1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Turned around and go, wow, I really
don't know what I'm talking about.

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,950
A lot of times I really better
think about what I say more.

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:08,430
And even now I'm just a lot more careful
about making absolute statements.

4
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,730
I don't make any more absolute statements
or things like that because you want

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,620
to be sure that you're conveying
the right information to people.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,170
What were you saying before
the podcast started? You were,

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,350
we're going to bring it up again about
veganism coming from a religion. Yeah.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,440
Yeah. Veganism started, um,

9
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:26,180
with the seventh Adventist church
I believe. So there was, um, uh,

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:26,601
you know,

11
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:31,601
a group of people that had a church and
the guy that led the church as part of

12
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,550
the church was like,
you know,

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,030
they were following the Jewish kosher
laws or whatever at first and it was like

14
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:42,230
no pigs or whatever else, a shellfish
I think. Yeah, no pigs or shellfish.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,030
And then the guy just said like,

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,150
it just sort of took it to the next
level and said, and like, no, no meat,

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,440
no animal products at all.

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,460
And so these people that were in this
church were like the first real group of

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,503
vegans.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,170
The Church of seventh Adventist I think
is what it was called is where it came

21
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:00,870
from. Like 1863 is when that
movement I guess started it.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,420
I'm like sure I'd started early.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,730
I'm sure people were doing it
earlier than not obviously,

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,950
but I think that that's where the,
the roots came in.

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,310
I just find that really interesting
because it does, you know,

26
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:12,390
it does seem like a
religion. It seems like. Um,

27
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,800
today it seems like a lot of times you
get, um, I get called out a lot on,

28
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,870
on Instagram and stuff like that from
people that are Vegan saying like,

29
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,370
I can't believe you'd
do this and blah blah,

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,180
but I would never go on their page and say
anything to them at all. Well, so there

31
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,080
proselytizing, I mean that's, that's a
big part of this whole community is it's,

32
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,680
there's a moral high ground. They stand
on it. And then a lot of these people,

33
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:36,650
especially people with Vegan in
their name and their screen name,

34
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:41,651
they always go after people and they try
to shame people and what they're doing

35
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,770
is in oh in many ways
is a very good thing.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,020
They're not participating
in factory farming, right.

37
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:50,920
They're not participating in the horrors
that we see in these fucking peta

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,910
videos where you see cows and pigs
and chickens are just being tortured,

39
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:56,510
all that fuck,

40
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,780
that is disgusting and that should be
eliminated and it shouldn't be a part of

41
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:00,620
modern culture.

42
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,480
But in terms of like the humane
raising and killing of animals,

43
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,050
look, they're not going to live
forever and I don't care what you say.

44
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,870
I'm not into animal suffering.
I don't think they should suffer.

45
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:15,110
But if you try to say the people are
not herbivores or that people are

46
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:18,620
herbivores rather, and then
we're not omnivores, you're
crazy. It's just not true.

47
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:22,760
It's not fact. And they show picture.
These are not the teeth of a carnivore.

48
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:25,850
These are the teeth that were were not
carnivores. Stupid. We're omnivores.

49
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,070
Check stands and everything. Yeah, we,

50
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,460
we look real similar and
our teeth to fucking chimps.

51
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:36,470
Chimps are omnivores and the human
diet is a very complex thing.

52
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,110
When you attach that
human diet to ideology,

53
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,660
then it gets really screwy
because you're not dealing,

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,190
you're not dealing with people that
are being honest about dietary,

55
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,120
like what is really important and
as far a dietary requirements,

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,500
how your body functions, what the studies
show. If you look at it objectively,

57
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,940
the objective, the first thing anybody
should say first thing of cross the board,

58
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,200
Garrett, all the fucking
sugar. That's number one. Yeah.

59
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,840
Get rid of all the refined carbohydrates.
Eat more vegetables.

60
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,710
I think you guys don't eat more
vegetables. Eat healthy fats.

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,380
Get some formal omega fatty acids.

62
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,390
Recognize that the omega fatty fatty
acids you get from flax seed oil or not as

63
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:21,190
bioavailable is fact from studies
not as bioavailable. Is it?

64
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,790
Mega fatty acids you get from fish
and meat, you're just not the meat.

65
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:29,500
The protein you see well broadly has
15 groups. It's not as bioavailable.

66
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,580
You fucks and you know it's not,
it's just not.

67
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,310
So you can get bioavailable
protein from plants.

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,730
You get it from him, you get it
from keenwah. You get it from peas,

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,500
pea proteins where it good,
but it's not as good as the,

70
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,710
the protein that you get from meat. It's
just not, can it sustain you? Yes it can.

71
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,790
Can you be a healthy person and live
a fucking bounced life on a completely

72
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,600
vegetarian diet?

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,040
100% but I would always
recommend eat free range eggs.

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,910
You're not hurting a chicken. Nothing
gets hurt. It is free food. We have,

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,240
I have chickens. They roam around,
they eat vegetables. Nobody eats them.

76
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,450
The chickens live a fucking healthy
life. They lay eggs, we eat the eggs.

77
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,940
The eggs are healthiest.
Fuck ethos.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,350
Find a place that has free range
chickens. Eat the eggs. It's,

79
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,270
I mean it's not Vegan,
but it is vegetarian.

80
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,270
If you want to get rid of dairy
and you don't want, I get it, man.

81
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,670
I've seen Gary dairy farms.
It's fucked up.

82
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,100
You see what they're doing at cows
and they, you know, the way they,

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,780
they treat them and the way they're
raised them and just the whole idea behind

84
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:32,470
it, like making them lactate.
The only time cows lactate
is when they have a baby,

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,890
right? So they keep them in this
state and it's just, it's unnatural.

86
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,090
And that is a reality of dairy production.

87
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,390
And if you don't want to be a part
of that, that's 100% knowable.

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,810
But we have to be honest
about nutrition requirements,

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,980
not about the ideology of veganism.
And this is the problem with these people.

90
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,090
And so many of them, especially the ones
with Vegan attached to their identity,

91
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,390
because they use the name
like I'm Vegan Warrior,

92
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,580
this is Vegan prints
and the Vegan defender,

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,160
they're fucking morons who joined a gang.

94
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,160
And what they do is they
start eating plants,

95
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,370
they start talking shit and they go
looking to just go after anybody who's not

96
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:13,180
on the same page as them. And the real
problem is people that watch a movie,

97
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:17,590
like what? The health or something and
then think, well that this is, oh my God,

98
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,110
I'm killing myself by not being a Vegan.
Nope,

99
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,000
you need to Google what the health
debunked and find out the actual science.

100
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,090
Cause what they're talking about is
bullshit. They're not being honest.

101
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,690
What they've done is make a
Vegan proselytizing movie.

102
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,800
They're trying to get people to join in
because that's what they do and a lot of

103
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,634
these people,

104
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,700
they give up a lot of these people that
get to a point where the health can't

105
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:43,270
take it anymore and they fucking give up.
Chris Kresser is a perfect example.

106
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,550
I don't know if you've, have you
interviewed him for the film? Not yet,

107
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:48,100
but we will. He's fucking
brilliant. And he was a macro,

108
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:49,750
but he was a macrobiotic Vegan.

109
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:53,560
I mean this guy was all off the charts
with veganism and eventually realize his

110
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,180
body was falling apart and gave up on it.

111
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,690
There's some people that own that
restaurant in California and Hollywood.

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,730
What is it called? The something cafe.
Thank you. Can I think gratitude?

113
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,510
Yeah. These people were, they mean
they're fucking health was falling apart,

114
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:10,850
so they decided to raise their
own cattle and eat throwing.

115
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,490
Me and vegans found out they got death
threats and people were fucking going

116
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
after them. Yes ma'am. It was a
terrifying thing for these people.

117
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,300
They're all our folks. And they, they,

118
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,750
they have their own farm and they were
raising their own farm animals and they

119
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,680
decided to start eating them. And when
they made these posts about starting in,

120
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,070
these people went after them. And you
know, it's not, this is not kindness.

121
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,160
And you know,
this is not someone who is compassionate.

122
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,690
He's a fucking cunts that are in a gang
and that they're in the plant gang.

123
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,980
You know,
and if you talk,

124
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,040
and I'm sure you've seen it by
doing this carnivore diet thing,

125
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,000
if you do anything that's outside of that,
they go after you.
