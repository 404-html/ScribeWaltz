1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,380
Religion in many ways gives you
answers right now. Yeah. Without the,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,320
to sort of to the research
it or to go on the frontier.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,170
The lack of education and the lack
of a lack of curiosity about it.

4
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:15,990
It's one of the scariest things
about new generations of kids, right?

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,030
Like when the new
generations are coming up,

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,010
if they know less than
the generation before,

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,350
that's when we really start to freak out.
That would be a problem.

8
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:27,351
Although I have good confidence
in the 30 and under gender.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,520
Does that millennial,
I will be have to be,

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,270
I think millennials have only ever
known the Internet and devices.

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,130
So what would you say recent,
but my son is a millennial and he's like,

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,480
my kids are millennials so they're
twentyish so 30 is a little old.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,570
So 25 and under I think
are the millennials. Yeah.

14
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,470
But 30 when they were 10 the
Internet was around. I know,

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,540
but they need a different marketing terms
so you can market to them differently.

16
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:55,800
Yeah. So to me, I would put them in the
same bin just as you were thinking there.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,270
But,
but they,

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,380
they have a different relationship
to science and technology.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,680
Of course they're not, they don't
fear the science or the technology.

20
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,740
They embrace it because it has shaped
the civilization that is enabled their

21
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:11,010
social life. It has. But through this,

22
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,840
like one of the things that I tweeted,

23
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,340
I think it was from scientific American
yesterday, maybe it was yesterday, that,

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,140
uh,
it's a little bit misleading,

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,470
but one of the things they said is only
64% of millennials have a strong belief.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,290
These things, these coasters
are terrible. They look great.

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,710
But then things stick to the
bottles are made of a metal,

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,090
a metal coaster. Yeah. See what
the hell is that sticks? Yeah.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,390
That's the issue sticks
when it gets moisture,

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,880
you know about this. We flip this
over and he tip it over and then it,

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,780
what happens on that? They never
did that. What? Datastay yeah. Oh,

32
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:52,130
because of the pressure. The
air pressure on it. Okay.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,790
But don't do it.
I don't trust your science.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,560
Your objective truth.
64% of what of millennials are not,

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,240
uh, are only 64% are convinced
that the world is a ball.

36
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,860
The world is a circle that [inaudible] us.
What is it a spheroid?

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,900
Is that what it's called? Oblique. I'd
like to see how that question exactly.

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,290
Because if they know that we are ablate
and the thing is asking, is Earth a ball?

39
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:23,250
They'll say, no, we're an ablate ball or
a slightly wider below the equator than,

40
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,300
uh,
than at the equator.

41
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:28,530
So we're a pear shaped oblate spheroid
but it's not a pair that you would find

42
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,310
normally if you found that period.

43
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,550
But like this is fucking pair
that's shaped like a ball. So the,

44
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,160
these distinctions,

45
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,940
these differences in measurements are
so small that if you found it on the

46
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,460
ground, you would say, this is a perfect
sphere. Right? Let me tell you how,

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,580
how good a sphere it is. Right.
All right. Do you ever see the,

48
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,000
the school room Globes,
the Geographic Globes,

49
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,740
and you rub your finger over in Nepal and
you get the th the Himalaya? Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:54,570
And you get the Rockies. He said, Ooh,

51
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,950
that is a gross exaggeration of reality.
Yes.

52
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,890
Do you realize if you took earth
with all of its mountains, valleys,

53
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,650
and hills and rep and shrunk it
down to the size of a cue ball,

54
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,110
he'll be smoother than any cue ball.
Every machine?

55
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,560
Yes.
Yes.

56
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,050
Think about it. Why? I think, think about
this Joe. Really. Joe Rys, go chill.

57
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,210
Listen to me. You Ready? Okay. Uh, do you
know the deepest part of Earth's crust?

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,790
No. The Marianas trench off the coast
of the Philippines in the Pacific Ocean.

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,630
That's the deepest, deepest white it
six miles down. Okay. Oh, okay. So,

60
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,300
okay. Sorry. No, no.

61
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,430
Just access to the deepest
part of Earth's crust.

62
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,980
The lowest point on her surface.

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,010
The Marianas trench right off
the coast of the Philippines.

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,930
The highest point on earth surface.

65
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,130
The tip of a k one k two k one
or k two which one is Japan?

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,110
I think it's k one.
Why would you name the tallest peak?

67
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,150
K Two it's good to point. I'm just right.
I'm not a mountain climber, but I'm,

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm just thinking k one k with the,
it's the Himalayan mountains in Nepal.

69
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,190
Okay. Isn't it in Nepal? I'm
thinking it is. Yeah. Yeah. Okay,

70
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,670
so now let's say how high up is that?
It was 28,000 feet,

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,650
so it's like five miles up.

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,480
Okay. Right. The distance

73
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,560
between the lowest point on earth surface
and the highest point on earth surface

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,340
is 11 miles.
That's here to the comedy store.

75
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,450
That is less than the length of Manhattan.
Whoa.

76
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,540
Yet we are 8,000 miles in diameter

77
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,460
and those two points are very
far separated from one another.

78
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,990
If you are cosmetic giant and you came
up to earth and you rubbed your finger

79
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,190
over earth's surface,

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,710
it would feel as smooth
as a cue ball to you. Wow.

81
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,880
In fact, in this, in this book, I have
a whole chapter called on being round,

82
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,740
which is all about,

83
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:05,820
this is all about our perception
of what is round and what is not.

84
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,730
I had asked you to debate one of them flat
earth guys. No, I don't. I can't. I know,

85
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,160
I know. We talked about it and
we're going to have him on Skype,

86
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,420
not what we do is,

87
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:19,740
and I think this is a diabolical plot
so that the next time we can ship people

88
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:20,820
on mass into orbit,

89
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,310
they all want to be the first
in line because they know
we're going to send them.

90
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,170
So if they can see the round earth,

91
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:28,710
they're going to be the first ones in
space just so they can stop annoying the

92
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:33,060
rest of them. I don't think you're
correct. I don't think you're correct,

93
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,560
but everything is a diabolical plot.

94
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,830
I do have people that have met
that don't believe because they,

95
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,080
the problem with youtube videos is that
it's a problem with a lot of things,

96
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,210
but one of the things
about being unchecked,

97
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,830
why you are discussing things is you
can say things, you can use big words,

98
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,720
you can sound articulate and smooth and
you can do it in a very professional

99
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,920
looking manner or do it
passionately. Yes, passionately,

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,930
convincingly charismatically and you,
you're unchecked.

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,120
But if you did that in front of an expert
and you showed them that along the way,

102
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,360
they go stop. That's not true.
Stop this. Not what works. Right?

103
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,040
Let me show you why this is incorrect.

104
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,700
Let me show you how you could prove that
this is incorrect. Objective truths,

105
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,910
but this is not happening.

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,860
Render your argument invalid so people
don't have any education and then they

107
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:23,270
watch one of these youtube clips.

108
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,290
They start actually believing that this
stuff makes sense because it's unchecked.

109
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,600
And I would say it's not about
whether they've had education,

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,550
it's about whether the education they had
teaches them skepticism of information

111
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,680
and teaching them how to inquire.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You realize it's just as intellectually
lazy to believe everything you see as it

113
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,120
is to deny everything you see.
Yes.

114
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,150
Why should someone know automatically
that earth isn't flat yet?

115
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:56,810
I tell them in the next breath that the
entire universe was once a small as a

116
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,450
marble,
right?

117
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,570
Both of those sound equally preposterous
except one has evidence to back it and

118
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,780
the other does not.

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,970
And very strong scientific theoretical
and experimental underpinnings.

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,570
So when you are trained to inquire,

121
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,260
you don't either believe everything
outright or reject everything out, right?

122
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,240
You're trained to ask questions.

123
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,430
You trained to probe deeper than the
layer of information that comes to you.

124
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,400
That's what should be taught in school.
And it's not,

125
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,950
they give you a book and say,
learn this and you'll get tested on it.

126
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,271
And then when you're done,

127
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:40,271
learn this well is it also there's a
problem with being inexorably connected to

128
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:44,960
your first belief to when you have
an idea and it's in your head,

129
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,050
it's very difficult for people to shake
that idea and they start arguing that

130
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:48,351
idea,

131
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:51,740
that idea becomes a part of their identity
and they dig their heels in deeper

132
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,640
when an opposing view is presented to
connect themselves to these ideas, right?

133
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,120
It's, it is who they are.
Right? Right. And so I,

134
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,710
I try not to base my character profile
on something that is not yet verified as

135
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,770
objective truth.
And this is a very good thing to do.

136
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:14,270
It's one of the reasons why I
don't have tattoos on my body. Oh,

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,540
holdings go. It's stretching my face.

138
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,750
Go on.
Uh,

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
one of the reasons is there's
nothing I am so sure about that.

140
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,270
I want to put it in Delhi on my
skin with, no, no, that's not,

141
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,260
let me say it differently.
There's nothing I value in my mind,

142
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:36,561
body,

143
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:41,561
and soul so much in this moment that I
want to indelibly etched it on my skin

144
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,680
cause I want to leave room for me to
