1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,380
The joe rogan experience. That's
what they're going to do. Yup.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,720
Maybe they'll do that
international fight week to don.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,790
Don Sizzler,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,810
trying to get these ratings
up for Fox buys. Ww.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,850
Imagine if Brock's first fight back
as John Jones. Yeah, I can. Yeah,

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:22,020
I can just the car. Don't look in that
mother fucker. It's not July. Yes.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,300
Yes. Steep a DC Granshawn Jones. Brock.

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:31,740
Preach. Tyron Woodley.
Dosign Joe's or Tayga?

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,020
Max Holloway. Amanda Nunez. Cyborg.
We busted this load on this one card.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,660
Whew. Whew. Whew, whew. We can
still do the ratings did that,

11
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:45,600
that place would be the
same. It'd be insane.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,700
That'd be one of the greatest
cards of all talkers.

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,420
And then I taught you sprinkle
in this swink a little cm punk.

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,380
Mm. You wouldn't be able
to do that one. Why?

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,180
Because that one needs so much money.
The one that I'm thinking about,

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,110
which one? You know the
one, which one? Joe?

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,420
The one that was a lot of sprinkles on
top. Which will you know that boxer guy?

18
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,330
What's his name? Oh, you
talking about employee Tim?

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,910
Something money that we keep
talking about. If that happened,

20
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,580
and this is by the way, I believe
you and I were the first speculate.

21
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,070
That's publicly correct.
I think that's the fight.

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,830
I think that's the fight to make. I
agree. I don't know if it'll ever happen,

23
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:22,530
but I think it does. It does happen.
It happens on its own individual card.

24
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,000
You put a kick ass card underneath it,

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,200
but I don't know if you put like a UFC
200 size kick ass card or anything. No.

26
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:32,670
Cause Floyd and cm punk skin cell
is a cell. And also if you're Floyd,

27
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:36,060
just leave it from Floyd's perspective.
All right, pay me this much money,

28
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:40,740
which I boatload of cash and also give
me the guy who has zero experience like

29
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:44,490
me and cm punk comes a huge
name so it makes sense.

30
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,600
It's the only fight to make for Floyd
cause condo literally kill them. Yeah,

31
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,240
you can't do that because it
wouldn't be fair. It's not fair.

32
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,820
It's not beat up Floyd and
cm punk in the same night.

33
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,720
People would understand the difference
between Connor Boxing Floyd,

34
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:01,540
which you've got clearly outclassed,
but he hit him like Floyd is.

35
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,740
I can do anything. No, it's
no competition. It doesn't.
It's going to be awful.

36
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,880
It doesn't make sense. Make sense? He'll
get kicked once in the legs and be like,

37
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,780
oh my God, now I can't walk and then he
gets kicked in the same spot. I'm like,

38
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:16,380
oh Jesus Christ and his folding over and
he's getting front kicked in the gut.

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,830
Connor's talking shit to him.

40
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:21,150
That head kick the viciously and then
you're on that highlight reel and the UFC

41
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,810
is using that over loop over and
over and it takes one clinch.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,180
Just one clinch and
you're on on your back.

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,670
If you're seeing punk than her fighting
Floyd, I'm army crawling over Floyd.

44
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,510
You're not even, I go ahead and
punch me. But Dan Karate style,

45
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,260
you stand karate style and you throw
sidekicks and you just walk towards him

46
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:40,280
throwing sidekicks. There's so
many gifts to the cage. Yes.

47
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,670
Why would you even want to box them?
You stand total Wonderboy side stance.

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,660
Just stand like this way back. Liotta
Machida style and just throw sidekicks,

49
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,690
keep them off you. And then when
the move is, whenever it happens,

50
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,510
get that client shotty,
la, fucking everything.

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,630
The guy weighs a 145 legitimate pounds.

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,660
That's what Floyd was even just bear
hug them and just pull them on top of me

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,290
and sweep and we get full amount. I would
literally just come at Floyd like this.

54
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,430
Just walked straight forward like
the terminator two. Wait. Yeah.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,530
He could make welterweight unboxing.
He could.

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,770
That's the only problem with this fight
that were spiked lane is 20 pounds.

57
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:18,270
What weight are they going to fight that
because see a punks nuts. Small. No, he,

58
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:21,100
he was uh,
a legit sized one 70.

59
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,150
So he would go and catch weight here.
You don't have to be catch weight 60.

60
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,110
See that's the other thing. You Drain cm
punk down to one 60 and he's Foxville.

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,710
Yeah, let's do that. Yeah.
Well, well, here's the thing.

62
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,060
At one 70 he doesn't have a lot of muscle,

63
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:41,650
but he's got a little bit of fat so maybe
he might be able to do 65 he does it

64
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,670
smart and long, you know, he takes a
long time to do it. Adjust as calories,

65
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,380
really ramps up as cardio.

66
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:50,740
Just forces himself to do an hour of
cardio after every training session.

67
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,200
Has anyone seen him lately?
A man looking thinner? No.

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,890
Just Kinda have to look a lot funner
to get that fight. Or Floyd just says,

69
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:00,130
I don't give a fuck. I'm going to like
this dude up. Cause when they're standing,

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,910
when?
When he's got to close the distance on cm,

71
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,430
Floyd has four ounce gloves on.
Are you fucking kidding me?

72
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,010
And he's impossible to hit. He's
in Pi. You're not going to hit him.

73
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,210
That's not happened to catch coming in
and it's gonna beat fucking at night

74
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,350
night. Even the leg kicks like,
boy, can you even kick his legs?

75
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,110
How fast the CM punk kick.
You know what I mean?

76
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,280
We're not talking about like yachts and
Clyde. That's not the move for cm punk,

77
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,160
sir. Just do what you gotta do to get to
the ground. We have a karate background.

78
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,760
Cm punk. Yes. Much as
a, I have a crowded bar

79
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,480
and I'm not making fun of him.
When he was like 13 or some shit,

80
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,980
I guess doesn't count.

81
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,810
I play dodge ball to when the [inaudible]
not on my resume, doesn't count.

82
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,100
Soccer player. I'm going to put
that on my fucking soccer player.

83
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,040
My Twitter handle now. I played soccer.
Yeah. That doesn't count, man. Play it.

84
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,290
Yeah. We were so heartbroken.
You're right. Yeah. Jesus.

85
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,810
I don't want to throw it. It's that cold
brew. This new Cobra was snacking on.

86
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:07,870
Yeah.
