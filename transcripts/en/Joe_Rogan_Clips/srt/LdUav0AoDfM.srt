1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,230
What are my limits,

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:05,490
what are our limits collectively and can
my physical expression of this inspire

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:06,570
other people to innovate,

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,690
create and do amazing things in the
world and in and other modalities and

5
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,524
canvases?

6
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:10,781
Well,

7
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:14,080
that's one of the weird
things about people doing
extraordinary things like what

8
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:18,310
you did is that you absolutely will give
other people fuel to accomplish things

9
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:22,450
in their life. Inspiration is so
critical for human beings. I mean,

10
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:27,451
I draw upon it from so many different
sources from David Goggins and a bunch of

11
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,160
my other friends,
my friend Cameron Hanes,

12
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:33,130
and a lot of other people
that are endurance athletes
and different people that

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,470
I've interviewed on this podcast.

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,790
But there's something that happens
when you realize that people can do

15
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:44,710
extraordinary things.
It makes you believe in the potential,

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,990
not just in that person,
but also in yourself.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,740
Absolutely. I mean, you know, God is a
great example of that. I've never met him,

18
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:53,350
but I know I've personally derived
inspiration from that guy. I mean,

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,510
he gets out there, you know,
you can't run a hundred miles.

20
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:57,520
Like I'll show you like I run
a hundred miles. You know,

21
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:59,560
and he's pushing his by two
extreme ways or you know,

22
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,420
I love what he says
about the 40% you know,

23
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,010
I think about it a little
bit different in my mind,

24
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:07,120
but like what are those limits? I don't
know if it's 40% or 80% people quit.

25
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:11,680
You know, people quit that I can't. Voice
comes up and you know, he's proven it.

26
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:15,310
So as many other people have actually,
when you say I can actually,

27
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:17,140
when you don't stop,
you get stronger.

28
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,540
And for me in my own
story and my own journey,

29
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:24,340
I think that final day that finally
final 32 hour push proves it three days

30
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,260
before that, you know, I'm
videotaping all of this.

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,870
I'm trying to capture as much content
to be able to share with people of this

32
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:31,630
crazy weird place that's
an article by yourself.

33
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:36,490
And like day 49 day 40 50 like I'm
literally crying into my goal Probean like

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,270
I'm running out of food, I'm exhausted.
I don't know if I can keep doing this.

35
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:45,220
I'm just like worked. Right? But sure
enough, I don't say I can't, you know,

36
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:48,520
it's that for it was that 40% was that
50% that's that moment when I wanted to

37
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:51,700
quit or I should have quit.
But then the strongest,

38
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:55,840
most amazing moment of my entire athletic
career that spans decades happens

39
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,610
three days later because I kept pushing.

40
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,610
It's not like I rested for
three days and pulled that off.

41
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,960
Like I never took a rest day in 54 days.

42
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:05,740
I pulled my sled 12 to 13 hours every
single day and on the last day it was the

43
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:09,190
strongest as possible. So I think it
proves if we can push through that,

44
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:12,700
I can't moment, no, it's not going
to work. That you can get there.

45
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,700
And unfortunately, you know,
we talk about 40% with Goggins.

46
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,910
I actually think a lot of people quit at
1% they're sitting behind their office,

47
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:22,330
they're like, you know, one day I
want to travel overseas, or you know,

48
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:25,690
I hate this job. You know, I've got
this great business idea. But I mean,

49
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,360
they're like, but I can't, like I've
got no money to start this business.

50
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:28,841
I've gotten no,

51
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:33,700
this like when I first set off my first
world record in 2016 2014 I sat with

52
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:36,910
Jenna in my house, one bedroom apartment
with a whiteboard and we're like,

53
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,850
I'm going to see if I can set the world
record for the explorer's Grand Slam.

54
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:42,250
Something fewer than 50 people in the
world have ever done and I'm going to be

55
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:44,720
the fastest climb Everest come to now
like climb Kilimanjaro, North Pole,

56
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:46,810
South Pole, back to back. I hadn't
climbed a bunch of mountains.

57
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,560
Be Pretty easy to say I can't. Oh and
by the way, we have no money to do this.

58
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,590
We have no platform. I have like
200 Instagram followers. Like,

59
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,170
I mean I have nothing but we
just sat there and like no.

60
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:59,890
Instead of saying I can't, let's say
I can't, what's the first to that?

61
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,350
We literally get out our laptops and
I'm like going to like, we're like,

62
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,710
we want to build this big media campaign
where lots of people follow and get

63
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,040
pressed. Like we know nothing about. We
have no background this week. Google.

64
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,640
What's the difference between marketing
and PR? I mean we are literally asking,

65
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,840
Google don't most basic
of all basic questions.

66
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,260
Oh, but you know, we,
we continue to say like,

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,710
let's get coffee with our one friend
who knows something about this.

68
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,190
We should probably get a website.
How does one build a website?

69
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,210
And it goes on and on like this. How long
ago did you start this journey? So that,

70
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,190
that was 24 when we, 2014 when
we dream that up. This will,

71
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,280
the world record was just the
fact that years ago. Yeah.

72
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,620
So to see if I could set the world record
for something called the explorer's

73
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:41,380
Grand Slam. So let's come and tallest
mountain on each of the seven continents,

74
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,270
seven summits.
And before that,

75
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,930
had you done anything like that
or did it just been athletics?

76
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,600
So I grew up in Portland,
so I grew up like in the outdoors,

77
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:52,310
but like I mean to go climb Everest
at Denali sort of thing. No,

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
the short answer is I'm going to
climb a few mountains. You know, I,

79
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:56,200
it's not like I'd never
been in the snow before.

80
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,570
I'd worn crampons ice that's like,
and I had zero experience,

81
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,780
but like not even close to the experience
that you would think one would need to

82
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,130
do that and to just break world records,
not just do it,

83
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,990
but like be the fastest person to ever
complete it. You know, like I said,

84
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,660
it ended up being a hunter in 39 days
straight through to climb all those

85
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:12,310
mountains.
Didn't know,

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,900
I think we had a clip up a second ago if
something on Everest, but uh, but yeah,

87
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:21,740
I mean to do, to do all of that, it
started from this place of not, of, of,

88
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,400
of uh, believing I can. And
then, you know, it's, again,

89
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,410
it's fun to talk about the epic adventure,
but be,

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,740
for me it's actually fun to talk about
what happened behind the scenes of that

91
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:33,970
because what actually
happened, like people applaud
our success. Now this is me.

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,410
This is you. Everest walking across
the ladder. That's, you know,

93
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,150
about 300 foot hole a crevasse,
uh,

94
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,580
on the other side of it that you have
to go through to on your way up the, uh,

95
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,890
the Mount Everest climbing route. And so
your crampons or clicking on the, on the,

96
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,670
you're hooking them on the ladder as
you walk across and if you fall you die.

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,410
Yes. Okay. So that man,

98
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,330
watch this again. This is so
awful. It's so awful. Look at,

99
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,280
cause you're, you're basically
just walking this tight
rope on. Let me hear it.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,070
Listen to that click folks,

101
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,860
I implore you to go to the Instagram
page so you get the full freak out cramp.

102
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:16,760
The consoles, they're tied
together to those ladders. Yeah.

103
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,970
Ty [inaudible] is compete the 300 foot
cavern over there. Oh fuck. All of this.

104
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,100
She's a us. Oh, and you're looking down,

105
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,460
cause you ever go on and we cut
the sound off at the Ed there,

106
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:33,880
but I go at the bear and I go because
like there's 50 of those letters,

107
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:37,690
but I was cheering every
fucking time I got cross. I
was like, yeah, one more down.

108
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,653
Woo.

109
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,490
50 Times in the Khumbu I slash should go
through that section a couple of times.

110
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,890
It's a very dangerous section
of the mountain. Um, but yeah,

111
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,010
I went about 50 of those ladders.
So when you went through Everest,

112
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,990
did you see the bodies?
Um, so I fortunately didn't
see any bodies up there.

113
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,090
Fortunately or unfortunately,
fortunately. I mean,

114
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:58,240
I mean I'm not like trying to see
that bias, you know, but they're,

115
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,410
they're more prevalent on the
climbing around on the north side.

116
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:04,670
The day that I did summit,
um, three people died, uh,
on the day that I summited.

117
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:09,170
So when I, yeah, when I, so the
set, the, I mean, talk about Evers,

118
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,850
I mean for me is a major setbacks.

119
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,220
It was the eighth of nine
expeditions in this sequence.

120
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:16,910
So I'd done a hundred days
of other expeditions leading
up to Everest to do this

121
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,880
explorer's grand slam world record.
I'm trying to climb Everest.

122
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,260
I'm exhausted from a hundred days.

123
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,840
I just come from the North Pole before
that Kilimanjaro. Before that, you know,

124
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:27,760
Albert's all these other mountains.
And then I make my summit push on Everest.

125
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm not climbing with a guide or anything,

126
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,630
it's just myself and one Sherpa who I
met climbing in Nepal the year previous

127
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,740
when I was training for this.

128
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,700
And so it's just the two of us and we
climb up into camp for so ever says,

129
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,520
you know for camps there's base camp and
then there's camps progressively higher

130
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:43,670
in the mountains so you can get your
body a climatize and we get up into camp

131
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,840
for, have you read the book into thin air
by Jon Krakauer? Anything about it? Say,

132
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,620
okay, there's a famous book
that's written about it.

133
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:51,560
We're 11 people die and right in this
moment it's called the death zone where

134
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:55,180
you enter above 26,000 feet. The human
body basically can't survive for long,

135
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,690
even with supplemental oxygen and this
massive snow storm and wind storm blows

136
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,210
in like kind of out of nowhere. And
we're just trying to push for the summit.

137
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,410
It takes us two and a half hours just
to set up our tent and get inside and we

138
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,090
know like it's over.
Like we're not,

139
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,850
we're not going to summit Everest
like in this storm. There's no way.

140
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,460
So we just survive the night,
wake up the next morning,

141
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,220
still getting pounded by this weather
and actually have to climb back down the

142
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,920
mountain. So climb back down the
mountain all the way to camp two.

143
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,570
And they're looking, they're
like, well that's probably it.

144
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:23,390
Like you don't usually like spend a night
out in the death zone and like make a

145
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,520
second attempt and you've already
tried all these other mountains.

146
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:28,190
You're a hundred plus days in
this journey. And I was like, man,

147
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,170
I want to see if I can get back up there.
Like,

148
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,100
and this other guy who I met on another
team had some supplemental oxygen.

149
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,670
So I had to use some of
my supplement auction.

150
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:40,370
So my supplies tours are limited
now as well. And so he, uh,

151
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,620
he says to me, Hey, I'm not
going to go up. I'm sick.

152
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,100
But if you get back up to
camp four, there's a couple
of bottles of oxygen that,

153
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,220
um, you could use of mine if you,
if you somehow get back up there.

154
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,830
So sure enough per sang [inaudible]
name of the shirt palace,

155
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,660
common with amazing climber himself.

156
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,320
We get back up to camp four
and the death zone. And uh,

157
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,050
we decided we're going to go for the
summit and we call back down to base camp.

158
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,880
What's the weather forecast?
And they're like, well,

159
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,090
it's the exact same forecast we
told you before. It might hold,

160
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:08,450
in which case there'll be fine or it might
turn into what you guys just survive.

161
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,600
And if you're not near your tent and
you're up on the summit ridge of Everest,

162
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:15,440
like it's going to get like pretty bad.
And so we kind of go back and forth.

163
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,170
Should we go for it? Shouldn't we go
for it? We just decided to go for it.

164
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,030
But this crazy thing happens,
which is,

165
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:22,490
you may have read about this or heard
of this if you know much about ever is,

166
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,450
but basically no one climbed
Everest in 2014 or 15 cars.

167
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,680
A huge avalanche killed 16 shorters in
2014 that the mountain was closed in 2015.

168
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,320
There was a huge earthquake in Nepal
that shut the climbing season down.

169
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,150
So no one's even climb
the mountain in two years,

170
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,160
but all of a sudden because
of these weather delays,

171
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,220
I ended up there and there's a hundred
people going for the summit on the exact

172
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,054
same day.

173
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,240
So basically traffic jam on the worst
fucking place to feed a traffic jam

174
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,310
possible. So Sang Bodie
and I would go, okay,

175
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:52,340
let's figure out how to climb this
thing. And we leave camp. I, you know,

176
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,900
there's a photo that I
took for leaving camp.

177
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,850
There's all these lights up the side of
the mountain and it's because there's

178
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:58,890
one rope that everyone works to put in.

179
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:02,550
So everyone's using the same rope and
all of a sudden we're behind a hundred

180
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:05,850
people. And if you stand there,
wind chill minus 40 degrees.

181
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,670
Like we're going to get frostbite, like
we're going to not be able to make it.

182
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,570
And so Passaic Bodie and I look at each
term ago, let's unclipped from the rope.

183
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,430
And so we actually decided to, we
actually decided to unclip from the rope,

184
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,760
climb up all the way to the
balcony from the, the south call.

185
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,370
The death zone area was mentioning before,
um,

186
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,840
up to about 28,000 feet on rope because
we actually think it's more dangerous to

187
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:32,650
climb roped next to all the behind all
the people than it is to risk of fall.

188
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,990
You don't know those people. They're
like, and people work. I mean,

189
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,850
you're on Everest at 28,000 feet
and people are walking, I mean,

190
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:43,170
one step per minute sometimes. I mean,
it's, it is brutal. And so, I mean,

191
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:46,050
I'm walking maybe two
steps every 30 seconds,

192
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:49,680
but I'm like you saying bolt like
pasties people. Yeah. This is,

193
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,380
this gives an example of like,
so you're in it like the world,

194
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,560
the worst place in the world to be.
You know, it, uh, in a traffic jam.

195
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,580
As you can see here for this
photo, I posted, uh, that day. Um,

196
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,570
but anyways, I get up to this edge
and it finally, it's too steep.

197
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,240
It's too dangerous for us to be
unclipped from the rope any longer.

198
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,430
And we're like, we're just going to
have to clip in and settle in behind.

199
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:11,400
You know, we'd pass like 50 or 60 people,
so we're in much better place than ever.

200
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,520
I still have this one big puffy coat
has actually the same puffy coat.

201
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:17,010
I used an Antarctica, the big like
Michelin man coat and I'm like,

202
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:19,350
we're going to slow down.
I better put this big jacket on.

203
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,420
And so I take my jacket off,

204
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,260
I undo my gloves real quick to put this
big jacket on over me to warm myself up.

205
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:28,260
And I looked down and
my right hand is black,

206
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,700
like just black is black, can
be. And I'm like Holy Shit.

207
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:36,630
Like telltale sign of frostbite,
like Oh my God. Like it's same thing.

208
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:40,080
We've got school kids bowling alone, got
family fun, the whole thing. And I'm like,

209
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,940
oh my God,
like I'm going to route lose.

210
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,090
My right hand is Jenice still
gonna love me. You know,

211
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:48,630
what's my family going to think? And then
I don't say anything to put Sang Bodie.

212
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:52,310
I jammed my hand back in this big
gloves and I go, okay, and I don't,

213
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:54,030
I don't recommend this thought process,
but I go,

214
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,700
well if I'm going to lose my hand anyways,

215
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,090
wouldn't it be cooler to lose my
hand but also have summited Everest.

216
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,720
So how black was it? I mean it
was black, like black, black.

217
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,450
So yes, it was black. Did
you take a picture of it? So,

218
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,520
so the sun had was just still,
the sun was just below the horizon.

219
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:17,190
So it's like dusk and I looked down at
this point and then the sun comes up.

220
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:20,050
So I jammed my hand back in this club
and I don't say anything to present bone

221
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:21,480
in,
like let's keep pushing for the summit.

222
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,360
So we go for the next three hours and the
whole time I'm on I'm like, Oh my God,

223
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:26,790
I'm such an idiot.
Like I'm going to lose my hand,

224
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,320
my hand's frostbit and this and that.

225
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,620
And so we get up and we're
about 30 minutes blow Mount
Everest summit and should

226
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:32,640
be a beautiful moment for me.

227
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,580
Like since a little kid I dream like
summiting efforts would be like the

228
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:37,470
greatest accomplishment of my life.
Oh my God.

229
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,300
And I'm thinking like
just in this dark place,

230
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,760
but also haven't taken a single
photo basically. And I'm like,

231
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:44,940
well I got to get like a
photo or a video of, you know,

232
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,140
the famous Mount Everest summit.
So I pull up my GoPro to shoot a video.

233
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,850
I shoot this short little video,

234
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:54,190
which kind of shows this crazy
exposure that I'm on one side,

235
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:56,230
5,000 feet down into China on one side,

236
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,750
5,000 feet in Nepal and this
tiny little knife edge ridge.

237
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,910
And of course I have to
adjust my gloves again,

238
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,160
this is from the summit and I pull my,
I pull my GoPro out,

239
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,540
I have to mess with my gloves,

240
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,100
put it back in and I look at my hand
and I started going away from my arms in

241
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,110
the air,
go per se,

242
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,230
Bodie,
my handbag

243
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,730
back. And he's like, what are you
doing? It just so happened that the,

244
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,560
the glove warmers in my of clubs,

245
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,610
the chemical hand warmers had
broken open and the charcoal.

246
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,650
And the copper filings of the chemical
hand warmers had tied my hand flack.

247
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,990
Oh Geez. I was completely fine. Oh God.

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,690
So yeah, this could peer if you play it
from the top is me reaching the summit.

249
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:42,100
That's the SAG Bodie right
there. But uh, so when

250
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm on the summit of Mount Everest,
top of the world,

251
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,490
no words can describe.
Wow.

252
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,500
So what did you experience any
discomfort in your hands forward?

253
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,940
So you're, again, we're talking
about a lot of this, this podcasts,

254
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:06,550
bit about mindset, which is
one of my favorite topics.
And like, just like we said,

255
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,640
you can convince yourself that
the salt man is fixing your foot.

256
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,150
Like I'm on Everest,
I'm at 28,000 feet.

257
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,650
My brain's not working very well.
I know that the weather's coming in bad,

258
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:20,440
that people are going to get maybe
frostbite based on the forecast.

259
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,620
And I looked down and I see my hands
black. Where does my mind go? It's like,

260
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,420
it's not like,
Oh let me think about this.

261
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:28,390
My hand warmer must've broken
open in this. I'm like my hand.

262
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,720
And it was weird cause I was like, I
didn't feel my hand getting cold. My hand,

263
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,370
like it was fine, but I'm on Everest,
my hands black. That means, you know,

264
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,560
in my brain I'm like, I have
frostbite. So it's just like,

265
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,320
it's a weird thing where you can
take your mind. Like a lot of this,

266
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,050
the positivity, this, my mom
went to the negative immediately.

267
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:47,940
Like your hands gone. It's
frozen off like the end. Um,

268
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,640
so what'll happen to the people that
died? Were they on the rope? Yeah,

269
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:55,180
so unfortunately that day the weather
actually did get pretty bad later in the

270
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:58,810
day. So fortunate I was able to get
down before the weather got too bad. Um,

271
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,240
but uh, the people that died that day, uh,

272
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,940
one slipped and fell down
these ropes over on Lhotse,

273
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:05,080
which is the adjacent mountain,

274
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,000
but similar sit sharing some of the
same ropes on the same route. Um,

275
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,120
and then two people died
from altitude sickness.

276
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,600
So basically either running out of
oxygen up there and not be on to get back

277
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,261
down to their tent.

278
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,840
I think those people actually did get
carried back down to their tents that

279
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:20,990
night and then died in the
tent that night. Some it's
called cerebral edema. Um,

280
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,130
which is basically your brain fills with
fluid from being at the high altitude

281
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,640
and not getting enough oxygen. And it's
a, it's a killer up there. And you know,

282
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,920
one of the crazy things about
being up there is, you know,

283
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,520
you read about it but you really can't
rescue somebody very easily up there.

284
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:37,250
I mean, tick to carry a human
body down into the rescue them is,

285
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,690
is nearly impossible. And I kind of
always thought in my mind, you know,

286
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,560
if I saw somebody lying on the
ground, like I would, you know,

287
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,460
summon the energy to pick them up.

288
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,030
And I was actually coming back from the
summit and I was on the South Summit.

289
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:53,030
So just below the effort, some inner at
28,000, 800 feet or something like that.

290
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,500
And this Brazilian woman who
I'd met in base camp, um,

291
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,900
named Tyce who I've become friends with
your in Nepal for a couple of months you

292
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,450
start talking to people, getting
friends with other climbers, whatever.

293
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,730
And I see her lying on
the ground with our head,

294
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:08,090
like leaned back in her oxygen mask off
to the side and I'm like, oh my God.

295
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,980
Like this is the moment
that I'm most feared.

296
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:13,340
Like somebody who I know is lying here
on the side of the mountain and I think

297
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,050
to myself,
I've got to pick her up,

298
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,040
I've got to pick her up and somehow like
carry her down this mountain and I lean

299
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:23,510
over to grab her and I try with all my
might to do anything and I realized I

300
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:28,100
can't move her six inches.
Like I'm completely exhausted.
Muscles aren't working.

301
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,780
Brain's not working.
So I do.

302
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,410
The only thing I can think to do is I
just wrapped her in my arms and I say Tice

303
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,440
like if you can hear me, it's
calling. You need to get up,

304
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:40,010
you need to get your oxygen mask on, you
need to start moving. Like please get up,

305
00:15:40,011 --> 00:15:43,040
please get up. No response.
She was climbing with a Sherpa,

306
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,230
another guide right next
to her and they were like,

307
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,090
look like we're having
trouble with her oxygen mask,

308
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:49,070
but we're going to fix it like it's
gonna be all right. And I was like,

309
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,520
just kind of going through
this intense moment, Mike,
what do I do? How can I help?

310
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:56,230
And it's this weird, as you know, I, I'm
not proud of it necessarily to say it,

311
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,280
but like there was
nothing I could do like a,

312
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,760
it's just the most helpless feeling in
the world where you want to help the

313
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,100
common person. You afraid, I mean,
this person, I'd be a friend,

314
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:07,070
but if any human being is lying on
the ground in the snow, you're like,

315
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,700
I want to help this person get down this
mountain. And I was just on so close to,

316
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:14,570
on my limit up there, the summit, there
was nothing I could do. Fortunately. Um,

317
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,800
she was not one of the people
that passed away that day. Her,

318
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:20,060
her team did get her oxygen mask on her
and she actually made it to the summit

319
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,840
and back down safely. She went up,
she ended up going up from there,

320
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:26,540
which to me is like another
whole crazy part of that story.

321
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:31,220
But it was an interesting lesson for me
in like, you know, you hear these stories,

322
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:33,590
you can't move bodies up there.
There's nothing you can do the rescue.

323
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,020
And people have been criticized for not,
you know,

324
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:38,750
doing these crazy rescues when
things have gone wrong up there.

325
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,610
But it really hit home for me,
like how,

326
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,540
how hard it would be to move somebody
down that mountain from that altitude.

327
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,300
And so when you're up there, you
know, unlike, you know, Antarctica,

328
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:50,390
I was actually alone in Everest. Like
I said, it was pretty crowded day.

329
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:52,130
Like you're essentially alone up there.

330
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
Like if you can't keep putting one foot
in front of the other up in the death

331
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:58,380
zone, there's not, not a
whole lot that you can do. Um,

332
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,060
so the three people that died up
there, did they leave them there? Um,

333
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,290
I'm not sure with those specific
people because sometimes they,

334
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,250
you can get like a large team of people
to slowly lower people down. You know,

335
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,860
in a weird way it's actually easier to
lower a dead body than it is to lower a

336
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:14,300
live person because it dead body,

337
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:17,540
you don't have to worry about breaking
bones and things like that if you're

338
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,400
lowing someone over rocks
and things like that.

339
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,520
So I actually believe those
bodies are no longer there.

340
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:23,960
But there are quite a few bodies,
you know,

341
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,450
still on the mountain in particularly
the north side, the Chinese,

342
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,520
so you can climb it from two sides.
The Nepal side,

343
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,130
which is more commonly climb
where I climbed the Tibet side,

344
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,380
the Tibet side is known
for having a lot more of,

345
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:37,340
the body's still actually on
the climbing route for sure. So,

346
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,050
but for me on that,

347
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,030
I mean that day in a crazy way continues
on because I got back down to camp four

348
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,910
and I'm thinking I'm going to sleep
for the night rest and come back down.

349
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:49,800
The mountain usually takes a few days
to get back down the, at this point,

350
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,460
you know,

351
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,340
I've only got one more mountain to
climb to come finish my world record the

352
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:56,970
explorer's Grand Slam and I was
about two months ahead of schedule.

353
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,920
So if I had climbed Denali
in the next two months,

354
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:02,130
North America's tallest mountain up in
Alaska, I was going to set this world,

355
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,580
this world record that I was. And so I
called back home to Jenna and I was like,

356
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,670
I made it like I made it.
And uh,

357
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,740
earlier in the day when my
hands had gotten frozen,

358
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:14,400
I had actually had a heated boot warmers.
And so I turned the heat in,

359
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,280
my boot warmers up as hot as possible.
So I'm like, if my hand is prospecting,

360
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,280
what got my feet look like?
So I crank those up as hot as possible.

361
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,520
And so Jen is like, hey, like how
are you doing? Like you all right.

362
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,730
We've heard some reports over social
media that has been a really hard day up

363
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,150
there. Like, I'm like, yeah, I'm a
right, like no frostbite, no injuries,

364
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,840
like I'm good. And I was like,
well actually, um, I, uh,

365
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,470
I burned my feet and she's
like, oh, frostbite. Like how
bad is it? And I was like,

366
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,560
no, not frostbite. I actually burned too,

367
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:44,790
like silver dollars circles in the
bottom to both of my feet from turning my

368
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,970
boot warmers up too much. And she's
like, wait, let me get this straight.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,390
Like you climb Everest, you don't
get frostbite, but you burn yourself.

370
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:55,770
She was like, you, your feet fire.
Like justice is a bad situation.

371
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,710
Um,
but then she goes on and she was like,

372
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,630
she literally said the
next thing you to me,

373
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:05,040
I will literally never forget in my life.
But she goes, so you're in your tent,

374
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,350
right? You took your boots
off and everything. You're
curled up in there. I'm like,

375
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:11,160
yeah. And she's like, well, uh, I actually
need you to put your boots back on.

376
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,680
And I'm like, excuse me? Like I
just what? Like she was like, yeah.

377
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:18,930
So we've been doing some calculating
back home and it just so happens that if

378
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:23,640
you can get to the summit of Denali in
the next, uh, week, you can set, not one,

379
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:27,390
but two world records. And I was
like, well, that sounds nice.

380
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:30,360
But like I'm on the summit of
below the summit of Everest.

381
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,750
How the hell is that going to work? She's
like, okay, put your boots back on down.

382
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:36,780
Now climb all the way back to base camp.
There's no time for you to sleep.

383
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:40,290
But then a helicopter is going to take
you to Katmandu. No time for a hotel,

384
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,690
no time for a shower. But an evening
flight is going to take you to Dubai,

385
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:45,720
to Seattle, to anchorage. And instead
of having three weeks to climb Denali,

386
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,820
you'll have three days.
But if you can do all of that,

387
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,470
you'll set another world
record like ready, go. Oh.

388
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,770
So I was in disbelief, but uh,
no one better than to disobey.

389
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,060
Not only my amazing wife,

390
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,570
but the planner and logistics expert
in running the backend. All of this,

391
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:07,860
I assure enough, put my
boots back on, wipe the slate
clean, and found myself, um,

392
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,230
you know, just a hundred hours after
standing on the summit of Everest,

393
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:13,740
I found myself over in Alaska trying
to push up to the summit to, uh,

394
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,870
to try to set the two world
records and not just the one.
