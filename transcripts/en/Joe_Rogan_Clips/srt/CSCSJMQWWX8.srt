1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,320
Her low freak bitches.
So at any rate,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,590
there's a story in there
where he talks about, uh,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,180
talking to this person who's like,
uh,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,250
he lived in an all white town except one
of the Klansmen that was d hooded talks

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:14,700
about,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,970
he lived in this all white town and he
was raised very racist and that black

7
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:20,550
people were the worst.
And there was one black family,

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,040
like the Johnson's or whatever.
And his father told him,

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,710
all black people are the worst.
They're monkeys.

10
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,680
They're the worst except the Johnsons.
The Johnson's are good,

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,573
they're good people.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,930
And he had this realization is like
tickle in his brain of like, wait,

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,040
my father hates all the black people
except the black family that he's met.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,630
Like all black people are bad except
the one group that he's actually met.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,100
And that is like the phenomenon
of othering, right? It's like, oh,

16
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:50,970
black people are bad, Muslims are bad.
But actually my friend Tom, the Muslim,

17
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,080
he's Nice but Muslims wanna kill me.
But the Tom over here,

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,990
he's a good dude.
Anyway,

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,260
I think other things like the big
one of the big problems that we have,

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,380
well it's also I think what's
going on with black lives matter.

21
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:07,380
One of the things that's going on is
that they're in the middle of the battle,

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,820
right?
So right in the middle of the battle,

23
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,140
every day you wake up prime for battle,
getting online, you're active, you're,

24
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,900
you're, you're, you're activating
your membership, your, you know,

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,080
organizing,
doing whatever.

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,020
And then this guy comes along and he's
doing something totally different.

27
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:26,910
He's out there talking to the clients
when you go fuck those people, man. Right?

28
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:30,700
Totally. Yeah. I was for my show that, uh,

29
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,090
that I'm doing my comedy
central show we're doing,

30
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:37,830
like we just did a cultural appropriation
episode and I was, uh, studying.

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,170
So I was studying, I was like deep
in the cultural appropriation.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,310
I was reading so much shit about it.

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,310
But one of the more interesting things
that said about black lives matter,

34
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,780
it's kind of connected to this,

35
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,980
is that one thing that happens
with cultural appropriation
and things in general

36
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,360
is that people seize on language. We're
in like a crazy language war right now,

37
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,410
right? Like so many of the
phrases that we use, uh,

38
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,360
are so charged with secondary and
tertiary, meaning that we can't,

39
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,800
they didn't even mean anything anymore.

40
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,670
Like white privilege is a concept
that the moment you bring it up,

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,610
there's so many levels of
eye roll that it's like,

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,220
I don't even think it's a useful phrase
anymore cause it's like the moment you

43
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,870
say white privilege than a person,

44
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,840
the white person who you're saying
it's privileged is going like fuck you.

45
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,540
And the minute someone saying fuck you,
you, the conversation has ended it. Yeah.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,400
So the thing they said about black lives
matter was also a lot of silly people

47
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,540
use that expression. No doubt.
That's the weird baggage that it has.

48
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,320
Like it's the thing that we learned
about that I learned about cultural

49
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:32,790
appropriation because for me,
I,

50
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,300
I roll my eyes so deeply at the concept
of cultural appropriation, right?

51
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:40,200
It's like, oh, so I shouldn't eat burritos
anymore. Is that what you're also,

52
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,710
I always think I'm always really tickled
with the idea of like the person saying,

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,900
oh,
you shouldn't wear that tribal gear.

54
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:48,990
And then it's like go to the third world
country where the market is and tell

55
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,620
the the like impoverished
Pa, uh, in merchant like, oh,

56
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:57,621
I'm sorry I can't buy this bit of silk
from you because it's racist for me to

57
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:00,640
wear it. That person. Like please,
please buy it and wear it. Like,

58
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,130
or you know what I'm saying? Or
like the family, it's like, oh,

59
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,980
it would be a great honor if you would
wear this, sorry, or whatever. Right.

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,810
So it's a big eye roll. Except then you
start to think like upon reading it,

61
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,530
it's like, oh, the thing is it's
not incidental, it's emotional.

62
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,180
It's like deeper than, than just like
trying to parse out the logic and go,

63
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,080
oh well I found an example
where your thing falls apart.

64
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,090
It's like it's emotional.
There's an emotional reaction.
Like when, when somebody,

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,410
you know, affects, you know, dreads up
their hair, even though you can say,

66
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,610
but people have been dreading their hair
in other cultures for a million years,

67
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,740
vikings had dreads and that is true.

68
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,490
It doesn't matter because the
person that's in front of you,

69
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,900
that's a black person that's going,
I have pain when I'm,

70
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,230
I have this pain that I'm looking at,
you know,

71
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,240
a person that's affecting my culture
without any of the negative parts. Right?

72
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,590
So you can, you can wear the hair and
you can have the dreads that, okay.

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,110
Just because of the word culture. Because
if that's the case with someone else,

74
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:01,640
some someone else wearing something
that you might find a fit.

75
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,460
Like what if you're a
person that's extremely, uh,

76
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,510
conservative when it comes to dress and
you see a woman in a short skirt and you

77
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:11,590
have pain, should that impose upon that
woman's ability to wear that skirt? No,

78
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,101
definitely.

79
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:16,900
And I'm not making a case that anybody's
pain ought to be automatically, uh,

80
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,260
adopted as like a behavioral standard.
Right? That's not really what I,

81
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,660
I learned that from this
whole discussion is it's like,

82
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,340
it's not really about going.

83
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,680
No one is really saying except
the most emotionally kind of, uh,

84
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,700
in fury.

85
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,880
Like the person that doesn't have the
language to express what they're really

86
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:37,540
saying.

87
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,380
Almost no one that I read when I was think
reading these real like intellectuals

88
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,520
and their concepts of cultural
appropriation is saying
white people should stop

89
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,950
doing this stuff altogether.
Almost no one,

90
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,840
I didn't find one left wing Wolke article
that said white people should stop

91
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,610
adopting the culture of other,
of people of color. Right.

92
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,470
Okay. I read a lot of right wing think
pieces that were saying this is absurd.

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,050
Why are you telling us to
stop adopting these cultures?

94
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,810
Isn't all cultural melting pot
and all cultural borrowing.

95
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,430
But not once did I read somebody saying
white people stop this altogether.

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,130
Well what did you read? So, so mostly,

97
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,540
and I hope I can articulate
this well cause I'm,

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm not the best advocate for this
position because like I said, it's, it's,

99
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,430
it's one that I struggle with that's
dubious. It's dubious and difficult.

100
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,230
And there are ridiculous parts of
the cultural appropriation argument,

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,500
but one thing that like it's all
connected to historical trauma.

102
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,510
It's all deeper.
Like basically,

103
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,520
let's see if I can articulate this well
what this one, um, this one person,

104
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,510
and I wish I could find his name actually,
but uh,

105
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,880
because he deserves it because he's
really deep thinker about this stuff was

106
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,640
talking about was that,
you know, we have racism.

107
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,890
Racism is a huge word that that describes
everything from a white person like

108
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,230
hugging their purse closer to their chest
when a black person walks by or even

109
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,670
like a weird, like, you know,

110
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,230
just the smallest little racial weirdness
all the way to lighting across on

111
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,500
somebody's,
on somebody's lawn to murdering someone.

112
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,120
Like that's all encompassed in racism.

113
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,910
So they started trying to like
parse it out. People are going,

114
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,210
when you call someone a racist,
right? They go, I'm not a racist.

115
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,370
You're calling me a monster. And
then somebody will go, oh no,

116
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,770
I meant like a systemically racist.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,950
It's like you need more specific examples.

118
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:32,050
So cultural appropriation is one, white
privilege is another. There's all these,

119
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,720
but still go back to cope. What,
what cultural appropriation,

120
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:40,070
like you said that no one was
saying don't do it. Right. So what,

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,100
so what are they doing when they're
trying to chop someone's dreads off? Okay.

122
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,130
I don't know about this.
I mean what,

123
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,800
what exactly you mean the San Francisco
state example where the girl attacked

124
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,240
the guy? I mean that girl was just
inarticulately expressing some insanity.

125
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,930
I don't,
I don't think that's defensible and I,

126
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:58,370
and I think most of the articles and the
stuff that I read about that specific

127
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:02,390
instance or just like basically saying
that woman's, uh, an uh, a lunatic. Well,

128
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,110
I've heard people though enforce it
and I know someone who was mad at their

129
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:10,430
friend is a black girls matter. Her friend
who was a white girl who had braids,

130
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,150
she had like corn rows and she was mad
because she was saying that it's cultural

131
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,780
appropriation, cultural appropriation. I
said, if you do, you know about Bo Derek,

132
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,230
right? Like she was one of the first
people to ever have core the Romans,

133
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,810
you know, there's corn rows on
Roman coins actually, right? I mean,

134
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,330
it's crazy thing to call
that cultural appropriation,

135
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:30,410
but also saying that a white
person shouldn't wear that.

136
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,780
That's fucking crazy because what do you,

137
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,810
what about a black guy wearing a
polo shirt? Well, okay, so, okay.

138
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,710
There's a good example, right?
Yeah. Is, uh, and again,

139
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,500
I'm not like I'm not the greatest
advocate for this position.

140
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,890
I just read so much that made
me empathize with the position.

141
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,710
Not necessarily agree with it,
but empathize with where it's coming from.

142
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,880
So the Polo for example, when you see you
as a white dude or me as a white dude,

143
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,460
when I see somebody wearing a polo,
it's just a polo.

144
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,560
It has no historical antecedent,

145
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,590
it has no historical baggage to it and
there's no connection to systemic racism

146
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:07,130
or, or Elvis Presley stealing the cream
of the intellectual musical crop and then

147
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,400
never giving back to that
community or Iggy Azalea coming in,

148
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,460
adopting a black accent and then just
like taking all the money and running,

149
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:17,420
you know, it has no connection to deeper
root systems like these trees have the

150
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:22,100
communicate with each other, like tastes
bitter. Right? So all it is is a polo.

151
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,350
It's just a guy wearing a polo.
It's,

152
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,800
and that's why the counterargument doesn't
make sense because it's like nobody's

153
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:30,290
upset when they see a black
dude and a polo shirt. Uh,

154
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,940
I mean maybe some weird racist guy is,
is, but mostly not. On the other hand,

155
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,310
when a person sees

156
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,170
a white person affecting a deep part of
black culture without any of the baggage

157
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,630
that is associated with it,
like for example, dreads, right?

158
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,680
One of the arguments I read a lot is
that like white people wearing braids and

159
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,680
dreads, you know, you get
rewarded for it. You look cool,

160
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:59,190
you look and meanwhile black women are
having a difficult time getting a job

161
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:03,060
because they have black hair or black
people getting fired from jobs because

162
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,140
they have dreads.
Right?

163
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:07,950
So there's these consequences that black
people experience because of black shit

164
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,150
that white people that are adopting
it don't necessarily experience.

165
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,871
That's true at all.

166
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:14,870
I think if you were working in an
office and some white dude at dreads,

167
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,380
he'd be highly suspicious of
his behavior. Well, for example,

168
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,170
this guy has kind of like get dork.
I hear what you're saying.

169
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm going to hire him.

170
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,800
There's a guy that had hair
like you and right next to him,

171
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:28,540
some stinky white dude with them.
Stinky dreads. Has dreads. Stink. Okay.

172
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,160
Dreads out. Let's say. Well, that's a good
example. Okay. There in the u s military,

173
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,620
there was just a, a new, um,

174
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,000
a new set of acceptable hairstyles and Mo,

175
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,570
almost every one of the unacceptable
hairstyles that they, that they,

176
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,280
that they put into place.
It was basically black hair.

177
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,440
Like what braids? Wearing your hair
natural? Um, I don't know the intro.

178
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:56,860
What do you mean? I mean, I would have
to, we'd have to be like an Afro. Yeah,

179
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,370
a short, short afro. Yeah. I mean,
you're not allowed to do that.

180
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,610
You'd have to pull up the article
to give the specific examples,

181
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:07,390
but basically there are a
million different examples
like that. And like I said,

182
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,110
I'm not, I'm not necessarily
an advocate for hed and,

183
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,340
and honor the call of the
appropriation accuser.

184
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,780
I'm more like now realizing that,
uh,

185
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,690
I'm more now realizing that there's
like just a lot of deep emotional,

186
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,130
weird trauma underneath every,
every accusation of appropriation.

187
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,970
It's not that I think therefore
white girls shouldn't wear braids.

188
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:35,971
It's that I think I understand more
where the person that is upset is coming

189
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:40,810
from it. Just from a compassionate
perspective. You didn't know. I get that.

190
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,160
I get that. It just logically it
doesn't, it's not about logic.

191
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,381
Yeah.

192
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:49,070
But it should be all human interaction
should have some base in logic if you're

193
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:50,180
going to communicate with things.

194
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:52,450
I don't agree because emotions
aren't about logic, right?

195
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,960
But should anybody be subject
to your own emotions? Like Shit.

196
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,700
Like you change your behavior,
your dress.

197
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,070
If you're a person who's
completely not racist,

198
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:03,500
but you enjoy the way your hair looks,
if it's in braids,

199
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,650
should you take into consideration all
the people that you're gonna run into and

200
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:08,810
they're going to be
upset at you over braids,

201
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,860
even though they're ignorant about
the history of braids and cornrows,

202
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,690
should you alter or change your behavior?

203
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,660
Should you accept the fact that you're
just going to have a certain amount of

204
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:18,680
cultural appropriation?

205
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,400
Well, let me ask you this, like if you,
I don't have an answer to that question.

206
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,234
I don't,

207
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,320
that is an important part of this.
I mean,

208
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:27,810
if you're going to accept the fact
that there's some sort of an emotional

209
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:30,120
attachment to these things,
and that's where the argument comes from,

210
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,960
shouldn't you decide or at least
contemplate whether or not that emotion is

211
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,780
valid?
It doesn't seem to be,

212
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,990
seems to be this real examples
of racism and horrible things.

213
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,740
Like if you want to,
you know,

214
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,230
make your eyes squinty and look like
a Japanese character from a bugs bunny

215
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:47,980
cartoon in,
you know,

216
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,200
1940 and then you want to go to a
party and people think you're a racist,

217
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,040
you should,
you should be

218
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,660
aware that you're presenting an image
that is inherently racist. Like that's,

219
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,640
that's something that's kind of fucked up.

220
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:05,110
And you should be considerate about the
way people's emotions are going to fire

221
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,930
up looking at your image.
That's what I'm saying. Yeah,

222
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:12,290
but that's a different thing than braids.
Oh, but oh, but that's what I'm, I,

223
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,040
I'm not advocating, first of
all, I'm not advocating anything.

224
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm just saying I've,

225
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,430
I've delved into this topic enough that
I've started to understand where people

226
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,500
are coming from when they,
when they get activated by send too.

227
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,700
But I think a big part of it is
reinforcement in the community that that's

228
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:30,760
acceptable to be upset at people for
corn rows or braids. And I don't,

229
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,010
I actually don't disagree with you.
I think you're right about that.

230
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,130
And yet I think it also is connected
to like a legitimate emotional reality

231
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:42,730
that's happening. Like for example, by
the way, logic is, is very important.

232
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,880
And I would say logic is more
important than emotion when it comes to

233
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:49,240
communication. But it doesn't
because something is more important,

234
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:53,050
doesn't negate the, the importance
of the other thing. Well,

235
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:56,020
it certainly doesn't solve the situation
just by clearly using the logic.

236
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,600
You might get a certain percentage of
the people that agree with you because of

237
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,050
logic, but that's more rare than it is
common, right? It's like, would you,

238
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,310
would you feel comfortable going
to a native American powwow?

239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
You know, with a headdress on, not even
a pilot, there's a powwow next door,

240
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:13,140
you can see it and you're at a music
festival. Would you wear an Indian head?

241
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,570
I wouldn't, but the reason why you
can't and the reason why you shouldn't,

242
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,450
or the reason why it's an issue is
because the people are marginalized.

243
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,690
Let me take my own people.
I'm Italian and my people,

244
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,560
for the longest time there was a lot of
anti Italian races and my grandfather,

245
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,080
he's talked to me about it,
what it was like coming off the boat,

246
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,320
but then somewhere along the line it
became acceptable for Italians in, in,

247
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:38,140
in American culture where it's not,
there's no real racism. It doesn't stick.

248
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,820
Like you call it Italian Guinea,
Guinea to our face and we will laugh.

249
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,230
No one cares. You can make meatballs
and Spaghetti all day long.

250
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,650
Nobody gives a shit. Nobody accuses you
of, uh, you know, you have a pizza party.

251
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,240
Nobody thinks it's cultural appropriation,

252
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:56,680
but try having a TACO party try haven't
Taco Tuesdays people get pissed you. Why?

253
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,890
Because Mexicans still experience
real racism in this country.

254
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:02,050
Whereas Italians largely just don't.
Right.

255
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,290
And like Taco Tuesdays and example of
something that's like, who fucking cares?

256
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,070
That's not important.
And so if I'm wearing a Sombrero,

257
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,880
exactly offensive to people, if that's as,
that's as deep as most people go. Right.

258
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,300
That's dumb. What are you
talking about at Kennedy to Taco?

259
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:20,200
I mean that's done and it is dumb,
but if you kind of like get under the Dme,

260
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,260
which is the name of my, my
third out, my third special.

261
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:26,790
So it's not yet live in Oakland now.

262
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,690
Fucking Hitler and then
get under the dumb.

263
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,020
But if you get under
the first like the most,

264
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,270
the epidermal layer of like
flashy and sanity and go like,

265
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,610
what's really happening here is like,
oh,

266
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,740
it's just what you're saying
actually you're more woke than you,

267
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,340
than you let on June interest. It's like,
it's really about like power dynamics.

268
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,410
It's not really about the
appropriation incident,

269
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,420
although on some level maybe it is.

270
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:48,850
It's really about the power
dynamic underneath it. Well,

271
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:51,920
I think one of the things that we're
seeing in universities in particular is

272
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:52,520
people

273
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,520
that are exercising the ability to affect
change even if it doesn't make sense

274
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,880
because they have the ability to uh,

275
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,020
point out something that they think is
incorrect or is unjust and then they

276
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,830
attack it and go after it and then they
see results. And by seeing those results,

277
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,670
it's almost in a lot of ways kind
of attached to the same idea.

278
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,910
Like if you're worth x amount of dollars,
why do you still chase money?

279
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,180
Because you're trying to get the
thrill of the accomplishment.

280
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,210
There's the game that's going on and
there's a certain amount of game going on

281
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,600
trying to get that white kid that you
don't even know to cut off his dreads.

282
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,880
Whether or not you know
that the Romans wore dreads,

283
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,740
whether or not you know
that the Greeks wore dreads,

284
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,100
the vikings and all these different
people had them. It doesn't matter.

285
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,430
It's like there's a little tiny white guy
and that girl could yell at that white

286
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:38,990
guy then chase him with
a pair of scissors.

287
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,570
Yeah, exactly. It's, it's the
incidents are the absurdity, but the,

288
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,180
but the current, the conceptual current
is somewhat valid. I mean, the knee over,

289
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,310
you know, I'm sorry, but to
some degree, like even you,

290
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,520
and I think that you're naturally
skeptical towards concepts like cultural

291
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,850
appropriation because, and I am too,
because as a, especially as Comedians,

292
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,230
it's very easy to see the absurdity. It's
so stupid and it's so, it's a pointless,

293
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,970
like, well, we can't not adopt each
other's cultures. That won't ever happen.

294
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,370
So, but even we'd go, okay,

295
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:13,540
but I wouldn't wear a
Sombrero to a Mexican club.

296
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,290
I wouldn't walk into a club like, oh, hey,
what's up? Right. So eat. So if you say,

297
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,350
okay, it's almost pornography,
right. I know it when I see it.

298
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,380
I know when I know it's offensive
when I feel it. Right. You know,

299
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,030
so if you kind of expand further and
go, okay, even the absurd examples,

300
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:30,940
I kind of understood.
I'm going to try to understand from me.

301
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,490
I'm going to try to understand where
people are coming from with that.

302
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:37,120
Then I can kind of contextualize it.
No, I don't have to agree with it,

303
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,790
but I can at least say, oh, I
get where this is coming from.

304
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,810
It's coming from historical antecedents
of racism and oppression that are

305
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,910
connected to hairstyle
and, and the, and, and uh,

306
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,770
all of these musicians that have taken
black culture and made money off of it.

307
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:55,240
There's all this like deeper
sedimentary layers of emotionality.

308
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,570
I don't have to heat it and
change accordingly, but I do,

309
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,630
I would be foolish to ignore it.
Right.

310
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,700
Yeah,
that completely makes sense.

311
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:07,590
And also I get it from a point of view
of a person comes from culture that used

312
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,340
to be maligned and he isn't anymore.

313
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,790
I wanted to make one final
point about that cause I,

314
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,340
I think I figured out how to make
my cultural appropriation point. Uh,

315
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:20,550
I don't want to take us back too far,
but I think what we're,

316
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:23,670
what we're doing is like, and we
came to a good place with a dislike.

317
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,060
What we're talking about, it's
all about language, right?

318
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:30,210
So cultural appropriation, your
immediate reaction is, that's absurd.

319
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,030
And some of the examples
people use is absurd. But the,

320
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,630
the underneath the racism is just,
we're talking about racial insensitivity,

321
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:39,750
we're talking about being insensitive.
And if you try to just focus on that,

322
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,870
then you can get to like the
reality of what's happening.

323
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:46,770
And the original point I wanted to make
was in this article I read about it,

324
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:51,370
it said that we often get
locked on linguistic the, the,

325
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,390
the boat that the concept
floats in on the absurd boat.

326
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,690
So like black lives matter is
the ultimate example you gave.

327
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,480
I just thought this was such a fascinating
point is like black lives matter,

328
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,470
it's the name of the organization
that is there to fight against police

329
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:07,320
brutality and killing of black kids.
Right?

330
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,880
And people react to the words, right? So
people go, what are you talking about?

331
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,340
Black lives matter. All lives
matter. Blue lives matter.

332
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,210
And basically if you,

333
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,570
you don't acknowledge that it's
black lives matter to that,

334
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,050
which is really obvious,
right?

335
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,070
You're fighting about the
words black lives matter
where we haven't been talking.

336
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,150
You've left the, the foundation
principle behind like a long time ago,

337
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,730
which is police brutality. No one's even
talking about police brutality anymore.

338
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,640
Now they're just talking
about the language that you
chose to call your group.

339
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,420
So at any rate, I think that was
the thing I was trying to say.

340
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,820
No, that makes sense. Look,
all of it makes sense.

341
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,780
If what is going on is people
are being racist, right?

342
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,410
If someone is doing something
for racial inappropriate or, um,

343
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,310
cultural appropriation at the heart
of it involves racial insensitivity or

344
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:56,680
racist in sensitivity,

345
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,140
but there's, there's difference,
right? Racist, theoretically,

346
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,870
racist is an,
again,

347
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,240
racism is a word that doesn't
have a lot of use anymore either.

348
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:10,350
Because you described the same phenomenon
of you saying to like your black

349
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:15,060
friend. Like, wow, I didn't expect it to
be so articulate. You mean well, right.

350
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,640
You mean you were trying to be polite,
right. Or I don't like black people there.

351
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,540
They're bad.
These are the same.

352
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,090
It's the same word to describe
both of those things. Right, right.

353
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,100
So in sensitivity is,

354
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,750
is not overt and aggressive
racism. Yeah. I think,

355
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,030
yeah, yeah, yeah. It's insensitive.
It's insensitive racism.

356
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,150
Like you're not being sensitive to the
possibility that you're saying something

357
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:39,550
offensive

358
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,100
or just doing something boarish Lee dump.
Now I agree with you.

359
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:46,280
The logic is more important than that
than that. But I think, you know,

360
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,380
the more aware we can all be
about how to not be a dick. Yeah.

361
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,080
It's like people want
to say, um, you know,

362
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,570
you could never have all
in the family on TV today.

363
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,060
Could you imagine people would go crazy?

364
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:02,230
Well then that's cause we moved past that.
I mean that's what's going on.

365
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:05,290
What's going on is there's a process
and one of the things is disturbing to

366
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:09,800
people about Trump and what's
disturbing to people about this new, um,

367
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,380
freedom to mock Jews or to pointed them
as the root of all evil and that it's

368
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,180
much more open than it's been before,
is it?

369
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,430
We thought we got through that and then
slowly but surely the demonization of

370
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,950
individual groups and in
terms of, you know, like who,

371
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:27,610
who are the bad guys and
who are the good guys?

372
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,850
And instead having it been boiled
down to activities and behaviors and

373
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:34,840
individual human beings
that are the problem,

374
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,390
not giant groups of people that
believe in one God versus another God,

375
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:41,800
which is what it's been historically.

376
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,940
The idea is that as time goes
on and as people like my people,

377
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:48,130
the Italians become so integrated

378
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,120
that you can't be racist about us anymore.
Right. It doesn't work. Right. Totally.

379
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,450
I mean it really doesn't work. Yeah.
It's one of the best examples of it.

380
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,391
And totally,
it's,

381
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:59,440
it's fascinating because there's so many
things that are there still and you're

382
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,460
like, they don't have any charge
or power any longer. Not only that,

383
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,180
there's so much gross behavior by
Italian, it just goes unchecked, you know?

384
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:09,720
And I think the soprano's is probably
responsible for a lot of that.

385
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,900
I was in Italy,
uh,

386
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,410
last year and I was walking home real
late at night and I saw this guy,

387
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,640
he's got his girlfriend up against the
car and he's fucking like going off on

388
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,790
her and I'm like this little
like liberal American boy, like,

389
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,740
is somebody going to call the police?

390
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:27,010
And then I kind of stood there for a while
longer and he's screaming in her face,

391
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:30,070
and then I just like look for about
like two or three minutes ago. Oh,

392
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:34,120
this is just some Italian shit.
I just walked home.

393
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:44,680
Okay.
