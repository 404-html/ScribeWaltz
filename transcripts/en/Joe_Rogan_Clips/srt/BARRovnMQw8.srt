1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,410
Somebody was telling me about this.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,530
I was at a little kid's party and I was
talking to one of the dads and he was

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:09,510
telling me, um, about this,
uh, thing that happened,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,900
this,
I think it was in northern California.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,070
It was a fire in fucking might not have
been northern California was a fire.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,810
And um, the, initially they
thought it was just a fire,

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,950
but then the CEO and his vice president,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,460
we're both of their houses caught fire.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,800
So then they thought it was like an attack
on bold people and then they realize

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,940
no,
it was a murder.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,090
And one of the guys killed the guy and
his family and then lit his house on fire

12
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,970
and then went back to his house and lit
his own house on fire to make it look

13
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,930
like they were going after both of them.
And he's the only one that survived.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,710
Yeah. Whoops. That just happened in
New Jersey. A Guy, he's in New Jersey.

15
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:56,640
Maybe that was it. A guy murdered his
whole family. His own family. Yeah.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,340
And then lit the house on fire.
So maybe that's it.

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,110
Maybe I'm getting a fucked
up version of the story.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,060
I get drunk a kid parties too.
Oh,

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,710
it's the only way to go by family
massacred disguised as a massive fire New

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,790
Jersey. Yeah, that's it. This
is the story. So, um, make
that a little larger please.

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,510
It says a, there was more than a brotherly
bond between Paul and Keith. Yeah,

22
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,980
that's right.
Part of New Jersey

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,190
vacation together and settled about 11
miles from each other in the suburbs in

24
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,080
New Jersey.
But two days before thanksgiving,

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,550
a horrific chain of events would forever
tear them apart. Oh, his brother. Yeah,

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,120
that's what it is. So I was getting a
really fucked up person. This story,

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,580
Paul, how do you say that name?
Kenario. Ken Arrow. Arrow.

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,890
Arrow Kenny. Oh, candy churros
brothers killing his youngest brother,

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,900
his sister in law and their children.
Oh, this is what's fucked up. Like what,

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,243
what,

31
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,310
how does a guy go from never killing
anybody to killing a wife and daughter?

32
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:59,100
So he killed his brother and
his brother's whole family.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,670
Oh my God. I thought he handled
his own. Danny said is home,

34
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,490
home on fire with his
wife and daughter inside.

35
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,860
Tried to make it look as if the
whole family had been targeted.

36
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,210
His family got out of the home
safely. Oh, can you imagine the panic?

37
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:17,010
Like what the fuck man murdered these
people don't scroll, go back, go back.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,260
You let your own house
on fire and you're like,

39
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,310
can you imagine like while your lighting
your house on fire thinking like the,

40
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:27,310
the intensity of this is going to work.
I'm going to get out of this, this, this,

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,440
this is where the plan goes and Poof,
it's really fun.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,550
How does a person kill?

43
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,150
I mean I understand you're mad at a
guy and you fucking hate each other.

44
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:37,230
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

45
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,690
And you start fighting and then
you wind up killing each other.

46
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,230
How do you kill his wife and
daughters? How do you do that? What,

47
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,150
like what switch goes on?
Like is he just trying to yeah,

48
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:51,300
cause he's just walking around and
go back up. It says it's killed.

49
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,760
His sister in law had
said he's [inaudible],

50
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,130
he's accused of killing
his younger brother.

51
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,120
His sister in law and their children.
Like how many, like who would, hey,

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,740
you killed kids.
Yeah.

53
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:04,630
So this is a guy who's never murdered
anybody just walking around cults.

54
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:07,540
Nick Township, New Jersey.
Yeah. He's a businessman.

55
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,340
Probably never done anything really
major in his life. Probably like,

56
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:16,450
was that a, uh, like a business meeting
like two days before with some guy?

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,260
What the fuck man? Just living his
life, talking about the giants.

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,130
Like what the fuck? What is that?
His wife and his two daughters.

59
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,670
Oh,
several twists in the case of Matt,

60
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,670
he then allegedly said his own home on
fire with his wife and his daughters

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,170
inside.
Did you not hear me say that?

62
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,800
I thought you were talking about
is his brother's family? No. No.

63
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,070
He killed his brother and his family.
Set the house on fam on fire.

64
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,890
Then led his own house on fire to make
it look like he was being targeted.

65
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,870
I knew that, but I didn't
know his, he had kids in, yes,

66
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,660
his wife and his daughters were inside.
Oh my God.

67
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:52,970
To try to make it look as if his
whole family's being targeted,

68
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:57,080
his brother and him. Oh my God, it's
family. Got Out of the home safely.

69
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,260
Wow. Fucking unbelievable. Think
about his kids right now. We're like,

70
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:07,500
what? To dead? What? Yeah,
what Jesus Christ. He,

71
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,150
oh my God.
Killed before sunrise.

72
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,590
Scroll up there. Somewhere
between midnight and 5:00 AM Paul.

73
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,590
Kenny Arrow was walking
around his brothers.

74
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:23,580
One point $5 million colts neck
home armed with a knife and a gun

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,580
husband in front of the white mansion
with a deadly confrontation unfolded.

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,860
Paul fired multiple shots.

77
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:36,110
Striking Keith fucking a when you got
mad at me for not following the story

78
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:38,620
clearly. Did you feel like you
could kill me? No, not yet.

79
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,870
I need more than need
more than Jesus Christ.

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,550
He walked inside, found his wife's,
uh, found Keith's wife, Jennifer.

81
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,490
He shot and stabbed her and
then stab their children.

82
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,770
Jesse 11 and Sophia Eight.
What the hell?

83
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,940
Then he took some documents
instead of firing them. You spent,

84
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,810
what were they doing like the week before
fucking stabbed an eight year old dude,

85
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,680
an eight year old girl in her sleep.
How do,

86
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,460
how to fuck to someone in
her sleep and her sleep?

87
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,080
Well, it was 5:00 AM it doesn't matter
man. He's, there's gunshots in the house.

88
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:20,880
The kids might have gotten
up. Oh my God, good Lord.

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,470
What a monster. A monster. What
was this guy like the month before?

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,120
Like what the hell could that normal
looking house shit that is the normalist

91
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,410
look normal house ever.

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Do you believe that there isn't always a
presence of good and evil in the world,

93
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,370
like like that it's not just evil deeds.
What this guy did was evil,

94
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,880
but do you believe that there
is a real presence of evil?

95
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,940
That it's like a thing that
takes over people or takes over,

96
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,180
you know what I mean?
Like,

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,440
like, like, like good and evil.

98
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:05,120
Is that more than just people's actions
or is it like a force of nature?

99
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,840
Is there a good force of nature and an
evil force of nature that is constantly

100
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,450
using people and using things as,

101
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,380
as a catalyst or as far as a instrument?

102
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,400
Well,
let's break this down.

103
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,890
I don't think nature's the right way
to approach it because I don't think

104
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,350
there's good or evil in nature.
I think nature,

105
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,930
nature is actually far more moral
than humans are because what?

106
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,890
With nature's just about survival,
right?

107
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,430
Predators and prey and they
kill things and eat things.

108
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,820
But when animals in nature kill,

109
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,480
like what they call surplus killings
were wolves will kill like 18 elk and not

110
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,470
not eat them. They're just, there's
this going on their instincts.

111
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,170
These things are there
to be killed and they,

112
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,010
they can get them because
they can't run away.

113
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,710
Maybe it's thick snow or something
like that. So they just can't help it.

114
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:53,600
They just tear them apart because their
instincts are the drive them to kill

115
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,270
because that's how they survive.
That's other family survives.

116
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,710
They're killing and they,
they,

117
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,200
they're eating these elk and
this is just what they do.

118
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,600
And even if they kill a bunch of
them where they can't eat them,

119
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,750
their instinct is to kill because
that's how they survive. It's natural.

120
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,584
It's normal.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,400
With humans it's very different because
with humans there's consequences,

122
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:16,580
right? And there's law and
there's other humans finding out.

123
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:21,530
So there's deception and then there's,
there's selfishness and there's the,

124
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:25,160
the fear of getting caught.
And then there's your own,

125
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,250
your own survival
instincts in terms of like,

126
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,930
you don't want to get locked up in jail.

127
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,520
You don't want to get
caught for something.

128
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,560
So I think if I had a guess that this
guy didn't think he was gonna kill this

129
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:39,290
guy's wife and family probably didn't
even think he was going to kill this guy.

130
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,820
They probably got into a heated argument
and they, they're stupid. And He,

131
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,260
you know, he's Guinea, he's, that's my
people. They do stupid. Your people too.

132
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,940
Canny air, they do stupid shit. You know,
they're, they're fiery people. And those,

133
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,200
those fiery people.

134
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,240
I swore off Italian girls and I was 21
I had an Italian girl take a swing at me

135
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,300
when I was 21 I was like, that's
it for me. I'm done. I'm like,

136
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:03,440
I'm not hitting one back.
