1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Hello Freak bitches. So
I think there's that. Uh,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,620
but then there's also look, you know,
like the Colin Kaepernick thing,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,400
I think that probably costs
a lot of ratings for the NFL.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,830
Did they do that? They're the, yeah. There
was that poll that came out that said,

5
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:19,180
I think of the 12% of people who said
that they were not watching NFL games last

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:19,181
year,

7
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:23,620
28% of that 12% said that the Kaepernick
national anthem thing was the reason.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,150
Yeah.
I mean it's some small percentage

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,330
probably embolden them. They probably
liked it and they wanted to watch it more.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,300
This is fascinating about the
cultural breakdown of the country.

11
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,340
Basically white people hate didn't black
people loved it. This is a visitor.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,360
This is how the polls where it's like
72% of black people thought it was great

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,210
and like an equal percentage of white
people thought that it was just terrible.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,341
And which is it?

15
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:43,920
Which is a fascinating look at that
sort of how race relations work in the

16
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:45,300
country at large.
Is it?

17
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,550
It's actually one of the reasons I think
that ESPN has been losing writings.

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,540
Like I used to watch ESPN
religiously and now I,

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,640
all I want is to just watch my sports
and not be bothered with the politics.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,080
Right.
Cause I say I do that during the day.

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
It's a pet peeve of mine that every time
I turn on ESPN I have to hear a lecture

22
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:02,060
about Caitlyn Jenner or about black
lives matter. It's like shot up.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,070
Caitlin Jenner hasn't even
been athletically relevant
for since before I was

24
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,390
born.
I was born in 1984.

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,560
Well the Caitlyn Jenner piece,
when they did it for ESPN,

26
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,780
and I don't know if this is true or not,

27
00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:16,781
but the word was that her getting athlete
of the year or whatever the award was

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,290
like the hero of the Year award euro,
uh,

29
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,810
was directly tied to the exclusive
interview with Diane Sawyer.

30
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,930
That makes sense. They sold the two
of them together as a package deal,

31
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:34,190
which I buy 100%. If you
don't, if you don't come on,

32
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,510
Liz works. If that's the case where she
came from, she's a fucking car dash in.

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,810
Okay. She's a giant
car dash. Yeah, that's,

34
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:44,180
and that's what she is now known
as I'm saying she, you know, yeah.

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,400
You're saying she, I would say very
politically correct. Yeah. I'm not, um,

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,280
but the video where they circled her
house and she was like moving in the

37
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:56,540
shadows behind the drapes. Did you
ever see that? No. It was wonderful.

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,270
It was wonderful.
She made,

39
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:01,670
it was like the first time she was
revealing herself as this woman.

40
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,050
So they're circling her house.
She's this Gloria's house and like,

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,410
it looks like it's in Malibu or somewhere
where they're circling the house and

42
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,670
it's in the hills with a
helicopter like filming. I,

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,100
it's like fucking high production value
shit. This isn't just like, Hey, you know,

44
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:19,130
we met with Caitlin and home Kaitlyn.
Tell us your troubles. You know,

45
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,330
like Kristen back,

46
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:24,380
the former navy seal who just sits
down very reasonably and says,

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,630
this just feels better for me.
This is who I am, right? No, no.

48
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,110
There was like curtains and shadows and
who's mysterious and and then she starts

49
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,280
talking. I was like, like Whoa, God.

50
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,610
And then there was a weird,

51
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
weird is part where she said she got
surgery but it doesn't make me any.

52
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,450
I was,

53
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,070
it wasn't like I was any less of a man
or less of a woman before the surgery.

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,120
Well, this is the case is about gender.
Right. Well then why get the surgery?

55
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:54,190
That was like, this is, well the, there,

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,030
there are a lot of questions as to
the logic of all of this. I get you.

57
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:01,750
You Call Caitlyn Jenner. She, Caitlyn
is a biological man. So sorry,

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,620
get triggered.
Sorry to break this to some of the,

59
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,410
all the people who listen to your show.
Caitlyn Jenner is,

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,630
I had a tweet this week.

61
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,670
All the people that are listening
that probably agree with you. Yeah,

62
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,990
that's a good book.
Good amount.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,860
Do the number one retweeted tweet I have
ever had, had a hundred and I tweeted,

64
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,880
I think a day of going, it has
120,000 likes and it's, it was,

65
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:23,881
there was a headline from CNN that said
transgender man gives birth to a trans.

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,180
What it was it as transgender man,
uh,

67
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,820
assigned the female sex at birth
gives birth to a healthy baby boy.

68
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,480
And so I tweeted, woman gives birth
to boy, right, because it's a woman.

69
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,420
I mean this like that's not a
headline. I'm sorry. Like I'm just,

70
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:40,330
because of the woman believes she's a man,
doesn't make her a man.

71
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:43,270
Like biology still exists.
Sex still exists.

72
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,210
If you want to say she's a woman
who feels like a man, that's fine.

73
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,110
If you want to say that,

74
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,100
I don't even care if she
gets hormone treatments or
if she wants to have surgery.

75
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,900
Like it's a free country,
what the hell you want.

76
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,630
But when you start
insisting that I use that,

77
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:57,790
I just throw biology out the window.

78
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,030
I don't understand why that's any better
than I is a religious person saying

79
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,880
every time you say something you have
to mention God, right? Like, well,

80
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,370
I don't have the right to do that
to you. Like, well that's idiotic.

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,050
Are you fascinated by it? Are you
fascinated by the transgender? The,

82
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,690
I'm fascinated by just
society's obsession with it.

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,520
That's a good way of saying it.
There's not just a, an obsession.

84
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,840
It's,
it's compulsory and it's rabid.

85
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,380
So I think that there's a couple of things
that are going on. One is that it's,

86
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,530
it's very dark, but I think that
there is an element of like,

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,640
this is different and we get to, we get
to revel in the, in the weirdness of it.

88
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,340
But we're gonna pretend that it's all
about the civil rights of it. Right?

89
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,200
We're going to feel like special
because we're, we're, we're,

90
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,610
cause we're on their side watching Caitlyn
Jenner because it's a curiosity and

91
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,900
because it's weird and entertaining,

92
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,360
we're doing it because we're
on Caitlyn Jenner's side.

93
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,940
But their good about forever. Yeah. Right.

94
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,540
I mean Renee Richards was a trans person.
It's happened throughout history.

95
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:57,490
I mean there's, there's,
what was I reading a couple
of days ago about a Roman,

96
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,070
like there was something
about reports of a,

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,760
some trans soldier in the Roman army,
you know,

98
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,240
boring and thousand years
ago it's gotta be, if it's,

99
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:10,470
if exists now and it's existed
before it was popular. Yeah.

100
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,540
I mean there's gotta be a lot of people
that turn trans now just because it's

101
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,800
exciting. Oh, there it is. Right there.

102
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,330
A Trans Soldier in ancient Roman arm
that would of course that it wouldn't be,

103
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,230
wouldn't be surprising. I
mean, not shocked. No chart.
I mean it's a condition.

104
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,530
I mean the DSN called the gender identity
disorder and then they called the

105
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,570
gender dysphoria. It's, it's
a condition. I mean like,

106
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,690
I'm not saying conditions for you,

107
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,010
but that in a lot of people's mind
is labeling it somehow or a negative.

108
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,700
Well,
I mean it is highly linked to suicidality.

109
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:43,570
There's a 40% lifetime suicide rate for
people who have this particular gender

110
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,640
disorder. That seems to me
not to be like great positive.

111
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:48,550
Whether or not they transition, whether
or not the transition. Yeah. I mean,

112
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,740
and it doesn't, I don't care if you
transition to what you want to do, but,

113
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,060
but the idea that, that we as an entire
society, you have to redefine what sex is.

114
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,010
And we have to blind
ourselves to a biology is,

115
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,220
this is something I'm not willing to do.

116
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,500
I think that it's actually
damaging to kids, particularly,

117
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,460
I'm more than willing to
call her a she and chain,

118
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,020
but you can only change your name.
One,

119
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,040
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner,
Caitlyn Jenner.

120
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner
issue because you can't change your sex

121
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,840
and change your name. Right? Can you
change it into whatever you want?

122
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,990
I don't care. But you can't, she,
Caitlyn Jenner is not a chicken.

123
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,590
Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman. Caitlin
Jenner is a man, a biological man.

124
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:23,150
And if a man lost his penis and it, and
Eh, you know, in a, in a tragic accident,

125
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:23,984
it wouldn't make him a woman.

126
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,590
And if he were born with a high
doses of estrogen in his bloodstream,

127
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,410
he would also not be a
woman. Right? You already,

128
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,550
you are determined by our chromosomes
and they're not even talking about

129
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,151
intersex people.

130
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,210
Like intersex is an actual status
intersects is a biological status,

131
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,390
but this nonsense that if you Joe Rogan
decide tomorrow that you are a woman,

132
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,150
no surgeries nor homeowner and
the homeowner, nothing. You just,

133
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,450
tomorrow you wake up and not not decide,
but you feel like a woman,

134
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,330
then you have always been a woman.
We must treat you as a woman.

135
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,730
You don't have to change anything
about yourself for us to even determine

136
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,240
whether you're a woman. We
just like, no, I'm sorry. No,

137
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:59,960
I mean like I had mental illness.
I had a, I had a grandfather I got,

138
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,850
I got so much shit for this,
but I had,

139
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,060
this is not me being unsympathetic to
people who suffer from a condition that is

140
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:09,050
really tragic and obviously harms
people. You know? In terms of the, again,

141
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:13,880
the rates of suicide and depression
are astounding. My grandfather was a,

142
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,410
was a bipolar schizophrenia and it would
have not been good for him or my family

143
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,730
if people had said to him, Nate, you're
right, the radio is talking to you, Nate,

144
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,150
you're right. The curtains
are talking to you. He went,

145
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,300
did they put them in a mental hospital?

146
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,970
They gave him with the m and then he
was better and he could actually live a

147
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,620
normal,
relatively happy life.

148
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,050
There's no good treatment
for gender identity disorder,

149
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,460
gender dysphoria or whatever
you want to call it,

150
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,480
but to suggest that it is a condition
that doesn't require treatment there.

151
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,500
Really, it's just that you're actually
brain female. Again, this is a scientific,

152
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,690
there's no scientific evidence
to back this whatsoever.

153
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,610
Even these studies that have
been done talking about,

154
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,070
there's a female brain and a male brain.
First of all,

155
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,610
if you say this to a feminist,
you're a sexist, right? Right.

156
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,660
If you say to a feminist,

157
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,360
there's a female brand in the male brain
and male brain works differently than

158
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,300
the female brain. The feminist will
look you like, how dare you? Well,

159
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,134
it's also one,
are you

160
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,190
times we are allowed to celebrate classic
definitions of female beauty when a

161
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:09,420
man embraces him when he becomes a
woman lipstick, high heels, short skirt.

162
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,380
This is like

163
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,270
not in general was it k Caitlyn Jenner
was only a woman when Caitlyn Jenner was

164
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,720
on the cover of Vanity Fair and
a boost da. Right, right, right.

165
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,060
But if he had just said, listen, I look
exactly the same as I did yesterday,

166
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:22,540
but I'm a woman. Yeah. If he got a short
haircut and dress like Billie Jean King,

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
right. It's, it's the reason why the,

168
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,790
why the media loves Laverne Cox because
Laverne Cox has had surgeries and looks

169
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,330
a lot like a woman. So I dunno who live
around the middle of that. The guy from,

170
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:34,510
uh, well the, the transgender
woman from orange is the new black.

171
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,700
I never watched that show.
I've never watched that show either,

172
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,410
but she's on the cover of Time magazine.
Oh.

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,700
Or He's on the cover of Time magazine.

174
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,590
Well,
there was the woman in that show.

175
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,270
Isn't that the one where the girl
who ruby row is that the girl? Yeah,

176
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,270
that's Laverne Cox. That's a woman or
man, that's man. I used to be a man.

177
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,090
It used to be a man and a woman. Now.
Very tricky. You know, it's still a man,

178
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:55,680
but transgender tipping point. How far
I'm so out of the loop. I'm old man.

179
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,690
I'm that old man.
Yeah,

180
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,250
well that was one thing.
That headline there, right?

181
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,350
It says America's next civil rights
front here, and that's the key.

182
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,560
You have a bunch of people in the United
States who are suggesting that they

183
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:06,230
want the next civil rights fight. Always
the next civil rights fight. Right.

184
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,690
So is it the sixth the civil rights fight,

185
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:10,310
his immigration or the civil rights
fight as gay marriage or the civil rights

186
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,200
fight is transgenders. Okay.
How about this? How about,

187
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:15,170
there was only one real civil rights
fight news about black people who had been

188
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,230
historically oppressed in the United
States for 200 year there had been slaves

189
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,610
who had been slaves genders.
This is correct. Okay.

190
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:25,880
The worst that Caitlyn Jenner
had experienced was being
incredibly wealthy in a,

191
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:30,110
in a high net worth suburb. This is not
to say that transgender people don't,

192
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,350
you know, aren't discriminated against
in some, in some areas of American life.

193
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:34,190
I'm sure that's true,

194
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,400
but it's also like behavior is not the
same as being born black or being born

195
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,640
Asian or being born with,
you know, uh, disabled. If,

196
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,930
if I'm a business owner and I hire you
and you're a man and you come in the next

197
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,690
day and you're dressed in, in a
woman's clothing saying you're a woman,

198
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,930
but you still have a full beard. Like
I don't see why I, as a business owner,

199
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,020
I'm expected to eat the cost of that,
like that just did that. It seems,

200
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:00,890
that seems bizarre to me.

201
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,480
Eat the cost is a great way to phrase it.
I didn't have a dog in this fight.

202
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,170
I didn't,
I,

203
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,170
I was completely open and liberal about
it until there was a case where a man

204
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:16,901
who had been a man for 30 years became
a woman for a little less than two years

205
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:18,860
and then started MMA fighting women.
Yes.

206
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,910
Beating the fuck out of these women and
shot and not proclaiming that he or she

207
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:29,780
used to be a man because
what is it in quotes,

208
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,450
it was a medical condition that I did
not need to disclose. Like that's not,

209
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,100
I'm fucking medical conditions.
Right.

210
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,780
And if you ever watch
the fights when Alan Fox,

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,150
she wasn't winning
because she was skillful.

212
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,400
She was fucking manhandling these women.
It was ugly horse. It was horrible.

213
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,680
It's like this is it. But again, it's,

214
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:50,350
it's so funny how the transgender
movement destroys the feminist movement by

215
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,490
living off of the,

216
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,310
the sort of lies that the
feminist movement problem
and get it to the feminist

217
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:58,450
movement said stupid things like women
and men equally athletic profession.

218
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,603
Well that's

219
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,150
peated very recently that there's no
biological difference in the genders and

220
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:04,984
it's all social

221
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,140
absolute horse shit. I
mean, I'm told, sorry.

222
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,370
There is no scientific
evidence to back that.

223
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:12,100
And it's particularly true with
regard to actual physical capacity.

224
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,560
This is just nonsense. They
just no scientific evidence,
but I'm not, yeah. Yeah.

225
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,300
I mean mountain of it. My favorite
study on this as you know, there was,

226
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:19,911
you remember there's that,

227
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:22,810
those commercials about like throwing
like a girl running like a girl, right?

228
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:25,440
Remember there's the feminist commercial
saying what does it to be running like

229
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,661
girl,

230
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,350
no to an adult woman and she'd be running
all girly and then they would show

231
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,020
little girl and she's running and it's
still a little girly but she's running,

232
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,830
you know like normally it's
only exactly fierce. It's,

233
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,680
it's only society that has forced
the little girl to run. Like when it,

234
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:41,290
first of all, I have a three year old
girl, she runs like a girl second of all.

235
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,920
And it's not because I'm teaching her
is that cause her mom runs cause she

236
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,990
doesn't write but she played with
dolls because you're a sexist pig.

237
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,030
It's because of that.
My,

238
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,880
my daughters started off liking trucks
like in the first year and I can give a

239
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,520
shit and then and now likes playing
with dolls and dressing up in princess

240
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,560
dresses. Like who cares, she's a
girl, she's always been a girl.

241
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:57,311
She will always be a girl.

242
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,020
Whether she likes trucks or
whether she likes you guys.

243
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,880
That was an issue with
one of my daughters too.

244
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,360
My daughter was a little worried about
her. I go, she's going to be a dyke.

245
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,120
She was like, no, like, what's the big
deal? You like lesbians, who cares?

246
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:09,790
I don't care. I'm like, I
do not care. And she's like,

247
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,890
and then she turned the
corner and then she got,

248
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,630
but we just let her be whatever she's in.

249
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,580
But she was really into
like Batman for awhile.

250
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,700
My daughter is in ABAP and then she
was in a wonder woman. Like, who cares?

251
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,820
Man Is it? But what's funny about
this is that the left kept saying,

252
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,970
even when I met my wife, right,
who's, who's a conservative,

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,190
and I made her more conservative
when we got married,

254
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:31,920
because that's what men tend
to do to their lives. But
she, but she, uh, you know,

255
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,660
we, I remember early on we had a
conversation about this and I said,

256
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,050
women don't throw it like men. And
she got like all offended. And I said,

257
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:41,140
but that's factually attrition. Right? But
it's, but it's insulting. It's like, no,

258
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:44,020
that's factually true.
Like I'm sorry,

259
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,730
like there've been studies out of a
thousand if you took a woman throwing a

260
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,770
baseball and then a thousand
men throwing a baseball,

261
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,040
the woman will throw faster. Then out
of those thousand men is in the book,

262
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,874
the sports gene,

263
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,560
the one we'll throw faster than two of
those men out of a thousand and we're not

264
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,750
talking about like goose Gossage here.
We're talking about,

265
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,910
we're talking about the
accountant from down the block.

266
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,720
We're talking about Paul Ryan flinging
a baseball, right? I mean that,

267
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:07,840
that's not the way this stuff works.

268
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,100
That was the counter that found Fox used
was that she actually lost to a woman.

269
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,790
She lost a woman named Ashley Evan
Smith. But what I said was, no,

270
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:19,870
this proves my point is that you're
not good. You're just a man. Well,

271
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,920
this was John Mcenroe got slapped all
over the lot when he said about Serena

272
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,780
Williams. She's great. Is
there anyone who great and all,

273
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,780
but if Serena Williams were competing,
he said she's the best female player ever.

274
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:31,380
And they were like, well, why not just
the best player ever? And he said,

275
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,300
because she's a, she's a woman. Like if
you were a man, she'd get her ass kicked.

276
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,790
And everyone was like, no, how dare you.

277
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,800
There is something called
the universal tennis ranking.

278
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,770
She would rank in the mid
ranks of college male players.

279
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,210
If you were a man and Serena Williams,
he said like five years ago now,

280
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:47,420
I never want to play with like
Andy Roddick. He'd kill me. She,

281
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,670
she actually did this. There was a
200th rank man in the world who she,

282
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,120
she wanted to just warm up with and they
played it like just a normal match for

283
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,790
a, he won six one six
nothing right. And he was,

284
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,410
and he was like ranked 200th in the world.

285
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,530
And the only shock was that he dropped,
he dropped a point to her. Well,

286
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,240
there was the issue of Renee Richards,

287
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:07,750
when Renee Richards started playing
tennis against women and kicking their ass

288
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,640
and he was a middling player,
best as a woman or as a man rather.

289
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,620
But as a woman, he was a fucking killer.
I mean, Hey, I mean this is what,

290
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:19,330
you didn't sell feminist.
It turns out the Caitlyn Jenner,

291
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:22,540
when all these hero of the year awards
and everything we met are so great that

292
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:27,460
even when we decided to be women were
better than women but a woman for six

293
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,340
months. But he's amazing. He's
incredible at it. He's just,

294
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:33,790
he was a natural men better
even at being women than women.

295
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
No wonder feminists are
pissed and they should be.

296
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,020
And this whole glossing over the,
the,

297
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,860
the difference between feminists who have
been claiming that women are distinct

298
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:45,320
from men and important and different
and better in certain ways.

299
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:47,680
Like I don't understand how you
hold these two simultaneous thought.

300
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,260
Hillary Clinton needs to be president
because we need a female president,

301
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,330
but also Donald Trump. If he said he
was a woman, tomorrow would be a woman.

302
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,700
How do you hold those
two simultaneous thought?

303
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,190
I always thought that in the last week
of the election of Trump thought he was

304
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:58,551
gonna lose.

305
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,070
He should have just declared himself a
woman and then he too could have run in

306
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,110
the first female president.

307
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,320
I would have been incredible trolling
if he just showed up on the dresser and

308
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,890
the entire left a woman. I'm the
best looking woman ever. I've been,

309
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,130
I've been voted as the best
looking woman of all time. Um,

310
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,460
money's great arguments
that I've got it on.

311
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,470
Mine wasn't even arguments,

312
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,450
we'll put it so many people were calling
me a bigot because of this Fallon Fox

313
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,270
thing. It was, it was stunning because
it was so confusing to me. I'm like,

314
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm talking about defending
a biological woman like you.

315
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,750
These biological women,
at least two of them,

316
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:34,751
got the fuck beaten out of him by Fallon
Fox before they found out that she used

317
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,790
to be a man. I'm like, that's
not an issue to these people.

318
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,660
And so this one woman said, she's
always been a woman. And I said, okay.

319
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,670
She gave birth, she impregnated a
woman and got her pregnant. I go,

320
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:50,300
what about then she goes, even then
he didn't. Then she was a woman.

321
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:50,871
She was a woman.

322
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:54,650
She went and she was fucking a woman
with her deck and getting that woman

323
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:59,030
pregnant like we are in fantasy land.
It's crazy town town,

324
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,370
but this doesn't mean
this is what's crazy.

325
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,010
Like you can't just because
something's a logical,

326
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,810
you can't just decide that
someone's a bigot. Like you're you.

327
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,270
You were in a weird area.

328
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:12,260
We're talking about bone structure and
here's the crazy muscle density there.

329
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:12,560
There.

330
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,090
There's the crazy thing is that they
always rely on these gender reassignment

331
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:21,590
doctors to define the terms.
And it's really interesting
because I got deep, deep,

332
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,060
deep into the rabbit hole with this cause.

333
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:27,500
I was really shocked at how many people
were angry at me and there was one

334
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:30,980
doctor who was a board certified
endocrinologist who sort of broke it down.

335
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,890
She's like,
not only is the science behind this crazy,

336
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,960
but when you have gender reassignment
surgery, one of the big issues with men,

337
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm transitioning into women,
his bone density, who she's like,

338
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,810
when you have gender reassignment surgery,
you're taking estrogen,

339
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,690
which actually preserves bone density.
She's like,

340
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,080
not only do they have less bone
density once they become a woman,

341
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,400
they might have more will because
you're preserving it like it's,

342
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,270
you're not going to automatically be
just like a woman in a year or so.

343
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,630
I don't think surgeons,

344
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,500
I mean I know too much about doctoring
from having spent 1000 years with my

345
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:07,830
wife's medical education to believe that
doctors have the capacity to magically

346
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:08,730
change man into a woman.

347
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,150
I didn't know maybe it's going to happen
one day with like CRISPR or something

348
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:16,260
like that when they start using genetic,
I mean really genetic tendencies.

349
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,960
Maybe Andy actually at the chromosome
this before birth, but no, I mean like no.

350
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,450
Once, once your, once your genes had
been defined. What's your chromosomes?

351
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,110
Symptoms like this is fifth grade
science people. It's fifth grade science.

352
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,440
What scares the shit out of me is when
you hear these stories about people

353
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,940
deciding that their child who's like
eight or nine days left up beyond belief.

354
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,730
Gary, because you can't have nine year
look, a fucking 17 year old doesn't know.

355
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,480
That was the thing about
the ruby rose girl.

356
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,960
She was saying that when she was young,
when she was a teenager,

357
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,300
she wanted to be a man.
She wanted to be transgender,

358
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,920
and that she had gone through that phase
and now she's so that she didn't do

359
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:50,370
anything

360
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,360
right. Well, they did.

361
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,740
They say that 80% of kids who experience
any sort of gender dysphoria as

362
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,040
children grow out of it. So when you
have a society that reinforces it,

363
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,070
and then in Canada, they're now
having the passing laws. Now,

364
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,070
let's say that if a kid says, you know,
you have a girl and the girl says,

365
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm a boy and she's three,

366
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,430
that the government can come
into your house and take the kid.

367
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:09,810
Because obviously if,
if you,

368
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:13,560
if you don't want to humor of the kid
and get the kid treatment or surgery or,

369
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,950
or hormone blockers, then you're obviously
doing something wrong to the kid.

370
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:20,730
This is just, it's insane. First of all,
if anyone tried to do that with my kid,

371
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,100
I would meet them at the door with a
gun. I mean that, that, that this is,

372
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,190
this is the kind of stuff where you're
talking legit civil war. Like when,

373
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:29,190
when you say that the government can
take people's kids from them because the

374
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,310
government knows better than you how to
parent your kids on basic things like

375
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,850
are you a boy or a girl that's
going to get violent pretty quickly?

376
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,730
If you send someone in my door with a
gun saying I'm taking your daughter from

377
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,490
you because your daughter says
she's a boy at school and you,

378
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,460
and you're not going to take her to a
psychiatrist to start her transitioning

379
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,710
process.
Oh no,

380
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,830
but what, how did we get so far
down this rabbit hole of insanity?

381
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:52,000
And this is again,

382
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:56,410
this is not taking away the personal
choice of a 60 year old man like Bruce

383
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,620
Jenner who decides he wants to be a woman.
You want free country go have at it,

384
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,603
have a good time.

385
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,500
But how did we get so crazy that that
becomes an option that people aren't,

386
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,710
they're not paying attention to the,

387
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,760
the massive variables
that a child encounters,

388
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,600
psychological variable stress variables.
What's going on in the home,

389
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:19,300
what's happening hormonally,
what's happening psychologically,

390
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:23,590
what is happening to you and how,
how can you decide like, this is it,

391
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,020
you're going to,
you're going to allow this kid to make a,

392
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,110
like a locked down decision to begin
gender transition surgery at like nine or

393
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:35,050
10 years old hormone blockers in there
to an eight year old. Yeah. And you know,

394
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:40,051
and then they'll show you like this girl
who's like 13 who used to be a boy and

395
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:43,690
you know,
you see her act and talk and they go,

396
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,160
how could you imagine that
this isn't a girl? Okay.

397
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,240
I don't, you know, I don't
know. I don't, I don't, I don't,

398
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,390
I just don't know what happened.

399
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,230
I'm going to go with the fact that there's
a y chromosomes in every cell of that

400
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:56,100
person's body,

401
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,760
except ironically for some of his sperm
cells to tell me that that's probably a

402
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:00,960
boy. And, and yes,

403
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:04,500
you can block the manifestation of some
physical characteristics that does not

404
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:07,620
change the chromosomes.
And there are legitimately
Intersex people, right? I mean,

405
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:10,380
there are people who legitimately have
conditions like Kleinfelter syndrome.

406
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:13,050
I mean they're, they're like, these
are, these are actual biological things,

407
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,150
but if you're telling me any boy can
be a girl, no, no. The answer is no.

408
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,250
And it's,
that's not biologically correct.

409
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,860
And you're not doing any
sort of service to a child,

410
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,430
especially with evidence
less. I mean, you, no,

411
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,810
you're doing no service to a
child by bringing bye, bye.

412
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,680
Humoring what is obviously a mental
condition. And in mental condition,

413
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:34,320
by the way,
again,

414
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,480
linkedin 40% lifetime suicide rate is
higher than any other population on planet

415
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,970
earth by a whopping margin.
I mean,

416
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,510
telling kids that we are
going to force you into the,

417
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:48,130
like you express when you're five that
you think you're the sex and now at eight

418
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:50,740
we're going to transition you into this
and your suicide rate is exactly the

419
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:52,510
same as somebody who didn't do that,
right.

420
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:55,220
Where it's very similar to someone
who didn't do that and, and like,

421
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,460
this is somehow supposed to benefit
the person. Uh, it's just, it's,

422
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,640
it's beyond imagination and I think it's
cruelty. What's very strange for sure.

423
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,640
And as someone who doesn't
experience gender dysphoria,

424
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,080
I liked it. I mean when, when someone's
got some sort of an issue, whatever it is,

425
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:11,610
whether you call it,

426
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:15,940
call it an issue or a
condition or whatever the fuck
it is and I don't have it.

427
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,590
I try to be as, as standoffish.
I tried to be as objective.

428
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:24,880
I tried to be as as kind as possible.
This is a weird one though.

429
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,220
This is a weird one because it's,

430
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,670
it's become some sort of a fad and
any criticism of it whatsoever,

431
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:35,350
even discussion of it, you are labeled as
a, as a transphobic piece of shit. Yeah.

432
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,970
I think it's only weird honestly because
it's run into the weird sexual politics

433
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:42,180
that dominates in the country because
if we were to talk about Anorexia,

434
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:45,260
which is a form of body dysphoria. Yes.
All right. Or if we were to talk about,

435
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,360
I mean there are actual is something
body identity, integrity disorder, right?

436
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,540
Where people like want to lose an arm.
I we we'd be saying,

437
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,730
well the problem is in your brain,
it's not in your arm.

438
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,090
Like chopping off your arms seems a little
extreme. But if you want to do that,

439
00:21:57,091 --> 00:22:00,390
like go ahead. But if you were a kid and
it's a five year old, wouldn't say, oh,

440
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:02,010
well this kid's going to suffer
with this their entire life.

441
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:04,770
Like let's just chop off their arm now.
Prevent them,

442
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:07,550
their arm from developing
like this is not [inaudible].

443
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,130
And to tell the entire society that this
is a positive good is a whole nother

444
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:14,250
thing. It's one thing to try and treat
people who have a disorder humanely.

445
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,930
It's another thing to redefine the terms
of the entire civilization as well as

446
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:20,820
biology in order to fit
that. That's, this is,

447
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,090
it's valuing the subject over the
objective. Science is objective.

448
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,810
Your feelings about who you are is
subjective. You can have those feelings,

449
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,070
but once you are trying to translate those
feelings into the objective standard,

450
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:35,280
we all must told by now you're encroaching
on my territory. It's not just,

451
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:36,720
it's not just you doing what
you want to do anymore. You're,

452
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,870
you're telling me what I have to do.
And that's a different thing, right?

453
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,070
Well,

454
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,070
no one people say that there's this 40%
suicide rate amongst transgender people.

455
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,950
Um, one of the arguments that I've heard
is it's because they're not accepted.

456
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,230
Right? I've heard this too. Yeah. Yeah.

457
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,990
And that if they were accepted and then
they felt themselves and they felt loved

458
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:56,470
for their true self,
then it would be just like everybody else.

459
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,160
And I've seen no evidence to
suggest that if, if there's,

460
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:04,890
if there is a decrease based on treatment,
then it's marginal at best. But that

461
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,100
it's, is it uniform? Like I would
like to know is like gender dysphoria,

462
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:15,101
is it in a similar percentile as a
anorexia or what bodybuilders get,

463
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,130
or what's strippers get
when they get triple f tits?

464
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,790
I know there's a lot to look up.
Like the anorexic suicide, right. Um,

465
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,430
does for you is a weird thing. You
know, it's, it's, it is that people,

466
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:31,720
there's a girl that goes to my yoga class
that's anorexic and it's so disturbing.

467
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,680
It's so sad. Oh, it's, it's, it's
horrifying. It's horrifying. And listen,

468
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,590
I'm not telling, I'm not saying that we
should mistreat people, but if again,

469
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,330
you're talking about an entire society
mean forced to redefine basic biological

470
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:47,870
terminology,
then like it be an adult,

471
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,090
like live, like live with this. I'm, I'm
happy to treat you with, uh, listen what?

472
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,600
I would hire a transgender person,
but I'm not going to see,

473
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,930
I'm not going to change what
reality is in order to humor you.

474
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:02,800
Like if you call yourself Napoleon, I'm
not going to call you Napoleon Napoleon.

475
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:04,070
I'm like,
this is not something I'm up for it.

476
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,910
What'd you take it into consideration?
No,

477
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,770
I mean when you're looking
at the still like it was,

478
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:11,430
what if someone was really good at their
job and someone else was equally good

479
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:13,020
at their job but not transgender?

480
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,940
Would you lean towards the not
transgender person? Cause you say,

481
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:19,140
well the transgender person,
they're dealing with a host
of psychological issues,

482
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:19,974
obviously.

483
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,770
Well, I mean I, I think that you
would have to think about, you know,

484
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,110
typical aspects of reliability.

485
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:27,810
Just the same way you would with any
other mental disorder if you need somebody

486
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,340
was was manic depressive,

487
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,890
which is super common and you have
somebody who is equally qualified.

488
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:33,450
He's not manic depressive.
You might think,

489
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:36,870
well that might have an effect on on
how they do their job. Yeah. So maybe,

490
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:38,370
I mean I, you know, I've,

491
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,510
I haven't had enough personal experience
with transgender people to know whether

492
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:46,500
it would impact a secretarial
job or something. Probably
not. Yeah, probably not.

493
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,160
But it's, but again, to pretend that
like transgenders in the military,

494
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:52,950
this seems to me like in a decision
that will be made my military people who

495
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:55,200
actually have to determine how
much does this impact the job.

496
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,850
And if you already have a group of people
with a 40% suicide rate who have high

497
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:03,360
levels of higher levels of instabilities,
a group not individually as a group,

498
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,440
and you're choosing which groups to pick
from to be on the front lines in small

499
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:12,060
units living under severe pressure
for months at a time. Yeah. Like,

500
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:12,820
is that something that,

501
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,220
is that what you're going to go for
or is that something where like you,

502
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,880
you'd have to overcome certain
presumptions in order to get there? Yeah.

503
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,580
Tweeted something that Kristin
Beck wrote the other day. Um, uh,

504
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,390
but when the military band, when
Trump, apparently there was not a real

505
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,360
no,
it's bullshit.

506
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,910
I mean base from just trying to
distract from the sessions thing.

507
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,350
Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah.

508
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:35,440
I get t two minutes later he's back
to tweeting about sessions here.

509
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,310
This was the part about
that I didn't like,

510
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:41,420
like I actually agree that there is a
question as to whether the military should

511
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:44,690
be recruiting transgender people because
I think that the military has certain,

512
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:46,700
like it creates a bunch of questions,

513
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,670
not just questions about who showers
with whom, but also questions like, okay,

514
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:50,720
you have a transgender man.

515
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:53,080
Does he have to fill the female standards
of fitness or the male standards,

516
00:25:53,081 --> 00:25:56,210
the standards of fitness or like
these are actual questions. Does it,

517
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,250
how does it work with troop cohesion?
Right?

518
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:01,810
You have a group of men and now you have
a man who's technically a man, but he's,

519
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,870
did you treat him as a woman?

520
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,280
Like does you have to carry
the same amount of stuff?

521
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:06,810
Is the guy like how does that
work exactly right. It does this,

522
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,480
the cost of gender transition surgery
and hormones and psychologists like does

523
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:12,890
that come into play at all here?

524
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,680
Would you recruit from the
anorexic community for the
military? Like that's it.

525
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,490
These are like real questions.
But that said,

526
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,000
that's why they commissioned a study
from General Maddis at Department of

527
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,210
Defense.

528
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,880
He was going to look into all of this
and then give a report in six months and

529
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:28,430
Trump just sort of tweeted it out there.
I agree that,

530
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:30,440
I think that Trump's general,
you know,

531
00:26:30,441 --> 00:26:33,890
his general attitude on it is probably
correct in terms of what the military is.

532
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,540
They're doing, what, what
it's not there to do.

533
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,230
But what I don't agree with is how he
did it at all because it's disrespectful

534
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,880
to the people in the
military who are transgender.

535
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,170
I mean like I wouldn't want to find out
in a tweet. I want a better rationale.

536
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:49,080
Van Two tweets and then we're back to, and
then we're back to, you know, like look,

537
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,880
they're doing more than,
I mean they're serving in the military.

538
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:51,810
I didn't serve in the military.

539
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,450
It seems like it would be pretty
hypocritical of me to say, well,

540
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:58,530
it's perfectly respectful to say in two
tweets you're out because that's the way

541
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:00,600
it is without any sort of
supporting argumentation.

542
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,520
And he didn't actually implement a policy.

543
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,160
He didn't give the policy to the Defense
Department so they could even implement

544
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:05,520
it.

545
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,860
The Pentagon says they're not implementing
it because they don't have a policy.

546
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,250
So as a PR thing,
so this a weird PR thing,

547
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:14,970
but it really stirred up people in the,
which was, I think it was designed to do.

548
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:18,840
Right. I'm sure. Either that
or he just felt like tweeting.

549
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,690
And I think that's what I,
I think that's what it was.

550
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,320
I mean he wanted to shift the conversation
and it was the funniest thing about

551
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,400
that is that he did it in two tweets.

552
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,980
In the first half of the tweet was in
consultation with my generals and my

553
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:29,850
military experts.

554
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,120
We have decided that we will no longer
accept Eclipsys 10 minute gap transgender

555
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:39,180
people in the military. So
there was a, there was a,
there was a story, a buzzfeed,

556
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,014
those kind of funny,

557
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,840
they went an interviewed a bunch of
people in the Pentagon and a bunch of the

558
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,790
people in the Pentagon or like
during that 10 minute cap,

559
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:46,890
I didn't know whether we were
going to nuclear war, what right.

560
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,830
Cause that first tweet we
will no longer extended.

561
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,660
Could've been North Korea Korea's
missile missile test programs.

562
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,180
So wow. Yeah. This again is evidence.

563
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,100
I think it's an example of even if I think
the policy is good, good policy done,

564
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:05,700
the wrong way is actually
counterproductive for the
policies that I want to see.

565
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,600
None like I want it laid out by Madison.

566
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,910
I want to lay it out
by defense department.

567
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,580
I want all the reasons laid out so we
can have a good discussion over it.

568
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,420
I don't really want just like thought
vomit on Twitter, that's just not,

569
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:16,254
I don't think it's effective.

570
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,320
Well it also seems that this issue is
such a hot issue and it's also an issue

571
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:25,260
that you're not really allowed to have
an opinion on other than the standard

572
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:29,790
opinion. This has always and trapped in
a man's body and this is the way it is.

573
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,700
And by the way, healthy this day
cardian notion that it's like a man,

574
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,490
it's like the,

575
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,490
the the sole in the machine and there was
a woman deep down for 40 years who had

576
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:43,590
three children with a man's
penis and now is now is escaping.

577
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,450
There's like Ghostbusters, like
uh, again goes faster. It just,

578
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,320
have you seen the man in England?
Was it in England knows Germany,

579
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,650
the man that identifies as
a six year old girl? Yes.

580
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,030
And so they turned them into a six
year old girl and there's this clip,

581
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,020
that clip of me that's going around the
Internet a fair bit when I'm talking to

582
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,410
a college girl about this.
And she,

583
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:05,100
she's sang like men or men can be women
and women can be men. And I said, well,

584
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,860
how old are you? I love that
clip. And they, come on,

585
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,630
why aren't you 16 she's six days. And
she, she's like baffled, like what?

586
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,680
And then it finally hits her and it's
like, well, you know, yeah. It's,

587
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,130
I think this is what's kind of
frightening about the age we live in,

588
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:23,640
is that we can't even come up with
common definitions of basic things.

589
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:25,260
How are we supposed to have
conversations with each other?

590
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,240
If you can't decide what a
man is or what a woman is,

591
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,630
or whether a scientific fact
ought to be relevant or not,

592
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,120
at least we could decide what was the
scientific factor, not before. And now.

593
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:38,160
It's like the subjective
has just eaten everything.

594
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,480
If I don't think it's a scientific fact,

595
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:42,100
it's no longer a scientific fact
and they're I no longer parameters

596
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,930
of the argument.
It's become about freedom.

597
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,600
The freedom to be your authentic
self versus biology. Yeah.

598
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,070
Right. And again, be be be your
authentic self. I don't give a shit.

599
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:53,560
They will do whatever you want,
like you know, more power to you.

600
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,650
But it is no longer about your freedom
to be our authentic self when you're

601
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:59,680
talking about either a legislation that
impacts how I run my business or how I

602
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:03,880
raise my child or your suggesting that
it is my duty to humor your authentic

603
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:04,660
self.

604
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,940
Like I think there are a lot of people
who do stupid crap their entire lives.

605
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,640
It's not my job to humor their
authentic self. I mean I'm,

606
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm pro drug legalization but I've never
done drugs and I think the drugs are

607
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,040
stupid,
you know,

608
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,830
don't tell me that I have to like
cheer when somebody smokes a joint.

609
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:20,290
Like do what you want
but don't tell me that.

610
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,500
I have to redefine what I think is
good and bad behavior. That's silly.

611
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,930
Yeah.
It doesn't make any sense.

612
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,210
And the other thing that it became this
weird political hot point where we're

613
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,170
talking about bathrooms.
Yeah.

614
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,830
And then it become like the number one
was easy for people to sort of boil down

615
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:38,040
the argument into that. Right. Of course.
Like this. What about my children?

616
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:40,740
My children would go to the bathroom and
a man with a dress is going to come in

617
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:43,200
and he's gonna claim that
he's a identifying as a woman.

618
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,640
And it got to the point where so many
people were upset about it that people

619
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:49,500
were boycotting South Carolina.

620
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,930
Oh yeah. You know the, and, and this,
the one I thought was amazing was,

621
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,680
was the NCAA saying they were going to
remove the final four from North Carolina

622
00:30:56,681 --> 00:30:59,260
because they passed the,
the bathroom bill right in North Carolina.

623
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,360
And I asked online,
okay,

624
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,090
so when are you going to abolish the
separate male and female divisions of the

625
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:06,220
NCAA?
My got me.

626
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:08,590
You've said that we can't have
separate male and female bathrooms were

627
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,560
biological males play.
And you know,

628
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,690
biological males go to one bathroom
and biological females go to another.

629
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,880
So why do you have separate divisions?
Why do you have a,

630
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:19,570
why do you have an NCAA women's division
and an NCAA men's division? Yeah.

631
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:23,710
Where does this go?
I mean eventually it boiled down.

632
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,200
I mean eventually it goes
to one place or another.

633
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:30,090
Like either we just say this is a step
too far. It gives me a break, you know,

634
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,120
science has no, or we say anyone
can be anything at any time.

635
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,990
A man as a woman and a woman as a
man and you know, it's in just pick.

636
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,940
Have you ever seen any of the videos
for people that are gender fluid?

637
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,740
I have seen those videos. Those
videos are fascinating. Like you said,

638
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,840
wake up one day and there are a
woman and the next day there are man.

639
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,110
And there was a guy on NPR,
on um,

640
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,140
radio lab on the podcast who transitions
at times of stress makes perfect sense

641
00:31:56,931 --> 00:32:01,310
to me in the middle of
having a conversation. I
just switched. I'm Paul now.

642
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,200
I'm a man

643
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,480
when he's more stressed as he switched
into a woman because that'd be really

644
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:05,790
sexist, right? I mean,
I think they like it.

645
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,350
If he was stressed at work and he
switched into a woman and started crying,

646
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,610
that seems kind of sexist to me.

647
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:12,970
That's implying that women are the people
who cry at work. So that is sex also.

648
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:16,220
This raises a bunch of other
weird questions like, okay,
if you're like, there's,

649
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,090
there's been this, again, you wanna talk
about weird, there's been this, this,

650
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,860
this weird push in parts of the Trans
Community to suggest that a male who

651
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:28,780
doesn't want to have sex with a biological
male who says he's a female, is a,

652
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:32,670
is now a sexist against women.
Phobe is it trans folk? Right?

653
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,410
You're a bad person if you're a man who
doesn't want to have sex with a man,

654
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,050
a biological man, and it doesn't
make you gay to do that, right?

655
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,670
If you have sex with a biological man who
says he's a woman, that's straight sex,

656
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,730
but if you were to have sex as a
biological woman who says she's a man,

657
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,860
you're gay. Yeah. Kind of weird.

658
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:48,921
Really Weird.

659
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:53,900
But I have seen the arguments and the
blog posts and the tweets about men who

660
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:57,500
discriminate against trans women
who do not want to date trans women.

661
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,110
And people keep saying, well, it's,
it's culturally define. It's like, no,

662
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,060
that's called evolution. What you might
have a baby together. Correct. Correct.

663
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:08,230
It turns out that evolution wants
men to have sex with women. Like,

664
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,130
I'm sorry to break it to everybody,

665
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,180
but evolution rose relies
on human reproduction. Okay.

666
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:16,160
If you put that thing in the wrong place,
it ain't going to reproduce.

667
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,070
Like that's just, sorry.
I mean I don't know.

668
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,620
I don't know why I have to keep
apologizing for science and,

669
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,030
and then they say that my party is
the party of non science. Like what?

670
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,580
Like you're the ones who say that
two minutes before my baby is born,

671
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:32,900
it's not a baby and a man can be a woman.
But I'm anti-science. I'm just, I'm,

672
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,740
I'm wildly confused by this. Well, the
whole thing is wildly confusing. Um,

673
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,080
but it's just,
it's such a strange subject.

674
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:41,720
It's such a strange subject that's been
brought to the forefront and I think

675
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,690
it's about more of the moral posturing
than it is about people who actually

676
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,940
think this is a major issue.
I think you're absolutely right.

677
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,820
And I think people love to be virtuous.
They'll have to be on that side.

678
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,740
They live to virtue signal. How dare
you, I dare you. We're doing it.

679
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:57,930
It's the how dare you with
Dicks or lack of fake dicks,

680
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,920
but they don't really have a lot of fake
dicks. They don't really go that far.

681
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,840
They just sort of take testosterone and
see what's up. But the, the, it's just,

682
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,390
it's a weird facet of our society
today that is a unexpected, I mean,

683
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:15,140
you go back 2030 years and it
was an oddity and you know,

684
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:17,180
even during the Renee Richards thing,
it was,

685
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,030
it was more of an oddity than anything.
And think just sort of accepted.

686
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,560
This is why I say I think that it's,

687
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,200
I think that a lot of people who are
virtue signaling are still treating it as

688
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:26,300
an oddity. They just
won't admit that. Right.

689
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:28,280
I think that they're watching it
because it's a circus to them.

690
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:29,240
And I think that's actually cool.

691
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,330
I don't think that you should like put
people who suffer from mental illness on

692
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:35,450
the cover of magazines. I just don't,
I think that that's bad strategy.

693
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,480
[inaudible].
