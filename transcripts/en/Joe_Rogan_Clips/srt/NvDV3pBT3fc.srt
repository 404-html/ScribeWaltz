1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,370
It's interesting that you
combine those things though,

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:06,600
that you have this a gym or there's all
this martial arts stuff and then the

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:09,030
tactical stuff.
What do you do to chill out?

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,570
Because it seems like everything
is fucking Coco, coco cow.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,510
Everything is lifting weights,
shooting and pull on ropes,

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,380
shooting and arm dragging and shooting.
Um, what do you do to calm yourself?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,030
I am hobby heavy. Hobby heavy. Well you
show me your drawing. Very talented.

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,700
So I draw, I burped. I
bird watch. Birdwatch Yup.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,250
I bet a birdwatcher since I
was 10 years old, really? Golf.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,700
I go down this list, guitar, drums, um,

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,770
Cook. Let me see here. I got so many
freaking hobbies. It's ridiculous. And,

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,940
but the good thing about most
of ms I could go to and um,

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,740
and um, it doesn't take me a lot
of time or energy to invest in it.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,090
A fishing on big time fisherman,
outdoorsman, woodsmen type of thing.

15
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,050
I love that stuff.

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,180
I get into the rocky mountains at least
once a year and two like privation

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,800
training here just on my own.
So like what do you do when you do that?

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,300
This camp out there and live off the
land. You try it, try it, try to sustain,

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,620
you know, with what I have and
what's available to me. And it also,

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,170
uh, and it also includes a
orienteering so you know what,

21
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:27,171
over 24,000 scale
topographical map and um,

22
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,210
so orienteering and,
and these are wilderness areas,

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,080
not like national parks or forests. And
then, uh, tried to let it kill it, eat it,

24
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,700
you know, along the way. Carry,

25
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,900
I carry enough food so I'm not going to
be miserable so I'm not going to suffer.

26
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,400
How many days do you do when
you're out there? Well, it, it, it,

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,710
now that I'm retired not
before to five anymore.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,880
You're like bringing a ruck
sack or something like that.
Yup. So I pack in, Yup.

29
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,820
Whatever. A, whenever I need. And
you know, pat king a ruck is a,

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,930
it's a real, it's artwork man. Sure.

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,300
Even if you've been in the
military forever, you know,

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,510
you just never ever get that
down to a perfect science,

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,250
especially a weight. Yeah. Cause you got,
wait, you're going to rain, you got, uh,

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,680
you know, the, the uh, uh,

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,950
the situation may dictate
to strip this and add that.

36
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,160
And then where are you going to put it
and you bring satellite phone or anything?

37
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,760
We do it or you do I uh, I bring it, yeah,
I bring one of those cause Saturn's, yep.

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,010
You don't want to roll an ankle out there.
Well plus I usually go to Montana,

39
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:38,680
like the Bob Marshall, so that's both
the highest concentration of grizzlies.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,290
Lower 48. So you're not on the
top of the food chain management.

41
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,120
Big Hungary's out there. So that's
a fucking scary spot. Well it's,

42
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,680
it's always usually pretty good
unless you run into a female. Yeah.

43
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:52,940
With their clubs. That's when it
gets super sketchy. I just wrote,

44
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,190
I just wrote about that.
Um, that's not, I write,

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
so I write for a ballistic magazine
and combat handguns and I just wrote an

46
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,140
article about that wouldn't ballistic,
uh,

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,440
about what should be in your
personal survival kit. You know,

48
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,770
let's say you go on a day fishing
trip in Alaska. What should,

49
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,650
what do you have in that thing?
You know,

50
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,440
in the event that you need to go
into contingency planning mode,

51
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:21,880
that shit hits the fan. You got to have
something on you instead of just your,

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,210
your Orvis fly rod and
a couple of beat heads.

53
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,980
Yet the big debate with a hunter's is
should you bring bear spray or feed you

54
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,110
bring a pistol.
Yup.

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,950
Especially both smart that I need to
anytime bear country, I bring both.

56
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:40,120
I got them both on and I've talked to a
lot of gristle hunters and I put that in

57
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,410
that article too. It's like guys, you
know, I've done some research here.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,880
Uh, but yeah, so I'll
bring, I'll bring both.

59
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,010
Have you had any
encounters when you're out?

60
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,150
I've had almost every year
really the closest one,

61
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:59,710
15 yards. Maybe that was the
first time ever up there too.

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,350
And I'm smoked. I'm at the
end. This is what I was doing.

63
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,040
I started doing these when we were,
when I was active,

64
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,240
so bringing up unit guys and
this one was 95 miles long.

65
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,980
We walked from um,
uh,

66
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,230
a little spot on the map. Oh, Columbia
falls south of Columbia Falls,

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,180
Montana to Lincoln, the home Ted
Kaczynski. The Unabomber. Yeah,

68
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,860
yeah,
yeah.

69
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:30,340
So walk this stretch and it's 95
miles right in north to south,

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,900
and you've got to cross like three
different mountain passes and smoker.

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,500
So the s I think it was,
it was the fifth day. Yeah.

72
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,400
Because we had one more Ron,
one more rest overnight.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,410
And on the fifth day I had a,

74
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,970
we would walk like lines of drift
and stuff like that, you know? Uh,

75
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,530
and whenever I couldn't see 25 yards
up ahead of me, I would, you know,

76
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,550
clap my hands, make some
racket coming through mark,
you know, that kind of thing.

77
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,810
Because grids want nothing to do with you,
right.

78
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,790
You get in between their young,

79
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,370
their food source or you startle him.
That's when you run into trouble. Right.

80
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,500
So I did not want to stay, and here I
am, I'm, and I've got six guys, Whitney,

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,500
but they're lagging behind.
Uh, and I, you know,

82
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:22,501
coming through and I look up ahead and
this gigantic male stands up and the only

83
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,040
thing that I could,
my only reaction was whoa.

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,570
I mean I was just blown away.

85
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,220
15 yards is less distance
than you flew when you crash.

86
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,210
Right.
And flew in the air,

87
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,170
you have to fly in the air and it passed
that five yard. That's right. Yup.

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,190
Wow. Yup. He took off. Boom.
He was gone. Lucky. Yeah,

89
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,020
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Because I mean that's a lot.

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,930
That's a lot of animal.
Yeah.

91
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,380
I tell you when you're standing
like in the woods in the wild,

92
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,700
50 yards, 1550 yards, and
when that thanks stood up,

93
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,360
that's all I could say. That's all. I
mean, I had a gun and bear spray on me.

94
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,900
I went for neither of them
all I can think it was. Whoa.

95
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,950
And then when he took off, my next
thought was, where's my camera? Oh, Jesus.

96
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,350
Well that's nature's cleanup crew right
there. Anything that limps falls down,

97
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,510
fucks up. Yep. That's what it's there for.

98
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,070
That's why there's a thousand pounds
of him, man. He needs to keep eating.

99
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,050
Yeah. It's a, it's a majestic
animal. You see one in the
wild. You, you realize like,

100
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:33,840
wow, like this is just
nature has a system. Yup.

101
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,170
They know what they're doing when
they want to get rid of a moose.

102
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,030
They sent one of these motherfuckers
in there. Yeah. I mean really.

103
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,970
So when you're doing these,
um,

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,360
these things that you keeping
a journal when you do in these,

105
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,410
these trips where you by herself?
Um,

106
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,190
and I usually don't go by myself.

107
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,710
I usually have straphangers and
they're different every year.

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,670
It's a lot of times it's just like this,
you know, a couple of guys talking,

109
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,350
saying, Oh man, I like
to do that with you. Oh,

110
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,830
we're just send me an email and
I'll send you the dates. Oh Wow.

111
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,320
Because one is securities and numbers,
right. Especially at Greer's country.

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
Plus I like teaching stuff.

113
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:17,090
So I'll have guys who I could teach like
orienteering and you know, field craft,

114
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:20,920
you know, making a fire with sticks
and kind of that kind of thing. And uh,

115
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,950
the right way to, uh, maybe to
prep and cook a trout. You know,

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,890
uh, so do you bring a rod with
you? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,090
I'm one of them small breakdown.
I, I'll, I'll bring two of them.

118
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,320
I'll bring a,
tell us telescoping a 10 cholera and a,

119
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:42,350
a four piece, like a
five weight Orvis. Okay.

120
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,060
Because it's fly rod
then. Yeah. Okay. I am,

121
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,850
for me that's sustenance because
I'm not taking a lot of food.

122
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,350
Plus I want to fish. I want it to
be time off and I want to chill.

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,990
I don't want to just work my
ass off when I'm on these.

124
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,330
So I'm out there ripping lips,

125
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:03,140
but I'm eating two of them in
the morning and two at night. Uh,

126
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,510
and then it's a lot.
It's a lot of fun.

127
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:09,590
I've been doing these things now
since 98 I think that's a great way to

128
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,560
decompress too. Yeah. The places I go to,

129
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,970
one of them is I will lose cell coat,

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,930
cell phone coverage an hour before
I hit the end of the dirt road.

131
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,970
Yup. So, and then you stopped the
color, you were at the end of the road.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Now you're, you know, you're already in,

133
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:32,801
you're just at the edge of the Wilderness
area deep into a national forest and

134
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,880
then into the wilderness for
however many days, miles.

135
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,280
Uh, we run another folks in. You're out
there very rarely the best. You know,

136
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,300
I loved walking like on the
95 mile one and seeing nobody,

137
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,260
nobody,
I mean these places that are remote,

138
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,360
the Frank Church and Idaho,
uh,

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,940
I walked wind river and
uh, Wyoming, they, uh,

140
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,330
the Frank Church, I walked from
the town of Salmon to McCall.

141
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,360
That one smoked me.
How far is that?

142
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,620
They did w w on a scale of things as
a crow flies. I, it's not that far.

143
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:15,150
I think it's 60 miles or something, but
it's straight up, straight down down.

144
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,160
It's the most horrific and
d just terrifying terrain.

145
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,950
I mean, especially if
you're, you know, uh,

146
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,190
if your objective is to move from point
a to point B and not just an out and

147
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:30,930
back, let me see how far it can go. No.

148
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:35,820
When you got somebody picking you up at
point B and you have to be there. Oh man,

149
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,030
it is a freaking smoker. Yeah. I've
never been in the Frank Church, but um,

150
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,470
my friend Ryan Callahan was living up
there for a long time and it's cool.

151
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,670
He says it's amazing up there.
It's also so it's so remote,

152
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,740
but yet it's so close to Boise.
Yeah, that far, right? Yeah. Right.

153
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,930
Yeah. The grand scale themes,
things, it's not, it's not
that far. Right. But there's,

154
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,840
when you have these wilderness
areas, like uh, I don't know,

155
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,320
let's say it's 500 million square
acres or whatever it is. You know,

156
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,680
that's also a colposcope by
national parks and stuff.

157
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,941
And you know,

158
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:16,080
national parks will have dirt roads and
I mean they'll have little scatterings

159
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,980
of, of population here and there,
but those wilderness areas,

160
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,540
there's nothing in those.
Just animals.

161
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,610
There's no dirt roads and it's
such a complete ecosystem to me.

162
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:29,490
You have to have everything from wolves,
the grizzlies to mule deer to elk.

163
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,140
It's all living up in there.
Yeah. Yeah, they are cool.

164
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,850
I mean, I love doing those two because
you have to thank, there isn't,

165
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,760
there is an element of danger here that,
that can kill me.

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,890
And it's not just a big hungry,

167
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,270
you could get cut and show out there
because nobody's coming to get you.

168
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:55,800
Even if you got that beacon, you
know, forest service and stuff,

169
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,980
they're probably busy servicing,
you know,

170
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:02,820
grandma broke her leg trying to take a
picture of a bison in this national park

171
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,630
coming into that national,
that wilderness area, you know,

172
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,540
there was no h LZs there and
stuff like that. Right? So man,

173
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,790
I love that, that element of danger,
especially since I retired. You know,

174
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,660
I want to be cold, tired, hungry,
and maybe a little scared. Um,

175
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,610
and I want that several times
a year because, uh, yeah,
it's, you know, it's primal,

176
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,870
right?
And I think most guys need that.
