1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,160
There's studies that compare testicle
size of different civilizations and

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,440
different cultures.
There's a lot of argument about this.

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,400
And the problem is that the print
that it's racist, it's racist, right?

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:15,000
That's what underlies a lot of it. But we
get scared, right? So the thing is that,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,310
that the, the um, the genetics,

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,820
it explain why one animal or one
species would have large testicles.

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:21,201
In other words,

8
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:24,660
a small testicles are not the genetics
that would explain why two different

9
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,820
individuals in the same
species would be that way.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,390
Because the only way to make that
latter one work is you have to inherit a

11
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:33,300
constellation of traits.
So if I'm in a hair,

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,330
the genes for big balls
and for impulsiveness and
for having lots of kids and

13
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:41,490
not caring much about him and all the
things that are supposedly go with that,

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,470
that do, when you look between
species, there's no way for those,

15
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:46,680
that constellation of traits
to be inherited together.

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,560
Cause remember I was talking
about how polygenic everything is.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,740
And so they'd all literally need to sit
next to each other on the chromosome if

18
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:56,160
they've got any chance of being
passed on as a package and they don't.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,690
And you also get all the shifting
around her in Meiosis. Um,

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,010
I can't remember the term
for off the top of my head,

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,300
but where the pieces of genetic
material move around and that virtually

22
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,300
guarantees that you're not going to
inherit this huge constellation of traits

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,870
within a species between
species is dead easy. You know,

24
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:16,350
you're a species inherits big testicles
and inherits impulsiveness. It inherits,

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,430
you know, whatever. Uh, and our strategy
just reproduce a ton and ignore them.

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,290
You know,
all that kind of stuff's dead easy.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,280
And so CIM fathers don't pay any attention
to chimp babies to speak of because

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,630
while that's their mating
system, right? Whereas, um,

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,330
you've got pair bonded Gibbons and things
and now parents start to play a much

30
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,340
bigger, even male parents
start to play a bigger role.

31
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:39,000
But there's no studies that show that
human beings with archer testicles tend to

32
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,450
ignore their children. Well, so this is
just it. People have tried to show that.

33
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,880
But here's the problem.
I tried to show that studies.

34
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,780
So lots of people make that argument
and it's called life history strategies

35
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:49,620
where you say,
well,

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,650
you're going to develop one life history
strategy in these circumstances and

37
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,330
another and these other circumstances.

38
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,780
The problem is that you end up with
ethnic differences in testicle size,

39
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:58,920
which we know exist.

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,720
And you also have ethnic differences in
where in the kinds of lives that people

41
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,554
currently lead.

42
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,070
The difficult thing is it's super easy
to look at the world we are in right now

43
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,780
and this is what tripped
me up earlier as well.

44
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,850
You look at the world that we
are right now and assume, well,

45
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:15,360
that's the way things have always been
and they haven't. And so right now,

46
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,650
you know, the uh,
mathematics used for a while,

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,270
they're the best math in the world
was taking place in the Arabic world.

48
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,750
Now it's not anymore. And so if you,
if you don't know that past, you'd say,

49
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,584
well look,

50
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,230
people in the Arabic world aren't as
good at mathematics and they have these

51
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,250
qualities and that you'd make an inference
right now the ethnic differences in

52
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,320
testicles,
I believe,

53
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,380
but I can't promise you that it's some
different west African groups happen to

54
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:41,440
have the largest testicle size on average.
Um,

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,430
those west African groups
tend to be poorer right now.

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,030
There's lots of things about life that
go with being poor that looked like and

57
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,970
our strategy having lots of kids
and paying less attention to them.

58
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,080
But what you're probably looking at is
a coincidental association between some

59
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,530
biology and some, uh, some way that your,

60
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,500
your people happen to live that didn't
exist a while ago and that won't exist a

61
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:06,100
while from now. And so it's really
easy to try to use this research,

62
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,440
which people have to say,
well,

63
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,340
you've got some primitive people who have
big testicles and low parental effort

64
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,430
and you've got some more sophisticated
people with smaller testicles in the high

65
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,740
parental effort.
But that's genetically super naive.

66
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,360
One of the things that I
learned when I was in Rome,

67
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,270
we took a tour of the Vatican
by this guy who was a professor.

68
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:27,550
It was really interesting.
It was cool because we used to have a,

69
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:32,300
a really enthusiastic guide and who,
who could explain a lot of things to you.

70
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,990
And he was really excited that,
you know,

71
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,350
me and my family were very
curious about these things too.

72
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,620
But one of the things that
he said that was really
interesting, I said, okay, I go,

73
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,160
why all the dudes have little dicks,
like what's going on with that?

74
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,460
And he said that they believed
that if you had a large penis,

75
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,650
that large penises were a
symbol of barbaric behavior
and that these were crude

76
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:58,890
or people. And that to be, you know,

77
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,420
thought to be a sophisticated person.
You wanted a smaller penis.

78
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:07,421
So they actually accentuated smaller
penises in their gods and smaller penises

79
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:08,240
and their statutes.

80
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,970
And that's funny. I mean, you can see
these kinds of things all the time.

81
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,880
So early pre western contact. Uh, if you
look at Japanese women, they're pinned,

82
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,490
they're painted with their eyes as
narrow of a slit as possible post western

83
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:19,941
contact.

84
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:22,970
Now the women want more almond shaped
eyes and so they start painting them with

85
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,360
the beautiful women have bigger eyes.
These things can change all over the map.

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,890
I personally suspect that large penis
sizes also product to sexual selection.

87
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,610
So it's more fun for her if he's got a
larger penis or having sex for longer and

88
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,650
more regularly because
obviously patients hidden.

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,420
So he has to be available all the time.

90
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,150
So she has to be available all the
time or the system doesn't work.

91
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,830
And that's what creates pair bonding.

92
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,470
So humans copulating for a
very long period of time.

93
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:49,760
If you compare us to the other primates
with the single exception of Bonobos and

94
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,090
we have way bigger penises than
any of the other great apes.

95
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,690
And I suspect that that's something
that is female. I mean women always say,

96
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,220
why are men subsets to the penis size?

97
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,080
But I suspect that there
are the creator of it,

98
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:01,610
and that's why we're so obsessed with it.

99
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,470
Women who say that are playing games,
they know that's ridiculous.

100
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,520
I don't know that they are.
They're definitely playing games.

101
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,390
That's like men who are saying, why
are women so obsessed with big breasts?

102
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,080
We don't even care. I've never met a
guy who said that. Everybody has some,

103
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:21,400
some asshole out there that's playing
games. Okay. Possibly. You're right.
