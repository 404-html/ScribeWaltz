1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,210
kind of weird how they cited some of
those same parts of the code of conduct

3
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:08,530
where,
Oh yes,

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,210
every employee should do their utmost
of reducing bias and harassment and

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,860
illegal discrimination.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,870
When really my document
was about illuminating the
bias against conservatives

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,070
and the harassment against them and the
legal discrimination that we're doing in

8
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,480
multiple parts of our pipeline.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,440
There's no room for conservatives today,
sir.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,430
I mean I'm uh, you
conservative. Do you feel like,

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,350
because I,

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,980
I'm pretty much just libertarian but
that's thought of as conservative cause

13
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:42,300
it's convenient. Right. You just
immediately pushed off that right wing,

14
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,910
angry white male group.
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,770
Everyone that's in the center or
right of that is all right. All right.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,820
Yeah.
You favor of smaller government,

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,160
less intrusion. Yeah. I,
I'm not super libertarian.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,950
Like I obviously believe that there's
places where the government should be,

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,220
but just I do my,
yeah,

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,130
my like internal leaning or in
philosophy is more like that.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,880
Yeah. I think socially I
lean more left like socially,

22
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:16,560
like in terms of like welfare
and things along those lines.

23
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:21,540
And you know, obviously this, um,
protected status is driving me crazy.

24
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,000
This, this thing that
Trump's doing with, um, uh,

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,810
children that were born in this country
are born in other countries and then

26
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,390
brought over here as children and then
they're talking about deporting them.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
That drives me fucking crazy.

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,160
That kind of the hard right version
of that is despicable. This,

29
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,790
these people that I see online, like why
didn't they apply for citizenship? Oh,

30
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,550
who knows? Maybe because
they're fucking 13. You know,

31
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:45,600
like you out there applying for
citizenship if you were 13. No, I mean,

32
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:46,470
when you're 13 years old,

33
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,320
you're playing games and hanging out with
your friends and then you find out you

34
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,780
were born in Guatemala and
you're like, what? I'm like,

35
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:55,320
you have to go back to Guatemala.
What? Yeah, it's crazy.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,250
I lean way left when it comes
to those kinds of things.

37
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,360
Gay Rights and things like, um, you know,

38
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:07,530
a social programs for disenfranchised
people and disenfranchise communities.

39
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,650
I W I lean way, like if I want
my tax dollars to go to anything,

40
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,350
I want it to go to making
people's lives easier,

41
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,870
whether it's socialized
medicine or whatever.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Whatever we could do to make people like
have an easier path to success and to

43
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:27,030
not have them so burdened down by their
environment and their circumstances.

44
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,200
That I think is like our responsibility
as human beings to try to,

45
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,050
I don't want to say even the playing
field because there's never going to be an

46
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:37,680
even playing field, but to give
people opportunity, that's it.

47
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:41,520
Just give people an opportunity to do
well and not have it so completely stacked

48
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:45,840
against them. So in that sense, I'm
not very conservative in that way.

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,640
Like I'm not one of those pull yourself
up by your bootstraps thing because

50
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:52,730
that's just, that's so
delusional. Like some people are
just fucked, you know, they,

51
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:53,260
you know,
they,

52
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,260
they're born with a terrible hand and
it would be nice if more of us were

53
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:00,610
charitable that regard,
you know?

54
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,450
And some people think that that charity
should be a personal issue and that we

55
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,570
should all just do it. You know, as
part of our community and our society,

56
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,940
maybe that's a good argument and,

57
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,140
but maybe the argument is
that our government should
be a part of our community,

58
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,790
you know, and that we should
think about it that way.

59
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:16,950
Instead of thinking of it as,
as,

60
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,370
as this overlord that decides and
designates where our money should go,

61
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,400
then maybe we should have some more
say in it. It should be some sort of a,

62
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,380
a more, uh, you know,
just, just a, a more,

63
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
uh, more kind approach. So in that
sense, I leaned pretty far left,

64
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,110
but I'm also pretty
pragmatic, you know, and I,

65
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,020
and I also know that if
you give people too much,

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,650
it's like sort of that winning
lottery ticket thing or that

67
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
you know,
that

68
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,980
if you, if you make things too easy
for people, they don't try hard.

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,440
It's just a natural part of human nature.
So in that sense,

70
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:57,560
some conservative and a lot of ways,
yeah,

71
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,400
you definitely need some sort of safety
net and to ensure that people can

72
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:02,840
actually achieve the American dream.

73
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,350
I'm like,
I'm,

74
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,670
I've been bleeding more and more towards
universal basic income than anything.

75
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,940
I think universal basic
income at a certain point
that look good enough that you

76
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:17,890
can just eat and survive and then maybe
that would open up a lot more people to

77
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,220
pursuing dreams to going after
things. I mean, I don't, I don't know.

78
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,810
I mean there's arguments for and against

79
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,430
and I think it's debatable. It'll
be interesting to see, you know,

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,540
Finland I think was proposing start this
because we don't really know what will

81
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,810
happen.
Right.

82
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,400
And maybe people will start doing their
hobbies and really find their passion.

83
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,710
Maybe they'll just sit at home and
watch TV and die. Yeah. I, it's really,

84
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,940
these are the problems that we as
a society we'll have to overcome.

85
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:51,200
And of course these are just
first world problems, but that's,

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,100
that will be what the world is like.
There was another country today.

87
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,990
I read about it on Google,
uh,

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,610
another country today that's
considering a universal basic income,

89
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,830
but fucking, what was it? South Korea.

90
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,930
Oh really?
Um,

91
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,670
see if he could find it. It's,
it's Scotland. Is that what it was?

92
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,253
Hmm.

93
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,910
Um, I think there's many,
many people that are, I mean,

94
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,510
Elon Musk has been promoting this lately.
Scotland will be game funding,

95
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:26,900
universal basic income experiments.
Yeah. Hawaii. That's what it was.

96
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,820
Hawaii considers universal basic
income as robot scene, stealing jobs,

97
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:36,770
fucking robots running around the streets,
stealing jobs. Yeah. It's Hawaii. Um,

98
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,460
I think there is some real
arguments to be made and I think,

99
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:47,300
um, Elon Musk, who is of course
a part of this automated,

100
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,560
uh, car revolution and he's,
uh, he's creating these,

101
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,870
these trucks that they're gonna start
using to haul things and they're going to

102
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:00,010
be, and it's going to remove
a lot of jobs and they're,

103
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:02,750
they're starting to talk about
universal basic income is, you know,

104
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,740
a real solution to that. I mean,
it's entirely possible. It's,

105
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,490
it's certainly an argument, you know,
it's certainly worth discussing.

106
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,250
Yeah.
Something like that.

107
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,450
And hopefully the incentives will be
better than some of the current welfare

108
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:21,470
systems where, you know, you're not
incentivize to get off of it. Yeah.

109
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,371
If you start working,

110
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:27,371
then you'll lose all of it while universal
basic income can be made such that

111
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,410
you start working on,
then you'll lose a little bit.

112
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:34,850
But it's never an actual
incentive to not work. Yes. Right.

113
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,460
It's not an incentive to not
work, but it's an, it's a

114
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,210
gives you food and shelter. Right.
So then you could go pursue a dream,

115
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,010
which I think it would be
wonderful. I mean, look,

116
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,640
if there's anything that our tax
dollars should be going towards,

117
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,860
it's creating less losers, right? Less
people feel disenfranchised by the system.

118
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,330
You know, if you're, if you're, if
you can pay x amount of tax dollars,

119
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:03,331
but live in an exponentially more safe
and friendly and happy environment,

120
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,800
I think most people would be leaning
towards that. I think it would.

121
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,290
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and we'll
see this, we see it too. And um,

122
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,990
people that start companies where
it's a huge risk to start a company.

123
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:15,890
Most people fail.

124
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,400
And most entrepreneurs in silicon
valley are men who are much more,

125
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:26,480
uh, willing to take risks. But if we
do have some sort of strong safety net,

126
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,630
then it won't be so bad if you fail,

127
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,160
and maybe that'll help address some of
the gender gap too. That's interesting.

128
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,280
[inaudible]
okay.
