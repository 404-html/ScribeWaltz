1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,210
You know, um, yeah.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,770
Well there's a,

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:09,340
there's a movement going on in this
country right now that the social justice

4
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:11,440
movement and a,

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,770
it leans in that direction that people
don't want to look at things for how they

6
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:19,000
are. They want to look at
things for how they want them

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,820
to be. Yeah. That just,
I just don't understand.

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,380
You cannot

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,950
legislate that everything is going to be
equal for everybody because everybody's

10
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,540
not equal. I'm sorry. They're not equal.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,740
They may be equal in terms of
their value as a human being. Yes.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,300
But they're not equal in math skills.
They're not equal in how fast they run.

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,470
They're not equal in creativity. They're
not equal. Everybody has their own value,

14
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:51,870
but that doesn't mean they're marketable.

15
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:56,871
Skills in an open society and an
open market are going to be the same

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,660
now. It's ridiculous. I used to,

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,750
I had a joke on one of my special
sauce two specials ago about, uh,

18
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,260
there was a story about a woman
who was guarding the White House.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,310
She was the lone guard at one of the doors
of the White House and some crazy man

20
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:13,720
broke in and knocked her to the ground
and just ran through the White House and

21
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:16,900
he was running around inside the White
House for like three minutes before they

22
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,210
finally some off duty.
Uh,

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,890
a secret service agent tackled this guy.
He saw like, what the fuck is going on?

24
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:25,690
This guy's running through the
White House, tackle this guy.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,960
And that the joke was that people think
that a woman can do everything a man can

26
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:35,860
do. I go, a woman could do
everything a man could do.
Is that true? And some woman,

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,040
it was in the crowd of the comedy
store is like, yes. I go, well,

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,990
that doesn't make any fucking sense.

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,980
Here's why it doesn't make
any sense because a man
can't do everything a man can

30
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,480
do. I go, look,

31
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,630
I've met Shaquille O'Neal and his Dick
is where my face is and if the White

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,740
House's is experiencing a Shaq attack,

33
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,970
I'm the wrong person saved the world
because he's just going to run right over

34
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:02,830
me. I go, but if my wife and kid
where garden, the White House,

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,220
guess what I'm getting in?
Okay. I love my family,

36
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,340
but if it's between me and get it,

37
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,050
there's no way they're going to be
able to stop me. I loved them to death,

38
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:15,280
but I'm a man and they're women and if
there's a woman garden, the White House,

39
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:19,420
I don't care who she is, I'll fuck her up.
It's not going to happen. This is crazy.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,380
But this,

41
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,380
someone had this idea that they would
put a woman in charge of a very physical

42
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:28,330
job.

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,100
You should have a giant man with a
violent temper and he should be armed.

44
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,810
Okay. Cause this is the guy that's keeping
bad people from the fucking president.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,360
Yeah. I don't know. I don't understand.

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,630
It just seems like you got to
find your own lane. I mean, yeah.

47
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,250
You don't want to put me in the NBA.

48
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,440
Yeah. Physical things in particular. And
then there's also mental things. Look,

49
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,600
I suck at math. Okay. If, if, if
everyone has a chance to work at CERN,

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,150
right? Everyone has a chance
to work at the large Hadron,

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,480
including people that have
no idea about physics.

52
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,180
We're gonna have a real time
making these equations work.

53
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,510
Yeah, that's what I mean about
finding your own lane. Yeah. Cue.

54
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,970
I can't add two and two and get five
every time. I'm just not good at math,

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,010
but I'm good with words. I can talk, I
can read fast and I can comprehend well,

56
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,200
but I am not good with math,

57
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,240
so I got myself into a lane where I
talk for a living. I read, I talk,

58
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:26,490
I, it's qualitative, not quantitative.

59
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,450
I can accept that I'm not suited for that.

60
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,660
I mean w w I don't feel bad
about myself because of that.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,550
Well, once you do something
and you're good at it,

62
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:37,530
you can accept not being
good at other things.

63
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:40,020
It's much easier if you find
the thing that you're good at,

64
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:44,310
whether it's gymnastics or singing
or painting, whatever the fuck it is.

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,490
If you could find a thing that
you're good at, it will make you,

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,840
it'll give you a s a feeling of self
worth and you won't need to be good at

67
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:55,770
everything you can accept and you can
enjoy other people being good at things as

68
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:56,604
well.

69
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,730
Yeah.
I shared earlier,

70
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,540
my dad was an alcoholic and I would
compare myself to that kid across cause I

71
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,920
had a damaged personal truth.

72
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,560
But I found a currency because at that
time in my life I was a pretty decent

73
00:04:09,561 --> 00:04:13,780
athlete for this small school I was
going to. So that was my currency. Yeah.

74
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,100
So now it didn't matter what was happening
at home because I got strokes for

75
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,850
being able to jump high and run fast
at school. So that became my currency.

76
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,930
So now well I compared myself to him.
Okay,

77
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:30,410
maybe my home life wasn't as good as his,
but I could run faster and jump higher.

78
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:34,740
So that became my currency.
So now I, okay. That level,

79
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,910
the playing field for me and
you all would like you said,

80
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,570
fine what you're good at at a given
time and do what you're good at.

81
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,130
Find something you love,

82
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:45,860
find something you're passionate
about and they can also excel at.

83
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,580
And if you can work it out where it's
your vocation and your avocation,

84
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,710
you love doing it and you get paid for it,

85
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,980
then you're just double blessed and
then you got it right because you enjoy

86
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:57,200
doing this and it works
out and that's good. Yeah.

87
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:01,700
You catch lucky breaks if the
image, but that's, boy that's lucky.

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah it is.

89
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,840
And if I just think if you're
in your life and theirs,

90
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,470
you don't have something that
you're passionate about. I mean,

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,160
and I don't mean that in a cliche way.

92
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,260
If there's not something where you wake
up every day and there's nothing in your

93
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:25,100
life that you're excited to do,
man,

94
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,280
you need to go back to the
drawing board. Yeah. Cause if,

95
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:33,370
if all you're doing is just grinding
it out, you get up everyday,

96
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,470
go to a job you don't like do task you
don't care to do and come home to a home

97
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:43,370
you don't want to come home to and wait
to get them to do it again the next day

98
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,700
you're burning daylight.
What the hell existence is that I just,

99
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,750
I don't, I don't understand
that, that find something.

100
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,870
I don't care if it's gardening or
music or art or athletics or something.

101
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,580
Find something you're excited to do.
Yeah.

102
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,750
Expose yourself to different things with
that very purpose of finding something

103
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,840
that you love because their assumption
out there, there's something out there.

104
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:13,790
I guarantee you something. Yeah. There's
something healthy. It's not illegal.

105
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,710
It's not going to be high risk.

106
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:19,610
There's something you can do that's not
going to kill you or put you in jail

107
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,800
that you can be excited about.
Yeah. And I think it's, uh,

108
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,410
one of the most important things to do
when you're a parent is to try to expose

109
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:31,040
your kid to as many different things as
possible to find those things for them.

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,320
Yeah. I got two boys, as you know,
and you know, one of them really well,

111
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,410
and I did that growing up because my dad
never took me hunting a single day in

112
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,600
his life. He never took me
fishing a single day in his life.

113
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:49,130
He never took me camping a single day in
his life. He never took me to the lake.

114
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,990
He never took me skiing,
boating, anything.

115
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:54,920
So I took them to all of
those things I had no,

116
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,480
I had no clue what I was doing,
but I took him Turkey hunting,

117
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:04,460
duck hunting, deer hunting, she's
skiing, snow skiing, camping.

118
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,410
I did it all.
And to see what they like,

119
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,870
let them pick.
And boy,

120
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,700
when you don't know what you're
doing as a dad, that's a bitch.

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,750
Yeah. I mean, just little things like you,

122
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:24,620
you go camping and you don't realize that
sitting in your tent up on the side of

123
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:28,310
a hill,
even if it's like eight or 10 degrees,

124
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,200
is a bad idea. You've got to get on flat
ground. I mean, it looks flat to me,

125
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:36,110
but I spent the night try
not to roll down a damn hill.

126
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,570
It didn't look like it was on a slant,
but it was,

127
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,210
but you figure these
things out as you go along.

128
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:45,800
But I was glad I gave him those
experiences so they could choose.

129
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,530
And they did. And they, and there's some
of it they liked, some of it they didn't.
