00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,900
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,640
Oh d is this him again?
Again,

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,690
I wonder what year this was kind of just
trying to remember trying to number one,

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:16,691
the UFC brought back to 155 pound title
cause for a long time one 17 was the

5
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,670
lightest weight you could fly. You got
to give this to credit for his entrance.

6
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:23,300
Is it a lot of this? He obviously
does a lot of work, Huh?

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,530
Man Miller had a great one once he had
like a bunch of dancers behind him and

8
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:32,250
shit. He had a whole
choreographed entrance when he
fought in pride. I like that.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,310
I mean he always had ridiculous entrances.
I don't know what was that?

10
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:40,970
What his ski mask he was, what
was that? Anybody stealing money.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,840
Anybody who ever questions whether
or not may him was a good fighter.

12
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,040
Cause you know, may have had some hard
times and getting a little nutty lately.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,050
But if you go back to why and mayhem
fought saccharide no, not soccer.

14
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:57,200
I soccer in pride dude.

15
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:00,470
He smashed Sakharova smashed and went
right through them and submitted them.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,190
Really? Ooh. Yeah, pull it up
Jamie. See if you can find it.

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,040
It's already lost some
disqualification, ma'am. Yeah.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,260
In the UFC and pride. Did he lose
one by disqualification? Boy,

19
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:16,250
I don't remember that. Did he? I Dunno.
I didn't see it. It was like on his,

20
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,940
this is his dream and just, Oh, there's
this was dream. This wasn't pride.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,190
Wow. That's great. School
girl outfits. Come on.

22
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,260
How do you not love this?
Awesome.

23
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,710
No ma'ams had some tough times, but he's
always been cool to me. I liked that guy.

24
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:37,490
I love him. I see him. He comes out to my
shows when I do Irvine. He's a good man.

25
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:41,030
He's a great guy. I mean, he's got some
problems and you know, he was always,

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,990
he was always a extraordinarily
nutty dude. You know?

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,120
He did the MTV show for awhile,
by the way.

28
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:49,850
I ended up binge watching that
one day and watching dudes.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,050
Fuck all you guys who don't know how to
fight. Yeah, it's amazing. You know what?

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,090
I remember one time when we were in
Australia for the fights years ago,

31
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,960
a rampage was there and I guess
those two are good friends.

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,980
So I was going from like different areas
in like this mini group with rampage

33
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:12,140
and every time somebody
wanted a picture with him,

34
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,350
they put their arm around is like,
you know,

35
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,760
like around their shoulder and
anytime he would throw their arm off,

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,890
get your fucking arm off.
And they were like, okay.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,230
Then they'd be like scared for
their picture. Like Huh, like that.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,680
So we're going like,
that was ramping up,

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,300
ramping up by the way.
I look,

40
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,710
people pinch my nipples and pictures
with me and pages and pleasure.

41
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,620
So I'm sitting like,
so I witnessed that that like

42
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,130
10 times. And then we moved to like some
bar somewhere. And you know, there's like,

43
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,170
I dunno if he's like roped
off people over here.

44
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,160
There's a lot of people in the place,

45
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:51,161
but it's like a small group like this
and brand pages here and may him comes up

46
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,740
and I don't know that they know each,
I don't know the relationship.

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,560
And he immediately grabs him by the
throat because like, I'm gonna kill you.

48
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,140
But the for the,
for a split second,

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,040
I saw like all this just split,
like violence come into random.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,200
I was like, he was about to fucking murder
someone and then I saw it disappeared.

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,980
He saw him. He was like, you
crazy guys, white boy. But
like for for a quick second,

52
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,440
he turned like just to break them in half.
And I was like,

53
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:23,120
it was more terrifying than any fight
I'd seen. Rampage is a beast. Yeah.

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,950
That cinder block on his shoulders.
That head is oh, crack too. Yeah.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,750
It's so hard.
Rampage had some epic fights in pride too.

56
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,670
Before you ever even came to the UFC.

57
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,650
He has the all time greatest
slam knockout over all time.

58
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,920
Greatest and the triangle.
Yeah. Oh, in a triangle.

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Smashes him down to the ground and
what the fuck was the guy's name?

60
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,870
But he fought very good, uh, rampage and
a triangle rollout. Ricardo Romo stood up.

61
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,990
He, I'm going to fuck the guy
still had his legs around him.

62
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:57,930
He just picked him up. And then,
yeah, this is like, this is,

63
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,160
the dude went for the triangle,
but he was elevated and like watch,

64
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,370
go find the video.
In the video,

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,720
he went for the triangle
and rampage elevated like he
lifted him up and the dude

66
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,140
held onto the triangle, which
you just can't do. You got to,

67
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,400
you got to let it go at this point.
See when he's up like that,

68
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,390
you got to let go of the chart.
Oh my God.

69
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,970
Slam chaos is the greatest slam Kao ever
in the history of sport and he had them

70
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,100
around. Let's look at this. It's
like a pillow Glam to Daniel's.

71
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,260
Him with his head too. It looks like he
headbutted his face. Yup. He did that.

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,200
He actually got his eyebrow cut.

73
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,610
I mean this dude was just dead on the
way down. Watch, look, go right there,

74
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,830
right? Well, yeah.

75
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,560
I mean he just got fucking k. Oh,
did, did, did, did, did, did. It did.

76
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,040
This is the worst slam I've
ever seen in my life at all.

77
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,840
My years of watching fights.
God, yeah. I've never seen it.

78
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,670
Never seen anything more brutal, man.
I would love to see them do that.

79
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:58,780
The bird by bird. I'm just to
see it. Just to say it. Yeah.

80
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,860
But I can't take that kind of impact, man.
No, no. Around, it was never the same.

81
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:07,600
No more tickets, man. Growing
up. It's never the same after.

82
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,690
Never a runner. Was it like a
serious contender before that? Fine.

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,570
Kate sent me once in the, uh, in
that, in that gym that was downtown.

84
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:17,050
They had a little of one of that to show
companies the tap. I'll blaze. Nope,

85
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,520
the one, the Anderson's manager.
Oh, Yay. A black house. Yeah.
Yeah. And He, I was like,

86
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,031
I'm going to slam.

87
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,150
Looks like it was going to a light
one that was out for a long time.

88
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,230
You were not knocked out. I mean, like,
I couldn't like move. Right. Oh really?

89
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:32,920
He picked you up. He just left. He's
like, that's just a light. Like, yeah,

90
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:37,140
you got to learn how to fall before you do
that. I liked to him not to. Yeah, it's,

91
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,140
you got to kind of, as you go
back, you kind of like relaxing,

92
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,440
kind of slap the mat to dissipate
some of the energy for the real back.

93
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,650
Ever watch judo guys the role and as a
role rolling back, they slap the mat.

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,620
It's like a big, as loud
as shit. Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,970
It literally helps relieve some of the
energy of you hitting the ground is also

96
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,400
like relaxing,
knowing how to roll.

97
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,380
Okay.
