1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,800
Does the exercise work
better or the same as work?

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,880
Like for managing depression?
Uh, the workout is maintenance.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,050
It doesn't achieve much, but I achieved
the workout. But do you feel like the,

5
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:21,690
the endorphin release, does that
help you yet? Yeah, it does. And I,

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,180
as the Buddhist say I made merit.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,520
I went in there and did my time on the
treadmill. I don't want to be there,

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,050
you know, like this, like
the last 15 minutes. I don't,

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,740
I'd rather be somewhere else like, Yo,
it's cool. You'll be fine. Sit Down,

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,370
do your work.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,930
That's why before the podcast how
suggesting hot yoga to you and you,

12
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:46,200
you seem to be very stiff lately. You've
got some injuries and some things back.

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,090
Yeah. Dude, I'm telling you that'll fix
a lot of that shit. It'll really, yeah,

14
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:54,540
I know you, you have, you have
a great workout diversity. You,

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,460
when you and I were talking before we
were at your place and you said some

16
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:02,970
mornings you feel like training this
way and you'll go to that gym or you'll

17
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,550
train plug would judo or whatever.

18
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,260
And then the next day it's
going to be kettle bells,

19
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,640
so you really like to mix it up.

20
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:12,270
I think it's good for a body to always
be guessing what's coming next. Yeah,

21
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,090
I think that's important. I also, I,

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,140
there's some things that
are really have to do.

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,240
I think I need at least one day of hard
cardio a week and I think I need at

24
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,550
least one day of hard
lifting weights a week,

25
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,480
but I also think I need at least one
day of yoga. We can at least yogas.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,900
To me it's one of the most important
things that I do because for that 90

27
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:34,470
minutes I can't go anywhere. I don't
touch, my phone's on in the room with me.

28
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,270
It was just me and a a jug of water and
the Yoga Mat and the class and a bunch

29
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:43,230
of old ladies that are kicking my ass.
These old ladies are fucking tough man.

30
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,060
This is old lady.
She goes to this workout class.

31
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:47,190
May I see you there all the time.

32
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:52,080
She's got to be close to 70 she doesn't
even bring water. She just Tufts it out.

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,490
She's there for 90 minutes,

34
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,690
sweating and grunting through the postures
and those lie you do in an hour and a

35
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,860
half class,
those last 20 minutes in a 104 degrees,

36
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,900
it's so hard to get through,

37
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,230
but when you get through you
just feel like you feel better.

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,980
I just almost like can't while I'm in it,
I can't wait to do it again.

39
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,190
Like while I'm struggling and I was
like, God, I need to do more than this.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,830
I need to do this more often rather
I can't wait to do this again.

41
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,980
I always feel that and it
just lengthens everything.

42
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,620
Like all the back things
and the leg things,

43
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,730
the hamstring things just
stretches everything out
and lengthens it and all the

44
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,571
tension.

45
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,890
It just straightens it out and loosens
it up and I just feel like for a guy like

46
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:34,800
you or I who does a lot of a lot of like,

47
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,870
especially like you still
a lot of heavy lifting,

48
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:38,790
you were saying a lot of
dead lifts and squats.

49
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,420
This is the antidote for all that
stuff, right? It's deep compression and,

50
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,940
and for your body maintenance,
it's just phenomenal.

51
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:48,600
Probably let's loose the lactic acid
out of your muscle tissue. Yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,020
You know, here's what I've observed.
You know, I live in Los Angeles,

53
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,770
so there's a lot of yoga people,
but you know,

54
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,560
I know them because they have a mat.
But you could also see how they walk,

55
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,650
how they sit. There's
so in their body. Yeah.

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,190
And there is a grace to,
you know,

57
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm not trying to put
anyone in the pejorative,

58
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,000
but a yoga person where there's
not only are the limber,

59
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:18,001
they're just really okay though
this their body articulation,

60
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:23,050
you're like, okay, I don't have that.
I'm a Herky Jerky, uncoordinated person.

61
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,930
But there is a,
uh,

62
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,440
uh hum coming from that
person's overall body. It just,

63
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,610
it's a beautiful machine.

64
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,130
The way they articulate
themselves and the way these sit.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,630
And why unusual balance. The balance of
like you can tell someone who does it,

66
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:42,370
they have that and it's not subtle. I
recognize that you would love it, man.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,130
You know what?
You would love it cause it fucking sucks.

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,210
And while you're doing it, man, you
have the internal dialogues, crazy.

69
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,980
You want to bolt where you want a ball,

70
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,700
but you also start going over your life
and your mind and dealing with all your

71
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,120
bullshit and your to do list and
all the things you're, you're,

72
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,950
you're doing it wrong or slacking.

73
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,110
There's something about really struggling
in these static positions for like a

74
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,450
minute where you're trying to like
hold your leg up there and your sweat.

75
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,440
Sweat is literally pouring
off your arms and your head.

76
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:15,430
And there's something about that man
that it's just really cleansing it just

77
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,310
really empty.

78
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,540
I just think it's a thing that you're
missing that you would really love if you

79
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:19,990
try it.

80
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,930
I bet if you did it and they came back
and we did a podcast year later and be

81
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:26,350
like, fuck you. Oh God, I fucking
love it. It's changed my life.

82
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,900
It's changed my life.
I know a lot of fighters,

83
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,740
a lot of people who like are hectic
for living. Yup. They're yoga people.

84
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,210
And like in the 70s you say yoga, so it
was going to punch you like yoga. Wham.

85
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,760
Well, you know what I found out about
it. How do you know Hixon Gracie is,

86
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,530
are we talking about the Gracie
family? Well, the family hoists,

87
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,870
Gracie is the most famous because he's
probably the most important figure ever

88
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,840
in the history of martial arts because
he won the first ultimate fighting

89
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,590
championship and showed that a small
man could actually beat larger men with

90
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,730
technique and skill.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well his brother is Hickson
and his brother is like
universally regarded as one

92
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,660
of the greatest Jujitsu guys if
not the greatest of all time.

93
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,480
And he was different than everybody
else and that he did yoga.

94
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,430
Like his thing was like, I'd never heard
of a martial artist that got into yoga,

95
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:20,050
but Hixon would do these breathing
exercises and they do these balance beam

96
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,370
exercises and he was always doing yoga
and stretching and that was a giant part

97
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:29,371
of his workout and he was above and
beyond everyone else in his time period.

98
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:34,420
Like in the 90s everyone was scared
of Hixon. He was the man. I mean,

99
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,280
but it wasn't like there was any debate.

100
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,260
It's very rare that you get something
that is so a antagonistic and so tightly

101
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:44,920
contested as two men using
martial arts techniques,

102
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:49,921
trying to strangle each other and one
guy stands above all by such a large

103
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,580
margin and that was Hickson.

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,550
And I really do believe that
part of it was his mind.

105
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,260
Part of it was his physicality,

106
00:05:56,261 --> 00:06:01,010
but a lot of that physicality was enhanced
by his dedication to Yoga, Huh? Yeah.

107
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,150
He's a legit Yogi.

108
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:05,810
Like he does that fire breathing shit
where he sucks his stomach in in that

109
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,740
weird way and has it move up
and down. Wow. You ever see
somebody to do that? Yeah,

110
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,740
he does that like a, like
a real yogi look. It's,

111
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,630
it's a real trip and I
think because of his,

112
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,720
uh, his, his, his like physical like
you could see you there. He's good.

113
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,380
He's got this video here. You could
see him do this fire-breathing Shit.

114
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,320
Like watch what he does this stomach
cause it's kind of fucking crazy.

115
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,520
He sucks his stomach way, way,
way up deep into his rib cage.

116
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,360
He does this breath of fire
thing and then as it gets going,

117
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,130
he starts pumping is look here, you
see if you pull it up there, Jamie,

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,870
the part where he starts to do it,
they'll look at this. Wow. Yeah.

119
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,920
Like what the fuck? Isn't
that insane? Yeah. It's crazy.

120
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,210
And this is one of the things.
He has a dominant all muscle control.

121
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,570
Droopy. You never try and articulate,
make it do anything. Yeah. Well He,

122
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,780
you know, he'd practice yoga
for a long, long, long time.

123
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:07,370
And because of that he had this phenomenal
core strength and phenomenal balance

124
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,460
and he just had a giant
advantage over everyone else.

125
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,670
And I think a lot of
that advantage was his,

126
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,570
his ability to move his body
was different, but it also,

127
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,960
just for a guy like you that's been
just lifting weights for so long,

128
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,610
it's the perfect antidote for your body.
It's like your body will react to like,

129
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,870
oh yeah, stretch this out.
Thank you. Thank you. Have
been asking for this. Yeah,

130
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,250
but Linkedin, this, hold that pose. This
is instead of just lifted something raw,

131
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,680
you know,
which is like what men like to do.

132
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,280
Instead of that you're holding your arms
out, they're like, dad, you're like, fuck,

133
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:44,220
I don't even have any weight
in these things and I want
to drop them. Yeah. I've,

134
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:45,320
I did a,
you know,

135
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,230
every once in a while I've worked out
with someone else and they go, okay,

136
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,720
we're going to do this and this and that.
You work with and then you let them,

137
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,800
you let yourself be trained. Yeah. And
I've done a few workouts like, okay,

138
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,500
I'm going to kill you. I'm like,
okay, well what does that mean?

139
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:58,970
Like by the end of this,

140
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:02,540
you won't be able to take your
shirt off to change and I've done,

141
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,880
you know where you're benching
this much then this much,

142
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:09,770
then this what you need to do like 150
reps and by the time you can't lift the

143
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:14,630
bar and you can't lift your arms, you're
literally trembling from exhaustion.

144
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,150
And I've told that to
people. They go, that's yoga.

145
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,250
You will tremble from exhaustion.
Yeah.

146
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,550
And you'll be so happy when you leave
because of how good you feel and you can't

147
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:27,360
wait to go back and you won't
blow your joints out. Yeah.

148
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,170
The way you will with
weightlifting. I already have. Yeah.

149
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,330
There's no way around it.
I've paid.

150
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,550
Okay.
Okay.
