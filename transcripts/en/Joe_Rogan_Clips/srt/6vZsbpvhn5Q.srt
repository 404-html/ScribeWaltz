Hello Freak bitches believe
what's on salon.com. Look,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,940
it's impossible to believe those things
in good faith because you have to lie to

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:09,161
make the,

4
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:11,430
you have to lie so much to yourself
and to others in order to make those

5
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:15,450
arguments that I just, it is one
long practical joke. That site,

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,730
it is just a gigantic,
it's the same time.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,330
I'm convinced it's funded by the Koch
brothers to discredit a liberalism.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,240
I'm convinced, absolutely
convinced. If you trace,

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,790
if you trace the sell on money
back far enough, you will discover,

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,850
you will discover the surname coke
because it is the only explanation for how

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,840
badly sal on discredits progressivism
is the only exposure just today they

12
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,180
published another editorial
from this fucking pedophile. Um,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,900
you know who I wrote about and he wouldn't
even dare bring my name up because

14
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,660
he's too scared to get into it with
me cause he knows he lose. I probably,

15
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,330
you know, he published this thing
about how, you know, I'm a Peter Farb,

16
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,350
I don't act on it right after
I'd exposed a pedophile,

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,060
Sarah Nyberg in Gamer Gate, right.
And it went all over the world.

18
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:57,800
And it was a huge story that I broke
the, hold on, I'm going to stop coming.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,610
I exposed this file, I expose
this pedophile, you know,

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,920
she was backed up and they double
all the social justice warriors.

21
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,620
Doubledown protected her. She
was, you know, on message.

22
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,750
Basically she had the right politics.
So they stuck a kiddy fiddler.

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,890
This is the state of the modern left
directly after that with a coincidental

24
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:17,340
timing salon publishes this thing by a
pedophile saying, oh, well my pit of hell,

25
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:20,580
but I don't act on it. Which is precisely
the defense that this person's used.

26
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,350
So I respond and I, you know,
and I assume, and I did a,

27
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,650
I did a very good piece of knowing I
urge all of your listeners to seek it out

28
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:32,760
because it really is excellent journalism.
Um, yeah, it was called something like,

29
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:34,590
this is why the left.
This is why liberals,

30
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,660
this is why progressive's
stick up for Peter Falls,

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,350
explains why pdf files can get
away with this stuff and why,

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,010
why progressives and liberals back
then, um, you think people back,

33
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,600
pedophiles who backs poor,

34
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,250
they're making excuses for them as
they make excuses for them as San Juan,

35
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:52,170
just today,

36
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,920
today they gave us space to this guy
who was a pedophile about whom there is

37
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,930
horrific stuff online, which hasn't
come out yet, which you know,

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,890
you should watch this space for that.

39
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,670
Cause I know Steven Crowder knows about
some of it instead of why, um, excuse me.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,010
Uh, you should, you should
just go, who wrote this?

41
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,340
Did he get a second PA under his own name?

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,380
This is how brazen now wrote a second
piece for salon today playing the victim

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,310
saying that he came out as a pdf file and
he's been subjected to right wing hate

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,170
so that he says this is
the right [inaudible]

45
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,670
I'm a creator fall and I, I think so.
I'm a pedophile and I don't act on it.

46
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,990
And I did this like peace and everyone
like came out and said that it was really

47
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,840
supportive and it was really great and
they tell people to get through their own

48
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:37,020
experiences and everyone's
really sympathetic except
the right wing hate machine

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,060
meaning me, whether he didn't
dare mention me by name. Um,

50
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,330
who are the white right wing hate machine,
well apparent according to him. Um,

51
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,740
you know,
uh,

52
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,020
exit the right wing hate machine had
the temerity to say we think paedophilia

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,430
his role and why you sell on giving a
platform for it to this guy when there's

54
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,100
so much dirt on the Internet suggesting
that he is physically touched young

55
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:59,680
girls for example. Um, you
know, and I'm going to put yeah,

56
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:04,480
there is a completely different argument.
Well this is the thing, it's so long.

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,460
Gave a platform to this guy in San
Juan ought to have known about this

58
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,360
allegation.
If you're going to,

59
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,320
if you're going to make space on your
platform for a self confessed pedophile

60
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,570
and you will,
you will only find this on the left.

61
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,890
This is what I mean by the left.
Sticking up for a bit of,

62
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,550
I was there making excuses when
they tried to legitimize them.

63
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,750
They tried to give it,
they tried to habilitate this as um,

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,590
as an unfortunate sexual
orientation rather than, you know,

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,250
these people being dangerous predators
that we need to be protected from.

66
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,760
But I've never seen that.

67
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:32,380
But you're saying it's all I've seen is
where this guy's just discussing this.

68
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,800
But no,
honestly all bullshit aside,

69
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:39,310
like psychologists and sociologists and
neuroscientists have tried to figure out

70
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,280
what it is that causes
someone to have these desires.

71
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,440
But we know from the transgender debate,
the left doesn't care about that.

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,110
What it cares about is who can,
you know who,

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,180
where it can place people
in the oppression Olympics
and the victim hierarchy

74
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,800
and pet. If I'm telling you I'm
warning you now, that is the worry.

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,910
I'm warning you now is
that as the header files,

76
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,000
pedophiles are going to be the next.
Transgender has been one. Now they've won.

77
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,890
They've won that battle. It's over. Um,
do you think so? Yes, absolutely. Stay.

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,020
It's done and dusted.
We lost by we,

79
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:07,900
I mean people who actually wanted
to find out what the science said.

80
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,750
Two is simply telling people lies
born this way is a lie. And you know,

81
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,090
because if you're a true
story with some of them,

82
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,600
nobody that's holding the signs because
most of the ones holding the signs,

83
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:23,030
the militant homosexuals are the ones
that chose to be gay to get it. People

84
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,880
uh, do, do you have like
debates with gay people?

85
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,610
Well is willing to bait me
because they know they'll lose.

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,310
Well they've got woman brains.
They're not very good at logic brains.

87
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,620
I'm just kidding.
You accuse me trolling earlier.

88
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,470
So I thought I'd better get about 72 to
live up to the reputation. Certainly do.

89
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:46,170
And you're also very aware that uh,
you, you are right wing views and the,

90
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,690
those kind of a little bit
of a right wing Ben to you.

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,930
You talk about conservatives
dress to wear a suit and tie this,

92
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,330
this right from your suit tie.

93
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,830
Like a good way to align yourself in the
club is you have to espouse Christian

94
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,270
values or talking about being Christian.

95
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,260
Give us stuff about what the conservative
establishment thinks of me. If I did,

96
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:11,140
my career would have turned out
very differently. I've, I, you know,

97
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,460
I would have chosen a very different path
through my professional life. You know,

98
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,570
I was at the Telegraph and it,
you know,

99
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,220
the most respectable establishment
newspaper in England, uh,

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,400
eight years ago if I'd want it
to be, you know, a sign of the,

101
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,280
of the conservative Republican
establishment. I could've done that.

102
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,170
I did the exact opposite. I've stuck my
nose up and my middle finger up at the,

103
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,810
at conservatives every available
opportunity. I Bright Pour,

104
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:38,020
pour Breitbart who put up with
so much from me. You know,

105
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,270
they published Black Dick
Jokes every week for me.

106
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,170
And that is a direct assault on the kind
of stomach churn that the conservative

107
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,940
writers or were said to have
about gay things. Right.

108
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,200
I don't just tell them I'm gay, I tell
them I'm sucking Black Dick, right? I,

109
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,880
you might seem really good column,

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,700
very funny and entertaining
and I'm right about everything.

111
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,340
And that also puts them in
a very interesting place
where they can say, look,

112
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,630
we have a gay guy working for us.

113
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,750
I tend to think probably about gives us
stuff about whether people think that

114
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,180
homophobic or not.
They certainly wouldn't hire me.

115
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,750
The second is do they call everybody?
Buddy does trust me, trust me.

116
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,530
Right, but doesn't care about, doesn't
caffeine, you're homophobic, they're not,

117
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,630
but they don't care if
you do or they would.

118
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:16,940
They care about is is the facts of
what they published and the facts,

119
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,210
what they probably should,
but this was the time I see.

120
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,420
It's so strange is someone who
believes but doesn't practice.

121
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,570
You believe in religion,

122
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,930
but you don't practice any of the things
that that religious bouses especially

123
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,040
the sexual things, but it's the church
brought out the book. You can buy it now,

124
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,820
but it's like a,

125
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,590
well now it got republished a few years
ago by this guy named John Irvin and you,

126
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,910
so you can get a hold of it now,

127
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,180
but for the longest time used to
have to buy it as a used book. Well,

128
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:47,660
I will look it up. Yeah. This one also,
the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Christian myth,

129
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,970
he wrote a second one after
the Catholic Church bought out.

130
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:52,850
The first one stopped production
of it and bought all the books.

131
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,050
That's your people Catholics.
I tried to hide that information.

132
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,250
[inaudible] they last thing they want.
I went to Catholic school,

133
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,250
man for a whole year.
Cured me. Fix me up. Good.

134
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,090
It's where you get you a fine sense
of right and wrong from no wait,

135
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,350
let's not do that well,

136
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,740
right and wrong as far as what is
wrong with you now? I got lucky.

137
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,850
They beat me a little bit.
Lucky you didn't get that taste of no,

138
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,770
I said just like I said earlier,
if it went for Father Michael,

139
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,400
I would have given far less good head.
I mean it was a real father Michael,

140
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,740
so much less. You know, he's,
he's, he's going to get killed now,

141
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:25,820
but who is Father Michael?

142
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,410
I betcha there's a real dude I should
have made you suck his dick for real. Um,

143
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,850
I make me, I was going to ask about
it. I thought my English teacher too.

144
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,120
But how old was he at the time? Um, oh, I
didn't know he was quite young. Quite hot.

145
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Really? Yeah. And so that's where it
all started with Father Michael. No, no.

146
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,410
Is that post the tranny? Yeah,
it was post. So it wasn't like,

147
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:47,330
it wasn't drag queen as a
child or anything like that.
So, uh, it was quite a,

148
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,790
you already had the five someone
when like this is all wrong.

149
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,730
I need to talk to father Michael. He's
like, suck my Dick and shut the fuck up.

150
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,590
And you're like religion as
Aussie. I really, I really
had no hope. Did I? I was,

151
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,210
I was,
I was never going to end well.

152
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,520
Well it seems like you
kept stumbling in a decks

153
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,340
on them through life.

154
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,960
I don't know what would have happened if
a heterosexual man I just been falling

155
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:11,840
on Dix was in the same
circumstances as you early on.

156
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,000
I mean obviously things would
have went very different.

157
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:17,450
So I'm not sure if I buy the nop,
you'd go down great.

158
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,420
And the gay club go down.
Well, I mean, you know,

159
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,310
we have to push the expression. You
go down. Well it ain't already match.

160
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,080
Yeah. So good demo means you would
a, you'd be popular, you go down to,

161
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:33,340
well it would be like the way you
would describe a meal or a drink. Oh,

162
00:08:33,341 --> 00:08:37,230
like it goes down. Well we
like taking the piss. Yeah.

163
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:41,830
It took me a while to get, what the hell
do you want a cup of mind? Yeah. Which,

164
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,390
which again is another thing.
Gay people seem disproportionately into,

165
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,680
they're a peanut on each other.
That seems to be

166
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,030
the Lord only gay to be transgressive.

167
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,970
They choose to be coming up prior
in the gate. She used to be gay,

168
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,480
to be naughty of all know sexual place.

169
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,460
Pray the gale can't.
Full belief Christian values count.

170
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,310
Tear myself away on maybe as
you get older and you know,

171
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,750
drive dries up,
I would've made a good priest.

172
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you think I'm making a good priest?
I think a bit.

173
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,300
Well you make a good priests.

174
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:17,640
If you think the guy that made you
suck his dick was a good priests.

175
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,080
That kind of, he was a great
priest. Honesty, like he
was good. Other than that,

176
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,390
I've never had a better senior tutor.

177
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,700
He was great singing
teacher got notes out of me.

178
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:31,170
I didn't even know I could produce while
he worked. Your plumbing shattering,

179
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,520
the Chandelier's kind of thing,
but was he good outside of what he did?

180
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:39,720
Like was he a good religious scholar?
Was he a good parish priest? I mean,

181
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,790
I just said fucking creep.
Getting his dick suck.

182
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,060
Then it's gonna to get lynched now. How's
it going to get lynched? Does people,

183
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:48,270
do people know who he is? I don't
think so. What's his name? Well,

184
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,890
I'm not saying any, well,
I won't be at the time.

185
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,850
You were a little kid and he
was like, what? You're just
trying, you're trying to,

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,880
was he in his twenties or thirties it's
another yet another feminist strategy

187
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,980
that you have adopted in
addition to your language buddy.

188
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,950
I told you it wasn't the pedophilia.
I was [inaudible].

189
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,320
I was in my teens 14 I was in my teen.
Something like something like that.

190
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,470
That's what you said,
your buddy.

191
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,290
I don't know how they rocket and was
very old England. I was in my teens.

192
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,480
I'm here in my country and
he's saying it right now.

193
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,350
Maybe seen a 15 year old girl at any
point in your life, however old you are,

194
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,560
you've never seen a 15 year ago
thought was off when I was 15 no

195
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,480
dude,

196
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,300
when you were 25 when you were 13 you
will have seen girls about 15 you thought,

197
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:37,490
whoa, whoa. No, you did a
dental book going to be hot,

198
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,060
but he didn't want a fucker.
Bullshit.

199
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,290
You can't tell me what I was born into.

200
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,440
I think if you're 14 when you were
born this way, you're born a Jew in it.

201
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,460
Picker. No, you're trying to
make it so I'm a fucking creeper.

202
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:58,170
Like you know I'm not, I'm not in the
14 year olds. How dare you sir. No,

203
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,470
he's a 14 year old fucking the guy
that you said it's a great guy.

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,670
He was in a 14 year old stick.
It's a terrible person. No,

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,910
surely I was a very mature 14 year old.
Yeah.

206
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,230
Well in your case he got it right.
You got the right guy to molest.

207
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,240
It wasn't molestation.
That's absolutely,

208
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,010
most of the station is
perfectly consensual.

209
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,820
I don't think it is when they're 14 when
I was 14 trust me, I was the predator.

210
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,450
I was the Predator,
the Predator chasing after the crease.

211
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,720
It's to try to stay close to God.
Everybody I was,

212
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,890
I was aggressively seeking out sexual
company of adults because I knew it would

213
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,260
horrify people because I
wanted sort of power over them.

214
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:37,020
It was my way of rebelling,
my way of rebelling. I was,

215
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,970
I was the Predator of 14 let me tell you,

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,460
do you think that's what's going on
with that guy who directed x men?

217
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,980
Bryan singer? Yeah. Much of 10 year old
predators going after that. Poor man. I,

218
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm not sure it's the case with him.

219
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,610
That's a guy I,
I lived Hollywood I a while ago.

220
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,950
Did you meet briefly and
you got one of his parties?

221
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,930
I went to other people who I won't
name of a similar stature in Hollywood.

222
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,020
I went to their boat parties into their
house parties and things and some of the

223
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:09,220
things I have seen their baggage
belief. Yeah. Can you give us like a,

224
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,980
well, just, I can't,

225
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:16,290
I don't want to be indiscreet about
specific people because I think it's going

226
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,700
to be around the fact, yeah, dangerous.

227
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,740
But I can tell you the truth
without dropping anyone in it.

228
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,570
And some of the boys that were very young,
very young, I don't necessarily recent,

229
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:29,170
don't remember. No, no. Like, I don't
know, eight years ago. Um, I don't,

230
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,460
I don't remember,
um,

231
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,410
whether I ever met Bryan singer or
whatever or even knew who he was then.

232
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,800
But I knew other people of
similar stature, as I say.

233
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,060
And there were some very young
boys around at that time.

234
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,540
There was a lot of drugs
and a lot of tweaks,

235
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,820
a lot of twinks taking drugs and
having unsafe sex with older men.

236
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,180
And some of these boys were very
young, desperate for a job. You know,

237
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,720
when Andy Cohen, the guy, Oh,

238
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:58,480
what runs bravo had to apologize for
the use of the word twink apologize for

239
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:03,190
Twain. I thought that was one of the
most adorable things. Yes. Gay as fuck.

240
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:06,440
And he said the word twink and
he had to apologize because what?

241
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,850
Cause it was demeaning to somebody thought
someone was like a perfect twink and

242
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:14,470
he made like a social media comment.
Nothing. Nothing's wrong with that.

243
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,581
I got and you see this,

244
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:19,300
this is the thing you
see the progressive's are
starting to police homosexual

245
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,910
slang. You know this theory,
right? I'm, I believe that um,

246
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,500
pedophilia is the next
progressive rehabilitation drive.

247
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,200
But I also think that straight,

248
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,440
sorry that homosexual white guys are going
to be put back into the establishment

249
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,670
bucket very soon. If you look at some
of the whining editorials coming out,

250
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:39,670
I was like the daily beast,

251
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,420
this female female columnist
and the daily beast who will,

252
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,140
who will publish things about
seeing it on your Grindr profile,

253
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,480
this app that you use
to pick up guys nearby,

254
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,940
which is best just to see if torsos and
you just pick or you want to get the

255
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:56,320
fuck by. It's correct.
Jesus would've planned that.

256
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,960
I don't feel like the iPhone and
I don't use it for that reason,

257
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,140
not for that reason. I think he is that
it needs it. Um, but uh, on that, um,

258
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,720
on the APP, some people say whites
only. Some people say only Hispanics.

259
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,080
People just express their
sexual preference. Everybody
has a sexual preference.

260
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,070
Perfectly reasonable.
But of course, you know,

261
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,720
there's some progressive column is
just finally like five years later as

262
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,840
cottoned onto this and decided to
make a thing about it and said it's

263
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,530
problematic that gay people express
racial preferences in dating.

264
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:25,270
Of course it isn't. We won't. The okay
cupid data actually shows us which racism,

265
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,500
which genders, um, you know,

266
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:29,080
come out on top and come out of the
bottoms like Asian women do very well,

267
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:33,700
black woman right badly, um, you know,
and the sort of league tables of, of,

268
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:38,350
of hotness, uh, minimum. And
Anyway, um, so the sign to police,

269
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:42,460
the language now and the police, the
sexuality of homosexuals, I mean,

270
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,030
there was me thinking we were sliding
dangerously close to tolerance and

271
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:46,864
understanding.

272
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,600
And now progressive's are starting to
police the sexuality of homosexuals again.

273
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,520
Um, very interesting. There's a game of
Gotcha though. So chemos. Gotcha. So it's,

274
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,131
they don't really,

275
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:59,660
they're not really upset that upset it
should looking for something to complain

276
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:02,840
about. Yes. But the problem with it,
the problem that rich culture, I mean,

277
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,280
I've always said that outrage
culture is what it is. Right. Right.

278
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
And the problem with, without any
way to approach outrage culture,

279
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,130
it was just what I do is to be outrageous,
right.

280
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,900
Say Ridiculous and outrageous things,
um,

281
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,700
simply to draw attention to the
people, to get upset about it. Yeah.

282
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,270
I think it's a very important project and
it's what I do in a lot of my columns.

283
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,660
That's what I do on Twitter.
I've done a little bit today, um,

284
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:24,830
and I think it's very
important to wait a minute.

285
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,450
You've done a little bit of
it today. Well, I've been
outrageous. I haven't said,

286
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:32,510
and again, I believe, but I've
been outrageous. Outrageous,
outrageous, outrageous.

287
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,100
Um, just a little bit, I've toned myself
down for you because I know what a quick,

288
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,040
you intersectional lump lumping Cree.
Sure.

289
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,860
It's so much threatened me.
No.

290
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:52,310
Okay.
