1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,560
I said, I have mental health
issues. And you know, I said also,

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:08,430
I thought that woman was white
and it wasn't anything about race.

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,820
It was about Iran. And it was like, well,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,400
we'll see how this washes
out. Ben Sherman. Yeah,

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,420
we'll see how this washes out.
And then 20 minutes later,

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,630
Wanda Sykes tweeted,
let me off this show.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,230
And then Sarah Gilbert tweeted
shortly thereafter, uh,

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,760
something about she was
ashamed of one cast member.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,530
And, uh, with that one
blew me away. And, uh,

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,740
and Michael Fishman tweeted,
uh,

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,300
he was ashamed of my racism
or some shit. And, uh,

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,710
that was hard to take. But,
uh, it, it's because it was so,

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,950
it seemed orchestrated because
they use the same words, you know,

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,690
a egregious and forgivable.
But in fact,

15
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:04,500
it might've been offensive. And like
when I was talking to Mike Today, I said,

16
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,680
you know, we all say things that
are racially insensitive at times.

17
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,840
All of us do that. I'm a Jew.
I've heard everything. And, uh,

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,220
you know, or, or ethnically
offensive to somebody.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,430
But that doesn't mean where the KKK,
okay. That doesn't mean we're, uh,

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,350
you know,
fascists or you know,

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,190
and especially if we apologize
because most people who are offensive,

22
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:33,150
they mean to be offensive and they don't
apologize. And I think that's when,

23
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,290
you know,
there was a difference.

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,400
And if you don't have the discretion to
understand that something's wrong with

25
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,503
you,

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,490
and I think something's wrong with
people that they're so hateful and so

27
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:45,271
unforgiving,

28
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,560
and if you don't vote the way
they think you should vote,

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,450
that they feel justified in
being so, um, what's the word?

30
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,190
So sanctimonious and self righteous
and when they themselves are,

31
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,870
you know,

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,670
kind of saying far more offensive
things about people's children and such.

33
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,920
For instance,
I think people are just cowards.

34
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,450
And I think when things like this happen,

35
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:12,210
they want to separate themselves from
controversy and make sure that they're not

36
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,960
a part of that. I can understand
that. I can understand that.

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,920
I can kind of understand it, but I don't
get it. But that's what they do, you know?

38
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,780
And you know, I'm like,
wow. They also get really,

39
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:29,781
really upset when a few years later
somebody does the exact same thing to them

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,180
and go,
what goes around comes around,

41
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,270
and that's true and
especially true in Hollywood.

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,740
That guide that fired me just was
fired a couple of weeks ago for what?

43
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,110
I don't know. His contract wasn't
renewed and his last words were,

44
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,960
well, I didn't know I'd be forced
to cancel our number one shell.

45
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,260
It wasn't forced to do anything. Well, he
might've been forced. They're all fools.

46
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,470
They should have just, first of all,
they should have let the dust settle.

47
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,710
Second of all,

48
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,190
they should have examined
what you actually said and
what your intentions were

49
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:07,780
and let you apologize and then have a
conversation with you on one of their

50
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,990
shows in long form,
in a teaching moment,

51
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,380
such as not Valerie Jarrett
would've accepted that. I said,

52
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:19,150
I would like to debate her on the Iran
deal and explain what I what I said. Well,

53
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,280
even that's not necessary. I mean, look,

54
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,480
the Americans should know about
that deal. Well, maybe they should,

55
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,940
but I don't think that's
completely related to your tweet,

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,940
but it would have been a
teachable moment maybe.

57
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,140
But it also would've been a distraction
from what you were trying to say. Well,

58
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,920
they didn't let me say it
right. And, uh, you know, um,

59
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,870
but to get involved like
openly, politically, uh, the
television show dangerous,

60
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:48,040
but Taylor swift just did it. But what
did she say? Just get out and vote.

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,190
But it's really for the Democrat.
Yeah. But though it wasn't that like,

62
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,440
it's almost abstract. Get out
and vote. You know, she's not,

63
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,630
she said vote for the Democrat. I don't
like the Republican. Marsha Blackburn.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,980
She didn't like her.

65
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,981
Although Marsha Blackburn has been the
author of a lot of great anti rape laws

66
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,730
and all kinds of stuff like that,

67
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:10,930
but she didn't like her because she's
a Republican, says she took a stand,

68
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:15,100
a political stand, I guess. Uh,
you know, some people can do it,

69
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,990
but some people can't.
And the political stand I took,

70
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,820
which I just want to remind people
is that, um, I'm, I'm an independent.

71
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,040
That's my stance.

72
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,800
And I just thought both sides had gone
too far out and need to talk to each

73
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:35,470
other.
So I came back and did a show about that.

74
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,920
That's a stance you took with your show
and in my life it's like if we can't

75
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:46,660
even discuss things that's really,
really bad. That's not American.

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,570
We we discuss and debate.
We don't label and blacklist,

77
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,600
which we certainly can talk things and
maybe that's something that you could

78
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,780
have done once they had a conversation
with you about your tweet.

79
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,620
But I mean I just think that what
they did was just very hasty and very

80
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,890
foolhardy and they should have
known who you were beforehand.

81
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:08,950
They should have known about your
mental health issues. They should know,

82
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,020
they should have known about a medication
issues, all those things they know.

83
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,040
But this is what my point was.

84
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,490
If you have a person with a broken leg
and they can't run and you get mad at him

85
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:21,610
cause they can't run the,
isn't that ridiculous? Well,

86
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:25,750
if you have a person that has brain
issues and then they do something that's

87
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:29,140
erratic and you're mad at him for that,
well you're a fucking idiot.

88
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,060
That's stupid and you,
you,

89
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:36,061
you call them a racist or chastise them
in front of the world so that you remove

90
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,750
any possible
any,

91
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,810
any possible negative opinions that
could be cast your way when that's what a

92
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,290
lot of it is,
is deflection.

93
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:51,580
They're worried about negative opinions
and negative feedback that's going to

94
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,770
come their way.
So they immediately turn on you.

95
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,080
They turn on you in a
disproportionate way. Well,

96
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,870
they did cancel the show before
even one advertiser had pulled out.

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,420
It reminds me of Sarah Silverman's Bet
I'm for or against it. I remember that.

98
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm for or against it. Well,
there's a lot of cowardice going on.

99
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:13,400
There's a lot of people trying to save
their jobs and people panicked because

100
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:15,830
people are aware of the outrage
culture that we live in.

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,270
This is an outrage nation right now.
It's one of our number one,

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,640
the forms of recreation.
People love it.

103
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,280
They love getting mad at
whoever the fuck it is.

104
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,820
As long as you react the way they
want you to react. Ooh, they love it.

105
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,770
It's an inquisition. Well, it's,

106
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:36,771
it's the understanding that people
have way more power to affect change.

107
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,440
Whether it's good change or bad change.

108
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,910
They're pushing buttons with social
media and with outrage and with their

109
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,310
ability to express themselves.
It's unprecedented.

110
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:51,080
There's never been a time like this in
history where people can Salem witch

111
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:54,440
trials. Right. Well that
was just like, okay,

112
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:58,610
well if you swam that proves you're a
witch and then we have to drown you.

113
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,740
There's no, it's no, uh, it, it
has said there has to be a loser.

114
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,380
There has to be the two
winners. Well, there,

115
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,780
there has to be an understanding
of what's happening here.

116
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,380
And then people have to
have an understanding of the
power that they're wielding

117
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,120
and what they're doing and did it turn
back on them and it just never just stop

118
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,811
at line person.

119
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:22,040
That's why I said I'm surprised that a
lot more comics didn't defend me because

120
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,060
you know,

121
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,470
this means that anything they find
in your timeline that they think is

122
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:28,304
offensive,

123
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,080
they can mischaracterize and bring a
whole a battle against you that you can't

124
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:36,820
possibly win and take your life's
work. Well, how many did defend you?

125
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,740
Um, nobody defended me, but I did.

126
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,220
You did. Thank you Stan. Hope.
Did I stand hope dead? Yeah. Um,

127
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,370
there was [inaudible] that
we're working with. No,

128
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,460
none of them that worked with
you. Well, everybody that works,

129
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,040
you wanted to keep their job. Yeah. And
I don't blame them. I don't blame them.

130
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,250
They pray, you know, needed the money
and probably already spent it. Well,

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,850
the other thing too,
the Sitcom life that,

132
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,210
that fucking schedule is ruthless.
It's great. You know what?

133
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:13,130
I think it was a lot of it was, um, you
know, I gave him the gun to shoot me.

134
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,650
I mean,
I wasn't a helpless victim,

135
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:19,100
although I think my explanation,

136
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,680
you either make sense or
doesn't make sense, but uh,

137
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,750
well if you're compassionate
it makes sense. But a lot
of people aren't. But, um,

138
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,920
you know, uh, I forgot what I was getting.

139
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,990
I don't even know if they're
not compassionate. Roseanne.
I think they're scared,

140
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,310
I think to just chicken shit.

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,250
I don't think they're looking
at it from an in terms of like,

142
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,390
I can't win here and I can't lose here.
Let me just look at what's right. See,

143
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:43,730
I didn't have anything to win or lose.
So what I looked at it,

144
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,470
I looked at you as someone that I admire.

145
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,100
Some of that I think is one of the best
comics ever who I think I know that you

146
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,150
have mental health issues.

147
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:54,140
I knew from talking to you that you were
on Ambien and I knew you had alcohol as

148
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,700
well. I know that does.
My mom took ambien.

149
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,290
She woke up in the middle of the night
and drew all over the bathroom rug,

150
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,100
drew over it with lipstick and,
and, and um, and nail Polish.

151
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,650
She said like a little kid. So
Shit, you woke up in the morning.

152
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:11,250
She had no idea she did
it. She's terrified of that
shit. She won't take it now.

153
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,430
I have many friends, many friends that
have had bad experiences on amputee too.

154
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,950
And I thought, well they shouldn't have
shut down that conversation like that.

155
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,610
They shouldn't have.

156
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,570
It's a fucking dangerous drug to for the
wrong people in the wrong situations.

157
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,580
Especially when you mix,
mix it with alcohol.

158
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,580
I mean it's beneficial to people that
need sleep in certain situations.

159
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:33,270
I don't recommend it, I don't take it,
but some people like it, that's fine.

160
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,570
But to ignore what the
actual pharmacological effect
on the human body is is

161
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:42,330
ridiculous because there's studies on
this shit and that people understand the

162
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:46,440
interaction between chemicals and the
human brain and there are erratic and

163
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,870
especially when you mix them with things
you're not supposed to mix them with.

164
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,110
Weird Shit happens.
I thought it was going to,

165
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,920
I thought I was going to expand on
it in the morning and uh, you know,

166
00:09:55,921 --> 00:10:00,420
talk about that movie and uh,
too late.

167
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,160
It's too late. It put the whole
thing is just fucking crazy. When,

168
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,690
when was telling me not to tweet.
Yeah. Well, it's probably a good idea.

169
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,280
But now honestly the,

170
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:17,760
the problem also at Twitter is fucking
text is just too, it's too simple.

171
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,320
It's too crude a way of
communicating. It really is. I mean,

172
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,850
you can get across some
ideas. Like you can say, hey,

173
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,970
I went to see little foot's a great movie.
That's a good thing to tweet.

174
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,540
Real simple shit like that.

175
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,220
But I don't want to talk about like
political things or things that involve

176
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,190
nuance or seeing things that are complex.

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,930
I just don't think it's the way
to communicate any more. No,

178
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,060
it's terrible way to communicate, you
know? And I think it's not communicate.

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,660
It's like a, what did he say?
A search and destroy. Well,

180
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,480
for some folks, yeah, people,

181
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,550
well there's gonna be people that always
want to make things crash and burn.

182
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,490
They like it. They like like buttons.
They like hitting the buttons.

183
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,780
They like to see people suffer. Well,
they definitely are suffering themselves.

184
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,050
Look, there's a giant percentage of
our population that lives in misery.

185
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,060
I know they do all day long and
they have mental health issues.

186
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:12,690
They're exhausted, they're depressed,
they're there. They have despair,

187
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,810
they're overwhelmed with bills,
they're in shitty relationships,

188
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,080
they're overwhelmed and they're angry
and they look at someone like you,

189
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:22,830
a rich white lady, and like fuck that
bitch. And they just want to attack you.

190
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,680
And it doesn't have to make sense
because it's a reflection of their own

191
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:29,880
personal pain as much as it's a reflection
of their irresponsibility with this

192
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,890
power that they're wielding
through social media.

193
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,890
And then there's the mob mentality
cause a bunch of people that are already

194
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,750
going after you. Good. I'm
going to go after her too.

195
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm going to show the world that I'm not
racist and you know how I'm going to do

196
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,960
that. I'm going to shit all over
this racist, this racist Roseanne.

197
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,580
They don't care if you're really racist.
