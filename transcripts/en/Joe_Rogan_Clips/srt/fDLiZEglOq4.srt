1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,600
We're so far away from where
we were in the 70s so far away,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,240
so far away, so far away.
And that was our lifetime.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,090
We can remember the 70s you know,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,310
1973 I was six years old. Okay.
I remember that. I remember,

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,820
I remember the Vietnam War.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,310
I remember when the war ended
thinking when I was a little kid.

7
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:22,330
This is great that the war's over because
now they know that war is bad and they

8
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:24,850
won't do any war anymore.
The war is over, it's gone.

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,280
And then when the war started up again,
when I was,

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,170
I think I was 21 when Desert Storm
kicked in, I was at Holy Shit,

11
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,010
they're doing it again.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,820
Me and my friend Jimmy did
tell you we had an apartment in

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,130
think it was fucking where,
where we Malden or some shit,

14
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,460
I forget where the fuck we were.
Wall Fan. That's where we are,

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,860
where we are in Walt Dam.
We had this fucking apartment and uh,

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,320
we were sitting there on TV, which is
sitting in front of the delivery room.

17
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,480
I didn't think we had a couch.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,610
We just sitting there and the living room
watching these fucking missiles flying

19
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:00,820
through the air and I'll never forget.
He goes, buddy looks like we're at war.

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,160
And I was like, what? How the UF,
we're both sitting there going, what?

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,560
How the fuck we're at war?
I thought we didn't do that anymore.

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,520
I remember that.
I remember that whole,

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,600
that time when,

24
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:23,601
when that was how you got information
from the TV is so far removed from today.

25
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,300
Today,

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,300
everything that happens all the time
is coming at Ya a hundred miles an hour

27
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:32,290
from every direction.
There's just too much.

28
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,670
You have to control it.
You have to control it.

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,270
You still have to have a
life. You still, you know,

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,740
I don't have Facebook on my phone.
I have my email account.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,340
I try to keep Twitter off my
phone when I go on the road.

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,870
The IPAD has no Twitter,
no Facebook. It's too much.

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,810
It's too much.
It interferes with who we are.

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,130
And if you haven't caught that by now,
you're not catching this. You know,

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,630
I helped open up my Twitter on a
Saturday just to see who's tweeting,

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,670
thinking to myself,

37
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,410
what are you doing with your fucking
life that you're tweeting on Friday and

38
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:15,680
fucking Saturday and Sunday.
You know,

39
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,600
it becomes a little game.
It's, it's a little game. You
have to give it a breather.

40
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,330
You have to you,

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,400
it's too much news coming at you from
too old too on your satellite disk.

42
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,530
It's in. Oh, other thing is it's too
much news from sports to World News.

43
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:34,870
You got Hln,

44
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,400
CNN and then ESPN all of the fucking row.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,960
It's too fast. It's too quick.
Last week when I was home,

46
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:48,860
my buddy is a cab driver.
I took six.

47
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:53,540
Uber's on Monday in New York.
Tuesday I just wanted to take a cab.

48
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,960
I took my wife to get some real pizza.
Roma Pizza.

49
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,220
The guy that was making pizza
that was there when I was a kid.

50
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,130
I drove by one day and I go,
he still in there.

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,620
So we took a fucking cab on the cat and
this guy that drove me as a friend of

52
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,330
mine, we grew up together since we
were 12 and we would talk and I go,

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,510
that's a fair ask first gas station that
robbed and then he got some memorable,

54
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,800
we were 12 we were walking home the
night Freddy Prince got killed. Wow.

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,440
Freddie prince who killed
himself than they before.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,350
We didn't find out till about six o'clock
news. Do you know what I'm saying?

57
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,260
Like that was the gap in time.

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,060
So you got your news and the,
even though that was New York,

59
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:40,390
it was the city capitol who
watch TV in the morning.

60
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,480
Maybe they mentioned it in the morning
reports out of La Friday Prinze is in the

61
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,640
hospital. Yeah, but you never
saw it. But no, I still,

62
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,670
I remember us being out and
them saying Freddy Prince died.

63
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,950
He shot himself last night and
I started my, how cold it was.

64
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:01,660
It was January or February.
It was fucking freezing,

65
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,040
but we were walking home. We were 12
and what do we see in front of us?

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,410
But a guy passed out drunk,

67
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,790
just haven't drunk on the floor.
So when I call down,

68
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,120
let's get the money out of his pocket.
You take the bottle,

69
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,280
it was like a bottle
of Dewar's or whatever.

70
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,150
So I plan was to take a bottle and
shake a bum. What? What's it called?

71
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,930
You roll a bum? Yeah, we
put our hands in his pocket.

72
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:29,130
He grabbed one of us like Carrie.
So next thing you know,

73
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:33,400
all three of us just started kicking him
like we must have kicked the maybe two

74
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:37,810
times
and we ran away the bottle.

75
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,980
He got up and chases. Oh Jesus. We knew
as sharp path through the cemetery.

76
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,814
So we lost them.

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Like you get all those weird things
like that's what I associate with like

78
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:52,510
Freddy shot himself at night.
They must've mentioned it in the morning.

79
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:56,980
I was too busy going to school and
it wasn't confirmed to the next day.

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,310
That's how slow knew is was.
Now you're getting news,

81
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,120
you're getting hit with
200 stories in 10 minutes.

82
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,740
What happened in France?

83
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,580
What Trump decided what the UFC is doing,

84
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,640
what fucking Penny Marshall died.

85
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,710
You get this true natural all day, you
really can't control it. Take your child,

86
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,500
you've watched these
two young girls grow up.

87
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,800
You ever have days where
you take them somewhere,

88
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,410
Disney and it's so much information they
got to go back and take a nap. Yeah,

89
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,050
it happens to have step two
that's gotta be happening to us.

90
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Well for sure it's wearing you out and
it's a lot of it is really negative too.

91
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,510
That's another part of the problem
is what's interesting to people's,

92
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,430
what's dangerous and
there's not much dangerous.

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,620
So what's interesting to people
becomes, you know, being negative,

94
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,070
being nasty about something, complaining
about things, bitching that, starting

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,760
starting Twitter fights. Like people
enjoy doing it. They were like,

96
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,330
they're looking for,
for battles, you know?

97
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,340
And I wish there was a way where people
could choose to only engage online

98
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,830
without insulting people and just
try and get a rise out of people,

99
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:19,970
like a troll free way of interacting.
But it's never going to happen.

100
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,630
So you've got to kind of accept what
it is, is if you accept what it is,

101
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,110
you should be very wary about entering
to anything where 60% of what you're

102
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,990
experiencing is negative.
Anything,

103
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,010
anything in life where you're looking
at 60% negative, you don't have to.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,650
It is the one you like.
Being informed is one thing,

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,660
but that's more than just being informed.

106
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,060
Cause how much of that information
is even valuable to you.

107
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,040
A lot of it is just getting soaked, soaked
into these fucking horrible stories.
