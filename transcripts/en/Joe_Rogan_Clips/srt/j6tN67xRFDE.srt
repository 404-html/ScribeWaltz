1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,230
Right,
no Internet.

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:05,280
And then it became the Internet when
we're fully formed and as an adult.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,810
And then you got a chance to see it
and even then screwed it up and made

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:14,160
mistakes and got online within God viruses
on your computer and saw some stuff

5
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,540
he really didn't want to see

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,120
had that dial tone or you
dial in when you were gay

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,920
and then the picture would kind of come
in and little, little blips. Oh yeah.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,810
Realize when he didn't really want to
see it anymore. I go, oh, when was,

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,850
when did you get first get a cell phone?

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,630
I got one real early. I've got a
cell phone in the 80s. Wow. Yeah.

11
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:40,860
Well it was a comedian and like 89,

12
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,550
I think I had a cell phone.
I had a cell phone in my car.

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,810
It was like permanently bolted down
to my car. Yeah, I got it. Those,

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,230
so I could get, the thing about
it was I could get gigs with it.

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,050
So like, uh, some people get ahold of you.
Yeah, I would like bill bloomin'. Right.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,560
Uh, who is the owner of, um,
the Wilbur Theater in Boston.

17
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,950
It was owner of the comedy connection
back then. Always jokes around about it.

18
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,431
He was like,

19
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:08,280
you got a lot of work because you were
the only comedian with his cell phone.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,580
Like so he could call me
up and say, hey, you know,

21
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,870
this guy just got a flat tire on his way
to New Hampshire. Can you do the Gig?

22
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,390
I'm like, fuck yeah, I'm
in. I'm, I'm there. I'm, no,

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm already in my car cause
that's where my phone is dead.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,520
How much did you have to pay for
that phone? I don't remember. It's,

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,380
I couldn't afford it.
No, I couldn't afford it.

26
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,450
I remember not being able to pay for
it after a while. Yeah, it was just,

27
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:33,990
it was a dummy. I always spent more
money than I had. I mean it's, yeah,

28
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,990
I've never been good with finances.
I've never been frugal.

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,960
But he's one of those things where I
realized I could get it. So I got it.

30
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,570
But you remember that status you'd have
to drive around if you, before that,

31
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:44,370
before you had that,
that phone in your car,

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,010
you'd have to drive what I'm looking for

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,770
a public payphone.
Oh yeah.

34
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,740
And you're getting a quarter's right
or you had to have a calling card.

35
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:54,980
You remember those things.
He'd have a car I would get,

36
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,490
I would get fake cards too. He could
buy them off people. They were like,

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,000
like counterfeit cards and they were
good for a couple of days and they'd go

38
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:05,480
under and you could buy other ones. And
then there was other things you could do.

39
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:10,481
You could take a sound device and put
it up to the phone and you could get a,

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,040
get a call with that.

41
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:17,430
Like you would put up this thing to the
voice box area and it would make noises

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,500
like Eh. Yeah. And it
would somehow or another

43
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,920
trick opened up the, uh, yeah,
the line, I remember that we are,

44
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,260
we used to before the, yeah, before
the cell phone technology hit.

45
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,490
And this is early days of being with
the agency. When you were overseas,

46
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,290
if you were in an urban setting,

47
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,580
you spent half your time looking
for operating payphones, right?

48
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,340
Some 34th world country. You're trying
to find a payphone that actually works.

49
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,510
Cause you've got to make some sort of,
you know,

50
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,540
call related to whatever
operation you're engaged in.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And the kids, the kids, the kids today
and the agency, you don't understand that,

52
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:53,810
you know, cause they've all got great
technology and mobile communications.

53
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:57,320
But uh, yeah, in the old days it was,
it didn't, it didn't work that way.

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,370
There's people that even knew what a phone
booth is. No, I, yeah, exactly. I take,

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,220
they'd say like about fights.
That's like a common expression.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,960
These two could have fought in the phone.
Both that could've fought fight.

57
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,690
And I can't even say it could
a fight in a phone booth.

58
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,390
But today you say fight in
a phone booth and people go,

59
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:17,470
why don't just say they got a
fight on her fucking, you know,

60
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:22,150
something else that doesn't exist
anymore. A wine barrel. This London,

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,300
you're London now and you know
that those iconic red phone booth,

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,830
you haven't met a phone. It, there's
a I'm work. What are they now?

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,090
You just keep getting them up.
Yeah, I think they kept him update.

64
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,320
You could probably find one occasionally.
It's got a phone in it,

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,730
but it wasn't that long ago.

66
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,120
I remember they actually had
functioning phones in there.

67
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,060
You would go outside any
seven 11 or whatever.

68
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:41,980
And they were doing a bank of payphones.

69
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,780
I actually stopped and took
a picture I was having,

70
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:46,930
I forget where the hell are we nowhere
pulled into a gas station. It was,

71
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,450
I was pulling out after, oddly
enough, getting gas and uh,

72
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,980
I looked over to the side and there
was a pay phone against the wall.

73
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,800
And then now that the receiver
was just dangling on the ground,

74
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,730
but I literally stopped,

75
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:00,560
got out and took a picture of it
so I could show my kids, you know,

76
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,370
we used to make calls on these things.
This is how it worked.

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,270
I remember when there was no answering
machines. You remember that? Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,780
And the first answer machine and whoever
your buddy was at got the answering

79
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,620
machine first. You thought, man,
that's the deal. That's so posh.

80
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,430
And I remember we got an answering
machine where you could call it,

81
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,620
and then when the dial tone went on,

82
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:24,760
you would punch in a code and you could
listen to your messages and you weren't

83
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,090
even home.
You could retrieve those messages crazy.

84
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:32,690
You could call it of the car to your
answering machine. Pick it. There's a,

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,010
there's a funny, yeah. Okay. Maybe you
shouldn't, I guess I, what do I know?

86
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:38,170
But you should never start a story
out by saying there's a funny story.

87
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,290
There's this story that
when Lyndon Johnson was a,

88
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,750
was a precedent and not, not
present, I take that back.

89
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:51,610
He was in the Senate and it was another
guy, Dirksen. It was a famous senator.

90
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:56,590
And so Johnson was,
uh, uh, one day he was,

91
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,740
he was driving, Dirksen gets this
call, I think I got their guy, right?

92
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,240
It gets a call from Johnson and they're
talking and Johnson and say, wow,

93
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,670
I got to talk to you about this thing.
He says, Whoa, Whoa, hold on. Oh,

94
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:08,560
hold on a second. He
says, I gotta, you know,

95
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,630
we're just pulling up outside
the building. I got to get out.

96
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,850
I'll call you when I get to my
office and says, what are you,

97
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,250
where are you calling me now? And he
goes, well, I got a phone in my car.

98
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,360
And so Dirksen hangs up and meet is
this, I gotta get one of those. So he,

99
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,740
this, as the story goes, he pulled
some strings there in the Senate,

100
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,160
got somebody to put a phone in his car,
right?

101
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,980
And so then he calls Johnson and he says,
uh,

102
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,510
Lyndon just calling your from from my car.
And Johnson says,

103
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,760
ah, that's, that's, that's
great. Hold on a second.

104
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:41,230
I got a call coming in on the other line.
Thanks up on him.

105
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,370
So, Eh, yeah. Yeah. Whether it's true
or not, it's an apocryphal story.

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,700
Phones in their car back then. Yeah.
Well, you know, if you're a senator,

107
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,780
what year did they invent? Carphone's? Uh,

108
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,530
probably the year you got
one. No, I don't, I have no
idea when they infected ones.

109
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:02,330
But you know, uh, Jamie, we
should look in 1946 1946 what,

110
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,780
what? Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute.

111
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,780
1946 imagine will come up.

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,280
Pimp you had to be in 1969 to
pull up and like a 69 corvette.

113
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,310
The fucking phone in your car or
Lincoln town car. Whoa. This is what it,

114
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:21,740
that's like a car phone is a mobile
phone device specifically designed to be

115
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:24,800
fitted in automobile. That's what we
should call him back then. Car phones.

116
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,690
Remember service originated with the
bell system and was first used in Saint

117
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,720
Louis.
June 17th,

118
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,500
1946 before the fucking end of
the war, right? Yeah. No, no, no.

119
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,810
That was after the end of
the war. End. 45 okay. Yeah.

120
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,360
So a year after the World War II,
that's an incredible phone in their car.

121
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,170
And more importantly, why,
why St Louis? What was,

122
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,330
what the hell is going on in St Louis? It,
that's the site of the first car phone.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,230
Wow.

124
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,130
It was a radio enthusiasts who had the
foresight to invent the annoying habit of

125
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,630
talk on the phone while in the car.

126
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,610
So basically worked on the radio and it
would somehow or another connect to a

127
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,630
regular phone lines. Is that what
it worked? Uh, Jesus Christ. Yeah.

128
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:10,631
This is way beyond my apple watch rounds
had this look Johnson had it when he

129
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:14,000
was in the Senate. Yep. Yeah.
So and that would have been,
yeah. What's that? That's,

130
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:18,950
that would have been like 15 years after
this happened or, or 14 years after.

131
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,460
After they invented it in Saint Louis.
But, but yeah, I remember when they,

132
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:25,050
you know, the mobile phone
then was that big case do that.

133
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,160
We carry around and give it to get out
of your car set out out on your car and

134
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,530
then it started getting
too big fucking thing.

135
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,530
You throw over your shoulder a big handle.

136
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,970
I've got a big box at home full of all
the old phones that I've had over the

137
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,850
years and it's like if I could
ever get myself organized,

138
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,500
I would turn it into some sort of wall
art installation cause it's cell phones

139
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,960
through the years at least
covering the past three decades.

140
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,490
It's certainly interesting.

141
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:54,491
What do you got there at Jamie first
developed in 1920 mobile wireless

142
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,230
transmission device.

143
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:02,530
Send and receive messages in the
1920s phone like in 19 and 20 Jesus,

144
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,360
that guy behind him as the boss,
you can tell he's, he's listening.

145
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:10,280
He's the guy in charge, man. Wow.

146
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,481
Yeah.

147
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:16,481
I think that would be a great idea to
show kids today that I'm that old brick

148
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,060
phone from Wall Street.
Fantastic to the,

149
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,490
was it called the star Tech
Startac those were the bag I saw.

150
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,560
Somebody's still using one of those the
other day. Yeah, the little flip flops.

151
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,610
A little flip phone with the little was
kinda would come out. Yeah. To be fair,

152
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:31,881
he dead.

153
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:36,710
He had a Dork knob startac
there was a sweet phone.

154
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:40,940
I had one of those. I was like, oh baby.
It was like, like Star Trek, right?

155
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,530
You were like Captain
Kirk with that thing.

156
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:46,250
You flip it open and you're talking about
maybe you can get an extra fat battery

157
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:50,930
for it. Although that didn't set so
well in your suit coat. It's terrible.

158
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,930
Those fat batteries,
but if you didn't have a fat battery,

159
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,710
you can make a call for four minutes.

160
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,730
Battery Technology was terrible back
there. That waterway fallen, by the way,

161
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,760
has an excellent battle.

162
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,780
It's got a great battery amp
battery that battery is doing.

163
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,690
It's sucking all the information out
of your system and you got it. Yeah,

164
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,220
but sweet, sweet signal that you get
so long while it does that. It is true.

165
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,300
It is true. Go out there kids,
get yourself a Huawei bat phone,

166
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,270
amazing cameras.
They have a 40 megapixel camera in one.

167
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,490
They make all sorts of white goods too,
you know,

168
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:28,010
like washers and dryers and
refrigerators and those.

169
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:32,370
They're putting all that stuff in our
homes. Yes, it is. Yes, it, so I wouldn't,

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,560
I wouldn't engage in any
shenanigans in my kitchen.
