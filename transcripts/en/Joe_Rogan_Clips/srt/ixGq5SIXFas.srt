1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,570
Hello Freak bitches. So, oh,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,170
when you look at that as a
comedian is like, wow, you know,

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,540
that was good for me and that was
good for me in a certain way of,

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,310
first of all it's, it's great
jokes too. It's like it does say,

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,930
are we becoming too fragile
when it comes to our race?

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,770
Like black folk, like I say, yeah,

7
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:26,040
some people are racist and some people
are perceptionist now what that means. No,

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,010
the perception is, okay, the perception
in America was the white man.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,430
Donald Trump can be president.
The woman can't do it.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,420
Perception doesn't mean that if you
vote for Ronald Donald Trump that you're

11
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,910
racist. I don't think everybody
does it cause that was a big thing.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,750
Sometimes this perception I'll,
I'll make, I'll make it clear. Okay.

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,790
I do a joke in front of all black
people and I said black people are very

14
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,870
interesting people because we deal
with racism and perception ism.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,490
I said because we were very
nervous flyers, right? We
don't like to get on planes.

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,020
First thing we do when
we get on the plane,

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,120
we see who's flying this motherfucker.
We look in the cockpit,

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,440
if we look and see a black
guy, we will stop and go, hey,

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,850
how long you been flying?
Uh,

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,210
you got your hours with you.
And it was the perception.

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
And don't let a woman sit
next to him. Oh Shit, we good.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,080
It could be a bright sunny day is
a how's the weather? We're good.

23
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,460
And then as you're sitting in that seat,
anytime you hit a bump bump, my brother,

24
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:29,020
we straight, same situation.
You go in the cockpit,

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,750
you see that white guy with his salt and
pepper hair and those aviators and at

26
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,700
forum hair like this and
it's storming outside. Shit.

27
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,870
Fly the ship through a hurricane.

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,400
So it's the perception that we
have to talk about sometime.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,830
Does that make sense? Oh, it
definitely makes sense. Yeah. You know,

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,170
there's definitely that.
You don't like the,

31
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:51,430
the Donald Trump thinks funny know who
had it, said it best. Alonzo boating,

32
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,390
you know Lonzo? No, I would say funny
comedian. Yeah. He said, he goes,

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,540
not all Donald Trump
supporters are racist,

34
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,900
but all racists are
Donald Trump supporters.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,820
That he definitely awakened that side.
But I will,

36
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,440
but I will say this, like I said, the
perception gets us all to, you know,

37
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,110
cause like my, my daughter,
it was interesting, my
oldest, my oldest daughter,

38
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:18,570
like when when the,
uh,

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,140
when the election happened and
when the results came in, Dad,

40
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:26,910
I'm so mad I can't take it. I said, well,
what'd you were going to go March? I said,

41
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,880
what did y'all vote? Not all of us,
but you know, I said, well, you know,

42
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:34,210
you gotta get out there because their
perception was she had it in the bag.

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,700
You know what I'm saying? So you
gotta get out there and be, you know,

44
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,520
whatever that is. Yeah.
Whatever that is. Indeed.

45
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,020
This is a weird times for everybody,
you know,

46
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,100
because I think social media is
allowing people to express themselves.

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,170
Everybody's expressed
themselves and forming groups,
you know, they're just like,

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,800
you know,
they're progressive or they're there,

49
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,040
they're liberal or they're
conservative and this,

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
everybody has a voice because everybody
has a voice. There's so much voices.

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,700
I'll say this, maybe you can appreciate
this because we've, we've lived,

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,930
we're living in two worlds. We lived when
it wasn't here and we live in an exam.

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
It's discretion.

54
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,880
Social media allows you
not to have discretion.

55
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
You're able to go in and type whatever
you want to say and that usually that's

56
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,340
what we pay attention to.
Discretion is this.

57
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,360
We're sitting at the dinner table and Yo,
I said something that you did like,

58
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,350
but the discretion was, I'll
address that later. Right?

59
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,440
So now that you don't have any discretion,

60
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,160
anybody's voice can be heard.
Not Everybody.

61
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,041
How do you say it?

62
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:44,041
Not Everybody has a point that we
should hook all of our wagons to write.

63
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:50,860
What I notice is that we will hook our
wagons to the most extreme point and that

64
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:54,340
may be only 2,500 people. Like when
my homies with him, he said, man,

65
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:56,230
you would they say a man about songs.
Like I said,

66
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:59,980
how many of you use it to get 80,000
views as is 8 million people in Philly

67
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:03,520
alone. Why are you just
listening to those 80,000 people?

68
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,330
So you sorta have to put balance in
a way you saw the sift through it.

69
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,590
Does that make sense? It
does make sense. Yeah. Well,

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,960
the way I tried to put it out to people,

71
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,630
if you run into a room and there's
a hundred people in that room,

72
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:18,580
what are the odds that one person is a
fucking idiot. 100% right? One person,

73
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,550
almost almost every room of a
random group of a hundred people.

74
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,800
And I'm being very, very polite person.
That means probably a few, probably a few,

75
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,290
but let's go with one.
One out of a hundred.

76
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,360
So that means there's 3 million
fucking idiots in this country, right?

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,120
Just straight idiots, right?
Non fixable idiots. Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,060
So if you're gonna read comments,
you're opening yourself up to that.

79
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:47,020
If you're going to get your opinion swayed
by people who just want to just want

80
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,310
to see if they can affect,
you,

81
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,220
just want to see if they can
just fuck with you and touch you.

82
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,490
Just see big change. You get you
to change the way you're dressing.

83
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,480
Like that's part I don't like. So I tell
all of my artists and all my friends,

84
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,040
don't change.
Don't read it.

85
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,880
Because what happens is everybody
starts coloring inside the lines and now

86
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:05,710
nobody's dangerous anymore,
right?

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,050
Because you remember back in the day
on Madonna, dangerous, right? Donna,

88
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,680
come out naked. You know, just dance
into the grand. He's like, it's all good.

89
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,020
So what I hope will want to always say,
just don't Tuck your art in.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,480
Don't take your Rdm foot for the,
for the comments,

91
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,880
because we'll end up not having anything.

92
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,220
Not having anything to celebrate that is

93
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,920
bet is good.
Like having something to sell,

94
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:30,690
but somebody did a song that was
dope or movie that was doable.

95
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,610
Got Outside the box as opposed
to what we love celebrating,

96
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,200
which is the crazy shit.
You know what I mean?

97
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,153
Okay.

98
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,210
Yeah.
