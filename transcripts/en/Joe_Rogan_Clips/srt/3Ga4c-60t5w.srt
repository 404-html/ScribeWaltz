1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,641
Is the new.

2
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:04,630
This is a new genre of TV show of the
real guy versus the guy playing in the

3
00:00:04,631 --> 00:00:08,860
movie. Well, I want to see doctors
against guys who played a doctor.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,100
I only see astronauts against guys
who would take her an astronaut.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,993
I want to see it all

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,130
from a movie versus real dinosaur
versus chicken. I want to say,

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,780
isn't that what Mark Wahlberg sign if
he was on the plane, spy versus city.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,940
Did he really say that though?
That's what everybody says.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,030
I never heard him say that. It's
funny, funny something to think.

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,440
It's a crazy thing to think.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,570
You know who knows what the fuck you
would do if you thought that you were just

12
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,490
going to land somewhere.
You know?

13
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:39,100
That's the idea is that you knew what
was going to happen before it happened.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,070
Nobody knows. Well, while that shit's
going down, someone's got box cutters,

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,340
they were holding the waitress. They're
holding a stewardess by the neck. Like,

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,400
yeah, you don't know what
the fuck's happening. You
have no idea what's going on.

17
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:52,570
We're afraid to move and you know, I'm
sure that a lot of people would step up,

18
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,800
but you,
you know,

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,010
it could potentially cost that person
their life and then when the plane lands,

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,310
that person's dead when they may
be, if you don't know, right.

21
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,570
You don't know the actual scenario.

22
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:07,780
Now obviously we know it was a horrible
thing and you should do whatever you can

23
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:10,090
to stop them because they're going
to kill everybody no matter what.

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,960
But back then you didn't know when.

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,510
If someone just took the plane and landed
in the stewardess, he would be like,

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,500
glad I didn't do anything. He jumped
up and he cut her face off. You know,

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,550
it's like in, in those moments when
you don't know what's going to happen.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,070
To said I was on that plane.
Okay.

29
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,520
If with my kids and when
it went down like it did,

30
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,840
that would have been a lot of blood in
that first class cabin. Then me saying,

31
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:37,630
okay, we're going to land
somewhere safely. Don't worry.

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,080
Well that seat, I see where
he's coming from. Right.

33
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,350
He's got a, he's got kids that he loves.
You've got a family that he loves,

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,830
he wouldn't have sat still.
That's what he's saying.
Yeah. That's what he's saying.

35
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,960
And in his mind,
he probably has that conviction.

36
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,820
Even if it meant the thing running
everybody's life. Would you, you know,

37
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:01,060
would it work if it didn't work?
Like what did they have?

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,630
Do you know what they have? They have
a box cutter. They have anything else?

39
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,560
How many of them are there?
You don't know. Like is
anybody going to back you up?

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,340
Does anybody else know how to fight? You
know, you could get fucked up. You could,

41
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,300
you could step up thinking you're
Billy Badass and this guy is,

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,420
I'm the trainers who smashes your face
in and cuts you up with a box cutter that

43
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:26,080
could happen to, it still pulls his
belt off of the planet. It could.

44
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,710
Who the fuck knows Matt? The, that's
why there's professionals, right?

45
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:30,910
That's where there's professional,

46
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,290
those air marshals that can assess the
situation and figure out and obviously,

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,531
you know,

48
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,100
they weren't either they weren't there
on that plane or they couldn't help.

49
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,050
I sure was thinking about if I was in
that position, you know, how could you,

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,140
I mean, who the fuck knows
what you would do? Well,

51
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:48,950
since I look like I'm on the other team,
I would've said my friend

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,610
fucking it up. Come
on, get up and do your,

53
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,340
I'm like not part of the team
Dave, do your phone. Fuck man.

54
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,040
Yeah, you'll be, you know.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,270
Have you ever been so scared
that your frozen instant
for a second? Oh yeah. Yeah.

56
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:15,271
I mean you can't know what the right thing
to do is and the wrong thing could be

57
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,900
so catastrophic.
Great.

58
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,620
It was not really good as
far as to say like that.

59
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:25,400
He's making announcements on the
plane and this is all happening.

60
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:28,720
Like we're landing,
say like he's now the pilot in the movies.

61
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,800
Right.
That's true.

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,420
The movie you get to grant the intercom
at the end didn't go thanks for flying

63
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,440
so-and-so air.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,590
Sometimes you say things like that cause
that's how you feel and you don't think

65
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,000
about how other people
are going to perceive it.

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,940
That's what I would assume
that that statement is. It's
kind of how he felt like,

67
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,890
fuck that.
I'm landing this fucking plane.

68
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,790
I'm going to kill this fucking terrorists.

69
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,880
That's what he told his kids one night.

70
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,570
The problem is you're saying that to
billions of people and billions of people

71
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:58,070
hear that and they go, what? And then
all of these people get to assess your,

72
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,040
your statement,
whether or not it has any makes any sense.

73
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,990
Like what are you going to do? You can
kick everybody's ass. Okay, okay, sure.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
I know a lot of dudes who, if they
were there and you tried to do that,

75
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,970
you'd get smashed. Right?
Like they're scary.

76
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:16,350
People in this world is holding
weapons on him. I would assume.

77
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:17,580
If you're ready to die like that,

78
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:22,200
you have a very strange kind of conviction
to if you know you're ready to die

79
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:25,560
and you know how to fight like oof Jesus.

80
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,140
I don't mean who knows,
but it's like, okay,

81
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,560
the idea that you would have to think
about it, that's what's really terrifying.

82
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,080
What do you mean? The idea that
you would have to think like,

83
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:40,320
what do I do if something is someone does
hijack a plane? We all think that, yeah.

84
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,960
Every, every situation. Now there's
that what we do do, what do you do?

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,220
What do you do? I mean, so you
hear people run and they survived.

86
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:53,010
Then you people would run and get shot
down and they go to the wrong way. Well,

87
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,630
anytime a tragedy like that happen,
she's like, what the fuck? Horrific.

88
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,631
Random set of sequences and you're in
the wrong spot and you'll do the right.

89
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,450
Heroic.

90
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,660
How about how many people must do the
heroic thing and then they die anyway?

91
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:08,760
You never know about it. Oh, for sure.

92
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,660
I wonder what Uncle Steve
did in that situation. Yeah.

93
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:14,830
Yeah.
