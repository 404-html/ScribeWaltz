1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Talking about British woman wakes up with
Chinese accent. Oh, play this, play this.

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:05,514
I want to hear her.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,770
Oh, nice. Oh, it was not
have a voice that came out.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,760
55 sweet and sour chicken Hong Kong style.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,460
There's just been such
horrible thing to go with.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,810
She was diagnosed with foreign
accents and keep playing.

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,620
The inquisitor reports.

8
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,490
Others who have suffered from the same
change in voice had severe migraines.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,550
Only 61 cases have been identified since
1941 one explanation for the new tongue

10
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:34,480
is that her migraines,

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,100
which she experiences as many as 10 times
or more per month are leaving her with

12
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:40,570
neurological damage.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,260
They condition usually follows
traumatic brain injury or a stroke.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,620
Those with fas also
experience loss of vocabulary,

15
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,720
but Caldwell is not alone anymore.

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,730
To go back to when you
hear it again enough.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,860
If he finds to be sweet and sour,
chicken Hong Kong style,

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,390
is that her? That's her to
welcome. She doesn't have it there.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,433
Let me hear it again.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,710
She was Chinese accent. She literally
woke up, opened are nice. It wasn't,

21
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:14,150
don't have a voice that came out enough.
55 beer to be so our ticket,

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,660
Hong Kong style, there's just been
such horrible thing to go with.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,570
She was have an idea

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,690
that's not a Chinese accent. That's
the broken English accent. Yeah.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,300
With the Chinese,
uh,

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,340
from a Chinese person at why they giving
her of all things food or the fuck it

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,030
means she got to set any bigger than
the big game or of food or the means.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,640
I told that bitch order changes to this
sweet and sour.

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,940
I don't know if we can understand you
in any big else with a Chinese accent to

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,750
say this doesn't mean that is
kind of hilarious. Hilarious.

31
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,690
Like why play that play this
morning here was this lady got,

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,950
she's got a British just as a
Houston Mama at the Britain.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,730
What happened to her that didn't
say where she got hit in the head?

34
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,210
The queen's Tomfoolery

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,540
well, the third asking me, um,
having my mom got the acid,

36
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,460
Lisa Alomia. Oh, not from
England, sorry. Is 100% Texas

37
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,050
people who don't know me.
Hey,

38
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:15,220
where are you from before I see my,
Oh wait, where's that? I'm like,

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,490
we're hearing right? Oh, you're
from here. How'd you talk like that?

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,430
So that's when the whole story comes up.

41
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,830
Six months ago, jaw surgery to fix it
all. Chaucer changed Lisa speech too.

42
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,690
I thought she was playing around with me.
I thought she was joking with me.

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,080
But then she showed me that like the
doctor had told her she was diagnosed with

44
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,500
foreign accents in gym and she searched
it and then I was like, oh Lord,

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,330
you still have to just hold up.
Hold up, hold up, pause right here.

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,140
Here's the problem with that.
I can talk like this.

47
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,850
It doesn't mean that I talk like this.

48
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,550
So if I come back and say
if I got an operation,

49
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,570
I wanted to get a root canal and I came
back and I started talking about this.

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,250
Welcome to the Joe Rogan experience.
People are like, what's wrong with you?

51
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,180
I've diagnosed with foreign accent
syndrome. Then we once just talk like,

52
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:59,150
you know how to talk. No,
because I've been diagnosed,

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,740
I've been diagnosed with a disease.
I have an issue.

54
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,970
Please be more sensitive
and I'm calling the news.

55
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,820
I'd like to get on the news
today. Please do. I can't help it.

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,780
This is how I talk now.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Do you think they still
possess the original accent
is a well or is it just that

58
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:20,770
one navy? That bitch is so
dumb that I can't go back.

59
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,770
She says she's got one speed,

60
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,160
just knocked her into second gear and
she's trying to start off the line.

61
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:34,720
And second now hold on.
I have is, what is this?

62
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:37,450
This woman says she's been
described to speaking in Italian,

63
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,410
French and even Japanese. Oh, she's
crazy. She likes attention. Let's hear it.

64
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,230
Excellent Syndrome. Kath joins us
now along with Professor Rosemary.

65
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,140
It's a very clear,
so it's 2006.

66
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,150
She was suffering from bad
health for a little while.

67
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:56,151
You'd had headaches and then you spoke
to your sister on the phone and notice

68
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,720
that your voice is changing. Yeah, I
started off with just the least and um,

69
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,030
I was a good concern and I did the ill
health, I tend to get over fatigued.

70
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,020
So I fought. It was that. So until that
Dutch still there the next morning solely,

71
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,720
this list was getting a little
bit strange. I rang a on trends,

72
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,940
uh, my new rose up there left
at that time I could speak,

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,310
I record a message and nobody got back.
I thought, okay, nothing to worry.

74
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,690
Where's the morning?

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,860
It was starting to go like an early on
and by first year to go and completely

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,080
and then I lost my
swallow at the same time.

77
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,470
Which stats terrified still
scare me for my family.

78
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:38,040
There were still terrified for
me but no stops tuck me in.

79
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,040
Why are they scared? Cause you're
talking weird or cause you can't swallow.

80
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,620
He couldn't swallow.
Yeah.

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,920
She's the only spitting out now I've
been diagnosed with inability to swallow.

82
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,880
I come on of me. You swollen. No,

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
I've been diagnosed and inability to
swallow. Plus I have a new accident.

84
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,480
All of a sudden this book and what it's
taught me an accident cannot swallow.

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,340
How does show you the paperwork.
I got a prescription for a cough syrup.

86
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,960
I want to cough. I never squat. What
in the fuck. But here's the thing.

87
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:19,530
Then it may be, I mean, look, some
people are barely holding on to reality.

88
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:20,750
You're right.
Barely.

89
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:25,751
You're all in it is one fucking smack one
one smack upside the head and all of a

90
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:30,860
sudden, oh no. Sweet
Utah Hot toss off tie.

91
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:34,790
You took a former beauty pageant.
Has Foreign Accent Syndrome.

92
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,720
Okay. Former beauty queen.
Let me hear it baby.

93
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,670
And I'm terrible with accents.
Okay.

94
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,930
So some people were wondering where I
got in the accent from. It's really,

95
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,160
really crazy story.

96
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,500
Foreign accent syndrome is a rare
condition that only affects crazy people

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,990
still speaking their native language.
Uh,

98
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,030
let me hear her this week. Started off
with listening to this. She's never left.

99
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,440
The USA doesn't last.
This was her accent. Okay.

100
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,770
Hold on. Hold on. Stop
backup. Backup. Is that weed?

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,130
Sure is weed. That is good. Fucking weed.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,910
That is a gigantic, we'd plant behind
this bitch. She's high as fuck.

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,020
Playing with these people. Oh, she's
playing with his people. This lady's high.

104
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,710
She's barbecued term or what?
Your weekends.

105
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,020
She got so high she
thought she was British.

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,640
Hi.
Yesterday,

107
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,630
which is a September 17th,

108
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,150
2011 I started having problems with my
voice. Oh my God, I've got the same one.

109
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,340
I tried to talk and say some things
Matano fucked like it was right.

110
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,080
I had someone ask him again about my
accent. So I just making a new video.

111
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,890
I had a headache for about three
days, got arrested, emergency room,

112
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,850
and this was in May of 2015 and so
they put me to sleep, observed me,

113
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,440
stop, pause this. This is nonsense. This
is like, people think they're a Fox.

114
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,730
You can't,
you can't pick,

115
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,860
you can't stay in the one
accident cause you don't know yet.

116
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,960
No one can call people crazy anymore.
