1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
Larger people. They're eating better.
You know what I wanted to ask you please.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,790
Conspiracy theories. I know you
have some. Yeah, I got something.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,340
I felt like I was listening to you about
what is something about Martians the

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,850
other day that was a proud
Papa Johns Jones is Alex. Alex,

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,770
amazing NASA shirt. I was gonna
buy for Eddie the other day. Yeah,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,310
Alex wore a NASA. Yeah. Yeah. Hey Eddie,

7
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,200
believe she had that even
Alex thinks is ridiculous.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,250
Like what quits conspiracy theories do
you want to know about it? No, I'm like,

9
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:33,150
let me hear some, well, I believe
less than, less than I ever used to.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,900
Population control. Do you believe
that? No, I don't believe that.

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,230
I don't believe there's
any concerted effort. Um,

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,470
it like where there's a bunch of
really rich people that have decided to

13
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,490
euthanize a bunch of people to keep
the population low. I think that is,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,740
that's paranoid. I think that
there's probably some people that go,

15
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,680
you know what? We would be a lot
healthier if there was less people,

16
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,560
but there's no,
there's no obvious effort.

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,880
The population keeps fucking growing.
Imagine if you are the all powerful,

18
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,760
all knowing people that were running
the world and you're doing such a shitty

19
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,320
job of population control.
Yeah.

20
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,870
I don't know how you're going to
control the India and China. You're not,

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,010
you're not.
You're not.

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,760
You're not getting in these fucking dirty
villages and trying to stop being not

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,660
doing it anywhere.
And even in this country,

24
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,990
people are fucking like wild
animals and just come in next month,

25
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,750
you guys got three kids. Yeah.
Like, look, it's just the way it is.

26
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,690
Mad People like to fuck.
They like to make people in China.

27
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:27,780
You're only allowed one kid. No, I think
they lived that. They've left lifted,

28
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:31,210
lifted that because a lot of people were
drowning their daughters. There were,

29
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,990
there was horrible shit.
Wow. You're killing, I mean,

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,100
this is the rumor was that people were,

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,900
they wanted a son and if they had a
daughter they would, you know. Yeah.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,710
The daughter was like the law,
the law. The lose for you. Yeah.

33
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,070
And to me a daughter is a win because
there's so much easier to deal with.

34
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,170
Really. I find with my daughter,
I'm, we're, we're like this.
Yeah. You know what, man?

35
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,240
I mean,
just be of a boy coming next.

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,100
You got to have the ying and the Yang.
Little Joseph Lennox Lewis.

37
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:03,900
Peter's coming next month. Hey,
I'm Joseph Lennox Rogan Peters.

38
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,020
He's going to be amazing. I'm so
happy that you gave him my name. Yeah,

39
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,420
that's beautiful. Cave at first is
going to give me your middle name,

40
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,050
but I didn't want to do that to him.
So what's your middle name? Whoa. Yes.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,670
My middle name is Claudius. Claudius.
Yeah. That sounds like a Roman emperor.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,360
Absolutely beautiful. Hey Man,

43
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:23,910
I know you're supposed to get out of here
at two o'clock. Do you have a hard out?

44
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,940
No, no. You can say. Yeah, absolutely.
Beautiful. Let's keep talking. Yeah. Um,

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,230
yeah. So back to your
question. I don't, yeah,

46
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,890
I think there's definitely some people
that are influencing the way the world

47
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,820
works for sure.

48
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,660
But I don't think there's anybody that's
really trying to control population or

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,473
this one.
Okay.

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,570
Do you think the Russians put Donald
Trump in the president's chair?

51
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,810
I think the Russians absolutely wanted
Donald Trump to win. Absolutely.

52
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,870
And I think they definitely undermined
our democracy through various methods of

53
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,680
manipulating people through social media.
In fact,

54
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:03,670
I have a woman coming on very soon. When
is Rene de Resto this week? Next week.

55
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,660
She's on next week. And uh, she
actually studied it and wrote,

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,820
wrote this very
comprehensive report about,

57
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,821
it was on Sam Harris' podcast and detailed
millions of interactions with Russian

58
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,680
bots and Russian fake accounts and that
these troll farms that we'd create memes

59
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,200
and they did,
they did a bunch of different things.

60
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,810
They didn't just try to pump Trump up,

61
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,640
but they also tried to get people
against each other and cause all sorts of

62
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,100
civil, uh, arguments and all
sorts of, uh, on rust. Yeah.

63
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,970
All sorts of unrest online.

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,180
They organize these meetings like they
organize one pro Texas meeting across the

65
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:45,670
street from a pro Muslim meeting.
I did it on prime,

66
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,520
that did it all through Facebook to get
these people to fight with each other.

67
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,230
They're doing these things to try to get
people to take sides and to get people

68
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:57,520
to be angry at the other side. They did
a lot of shit like that. Real sneaky,

69
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,690
sneaky stuff that we probably do
in foreign countries all the time.

70
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,561
And you know,

71
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,140
we're mad that they're doing it to us
because now they're doing it through

72
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:05,560
social.
Yeah.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Well if you think about when we were
growing up in the eighties seventies and

74
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,410
eighties all the imagery we saw,

75
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,460
the USSR was very dark and gray and it
was very barren and it was destitute and

76
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,190
well, some of it was true though. Yeah.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,790
But we saw and then all of a sudden
that lifts and these hot fucking Russian

78
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,010
chicks show up.
What were these bitches is the whole time.

79
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,760
That's so true.
You never saw the hot Russian league.

80
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,950
There's some of the
hottest women on a plan.

81
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,180
They used to show us these big manly
women will do well. And now you're like,

82
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,200
well, hello. Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

83
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,210
I have two friends in America, Russian
ladies. They're very happy. No,

84
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,850
the question cause because you're
American, everything. I'm not American.

85
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,930
So is this wall, if we're going to get
built towards that, what's the situation?

86
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,970
I don't,

87
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,320
I think it was more of a campaign
rhetoric thing. You know,

88
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,730
build that wall, build that wall.
He's kind of staying with it. I mean,

89
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,880
I think he wants to porters, I think
he's got a kind of do something right.

90
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,670
Once you say that, you're gonna build a
wall, you got to kind of do something,

91
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,060
but they ain't shit been built and
we're two years into the president.

92
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:13,930
They haven't built shit.

93
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,590
I was a year left in the year and a half
left in the presbytery is some wall,

94
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,320
there's some wall. It's up. But
there's all some big ass gaps. And the,

95
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,590
the idea that they're going to stop drugs
from coming over from that wall right

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,930
now, the wall looks like Leon Spinks
his mouth. I don't have a bench.

97
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,880
I forgot about Leon spanx.
