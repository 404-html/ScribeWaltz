1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,110
Yeah. Wow. So, I mean, listen,
there are people, uh, you know,

2
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:07,780
at 10 years on the show,
I was on the show for a long time.

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:10,780
There's people lot longer.
It's people that did the whole 17 years.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,640
People have done well over a hundred,
you know, no one left that show.

5
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,620
You don't leave that show
if you get a spot on it.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,100
Were you with him when,
when it ended?

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,810
No. Uh, no. I was with him, um,

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,000
about a week and a half
before. Uh, so now, uh,

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,460
good friends that were there.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,050
I was in, um, Chicago and uh,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,200
I've woke up and the check my phone
and I got a text from my friend Maynard

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,180
Maynard Keenan
from tool and um,

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,020
Maynard is a Jujitsu brown belt and
really loves Jujitsu. Any, any, um,

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,440
the text me, he said so much for the, uh,

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,780
Maynard versus Anthony Bordain
celebrity Jujitsu match

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,900
and that's the whole text.
And um,

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,170
you know,
just sunk,

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,210
sunk a pit in my stomach and I just,

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,040
I just picked up my phone and went into
Google and I looked it up and I saw it.

20
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,300
I'm just like,
oh fuck.

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,640
I just couldn't believe it.
I couldn't believe it.

22
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,790
Now I just
started crying.

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,520
I think. I think I called my wife
had called Maynard or texted him.

24
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,670
I called my wife,
called a few friends,

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,240
you know,
just like,

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,320
you know, just couldn't believe, you know,
when someone's just not there anymore.

27
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,410
I didn't get to see him a
lot, but I was just, uh,

28
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,410
just appreciate the fuck out
of that dude. You know, like,

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,500
I don't want to do anybody's TV show, but
when I got a call from him, I was like,

30
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,530
fuck yeah,
what are we gonna do?

31
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:11,500
We're gonna shoot pheasants and hunt
and camp and we're going to cook by the

32
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:15,190
campfire. Fuck, I'm in,
dude. You know, I'm in.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,190
I just really, uh, appreciated
him as a, a genuine,

34
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,660
unique person. Like is
a genuine, rare person.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,350
And uh, you know, that's,
that's what I got out of being,

36
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,260
being able to spend some time with him
and being able to talk to him and pick

37
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:39,340
his brain. And he did my podcast once
and we always planned on doing it again.

38
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:39,570
We should,

39
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,120
we never got around to it because
we're both have ridiculous schedules,

40
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,040
but just my,

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,690
I would think about things differently
because of him. Like got my,

42
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,780
I would sometimes like hold things to
his standards and e j like legitimately

43
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:59,080
his appreciation for things,

44
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,130
his enthusiasm for things changed
the way I look at a lot of,

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,640
a lot of aspects of food and
culture and, and, and even travel,

46
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,013
you know?

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,600
Yeah. I mean, um,

48
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,693
yeah,

49
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,330
I'm sorry ma'am. And I, you know, I, and
I know he thought very highly of you,

50
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:22,310
and that was, that experience in
Montana was fantastic, man. So fun. Um,

51
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,460
you know,
it's been,

52
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,800
it's been a rough three months and
it's still hard for me to really

53
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:35,450
contextualize it and put it together. It
feels like, you know, upside down world.

54
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:39,440
Like there's no, and
he was such a, I mean,

55
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,650
it was a friend and a collaborator,
you know,

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,620
but also just such an icon to me,
you know?

57
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,410
Yeah.

58
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,390
And, uh, did, it's almost like, you know,
it's almost like the sun disappears,

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,320
you know, or something. It's something
that is so just inherently part of life.

60
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,300
They're in and dependable and you know,
um,

61
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,160
yeah.

62
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,900
So yeah, I mean it's been all right.
It's hard to describe how, how um,

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,510
profound that's been.
Um,

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,890
okay.

65
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,290
I remember when he got into Jiu Jitsu,
I got site cause I'm like,

66
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,680
we got more to talk about now.
I can actually,

67
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,600
I can actually show him some shit.

68
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,300
And he was always asking about things,
you know, he's really good at things.

69
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,000
Remember when we were in Montana,
we were rolling around on the dirt.

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,450
I know shown her stuff, him and Josh,
I was like click when you're in here,

71
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,960
like here's what you can do, you can get
the end. He's like, Oh yeah. He's like,

72
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,540
he was so a wide eyed,
you know,

73
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,330
I think it was before he even got his
blue belt or maybe it was like around blue

74
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:47,220
belt. So he was super, super jacked
about it and he was doing it every day.

75
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,570
I remember when we were, we were
filming, we were outside of billings.

76
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:55,410
Is that where we were? Where
were we? Yeah, well we're,
the hunt was on the hunt.

77
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:55,870
We were in

78
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,770
like a up in central Montana, you know,
so, um, we kind of started in billings,

79
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:02,840
but we headed up towards central Montana.

80
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,960
He was training so often in,

81
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,990
even on the road that
he traveled to a club,

82
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:11,470
there was just a Jujitsu club in
Bozeman. Yeah. And he found some guys.

83
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,930
And who's wrong with these guys in
Bozeman? Yeah, yeah, definitely.

84
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,200
Like damn you doing it every day. So that
was a day for a long time on the show.

85
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,930
That was a mandate. We
find the local, you know,

86
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,370
the local clubs and make sure that he
had a place to role texted me from some

87
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:28,500
European bloc country.
Said he was shitting bone bone chips as a,

88
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,300
he worked out with some old
school Carlson Gracie guys.

89
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,560
They don't believe in rolling light.
It's all top game and smashing you.

90
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:38,200
And he said, yeah, I'm shitting
bone chips. But I just,

91
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,230
I admired that a guy could be 58 years
old and decide I'm going to learn Jujitsu

92
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,890
and I'm going to be obsessed with it.
And then he became addicted to it, which,

93
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,250
you know, Jujitsu is a very
beneficial thing to be addicted to,

94
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,440
but it is absolutely an addiction.
I've,

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,100
I've come back from injuries where I
definitely shouldn't have been yet and

96
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,640
are just wrapped my arm up and just
fucking get in there. People get super,

97
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:04,880
super addicted to it and he got addicted
to it just like he's been addicted to

98
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,990
many things. He just, he jumped
right into the Jujitsu experience.

99
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,970
Um, well I'm glad he
did. It wasn't me anyway.

100
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,400
It was clearly like really
good for him to us. I mean,

101
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:20,840
I know very little about your jet,
so I know what I know from Tony,

102
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,260
you know, little slim. Yeah.
He lost all that weight.

103
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,920
All of sudden the out of stocks packs
up smoking. Yeah. You know, those were,

104
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,300
those were big things, man. And uh,
and he looked great and he's, you know,

105
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,920
he got off statens.
It's no longer on any sort of medication.

106
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,780
He lost all that weight, caught all
the carbs out. It was just eating like,

107
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,250
you know, just protein crazy man.
It looks so good. He did look good.

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,280
Um, he did look good. Then
I also just, I, you know,

109
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,840
the whole thing was kind of
indicative of the way he was. I mean,

110
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,910
he did things so passionately,
you know,

111
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,210
whether it was travel the
world and soaking up all
these experiences or Jujitsu

112
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,730
or whatever, if he was into something,
if something caught his attention,

113
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,480
he was just so aggressive about knowledge,

114
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,820
learning what he could, pulling everything
out of it that, that he could, you know,

115
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:17,170
it's crazy to see someone do something
that's that physically demanding. Yeah,

116
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:20,960
no kidding. 58 with no background
in athletics of the law. Yeah.

117
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,810
Like you could see when he was like,
even when he was doing things,

118
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,680
like when he went to curt,

119
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:28,260
Osi Anders place and was rolling around
like he doesn't have a background in now,

120
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:31,910
but he's just pushing himself
to it. Yeah. Yeah. And again,

121
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,760
I think that was true with
everything, you know? I mean, if he,

122
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,370
if it was something that was interesting
to him, he just went, he loved it,

123
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:44,600
man. It was crazy. And I said, you
know, I remember texting him going like,

124
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:49,100
how deep you getting into it?
He goes, real fucking deep.
And he goes, but he goes,

125
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,680
he goes, I'm getting tapped
out every day. But he goes,

126
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:56,090
I'm giving guys half my age
of real struggle. And he
goes, uh, and I'm loving it.

127
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,520
Yeah. And he talked about that a lot. I
mean, I think he talked about like the,

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,600
the failure as much as anything else.
I'd love that. Yeah. Going in and,

129
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,590
you know, getting smashed. Yeah. But you
know, again, to his credit, you know,

130
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,000
which show up in these places,
you know, Bozeman, Montana man or,

131
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,490
or Butte,
you know what I mean?

132
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,320
I think he rolled in Butte know a hard
hitting town. Man, listen, I love beauty.

133
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,710
I love you too much respect
to anyone from Butte. But man,

134
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:29,710
that's a hard hit in town. You know, you
can roll into real cowboys, you know,

135
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,640
and uh, and get the shit kicked out of
him and show up on set all, you know,

136
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:38,430
sore, bruised and, oh man. Oh yeah.

137
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,350
And then just jump into that. You know,
it's different for a guy who's 58.

138
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,030
I mean you got a guy who does it at 20.

139
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,050
I admire anybody who does Jujitsu cause
it's a real humbling ego dissolving

140
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,470
experience and a lot of ways cause
she's makes you realize like all your

141
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:53,630
illusions of how well
you can defend yourself.

142
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:57,390
They go out the window and
some just chokes you easily
and you're like, oh great,

143
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm just a bitch. Wanted around running
around this life thinking I'm a man.

144
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,050
But the fact that he did it at 58 just
showed what kind of a unusual duty was.

145
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,180
Yeah. But would you just
talked about there? I mean,

146
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,300
what you're talking about with like the
ego diminishing aspect of it. Again,

147
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,650
I think that that was something that he
took great pleasure in. And I think that,

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,400
you know, if you look at the way
he went through the world, um,

149
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,040
one of the things that,
you know,

150
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,150
I appreciated right off the bat and one
of the things that kept me around as

151
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:31,950
long as I stayed around, you know, um,
cause the fact that it took, you know,

152
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:32,461
for Tony,

153
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:37,461
I think that he was constantly
trying to dismantle that persona.

154
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,160
You know, to say like, I'm, I'm
not the focal point of this scene.

155
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,110
The what we're interested in here,

156
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,210
what I'm interested in
talking about is out there.

157
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,450
That's the camera's pointed away from me.
You know,

158
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,640
he was kind of a clearing house for all
that information and he was the root of

159
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:01,020
the show and it was his journey.
But you know, ultimately, you know,

160
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,060
what was refreshing as he wasn't like
working with some celebrity or hosts that

161
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:10,560
was completely consumed by their own
ego and their own, you know, brand and,

162
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,780
and how they were presented to the world.
That's so disgusting right now. Yeah.

163
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,950
Tears. But it's, it's everywhere.
It's everywhere. Yeah.

164
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:21,951
He was very self deprecating and he
had reverence for real artists and real

165
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:26,070
masters and total reverence.
Yeah. Came across. It came across,

166
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,230
I texted him about some guy,

167
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,290
there was a photo of a restaurant and uh,

168
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,990
I'm sure it's still on my phone.

169
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Some dude who's like a real famous guy
who's like some big time chef character

170
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,580
and I was eating in this restaurant. And
so I'm like, who the fuck is this guy?

171
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,660
I guess it seems like it's a
big deal. And so, uh, I, uh,

172
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,790
I texted him the photo, this cat right
here. Yeah. Do you know that guys?

173
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,980
Was that guy's name? So
I said, who is that guy?

174
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,890
Says Marco Pierre White Made Ramsey
cry like a bitch all the time.

175
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,580
Original rock star, chef genius,
mad man, the original punk.

176
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,660
But that kind of texts, like that's,
that's a Tony Board game text. Um,

177
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,810
that's,
that's what that,

178
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,580
that text shows that reverence
for the master. Oh yeah.

179
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,060
You know, I mean, even the
way he phrases it, you know,

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,410
made him cry like a bitch all time.
Original rock star, chef Genius Madman,

181
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,810
you know. And, um, and that's
the way, I mean, what was,

182
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,060
what worked about that is he had a,

183
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:34,680
like an instant ability to sniff
through the bullshit, you know, so,

184
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,740
you know, there's, listen, there's
all kinds of famous people,

185
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:39,060
celebrities and you know,

186
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:43,110
well accomplished people that he met
that he didn't feel that way. You know,

187
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,110
he would cut through that shit instantly,

188
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,610
but if you were on his radar in that way,
you know,

189
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,160
it's like total commitment to
what you do and you were in

190
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,600
or you're out the Anthony
Bordain click. Exactly. Dude.

191
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,260
You want to be in that list
of people is like, yeah,

192
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,800
that's a cool list to be on. Well I just
remember hanging out with them, you know,

193
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:07,600
like I just,
it was one of those guys,

194
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,510
he was one of the ones that I met
that I was like pretty starstruck.

195
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,510
Like right away I said something
really stupid. Like my wife says,

196
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:17,440
you're my boyfriend. Cause they've
watched his show all the time.

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,860
She would just joke around how you
want your boyfriend on TV? Like,

198
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,090
he's great guys, great,
leave him alone. But, um,

199
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,450
like, uh, when we were in Montana,
that's when I really, well,

200
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:29,830
I always knew how hard he went,

201
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,760
but when I was blasted out of my mind
and he was like, where's that bottle?

202
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,380
Where's those joints? And I
was like, Jesus, man. Like,

203
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,990
I can't even know I'm hanging
onto the earth here. Well,
I was a late night. Yeah,

204
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:45,730
it was that one. I mean, I'll listen
to their, like in all fairness,

205
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,840
not every night was
quite like that without,

206
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,750
we had a lot of fun that night for sure.

207
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,630
It was real fun and in
a really interesting,

208
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,400
thoughtful dialogue around the campfire
with super land townie from backwoods

209
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,920
country hunters and anglers and all this,
the other guys that were with us, right,

210
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,290
you,
these guys who,

211
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,030
it was good to get a different perspective
on what going out and getting your

212
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,850
own wild food is like, yeah. You know,

213
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:13,500
and then having him cook it there and
it was delicious. It was awesome. And,

214
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,950
but also being able to put those ideas
on like a major network and print,

215
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,050
pretty rare.
Man.
