1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,570
Look, I've got some notes here
and, and all I want to say is this,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,390
I want to play at one point that you
had about that. That was really good.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,090
You were saying that if you
sense yourself, he's just like,

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,460
I'll just censor myself a little bit, just
a little bit there to make this point.

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,140
We started the show but the actual auto,

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,490
you made it in the back start
over and it and it's right you.

7
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:22,380
We were talking and we were, first
of all, we gave each other a big hug.

8
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:23,430
We talked it out.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,250
We're both happy that we're not angry
at each other and then when we start

10
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,740
talking,
you made a really good point.

11
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,670
You said the thing is if you
sense yourself just 1% you say,

12
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,620
I'll just censor myself
1% that's what they want.

13
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,050
I'm going to make them happy and then
they're just going to keep moving it.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,330
They're just going to keep moving
it forward. Moving the goalpost,

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,540
moving the goalposts and providing you
with more money and giving you more

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,230
things, but keep moving it in a certain
direction and if you keep giving into it,

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,110
they're going to have a hold of
you and they can control you.

18
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:51,000
And that's how network
television got started.

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,490
If you really think about what
ned for network television is,

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,600
the reason why they don't swear and
they don't have explicit content isn't

21
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,180
because people wouldn't want to see it.
The reason is because the,

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,260
the advertisers won't let them. There's
a whole commerce aspect to it. It's,

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,520
it's not just, hey, you're the
CSI guys or hey, you're exactly.

24
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:11,700
And so now they've organized with
sleeping giant and immediate matters.

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,440
A couple million people that call and
threaten and attack anybody and then

26
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,110
notice Joe, once they're
done with me, now it's Joe,

27
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,470
you better not have this person on or
you better have that person on and show

28
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,590
what is your goal?
What is your destiny worth?

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,610
And I always thought I was smart because
I got to analyze politics and history.

30
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,690
I was kind of socially retarded.

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,450
And so I'll think you'll
have to say that anymore.

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,870
Exactly what I was and so that's what
I'm getting at is the biggest liars

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,940
without people to know the truth.

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,230
I don't come up with some cold blooded
calculation about what I think's going to

35
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,620
advance my personal life. I really
care about people and the process.

36
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:53,340
I've seen things wrong. I've grown,
I've heard people, I apologize. Listen,

37
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,800
that's true. That's true. What
you're just saying about you,

38
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,050
and this is one of the things that
I've always tried to explain to people.

39
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,440
If people get mad at me for knowing him,
like I have a great time with that guy.

40
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,710
Every time I see him,
you and I have had a great time in Austin.

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,600
We had a great time with the UFC.

42
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,660
We've hung out a numerous comedy
shows that I've done in Austin.

43
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,250
I've done your show 20 years ago.
We've had a lot of fun together.

44
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,940
And so when when people get mad at you
about sandy hook or about anything,

45
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,480
I just go. Even when he's, even when
you were mad at me, I wasn't mad at you.

46
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,320
I was like, I just got to
talk to them. They're like,

47
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,550
it's one of the reasons why Eddie Bravo
got the two of us to talk yet once we

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,610
talk and just be honest with each other,
we'll be fine.

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,080
And I want to clear this up because
when I was going big guns on you,

50
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,000
just so you'd know what
it's like to be judged,

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,900
I thought that you probably
never had any show.

52
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,090
It was not an attempt to get
back on your show. Listen, I,

53
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,030
I knew that if I had gotten to the point
where you're that upset that I must

54
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,670
have made mistakes too.
I'm not,

55
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm not that person that sees things and
always points in the other direction.

56
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,160
I pointed my, I'm a fucking
ruthless self critic ruthless.

57
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,050
I'm terrible. Like, so I beat
myself up about every house.

58
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,080
I'll flub one word on stage and I'll
sleep through the Ami tossing and turning

59
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,070
me. Send this to you. And again,
self doubts, a good thing.

60
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,140
It's just not going to be
a narcissist and crazy. Um,

61
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,060
I got offered at the time like
$5 million with a bitcoin.

62
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,300
I think it was like $38 billion by the
time it got there. I refused it. And I,

63
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,980
and I got told like eight years ago,
I got told by two different people,

64
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,980
a very well known rich people.
They said Jordan Charles,

65
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,830
like she wants to work with you and
Alexandra Soros and his other Soros.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,570
You just need to stop attacking.
Mm. And, and by the way,

67
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:38,170
we want you to pump bitcoin,
which may I believe in cryptocurrencies.

68
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:40,540
I believe it's the future. And we had a
private Federal Reserve. It's all Fiat.

69
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,270
I'm not judging anybody,
I'm just saying be careful.

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,560
And I was showed dumb back then.
I don't need even say so dumb.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,350
I was not in the current mindset,
the way the world worked.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,850
Like I knew how politics worked and I
knew how science worked and I knew how

73
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,030
crypto type, you know,
government and CIA stuff worked.

74
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,710
But I was like never trying to get a deal
for myself. I had my own thing. Right.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,610
So then I looked back in retrospect where,
where that was going on.

76
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:11,080
So when I saw you, it was
my breaking point. Go, Hey,

77
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:13,820
Alex Jones is full of
crap. George Soros, uh,

78
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,200
was a victim of the Nazis and the
Holocaust. And that's not what I said.

79
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,340
I didn't see your full crop. I said he
wasn't a Nazi. I go to the story that I,

80
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,120
I watched the interview and I don't
know what he did. He know the guy.

81
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,760
I don't know him. I don't know.
I've know very little about him.

82
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,080
But what I remember from the story was
that he was saying that when the Nazis

83
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,750
occupied,
he was with his,

84
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,930
I believe it was his own.info
Godfather his godfather,

85
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:41,170
and took him around as a Christian
and pretended he was a Christian.

86
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,530
Whether they were stealing from these
Jews when they would take take there.

87
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,620
And he just thought it was normal
because he was 13 years old.

88
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,070
But he was talking about it,
that he was shielded by this person.

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,130
I would be willing to take his
explanation is what I'm saying, but,

90
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,260
but, but, but, but here's the difference.
Even before that happened with you,

91
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,010
I got approached by a
major Hollywood actor, uh,

92
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,580
that my name's Herbert associated
with. And they said, listen,

93
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,150
George Soros told me to tell you that
he'd been killed if he didn't do that and

94
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:16,630
that and that and that. He did what
he had to do. Right. And I shed.

95
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:20,980
You tell George if somebody
put a gun to my head and shed,

96
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:25,030
we're going to kill you if you don't help
round up Joe Rogan's kids and put them

97
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,970
in a concentration camp, I'd
say, Oh yeah, I agree with you.

98
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,710
I've got the gun away and kill him.
Did he say,

99
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,340
he just said it was just
taking property? No, they were,

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,780
what do you think was even Nazi show up?

101
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:38,020
Take your property and then you don't go
away. I don't know. I mean, I don't know.

102
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,110
We know what happened in
Romania and Hungary but,

103
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:43,910
but Joe [inaudible] what he was saying,
they have headlines saying, okay,

104
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,590
so you're saying you think
that it was more, no, no,

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,020
he did an NPR interview. I'm not
trying to go indict George Soros. Okay,

106
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,110
well here's where I fucked up cause I
shouldn't have even said anything about it

107
00:05:56,111 --> 00:06:00,830
cause I don't know much about it.
The real absolute honesty I've seen.

108
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,170
I've seen a couple of interpretation when
I was horrible to interpretation from

109
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:09,590
me. I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about it was incorrect. Sure.

110
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:13,640
So when I'm 14 and I, in retrospect,
if somebody shed, we're going to,

111
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,250
you're going to help round up your
community or we're going to kill you.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,650
I would have tried to kill people that
were trying to kill people. I get it.

113
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,860
Not Everybody's like me and I'm not
trying to the top of sky around.

114
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,050
I think I've proven, I'll go up
against people. I get, you're 14,

115
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:31,550
you're scared and you helped the Nazis.
He was show arrogant about it.

116
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:32,930
He said it on NPR.

117
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,280
He started on 60 minutes and then I
learned you're being sued because you did

118
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:39,020
this. This is why he's financing. Well,

119
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,630
I'm not going to stop shaking
it because of that. I get,

120
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,390
he was in a bad situation.
The problem was if you play the clip,

121
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:47,390
he says it was the best time of my life.

122
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,050
It was happy making. Uh, it was,

123
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,830
it was invigorating to be there
with all this evil going on.

124
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:59,060
But I was with my father and I had faith
in him. And so we were able to do this.

125
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:02,690
And then I went and looked at
the logs and the records of him.

126
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,900
He was like going around looking for
Anne Frank's man and getting their money.

127
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:08,630
And Alan, yeah, he got the
money. There's some like I'm not,

128
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,420
I'm not even just run up a
white flag to George Soros.

129
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,430
George Soros overthrew all these
different governments towards swirls,

130
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:18,860
tried to crash the pound.
George Soros is the,

131
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:22,460
is the art type of James Bond
Villains and the fact that his money,

132
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:25,400
so I remember being a kid when I was like,
uh,

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,330
eight years old. My mom always
had a color TV in the kitchen,

134
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,070
but she cooked three meals a
day. Can I stop you? What do you,

135
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,300
what are you saying that
he's like crashing economies.

136
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:40,100
And when I was a kid watching PBS and
maybe they were lying, maybe he's great.

137
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,780
George Soros was an international currency
speculator who overthrew governments,

138
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,140
you know, booty. Yeah. But that's
what I'm saying. What do you, what,

139
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,000
what are you saying over through
governments? Like, what did he do?

140
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,040
I literally know nothing. Well,
here's what I'm going to tell you.

141
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,710
This is actually a declassified. You
know anything about George Soros? Jamie,

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,550
they'll type in George Soros
crashing the pound. Let me tell you,

143
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,130
born in George Soros is view.

144
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,790
After World War II,
he got hired,

145
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,540
brought to the u s he worked for the CIA.
LSS before that.

146
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,940
In his view, from his perspective, he
admitted he doesn't Brag about this.

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,230
George Soros is the guy willing
to take the money and DB it out,

148
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,870
and he's a very bold guy because
he's really small. I mean,

149
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,060
I'm not kissing his ass her, get him
on my back. He's not gonna stop me,

150
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:26,090
wants to hang my hat on the wall towards
while it does have 150 why does he want

151
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,700
to hang your head on the wall?
Because I went after him.

152
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:29,840
But the point is it doesn't matter.

153
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:34,760
George Soros ran the breakup
of the Soviet Union. George,

154
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:34,930
I've,

155
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,930
I've had the former head of of of you
got Jamie kind of thing type deal.

156
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,780
George Soros tried to crash the pound
the pound.

157
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,100
Anyways, guys, let me tell you, I
told you they got human pig hype.

158
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,570
You'd be putting them in it. Okay. I
told you they're keeping babies alive.

159
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,590
You saw the governor said George
Soros is highest level deep state.

160
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,110
He, he is the manager or was the manager.
Are you shooting of a secret payment?

161
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,860
Things you're saying,
I actually know,

162
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,490
but how do you know if he
leaves the research? He ran the,

163
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:13,080
cause I'm not the auction was 10
years ago he ran the Marshall.

164
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:17,280
We got here, George Soros break the Bank
of England mixed a little bigger police

165
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,010
in Britain.
Black Wednesday,

166
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:23,430
September 16 prior to the day of
the speculators broke the pound.

167
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,510
They didn't actually break it,

168
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,200
but they forced the British government
to pull it from the European exchange

169
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:32,530
rate mechanism. Joining the
erm, the king, the euro,

170
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,760
the pound, the euro, scrolling up please.

171
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,570
All those to depart from the European
currencies, the British pound, blah, blah,

172
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:39,770
blah.

173
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,620
Compounding the underlying
problems inherent in the
pounds inclusion in the erm,

174
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm not seeing this.
Where's the part where George Soros doses?

175
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,180
Well that's just what you
pulled up. I mean, but I'm just,

176
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,300
I'm just trying to find it.
That's all I'm saying.

177
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,770
Spotting of the writing on the wall,

178
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:57,270
Britain updates interest rates to
teens and attract people to the pound,

179
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:01,680
but speculate is George Soros among them
began heavily shorting the currency the

180
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:05,250
British government gave in
and withdrew its erm, the erm,

181
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,900
as it became clear that it was
losing billions trying to, boy,

182
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,320
it's currency artificially, although it
was a bit of a bitter pill to swallow,

183
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:18,210
the pound came back stronger because the
excess interest in high inflation force

184
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,120
out of, as you go to investors,
PDA like it's the boss. Hold on.

185
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,830
There's films about the Soros,
Soros,

186
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,820
Soros pocketed $1 billion on the deal
and cemented his reputation as the

187
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:32,250
premiere currency speculator in the world.
Now,

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,270
if you're a currency speculator,
isn't that what you do though?

189
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,410
I don't know what a currency speculator
does it. I don't want it. Here's the deal.

190
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,300
George Soros works for the works for the
people that run our government and he's

191
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,720
a guy willing to do at all and
he's been very successful. Okay.

192
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,280
My point is two plus two equals
four in my, in my equation.

193
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,560
You don't fight the Nazis because
you're 1314 you think you can't.

194
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:02,160
You join him. And he says, he talked
to me about the investment. I, I,

195
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,640
if I wouldn't have done it, someone
else would've done it. That's a quote.

196
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,720
It was happy making good. If you help
roundup Jews and take their property,

197
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:13,530
don't say it was happy making you don't
talk about it. So my point is him,

198
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,450
Shango you, you think the way he describes
it, even as a problem, it's problematic.

199
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,250
It disturbs you the way
he's describing that.

200
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:23,330
It was happy making that it was not a
big deal if I didn't do what other people

201
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,720
have done it.
That's a problem.

202
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,370
What I'm telling you is I'm going to
get off into Soros, is that if you,

203
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,450
if I had five minutes over there on
Jamie's computer, needed a good job.

204
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,310
Jamie does a great job. I'm
just saying it. Pull stuff up.

205
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,050
He's a goddamn Google wizard. Look at
him. LE, he's been beat me at quick too.

206
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:40,830
It's very frustrating.
