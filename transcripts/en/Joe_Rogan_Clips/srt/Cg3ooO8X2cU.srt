1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,700
What you're saying is one very important
point that we need to move past the

2
00:00:03,701 --> 00:00:05,360
military gatekeepers of technology,

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,700
right? Though it's, it's big tech,

4
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,670
which are at advertising agencies,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,140
things that are constantly
predicting your next purchase,

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,820
right? Yeah. Cause if you,
if you think about it,

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,060
and I'm in even in a semi democracy look
like we have in the u s I mean those

8
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:32,640
who control the brainwashing of
the public in essence control who,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,770
who votes for what and who controls
the brainwashing of the public is

10
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:41,330
advertising agencies and who increasingly
are the biggest advertising agencies

11
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:46,331
or are the big tech companies who are
accumulating everybody's data and using it

12
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,310
to,
to program their minds to buy things.

13
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:53,690
So this is what's programmed the
global brain of, of, of the human race.

14
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,640
And of course there are
close links between big tech
and and the military. Look,

15
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:03,230
look at how Amazon has, what,
25,000 person headquarters
in Crystal City, Virginia,

16
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,840
right next to the Pentagon.
And then I'm in China.

17
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,540
It's even more direct and unapologetic,
right?

18
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:13,541
So it's a new like military
industrial advertising complex,

19
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,260
which is his guiding the
evolution of the global brain on,

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,810
on the planet,
which

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,630
not with this past election,
right.

22
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:27,631
With all the intrusion by foreign entities
trying to influence the election that

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,400
they've,

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,400
these giant houses set up to write bad
stories about whoever they don't want to

25
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:35,830
be in office.

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,180
Yeah. In a way, that's almost
a red herring, but I mean,

27
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:42,820
the Russian stuff is almost a red herring,

28
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,010
but it revealed what the processes
are, which, which are used to program.

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,370
Oh.
Because I think the,

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,580
whatever programming of the American's
minds has done by the Russians is many

31
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:59,250
key minuscule compared to the
programming of Americans' minds, by, by,

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,480
by the American American corporate
and government elite. Right.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,800
Say That anybody's even
jumping in as well and elite.

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,330
Sure. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

35
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:14,740
it's interesting if you look
at what's happening in China
that's like, yeah, yeah,

36
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:19,570
yeah, yeah. They're, they're
way better than the, than we
are as much more horrific.

37
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:24,490
Right. It's more, it's more professional.

38
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,170
It's more polished. It's more
centralized. On the other hand,

39
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,180
for almost everyone in China, China's a
very good place to live. And you know,

40
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:39,181
the level of improvement in that country
in the last 30 years has just been

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,710
astounding, right? I mean, you can't,

42
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:46,030
you can't argue with how much better it's
gotten there since Deng Xiaoping took

43
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,490
over. It's, it's tremendous
because they're not,

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,100
they embraced capitalism
to a certain extent.

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,930
They've created their own unique system.
What labels you give it is,

46
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,980
it is almost arbitrary.
They,

47
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,690
they've created their own
unique system as a, you know,

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,980
crazy hippie, libertarian,
a narco socialist, freedom,

49
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,750
loving maniac.

50
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,970
That system rubs against Migraine in many
ways. On the other hand, empirically,

51
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:17,650
if you look at it, it's improved the
wellbeing of a, of a tremendous number of,

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,910
of people.
So hopefully it evolves.

53
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,940
And the way it's evolving now is
not in a more positive freedom.

54
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,860
Love. Well, it's not in the more
freedom, loving and an archaic direction.

55
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,760
One would say it's positive in some ways.

56
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,960
Negative and others like most complex
things. Why do you live there? Um,

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,430
I fell in love with a Chinese woman.
She's amazing.

58
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,360
She has great reason. We had a baby
recently. She, she's not from Hong Kong.

59
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,680
She's from mainland China.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,970
I met her when she was doing her
phd in computational linguistics.
