1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,380
So much money. Yeah, I drove by the one in
I, it's Kinda like the silver lake area.

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,280
Hollywood man. They've got a lot
of money. Did you read going clear?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,200
It's, there's, there's a lot of
what's, what's good about crazy,

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,920
what's good about crazy and about being
like if you have a fucking purpose in

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,210
life, man, it doesn't have to be
rational. But if you have a purpose,

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,930
if you've like a clear
directive in terms of, you know,

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,500
l Ron Hubbard says this and so I'm
just gonna listen and I'm going to push

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,350
forward and I'm going to stay positive
and I'm going to avoid the negative

9
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:35,100
people when I'm going to use all these
tools in order to maximize my performance.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,240
All good shit work. Yeah. All
good. It could be to your thing,

11
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:41,400
some made up nonsense. And by the way, if
you read anything about it, by the way,

12
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:43,710
when counts around and start
saying, by the way, by the way,

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,810
you read anything about l Ron Hubbard,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,210
they essentially think
that he was self healing,

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,250
that he was creating his bat shit crazy.
He was having me doing an inventory.

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,060
How his brain works.
Like that's what he did.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,210
He took a detailed inventory over
many years of how, how every I'll,

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,790
how the minutia of his brain worked and
he really category, he cataloged it.

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,790
That's why a lot of some
of it, he borrowed a lot of
like old systems and stuff,

20
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,380
but some of it is,
I works,

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,050
I love you made everyone were
like navy fucking to help.

22
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,130
It's like the commanders
were like in AP fucking out.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,580
But if you think about
Christianity focused the
European and American mind for a

24
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,540
long time,

25
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,700
everybody was on the same page and it
was very easy to kind of move things

26
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,660
forward as a uniform body. Nobody
kind of disputed what the truth was.

27
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,200
That's a recent Hubbard, I
feel like with Scientology, um,

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm pretty sure they're signups are
going down because of research and with

29
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:40,920
everyone see org.
Oh my God.

30
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:45,240
Apparently that little design is cash the
front. Yeah, it is. What whoop your ass.

31
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,270
You get on the line now. Yeah.
He's beat the shit. He made
some shit up. Yeah, right.

32
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,040
Yeah. Like if you're like, oh, so I show
your hands down, just fucked up today.

33
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,190
Like beat your ass, kicked people's
ass. Apparently it was that.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,220
Who was that said that David Miscavige
his dad. Is that his dad? His Dad.

35
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:02,280
And then also on the document talking
about how abusive and the book is crazy.

36
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:05,340
He goes into detail about David
Miscavige. Yeah, Tom Cruise kicking then.

37
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm sorry, what was his dad's name?
Ron. Ron Miscavige. Sorry Ron.

38
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,210
He tie rod the podcast. Oh,
interesting. Made me sad.

39
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,250
It doesn't talk to his son. You
know that, that, that, that,

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,630
that's the thing that made me the most
sad that the dad and the son don't talk

41
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:20,730
to each other.
We over some nonsense.

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,470
The best thing I ever heard was, I'm a
guy I knew who was a teacher and he was,

43
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:27,770
had scientologist and had been
for 23 years and somebody said,

44
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:30,590
are you a scientologist? And he kind
of caught off guard and he said,

45
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,230
well let's examine that for a sec.

46
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
I've taken classes there for 20 years
and I've found enormous benefit from some

47
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,790
of them and some of them,

48
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:45,650
and I've paid money for some of
my found zero benefit from so, uh,

49
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:48,710
and, and I, and I put into practice
some of the cults, the, you know,

50
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,230
some of the courses and stuff.
So if that makes me a scientologist,

51
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,870
I guessed I am. It was kind of a
good answer. That's a very good deal.

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,890
Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's, there's, you
can get that out of a lot of things. Sure.

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,260
There's a lot of things that
are like that, that have
some nonsense in him. Yeah.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,410
But I think people operate really well
when they have like a scaffolding,

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,710
like a structure that they
have to follow the Brit. Yeah.

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,020
And then they have a purpose.
They think there's a Po,

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,680
a positive action to their directive
and that there's going to be some grand

58
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:18,880
plan that they fit into
perfectly because of their work.

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,970
Know wrong with that either.
Listen, man, if that works for you,

60
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,590
it's bullshit until the contract breaks
out. But it's just if you bill, yeah,

61
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,520
right. Look at Leah Remedy.
I mean Leah Remedies,

62
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,540
she has the worst fucking
person over the [inaudible]

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,380
crazy man doesn't get off. She
doesn't give a fuck. And she's,

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,210
she likes being that girl that scared,
that's her. She likes that role.

65
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,940
It's almost like she was
designed because he like,

66
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,670
it didn't make sense that she was in
Scientology to begin with when I met her.

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:51,911
Right.

68
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:56,440
Because when I met she's like this take
no bullshit east coast chick and is also

69
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,170
beautiful. So I was like,
Huh, she's a scientologist.

70
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,080
I always got along with her always.

71
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,240
She was always very friendly but there
was always this like be careful don't

72
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:06,630
same thing. Stupid jokes.
Like all right, Jesus. Yeah,

73
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,990
I still the same way I had such
the same way she had so much power.

74
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:11,621
So here's the thing,

75
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,890
if she's got all this machine that
she'd just say about the book,

76
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,400
but she's got all this like she's got
all this like brass and the weight.

77
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,830
How does she get sucked into
that? Well, she was a little kid.

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,390
That's how she grew up in it. She got
sold a bill of goods and so she was like,

79
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:28,920
wait a minute, boy. They should have
kept her. But how does Tom Cruise? Yeah,

80
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,610
they live with Tom. I knew they
get, how'd they get Tom Though?

81
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,290
Like Tom wasn't that young. I
was very young. He was very,

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,630
how they get them and John Travolta.

83
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:40,360
Well I think people want
something that makes it look,

84
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,940
I bought the book I bought Diane,

85
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,810
I bought it through a late
night at 1994 son pre internet.

86
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:51,280
I was at home chilling and my apartment
in north Hollywood and I was like, damn,

87
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:55,270
this sounds like they're making a lot
of sense here and it doesn't make sense

88
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,480
the Laba,
but some of it does.

89
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,930
What are you 35 okay.
I'm 50 15 years older than you do.

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,820
You've got to think, you don't
really remember before the Internet.

91
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,510
You're like an infant. Yeah. Okay.

92
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,950
I was here as a grown man when the
Internet hit in 1994 but before that you

93
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,750
would get late night infomercials.

94
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:20,140
You'd be buying fucking squeegees
and Shit and pre selling.

95
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,130
I was pre cell phone bro. Yeah.
When I met, had a landline phone.

96
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,510
Now I know you guys were older,

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,890
but I'm just telling you this is dianetics
was something you'd see on late night

98
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:33,070
television and it was really compelling
because you can't do any research do it.

99
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,800
There was no Google, there
was no, there was no youtube.

100
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,000
Eddie Bravo would have been
his boss. Eddie knowledge. No,

101
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,300
but it's just what all of us.
No one really knew.

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,010
This is how a lot of things snuck through
this. You are curious all the way.

103
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,830
No, no, no, no, no. I never
went. We never thought,

104
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,370
we never thought that Arnold
Schwarzenegger or semester
salon or any of those

105
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:58,380
people were doing sterile shut the fuck
didn't I was seven and knew that before.

106
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,840
I knew they were doing stairs.

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,200
When I saw Rambo two I just thought
that was from weightlifting. No,

108
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,890
I knew it do steroids. When I was in
high school. I didn't think I didn't.

109
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,510
I didn't know that Hollywood, I didn't
know when you see demolition, man, I,

110
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,250
I just thought, I was like, dude,
how'd they get so fucking cut?

111
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,600
I've got to start working out. I
didn't know that. Right, right.

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,450
Maybe because I wasn't in the workout
world, but I mean I really, he's,

113
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,060
back then all of us were naive to
steroids. We run, the word is, fuck.

114
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:27,230
Here's the thing is, man, we,
you could find out like, okay,

115
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:30,590
what is Scientology based on? You could
find out, you could find in, okay,

116
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,540
does chiropractic medicine work?
Right?

117
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,100
You could Google stuff now and you can
look, okay, does fluoride cure cavities?

118
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,990
We didn't get,
we didn't get an answer,

119
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:43,610
but we might be able to get a sense
and you also get a sense of like,

120
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:47,390
here's the critics of Mercola,
this is what their perspective is.

121
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,280
Here's the critics of this natural
pathic site that might say some unfounded

122
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:56,110
things about vaccinations are
about, so there's always some, it's,

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,420
you can get a sense,
yes, but you, you lease,

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,230
you have a chance in 94 dude,
when I commend you to have a chance,

125
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:05,270
not a chance to Anthony Robbins cassettes.

126
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,330
I had a fucking vinyl
thing and you open it up.

127
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:11,690
I have all these different cassettes
and I would listen to those by the pool.

128
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,690
In my shitty apartment and room. Tony
Robin, didn't you get a lot from it?

129
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,960
I got a lot. Got a lot. He's
leaches. Fuck, I got a lot of shit.
