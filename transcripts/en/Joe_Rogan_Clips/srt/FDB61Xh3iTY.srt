1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,910
Right? I love that
fight. Marvel studios do.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,280
Superheros are they?
If they run out of superheroes,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,790
get this shit on my people at this rate.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,090
I don't know who is this in Samuel
Jackson is a different superhero now. Who?

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,050
This is at the end of the Avengers movie.
Hey Samuel Jackson.

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,740
Say No to some captain marvel.
Well, who is, wait a minute.

7
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,050
Captain Marvel's a girl and she and
she brings all of them back to life.

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,050
Wait a minute. Who was captain marvel when
we were kids? Uh, dude, wait a minute.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,010
I'll look. I don't know. It's
amazing that it's not a trans woman.

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,930
That would be dope. That's what
they're going to be enough trans.

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,280
Who's a weightlifting champion?
Come sit down and cheese.

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,730
No cheese. People get mad. People get the
cheese chewing on the microphone. Sued.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,320
We're pros, man. You guys
are tear a couple of one,

14
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,150
two pros.
Cheesy dude.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,780
If you didn't bring stuff in
provolone fresh. Okay. Okay. Hey,

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,710
how about this fight? [inaudible] Huseman
versus Tyron Woodley. I love that.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,260
That's March 2nd. Come on it. He's
our second watch guys, come, come,

18
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,800
come to Vegas. Okay here. Captain
Marvel was a guy in a girl in the kid.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,240
She was hot. They just picked
one. But that's from 2017 men.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,200
This is when it's already been
diverse. 19 nine Captain Marvel, dude,

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,940
give me type in 1992
Spiderman and captain marvel.

22
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,310
1956 when I was about this, this
spider verse movie that just came out,

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,820
it's like only a four
year old Spiderman story.

24
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:40,710
It's if it's not some old
thing they brought back.
That's cute. That's a cartoon.

25
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,310
The captain captain. Marvel's old
school. No. Yeah, but what are those?

26
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,880
Spiderman is like a duck,
right? He's a pig bro.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,540
It's a great movie.
Best movie I've seen in a long

28
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,760
term.
Bruce Lee into a superhero like powers.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,410
My kids said Nate to the fucking legos
movie and when you want to see the lego

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,180
movie that played out,
it's good.

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,270
We've seen the other ones. My son loves
the Lego movie. Oh, it's the new one.

32
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,100
Both of them. A new one just came out.
How many have there been there? Only two.

33
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,130
Really. So cool. That Batman's a douchebag

34
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,403
girlfriend.
Right?

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,560
And then the girlfriend because Han Solo
pulls up in the Millennium Falcon and

36
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,830
mistake, wait a minute. This
is the old captain marvel,

37
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:36,831
but he was Zam Zam Zam also known as
captain marvel terms in marvelous.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,000
She's dude, if you held a gun to my head
and asked me is Shizam DC or marvel?

39
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,930
I would have said cities DC for
sure. Yes, yes. Do you remember?

40
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:49,800
That's what I was trying to say.

41
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,730
There was a captain marvel character in
the DC comics universe from back then.

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,970
I don't know. That's what you remember
the marvel as one that existed.

43
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:00,340
So that's the confusion. That's
just an movie. Looks like.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,570
Is it like someone from dela Torre
are fighting someone from the UFC?

45
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,910
It's confusing, dude. All I know,

46
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,800
she comes back and you know how
everyone died in the last one. Spoiler,

47
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,600
it's been up for an hour a year,
so fuck off.

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,120
She brings everyone back to
how the fuck she do that.

49
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,010
That's the comic books dude. Do you
remember in a Lego movie when Batman,

50
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,900
he leaves his girl to jump
in the Millennium Falcon
with Han Solo and Chewbacca,

51
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,810
and he says later,
so he jumped in,

52
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,470
he thought he was going to party like in
space, and then he comes back. They go,

53
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,620
what happened? He goes,
turns out that wilkies a dude

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
that was fucking hilarious.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,810
There was no chicks because there there's
no chicks on the Millennium Falcon,

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
the android to to dig
marble 1968 but scroll down.

57
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,240
First appearance was the image
of a female. The girl 68 wow.

58
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,480
This picture from 2012
but here's the deal.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Girls weren't built like that back then.
They're building. It's a new thing now.

60
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,140
Those are you. Scroll down. Let me
see that image. That's all. I got.

61
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,790
A Primo crossfit chick. That's
legit. That's a new version of her.

62
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,530
Oh, that's 2012 yeah, that's a
UFC fighter chick. Right? Okay.

63
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:15,640
That's what they used to look like. Wow.
There's multiple captains on a marvel,

64
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,970
so captain marvel, sometimes a guy,
sometimes a girl. That goes both ways.

65
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,810
It goes both ways and you will know,
can relate to it. We're just like, hey,

66
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,160
whatever, whatever. But
they run a silver surfer.

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,310
There's so many superheros that they have
like 10 different ones on Netflix. Man.

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,250
A man,
shit,

69
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,020
fuck fucking Tommy wasp girl or some shit.

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,890
I can't fuck with that. Or aqua
man, get that shit out of me.

71
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,990
This is a good fight to Brian
Barbarina in [inaudible].

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,780
Luke K is a good fight if we didn't
watch miles jewelry. Let's be real. Oh,

73
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,030
this is a good fight now for sure.
This is a good one. That fight miles.

74
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:52,840
Jury did a few late. Did
feel, feel decision. Yes.

75
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,400
I didn't even watch the decision.
Well, we watched the flag.

76
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,000
We were taught the decision. Oh
Shit, Brian, but marina, good, right.
