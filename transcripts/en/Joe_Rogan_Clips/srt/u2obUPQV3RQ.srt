1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
Yeah, it's a problem. You know,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,290
like when you're thinking
and talking at the same time,

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:07,110
there's a bunch of words bouncing around
in your head and you're just trying to,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,160
and you think you're saying the right
thing when you're, you know, it's,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,280
that's why intent is so
critical. George Carlin. Yeah.

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,250
And magic words are so fucking dangerous,
you know?

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,370
And that is what I'm going to
tell you about later. Yeah.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,430
You know about a specific
comedian that we know and love.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,660
Well,
George Carlin was absolutely amazing.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,930
Well, he wa he would, not only
was he absolutely amazing,

11
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,570
but people don't have to you,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,600
you almost have to have lived during the
time where he was getting arrested like

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,750
Lenny Bruce before him.

14
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:42,980
But to understand how significant he
was when he was doing that seven dirty

15
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,490
words, you can't say on television.
Like back then people were like,

16
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:48,620
what the fuck is this guy doing?

17
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,440
Nigger, I was, I was far left men skin
tight, black, you know, sheruts the virus.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,910
Uh, you know, the virus, punk rock
bands, Antifa lag, things like that.

19
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,890
I was trying to think of,
it's been so long.

20
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,280
I'm trying to think of some of the band
shirts we used to have. And uh, man,

21
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:07,030
we were, we were angry and pissed off
all the time. I grew up like that.

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,040
And then over time I learned,

23
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,140
I went through a ton of
really important life lessons.

24
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,860
One of the first and most important was
I was a young skateboarder in Chicago.

25
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,320
Really looked up to some of these
older guys who were really good.

26
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,540
I went to Catholic school
when I was younger.

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,100
I ended up becoming this punk rocker
guitar playing far left skin tight,

28
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,210
you know, skateboarding, angry, Eh, no
flags, you know, fuck the government.

29
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,630
And then I go to, this dude's house
was just really great skateboard.

30
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:34,420
He's got a picture of Jesus on the wall.
And I immediately scarf like, um, um,

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,310
you know, high MIT. I was
like, I was like, what do you,

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,220
what do you like a Christian or something?
And he goes, no. And I was like, then,

33
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,040
why'd you have a picture
of Jesus? And he goes, oh,

34
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,380
I just thought like a story about a
dude traveling around helping people was

35
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:49,370
kind of cool. And I went, oh,
that's a good point. Wow. I was,

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,540
I was like, I was like, wow,
maybe I don't really understand.

37
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,420
Maybe maybe this means something
different to other people.

38
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,740
That show means to me.
Well,

39
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:01,650
if Jesus was an Indian man that
had wooden beads and you know, and,

40
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,590
and was a, a Hindu God, we
would love him. You know,

41
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,540
it'd be like Shiva Vishnu.
We would,

42
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,280
we would think he's the
most amazing thing ever.

43
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:13,900
It's the fact that if you look at what
Jesus preached and what he was all about,

44
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,960
I mean it seems pretty Ra I think it's
about is spiritual and loving and it's,

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,910
it's about, I mean it, his,

46
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:25,570
his whole ideology that the
Jesus of the Bible. Yeah.

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,350
And he was essentially about loving your
brother and treating people as if they

48
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,210
are you.
And,

49
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,250
but this, this for me,
like I bring this up,

50
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:37,690
cause it was kind of a formative moment
where all of a sudden I realized was my

51
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,670
ideology predicated on assumptions was I
was I holding these views because other

52
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,160
people told me to hold them. Right.
That I actually understand it.

53
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,020
There were some positive
things on the other side.

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,270
And then I slowly moved over to more of
a center left position. And you know,

55
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,560
now what w the reason I bring this
up is I looked, I watched that video,

56
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,320
I tweeted this, the video of George
Carlin, cause man, George Carlin, uh,

57
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,060
I used to watch this video was my,
my,

58
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,390
my mom would put them on and my mom's
been a hippie liberal, far left,

59
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:07,700
all that stuff. And you'd
probably consider a conservative
by today's, you know,

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,620
measures the way things have been going.
Now they look at, you know, Kevin Hart,

61
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,570
he said a bad joke 10 years ago. Get
'em out. Like, could you imagine, I,

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,240
God forbid, what would happen with George
Carlin's routines today? They wouldn't,

63
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,730
they would be running all of
his old routine saying, no,

64
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,130
you've got to ban him from the shows.

65
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,060
He literally called
these people the n word.

66
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,720
Why was it that George calling go onstage
and talk about how Republicans were

67
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,560
dom and how religion is crazy.
He was clearly on the left his whole life.

68
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,580
And he said these things that by
today's standards would be considered

69
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:39,010
conservative. Right. And so for me,

70
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,370
it's a weird thing to go from
being on the far left as a,

71
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:45,070
as a young person that was around
like 19 or 20 I started to become more

72
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,610
moderate and then to see them
today being extremely offended,

73
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:52,660
like people used to be in the fifties
and sixties to go from being on the far

74
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,111
left as a,

75
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:55,810
as a young person that was around
like 19 or 20 I started to become more

76
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,350
moderate and then to see them
today being extremely offended,

77
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:01,330
like people used to be in
the fifties and sixties.
