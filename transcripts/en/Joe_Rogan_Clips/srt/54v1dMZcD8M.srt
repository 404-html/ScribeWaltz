1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,600
You know, like to say that you've never
dated anybody who's over six foot five,

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:06,540
well, you're tall phobic. Right.
That's, that's a ridiculous statement.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,300
That doesn't make any sense. You
know, to say that you've, uh,

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,450
you've never dated anybody that weighs
more than 300 pounds. You, you know,

5
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:16,380
you're a, you're a mass phobic.
That's ridiculous too. Yeah.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,910
It's just all of it's stupid. It's all
stupid people telling him. But this,

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,060
what they're doing is,

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:26,061
it's a bunch of people that are pushing
this idea of being open entirely open to

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,040
all things trans,

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,140
that you as a heterosexual person should
not just recognize that this is a woman

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,920
because they chance for furred
from a of male to a female,

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,600
but recognize even if they haven't
transferred and recognize them in terms of

13
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,760
sexual selection in terms of a date.
Right.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,840
And that's just fucking stupid
because you can decide, right?

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,350
You're not into certain things. Like I'm
not really into girls with short hair.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,350
You could decide that it's not my thing.
I don't like girls with shaved heads.

17
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:58,020
I don't find it attractive.
Like a woman can say that too.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,170
I don't like guys are creepy
mustaches and nobody gets mad at him.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,300
But if a man says to certain people,
I'm not in to chicks with Dicks,

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,510
then that guy's a piece of shit.
Or what about,

21
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:14,400
there's a thing called sexual
racism where you specifically,

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,340
you know, I'm not attracted
to a particular, you know,

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,580
I don't like Asian men. I
don't like black women. Right.

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,570
You're not supposed to instantiate
those sexual preferences.

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,160
If the racial queue is the one that's
causing you to either be attracted or not

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:36,030
attach to someone, what do
you think of that? Um, well,

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,550
there's certainly beautiful
people of all race,

28
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:42,240
so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense
to me in terms of the person selection.

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,270
Like if you tell me you've never
seen a beautiful black woman, right?

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,790
Like you crazy.
Like you have met enough black women.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,020
If you tell me 17 a beautiful Asian
woman, like what? What are you saying?

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,740
Like there's beautiful
people in and there's also,

33
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,510
you should be allowed to, to be with
whoever you want in terms of not,

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,800
but why is it, it's always sex,
right? Because like obnoxious people.

35
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,910
Here's the perfect example.

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,760
I don't like friends that are
loud and get drunk in public. Oh,

37
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,650
what are you drunk phobic?
No, I just don't enjoy that.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,720
So like in terms of sexual selection,
that's on the dates.

39
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,790
I tell you why that analogy might fail.

40
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,650
And some of the progressive's you could
alter your level of obnoxious snus.

41
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,400
You could grow out of your boxes as well.
I know some people conceivably,

42
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,220
theoretically, I know some people
are fucked. That's just who they are.

43
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,030
Fair enough. Or you want
to name any names? No,

44
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,610
but your race is a immutable part of you.
Okay.

45
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,480
That's the perspective. I see that. I
mean I'm, I'm playing devil's advocate.

46
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,970
I'm not, I'm not agreeing
with it. Okay. Well what about
a tall versus short? Right?

47
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,311
You know what,

48
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,430
if you're a woman volleyball player and
you're six foot three and you don't want

49
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:51,300
to date a guy was five feet tall, you
know, are you, what are you, what are you,

50
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,051
by the way,

51
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:54,900
that is one of the biggest problems of
being a very tall woman because one of

52
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,650
the,
one of the,

53
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,800
so there's something called assorted of
mating and evolutionary theory sort of

54
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,010
mating is basically birds of

55
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,880
a feather flock together.

56
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,620
And that's very much the mechanism
that drives may choice much more than

57
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,580
opposites attract.

58
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,900
So one of the sorts of mating cues
that people most assault on his height.

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,010
So it's not so much that women want
guys that are only six foot or taller,

60
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,680
it's just that the woman wants
a guy who's taller than her.

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,950
So if you look at the, there is a study
that I've discussed in the past, uh,

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,080
that looked at something
like 720 actual couples.

63
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,980
And I think there was only a single
one out of the 720 where the woman was

64
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:33,610
taller than the man. Now once a woman
gets to be over a certain height,

65
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,170
she's six foot two,
six foot three,

66
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,090
her potential pool of prospective
suitors really shrinks.

67
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,680
And so if you have a daughter,

68
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,710
you really want to pray that she
doesn't get too tall because boy are her

69
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:48,670
choices going to be limited because few
women want to date the shorter guy than

70
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,210
them. Yeah. When you're at six
foot three, six foot four woman,

71
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,220
that's gotta be a tough spot.

72
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,760
You're basically relegated to big
athletes are big exact people. And the,

73
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,351
the nick,

74
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:02,710
the other place where you get this sort
of a sort of May thing is where you get

75
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:07,600
women who are super educated, uh, that
makes sense. The exact same thing happens.

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,090
The more educated a woman gets,

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,120
the worse her marriage prospects because
the more sophisticated women are,

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,300
the more they insist on a high
status male. And therefore,

79
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,580
as I get more educated as a woman,

80
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:24,430
there are just fewer men who
are as educated or more than me,

81
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,510
and therefore I'm doomed
to a life of solitude.

82
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,150
That totally makes sense.
That totally makes sense.

83
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:34,810
Especially considering that men,
you know,

84
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:39,811
in general they get insecure around
women who are more successful and more

85
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,160
educated or more intelligent.

86
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,600
Like very rarely are men comfortable
with a woman who has to explain things to

87
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,760
them. Absolutely. Yeah. By the way,

88
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,730
I think I have another theory which
I'd like to at some point test,

89
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,140
maybe someone will steal it now.

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,190
So when you have a couple
that gets married very young,

91
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,680
they are judging one another based on
their mate value at 18 or 19 right.

92
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:07,000
So Tony is the high school quarterback
and so he's the hot guy and I'm the

93
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,400
cheerleader and then later he stagnates.
He doesn't go on with his career.

94
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,550
Whereas I go on and become a physician.
I am a cheerleader.

95
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,940
So at 29 there is not a huge inequity
between our two mating values on the

96
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:22,330
mating market.
Right.

97
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,710
So when we were both 19 the fact that
we had roughly the same may think value

98
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,740
made us a very attractive,
stable couple.

99
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,420
But Tony turned out to be a fucking
loser. Exactly. He's a lame duck. Exactly.

100
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,760
And so I so I have a theory that,

101
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,000
and I'd like to at some point tested
maybe some graduate student will write to

102
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,460
me saying that I'll work with this on you.
The doctor side,

103
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,730
I have a theory whereby I think that in
many cases where people end up divorcing

104
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,090
when they married young,

105
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:54,390
it's precisely because that which started
as equitable mating values at time t

106
00:05:55,181 --> 00:06:00,140
zero turned out to have huge in our
trajectory on the mating market and that

107
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:04,970
puts a huge strain on the
marriage, especially when
the wife status is going up.

108
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,290
That the best way to ensure that the
marriage ends as for the status of the

109
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,430
woman to keep going up and that of
the man to either stagnate or go down,

110
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,130
that's going to be

111
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,870
doomed. That makes sense. It May.
It makes sense that also, you know,

112
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:23,290
obviously the young marriages are rough
because people grow and they don't

113
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,520
necessarily grow together.

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,210
We you catch people 10 years later and
they're oftentimes radically different

115
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,340
people.
Right.

116
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,000
But then there's also the
thing that women don't seem to,

117
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,670
for the most part, respect a man is
not doing as well as them. Right? You,

118
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,040
that's a, that's a giant issue.
Even if the guy's doing okay,

119
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,420
like say if your guys making $50,000
a year, that's a very good living.

120
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:47,830
He's out there doing well,

121
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,250
but you make 300 let me 300 grand a year
and this fucking losers over here with

122
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,720
his 50 grand,
like you're kicking ass.

123
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:59,320
You'll like some big wig at
some big corporation like that.

124
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,070
That seems to be a real sticking point.
And with men,

125
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:07,170
especially if they have a household where
they contribute income together, they,

126
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,070
they pile all the income
and the man starts spending
the woman's money on stuff.

127
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,350
You know,
he starts buying stuff.

128
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,820
You've got a new fishing rod and what
did you get that with your money or my

129
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,800
money. You know, it gets weird. Right?

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,610
And incidentally, uh, so speaking of say,
consumer psychology stuff that I study,

131
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,810
when you take a very rich woman
and you go out on a date with her,

132
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,840
even though she obviously can afford the
dinner and she can afford anything that

133
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:37,010
you're going to buy her, if you
exhibit cues of frugality, cheapness,

134
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,430
that's the perfect way to ensure
that you won't have a second date.

135
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,840
So it's not so much a question of
uh, you know, it's an old sexist,

136
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,510
the ritual whereby men were wooing women.

137
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,490
It really is an honest signal
of your commitment to, to
a woman. So the best way,

138
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,350
and I get many of these
letters where people ask me,
hey professor, what are you,

139
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,500
you know, you know, dating advice.

140
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,040
Well you do have to exhibit generosity
when you go out with that, I mean,

141
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,130
nuptial gift giving them,
she'll give, giving.

142
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,020
Is it sort of the fancy term for
courtship rituals across animal species?

143
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,730
So many species,

144
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:15,731
you have typically the male engaging in
some form of courtship gift giving and

145
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,100
depending on the quality of the gift,

146
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,090
will determine whether the female will
mate with your not while so much of what

147
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,850
we do in marketing context
is exactly that, right?

148
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:30,060
It's the exact same phenomenon repeating
itself in the human context, right? Uh,

149
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,930
uh, engagement rings, right?

150
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,490
The fact that you are supposed to spend
a quarter of your yearly salary on this

151
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:40,500
rock, is that really what it
is? Yeah, that's what I'm,

152
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,070
I don't know if everybody meets it,
but that's right. It is that right?

153
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:46,820
It's three months. Exactly. God, when
you say a quarter of the yearly salary,

154
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:50,510
it makes you just go,
what in the fuck is wrong with people?

155
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,140
But there is so much money, but
here's the, but here's the reason.

156
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,320
Here's the reason you ready? It's, it's
what's called is the Javian signal.

157
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,750
I don't know if I've ever
discussed this in this,

158
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,790
in this podcast is a Javian signal is
basically the idea that for a signal,

159
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:09,780
to be honest, it has to be
costly. Otherwise everybody
could imitate it. Right? So,

160
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,010
so think about, for example, rites of
passage in different cultures, right?

161
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,530
If you want to demonstrate
that you're a top warrior,

162
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,420
the rite of passage has to be
brutal. Otherwise, if it's only,

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,240
we all have to do five setups
than every male could do it.

164
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,170
And then the females can determine the
pretenders from the real guys, right?

165
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,460
So you have, for example, bullet ant,
do you know this one through, right?

166
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,380
You put your hands through, right? I mean,

167
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,200
that takes a lot of
courage and capacity to,

168
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,300
people don't know what
we're talking about.

169
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,270
So this is a tribe in the Amazon
whereby you take the bullet,

170
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,100
ant is supposedly the,

171
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,960
the biggest purveyor of pain
that is humanly possible
that you could experience.

172
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:51,310
My friend Steve gets done by one,
did it and what did,

173
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,710
he was in Bolivia, I believe. And uh,

174
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,270
he got stung and uh, in his heel, got
them in the heel and he said it was just,

175
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,750
he was delirious. What's happening?
He said it lasts for a few hours,

176
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,740
then it goes away.
Right?

177
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:09,630
So what they do in this tribe is they
take a bunch of these ants in the order of

178
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,730
a couple of hundred. One is enough
to cause you agonizing, impossible,

179
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,820
delirious pain. And they
said, date them through this

180
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,470
compound. Uh, and then they enter,

181
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,110
weave them in these gloves,

182
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,470
these a leaf gloves so that
when they're coming to,

183
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,100
they come out of their stupor
and you have your hands in there,

184
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,460
they start viciously biting you,
stinging you,

185
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,170
and you're supposed to withstand
that pain without screaming.

186
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,070
You have to take it. And so you sort of
almost go into this religious fervor,

187
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:48,840
this kind of uh, incantation.
And you have to do that ritual,

188
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,880
20 separate occasions,

189
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,200
the tech 20 different times
on different days, 2020,

190
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,130
before you are admitted into
the tribe of Warriors, whatever.

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,890
Well now let's think of back
to the engagement ring, right?

192
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,170
If all it takes for me to convince you
of my honest intentions is to buy you

193
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:11,370
flowers. And now let's go back behind
the shed and you know, have sex.

194
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,450
Well then a lot of cheaters are going
to convince you of doing this when they

195
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:16,680
really didn't have good intentions.

196
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,660
But if it takes for me to spend a quarter
of my salary to convince you that I

197
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:22,830
have on us,
so therefore,

198
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:26,550
this is a form of what's called as a
hobby and signaling because the Harvey was

199
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:30,450
a Israeli ornithologists that
studied this type of behavior,

200
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:34,800
this costly signaling behavior using
Arabian babblers, which is a type of bird.

201
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,690
So here's another example of
as a hobby and signal, uh,

202
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,120
you probably have seen this, uh,
when you have a Predator, uh,

203
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,190
that's looking at who to attack,

204
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,550
you often will have gazelles starting to
actually make themselves conspicuously

205
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,280
visible to the Predator. They come
close him, they start jumping from,

206
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,500
have you ever seen this gentleman,
and I think it's called stroking,

207
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,860
not strutting. And can you
think why that would be? Like,

208
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,160
why are they not hiding? Why are they not
making themselves? Uh, in conspicuous.

209
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,550
Why?

210
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,550
Why are they drawing attention
to themselves when they
are 50 different gazelles

211
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:16,180
that the Predator could be pointing
to? Why? Well, because what it's, what,

212
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,240
what that animal is saying is the fact
that I could stand here in front of you

213
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,910
and jump up and down and make myself this
visible suggests that it's probably a

214
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:32,860
lost cause for you to try to go
after me. I'm super fit. Right?

215
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,960
It's a costly signal of my fitness.
It's an honest signal,

216
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,853
right?

217
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,450
The one who is not doing this behavior
is the one that you should be paying

218
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,880
attention to. Ah, so this is called,

219
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,480
and so I use this principle of as a hobby
and signaling to explain things like

220
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,070
conspicuous consumption,
right?

221
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,350
The reason why you buy the fancy car
that the other males can't hope to

222
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,100
purchase,

223
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,660
it's precisely because they can't
afford to match your signal.

224
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,920
Therefore,
it's an honest signal.

225
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,100
The reason why I buy $100 million painting
that a monkey could have drawn shows

226
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,510
how wealthy I am,
that I could waste $100 million.

227
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,190
Ah, that makes sense. That makes
sense. It's all just meeting stuff.

228
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,270
It's mating and food.
You don't want to become somebody dinner.

229
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,600
You want to find dinner and you want
to have sex. Good night everybody.

230
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,061
Yeah.

231
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:31,900
Those signals are so fascinating when we
see them in our culture and people get

232
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,734
angry at them.

233
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,610
Like you see some guy pull up in a Ferrari
and you go look at this fucking loser

234
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:38,140
with as Little Duke,
right?

235
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,220
You're like maybe or maybe a guy with
a shit load of money wants to let the

236
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,270
world know cause he likes to fuck you.

237
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,720
Right. I've shared actually on this
show, I think the stories about my,

238
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,800
one of my brother's who was a big
car collector, three Ferrari's,

239
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,390
Aston Martin Ligand,

240
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,640
and I've even shared a story
which I'm happy to repeat, uh,

241
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,250
of we would go to
nightclubs where he's this,

242
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,920
this is the Olympia and this
is the five foot three guy.

243
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,970
And we would go to nightclubs and he
would pick the most beautiful woman and

244
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,450
approach her even though she's
accompanied by six foot four, you know,

245
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,990
tough fucking guy.
And he had that confidence.

246
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:20,390
I think because he had that
wealth catapulting him,

247
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,330
he certainly helps. It
certainly helps. Yeah. It's um,

248
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,630
it is a weird ever prevalent aspect in
the communication between men and females

249
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,290
is how much money does the
man have? Right. I mean,

250
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,650
and this is one thing that a lot of women
hate because they don't want to feel

251
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:44,370
like they could be purchased and
they can't. They can't. They can't.

252
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,180
Some can write a lot, Ken. It's a factor.

253
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,060
It's a big fee and a lot of women are
very rare, rabidly ruthlessly independent.

254
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,790
They don't want that ever in
their life and good for them. But,

255
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,170
but the reality is it's a
very effective strategy.

256
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:03,830
You pull up in that Ferrari or that
Rolls Royce or whatever the fuck you're

257
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:07,160
driving and it has a big impact
and you get to that nightclub.

258
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,540
And those studies have been
done endless sea and psychology.

259
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,830
So here's one example and you don't need
to have a signal as big as a Ferrari.

260
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,180
Just how you dress in terms of
the status that is exhibited to,

261
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,160
there's a study that was done
I think in the early nineties,

262
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,000
where they manipulated the
status, the, it's the sartorial,

263
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,440
the attire of men and women into one
of three different types, you know,

264
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:33,400
high status medium and you know, some tee
shirt or Mcdonald's uniform, whatever.

265
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,440
And then they asked men and women,
uh, one of six possible, you know,

266
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,680
would you go out on a w for coffee with
this guy? Would you go out on dinner?

267
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:43,330
Would you have sex with him?
Would you marry him?

268
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,720
And across all six
levels of relationships,

269
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,110
the status of the attire of a man had a
profound effect on the likelihood of the

270
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:56,110
woman saying, yes, hire the status.
The more likely she said yes.

271
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,440
That same manipulation on women had zero
effect on men and other words no man

272
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:08,680
has ever uttered the following words.
Words, my God, you've got a juicy but,

273
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,850
and I'd love to have sex with you, but
you're not exhibiting cues of ambition,

274
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,210
therefore no sex for you, Linda. Yeah,

275
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,850
that's a,
that's a reality.

276
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,830
That's a reality that people are very
uncomfortable with and I don't think women

277
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:27,510
necessarily are craving the same reaction
from men because of their ambition.

278
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:31,260
I don't think women are ever
sang through my ambition.

279
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:35,310
I'm going to get a good man. Right. You
know that just, it's just not a factor,

280
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,810
but they do say through my I ambition,
I'm never going to need a map. True.

281
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,110
That's because that's because,
look,

282
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,830
there's the reality is there's a lot of
shitty human beings out there and some

283
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:51,480
of them have penises and if you're a woman
and you run into too many of those or

284
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:54,420
for buy for whatever reason,
because of your environment,

285
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,010
because of your behavior,

286
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:59,910
because of the circles you travel
in your around too many of them,

287
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,230
a large dating pool of shitheads
out there. You know, you just say,

288
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,380
I don't want this in my life. I
want, I don't want to be like my mom.

289
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:10,260
I don't want to be like my sister.
I want to be independent.

290
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,150
But what you're not saying is,

291
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,980
I am going to get a or house and a
baller car and I'm going to get me a man.

292
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,970
And the only woman that I know of that
I've ever heard say that is disgusting

293
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,400
and the only woman that I
ever, she's like, you know,

294
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:26,460
talking about her success and our
success allows her to get men.

295
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,540
She's a foul beast.
Loud.

296
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,330
Yeah, she's not, it's not
healthy. A lot of women,

297
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,560
it's not so much at their interest.

298
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,940
I mean resources are good only to the
extent that they allow you to ascend the

299
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,560
social hierarchy, right. This,

300
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,250
this doesn't explain why some women are
attracted to the starving artists, right?

301
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:46,940
Because what, why are so
many women romanticizing
over the guy with the guitar,

302
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,200
but that's because they are choosing him
based on his future trajectory. Right.

303
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,333
I am.

304
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,210
I am banking on the fact that you exhibit
enough talent that I suspect that by

305
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,870
investing in you, by choosing you, it's
going to take me to that trajectory.

306
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,340
No woman has ever authored the
following words. You have no talent.

307
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,690
You exhibit no ambition. You're never
going to step out of the basement.

308
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,700
Let's have sex. Right? So, so it's not
that women are only interested in money.

309
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,160
They're interested in a panoply of cues,

310
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,990
all of which relate to the potential
of ascending the social hierarchy.
