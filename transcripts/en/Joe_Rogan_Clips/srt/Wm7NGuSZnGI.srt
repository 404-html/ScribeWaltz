1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,930
But what would doctor heard is talking
about is in the first chapter of the book,

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:05,370
which I guess you haven't read.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,800
Um, and I really should have a
copy for it. Stupid of me. Um,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,310
I got a copy of my bag.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,460
So that's really smart though.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,050
So this is fascinating to me.
The,

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,510
the British colonized India,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,630
and they set up what they call lunatic
asylum was really psychiatric hospitals,

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,450
sort of very primitive
psychiatric hospitals.

10
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:33,230
And they were really initially
for soldiers in the Indian
army and they were run

11
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,340
by British doctors.

12
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,500
And what these doctors really
as early as like the lead 1850s,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,070
1860s noticed was that a lot of the people
who showed up in these hospitals were

14
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:46,040
showing up with Cannop, what they
called Ganja. Actually in India,

15
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:50,840
it's called Ganja or bong, which is
a very weak preparation of a, of,

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,220
of basically, uh, uh, uh, Indian hemp,

17
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,580
just sort of low grade
cannabis. Um, and so,

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,180
and so they started counting and they
realized the 20 to 30% of the people who

19
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,710
were coming to asylums
were heavy cannabis users.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,380
And that was way more than alcohol.
It's more than opium.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,340
And it's really fascinating.
Doctor named, uh,

22
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,640
George Francis William Humans wrote a
book in 1908 and he looked at the evidence

23
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:21,440
and, and it is amazing to hear
how he described schizophrenia,

24
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,940
how he describes cannabis,

25
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:26,330
how he describes the cases of
violence around cannabis. It's like,

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,670
it's like any psychiatrist today.

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,870
Certainly any forensic psychiatrists
like my wife would, would like,

28
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,600
everything in the book
would ring completely true.

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,860
And it was so fascinating to me to stumble
on this and realize this is something

30
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:43,460
people have been talking about
for more than a hundred years. So

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,430
could we agree that there are some
people where cannabis is not a good idea?

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,980
Absolutely. Right. We can agree
that, I think we all agree.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,400
We're also agree that some
people can't eat peanuts.
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,540
And yeah, it's not the same thing though,
but yeah. You know why peanuts kill you?

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,880
That's, yeah, it's more dangerous. So
these like second 600 a year. Yeah.

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,940
People die from peanuts.

37
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,630
So I think more people die from cameras
as a result of that homicide and the

38
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,060
suicide. Okay. Well,
there's no correlation.

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,020
There's no paper that I know somebody
has got to do the work. Wait a minute.

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,220
But why are you saying that then?

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,300
Because I've looked at enough data to
tell me you think marijuana is causing

42
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,120
homicides. Oh yeah. This
is what the book is about.

43
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:31,140
But in how so and what was it causes
paranoia and psychosis in people.

44
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,410
And paranoid psychosis are huge
risks for homicide and schizophrenia.

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,210
Studies that refute that was noticeable
starting. No studies that refute that.

46
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,460
Paranoia and psychosis are
huge risks for homicide.

47
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,480
Schizophrenia is a 20 x 20 times Joe.
Well Jamie,

48
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:49,260
I sent you a document, uh,
yesterday. I mean there's,

49
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,840
there's multiple studies that show that,
you know,

50
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:55,290
marijuana laws are not associated
with any type of violence.

51
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,890
Marijuana law was just
talking about the drug.

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,130
So the use of the drug,
which could possibly trigger psychosis,

53
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,010
psychosis and schizophrenia,
which are correlated with murder.

54
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,830
Is that what you're saying?
They're not correlated their triggers.

55
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,510
That's absolute fact triggers because
of the paranoia and delusions and you

56
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,460
think that someone's out to get you and
they're not. Absolutely. I mean the,

57
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,750
the out of the numbers, the, okay,
so the numbers are, if you're,

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,450
if you're have a diagnosis
of schizophrenia, uh,

59
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,020
you are 20 times as likely to commit.
Homicide is somebody who's healthy.

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,010
Now it's actually worse than that for
cannabis. Okay? And here's why. What,

61
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,620
so the National Alliance for mental
illness and the mental illness address

62
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,620
advocacy groups hate talking about this,

63
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,940
why they hate talking about it obviously,

64
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,870
because it stigmatizes people with
mental illness. So what they say,

65
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,870
and this is true,
is if you have a diagnosis,

66
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,480
but you're taking your anti-psychotics,

67
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,270
even though the side effects might be
unpleasant, you're in treatment, you're,

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,180
you're,
you're not using recreational drugs.

69
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,250
Your risk for violence isn't that high.

70
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,910
It's not that much higher than a
healthy person. Okay? And you know,

71
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,580
fortunately healthy people
don't commit murder that often.

72
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,380
The problem is if you've, if you think
about the math for half a second,

73
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,760
if there's this one group of people who
don't have a very high risk for murder

74
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,880
or serious violence, who,
because they're not using,

75
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,490
because they're on anti psychotics,

76
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,530
it means that the excess risk in the
people who are using and who's untrue,

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,470
psychosis is untreated.
It must be spectacularly high.

78
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,740
And the numbers bear that out.
So,

79
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,530
so there's a really good
study from last year,

80
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,280
2018 it's small group of
patients in, um, in Switzerland.

81
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,310
Switzerland is a safe country,
has a low base crime rate,

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,440
but 50% of the people who were using
cannabis and had psychosis over a three

83
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,530
year period committed violence
in that group of people.

84
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,820
That's mostly 20 somethings.

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,710
Well, you know, there's, there's a
study here and I just sent it to, uh,

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,550
Jamie and it's, it's titled, um, risk
factors for violence in psychosis,

87
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,440
a systemic review and Meta analysis
of 110 studies. So, you know,

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,400
that's quite a few studies. Okay.
So, um, you know, let me just,

89
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,470
just read a part of it out too.

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,310
So violence was strongly associate
with a history of polysubstance abuse,

91
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,880
strongly associate with diagnosis code,

92
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:15,480
mid substance use disorder and recent
substance misuse and moderately associate

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,780
with it. History of alcohols misuse,
a history of substance misuse,

94
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,850
uh, recent alcohol misuse, recent drug
misuse and a history of drug misuse.

95
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,090
It was unclear if there was an association
between violence and a history of

96
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:35,080
cannabis misuse. So again,
this is 110 studies,

97
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,910
uh, they very carefully looked at at all
of the different risk factors as to what

98
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:44,170
could trigger violence. Just let me
finish Alex. And what they said again,

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,270
it was unclear if there was an association
between violence and a history of

100
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:53,030
cannabis misuse. Right?
So that's 110 studies. So

101
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,230
cannabis use in there is going to get
locked in with poly substance use because

102
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,720
a lot of people use are going
to be using other drugs. Uh,

103
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,960
Holly substance means multiple
substance, alcohol, cannabis, exactly.

104
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,500
Everything else was found to have
significant statistical signal.

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,280
And I have not just mine to study
that a doctor heard assignment.

106
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,170
I'd like to look at it
without looking at it.

107
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,140
I can't push back as hard as I would like.

108
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,350
What I can tell you is that I have
many studies in the book that show that

109
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:28,220
cannabis use is associated with
violence in people with psychosis. Okay.

110
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,110
And more broadly,

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,400
it's associated with violence in the
general population in large studies,

112
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:39,320
in studies of high school students and
bullying in studies of people who were

113
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,960
vacationing in Ibiza, in, in,

114
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,830
in studies of young men
in China and the UK.

115
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,730
There are big studies out there that
show cannabis use is associated with

116
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,420
violence, Ibiza, Ibiza.

117
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,920
It's been a busy place.
Let's say of ether.

118
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,980
I got grilled over there for that.
They get manager,

119
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,700
I suppose to just said it,

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,060
some dignitary or royal person had a lisp.
Right?

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,440
Isn't that how it all starts at true?
Yeah. Yeah. I believe so. Noted. Yeah.

122
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:19,441
The way the people in Spain pronounce
words was directly affected by this one

123
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:23,800
person apparently. But
um, so this, uh, these,

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,980
this correlation,
um,

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,670
between people that have
schizophrenia and using cannabis,

126
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,290
how do you,
is schizophrenia a diagnosis?

127
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,120
It's purely based on behavior

128
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,890
basically. Yes. It's a clinic. There's
no blood test can do a brain scan.

129
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,300
It's basically how you behave and,

130
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,280
and what'd you tell the doctor
about how you're feeling

131
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,790
and then what about our message?
Our eyes are,

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
it's very subjective because you're,

133
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,170
you're asking someone basically
a series of questions. I mean,

134
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:56,250
it's no different than, you know,
depression really. I mean, you, you just,

135
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:59,760
just asking someone a series of questions
and then you know, based upon that,

136
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,510
which is very subjective than you're
going to make a clinical decision.

137
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,980
Whereas when it's like a blood
test, like if someone, you
know, passes, uh, you know,

138
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,470
a certain amount of hemoglobin A1c,
you know,

139
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,910
depending on which
chart you're looking at,

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,210
then you're going to call that person
pre diabetic or diabetic. But, you know,

141
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,510
unfortunately we just don't have those
objective measurements. And again,

142
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:22,770
that's why, you know, Alex was saying
earlier that, um, that, you know, the, uh,

143
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:23,940
they couldn't really figure out,
you know,

144
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,640
how many people in the United
States had had schizophrenia.

145
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,730
And I understand that. But at the
same time too, I mean, it's okay to,

146
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,970
to adjust,
you know,

147
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:37,320
the way that you diagnose someone over
the course of the years and you learn

148
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,400
things because,
you know,

149
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:43,170
you could easily say that almost everyone
has some type of mental illness and

150
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,680
people should understand that,
you know,

151
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,070
there's seven different basic
human emotions. You know,
I've talked to this for,

152
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,460
it's, there's, there's anger, there's
contempt. Uh, there's, there's discuss,

153
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,090
there's fear, sadness and happiness.
That's seven. So, you know,

154
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:01,580
depending on which way surprise goes.
I mean, six out of those seven are,

155
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,120
are negative, right? Because we're
wired to basically detect threats.

156
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,470
So, you know, um, w when
we're, we're making, you know,
the, all these diagnoses,

157
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,520
I think we have to be careful because,
you know,

158
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,820
some people are calling themselves
to press and some people are calling

159
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,690
themselves anxious when really,
you know,

160
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,720
they're just not dealing with basic human
emotions that they need to understand

161
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,160
and need to deal with.
Like,

162
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:26,670
people are getting angry about being
angry or like depressed about being

163
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,250
depressed. They, if you
feel one of these emotions,

164
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,660
just kind of sit with it and just kind
of reflect on it. And I think, you know,

165
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,450
that's a much, much better way to kind
of kind of tea to tease things out.

166
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,960
But you know, to come back to my
original point, I think that, you know,

167
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,990
more people are understanding that um,
you know,

168
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,830
we don't just need to give out a pill
for everything and that, you know,

169
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,680
everyone shouldn't just be labeled as
having a mental health diagnosis because

170
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,010
if things just keep going the way
they are, you know what, what's,

171
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,550
by 2040 it's going to be like 50% of
people are going to have like a mental

172
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,940
health disorder. So like people just
need to understand that life is hard.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
You got to deal with these emotions.
Sometimes it's not that big of a deal.

174
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:07,490
And that's why for subs, for some folks,
and that's why I'm such a big thing of,

175
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:11,910
of Jordan Peterson because you know,
he's, he's, he's kind of tough on people.

176
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,880
Let me stop and shook his Jordan
Peterson was on Ssri is for years. Yeah.

177
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,130
That's interesting. Yeah, it was a
long, long time. I mean like for a long,

178
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:24,580
long time as was his family.
And what's crazy about him,

179
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,530
it was what got him
off is a carnivore diet

180
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:33,310
diet where he only eats meat with salt
and drinks water and the healthier than

181
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,270
he's ever been in his life.
And that is a,

182
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,430
another massively controversial subject.

183
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,250
Let me push back a little bit because
I think people as controversial as the

184
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:48,340
book has been about, uh,
about cannabis and psychosis,

185
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:51,860
this violence issue is even more
controversial. And obviously for,

186
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,250
for a fair number of people,
it doesn't really,

187
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,640
it doesn't sync with the stereotype
and it doesn't say it with how they've

188
00:10:57,641 --> 00:11:00,130
experienced cannabis
use. Right. So I think,

189
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:04,880
I think alcohol's a really
interesting comparison. Sorry,

190
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,900
the Canadian,
well you have to go national.

191
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,650
We were talking about,
my wife's actually from new family.

192
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,030
So you feel age as an understand
marijuana recently and decided to say,

193
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,320
you can't say Newfoundland
trained myself to say that way.

194
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:26,020
You're telling me I'm wrong.
Just pulled up.

195
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,200
Marijuana use increases violent behavior.

196
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:34,060
50 year study finds casual link
between cannabis and subsequent violent

197
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,880
behavior. A new research published, uh,

198
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,830
online in advance of print of the journal.

199
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:43,630
It's like a psychological medicine
concludes the continued use of cannabis

200
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:47,080
causes violent behavior as a direct result
of changes in brain function that are

201
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,450
caused by smoking weed.
Over many years,

202
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,920
researchers have long debated a possible
link between the use of and violent

203
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,520
crime in contrast to alcohol,
meth, and many other illegal drugs.

204
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,540
The mellowing effects of cannabis scene
unsuited to promoting violent behavior.

205
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,620
However,
ample,

206
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,240
ample previous research
has linked marijuana use to
increased violent behavior.

207
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:11,740
The sticky problem in such studies
are that many confounding factors,

208
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:16,360
cofounding factors, uh, involved in
interpreting this correlation. So,

209
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,600
so look,
okay,

210
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,090
it is very difficult to determine whether
or not any statistical correlation

211
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:26,950
between marijuana use and violent
behavior, our, uh, cash causally linked,

212
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,930
or instead the two associated,
uh,

213
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,170
or instead the two are associated
through some other factors such as

214
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,430
socioeconomic status,

215
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:40,030
personality traits are many
other variables that are
related to the propensity

216
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,170
to use marijuana.

217
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,310
MMM.

218
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,970
So I, I think that's a fairly good
summary of the, of, of the issues.

219
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,923
What's up James?

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The study came from 411 boys
who were born in 1953 in London,

221
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,760
97% of which were Caucasian.

222
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,910
And all of them are raised
in two parent households. So,

223
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,030
so, you know, so those
people are relatively stable
if they're the two family,

224
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:07,310
two parent households to hand parents
beat to shit. No, it's possible. But so,

225
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,370
so let me so, so, so I think
the alcohol comparison is again,

226
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,660
a good one because anybody who's ever
been in a bar at 9:00 PM and gone back at

227
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:20,470
2:00 AM knows that alcohol
disinhibit people, right.
It causes fights, right. It,

228
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,610
it makes people loud.
It makes a lot of fucking too.

229
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,100
It's good and bad.
I don't know if that's good.

230
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:34,101
I mean sometimes it's alcohol
and sex are a terrible idea.

231
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,080
It certainly causes some sexual violence.
Sure. Okay. But at the same time,

232
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,720
everybody knows that you can have a drink.
You know,

233
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,300
you can have a beer at the back of your
barbecue, you can have glass of wine.

234
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,320
It doesn't mean that you're going to
get in a fight and you actually might

235
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:53,460
enhance your conversation,
social lubricant, all that
good stuff, good stuff.

236
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,290
And you might even know people.
I mean,

237
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,380
I do know people who I would say
have a problem with drinking. Okay.

238
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:01,470
But it's mostly they're sitting
at home drinking scotch,

239
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,170
watching baseball until
they fall asleep that night.

240
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,630
Now that's obviously not a
healthy way to use alcohol,

241
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,070
but it doesn't make them violent.

242
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,050
But we know on a population basis
that alcohol causes violence.

243
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,720
It causes drunk driving,
it causes problems.

244
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,220
And it said that in this study
that I quoted earlier, but it's,

245
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:23,760
it said that alcohol again, they didn't,
or sorry, cannabis, they weren't sure.

246
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,740
Right? So, okay, so this is again,

247
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,130
I would like to read the paper that
you're quoting from because I have so much

248
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,800
other research. But here's, here's
what I'm saying about cannabis. Okay.

249
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,890
Cannabis for a lot of people.
Yeah, they can just smoke
it. And as people, you know,

250
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,370
many people who have tweeted at me,

251
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:41,020
the only thing I attacked
was a bowl of Nachos. Right?

252
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,870
And so and so that's true for some people,

253
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:46,990
but that can be sent with the alcohol as
well. That's exactly logical variables.

254
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,770
There's so many studies that say that,

255
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,650
that the cannabis laws have
actually decreased Crimea.

256
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,320
She gotta let me finish. Let
me finish. Let him finish.

257
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,090
Go ahead Alex. So, so

258
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,730
even though for many people,
cannabis isn't going to cause violence,

259
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,600
that doesn't mean it can't cause
violence in some people especially,

260
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,790
or at least could be a factor
of at least could be a factor,

261
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,910
especially with the kind of
violence that I am talking about.

262
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:17,480
And then I write about in the
book, which is again, so alcohol,

263
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,660
it may be makes argument into a brawl.

264
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,330
It makes a brawl into something
where somebody picks up a stick.

265
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,930
It makes that into something where
somebody pulls out a knife, it escalates.

266
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,790
Cannabis is different.
Cannabis Causes Paranoia and psychosis.

267
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,040
And it certainly causes
us things temporarily,

268
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,510
even if it doesn't cause them permanently.

269
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:39,770
So a distortion in reality that could
lead to you doing something terrible and

270
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:44,450
it's usually to somebody
you're not actually fighting
with. It's a family member.

271
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,340
The worst cases that I've,

272
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,080
and I've really seen a lot of these cases
are basically innocent family members

273
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,430
who are just in the way.

274
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,350
When somebody loses touch with the
reality and literally things like this,

275
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,500
my 85 year old grandmother
is going to kill me,

276
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,130
so I better stab her to death first.
That happens.

277
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,840
It happens a lot.

278
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:09,920
And if you look at the amount of violence
that people with psychosis command on

279
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:11,540
a population level basis,

280
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,250
it looks like people with schizophrenia
commit about six to 10% of all the

281
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,640
murders in this country and it looks
like people would sort of broader diff,

282
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,970
more broadly defined psychosis.
Again, bipolar with psychosis,

283
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
other psychotic conditions,
temporary psychosis,

284
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,260
they might be responsible for as much as
20% of the violent crime in the United

285
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,000
States.
That's a lot of violent crime.

286
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,220
And what I'm saying is that it is
quite clear that drug use mediates that

287
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,560
violent crime. In other
words, if you're not using,

288
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,570
you can keep your impulses in check, but
when you do use, you become dangerous.

289
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:44,630
Sure.

290
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,420
So when we're talking about
biological variability,

291
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,100
if we factor in schizophrenia,

292
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,130
essentially what you're saying is that
there are people that have schizophrenia

293
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,750
that don't commit violence,

294
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:58,760
but that they're much more likely to
commit violence if you add some sort of

295
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:01,790
psych medication, whether it's
marijuana, whether it's something else,

296
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,500
it perturbs reality for them.

297
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,250
And particularly marijuana
because hotbox bring down the

298
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,070
recreational drugs, the worst cases
of all our cannabis and a stimulant.

299
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,750
Because to the they both like cocaine or
meth. Exactly. Yeah. So when you get that,

300
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,900
you get paranoid from
two sources and you get,

301
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,510
the only good thing about cannabis from
this point of view is it kind of knocks

302
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,180
people down a little bit,
but meth brings them right back.

303
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,800
So is it fair to say that what we don't
know is that we don't know whether or

304
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,430
not these people like this young band
with his terrible story from Connecticut,

305
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,790
we don't know whether or not he would
have become a schizophrenia and exhibited

306
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,320
those symptoms without the marijuana.
We really don't know.

307
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,070
But we do know he did with it.
That's, that's correct. And,

308
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,630
and what I would also say is
that for somebody like that,

309
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,100
and this is quite clear
on a population level

310
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,870
basis with people with schizophrenia,

311
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,550
is you've got to
discourage them from using,

312
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,510
really have to be discouraged because
it brings out the worst. Right. And,

313
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,730
and you know, somebody said this, uh,

314
00:17:58,731 --> 00:18:01,380
a friend of mine of old friend of
mine from the New York Times said,

315
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,040
so every time there's a hurricane people,
some people on the right say,

316
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,660
well you can't prove that global warming
cause that one hurricane that would've

317
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,470
happened anyway and he and there,
right,

318
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,240
you can't prove it and you can't prove
that any one case of psychosis was caused

319
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:19,650
by marijuana. But when you look at the
big studies at the population level data,

320
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:24,240
the association is really clear and
everything points the same way and the

321
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:26,250
synthetic cannabinoids k two and spice,

322
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,620
those can clearly produce
psychosis in people.

323
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,420
And people with psychosis tend to slip
back into it if they use at some point

324
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,390
you got to start to say to yourself,
why does everything go the same way?

325
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,100
Yeah. I also have a personal friend and
I really didn't think about this guy,

326
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,800
but there's another personal friend
that I know that is a martial arts

327
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,260
instructor that had a psychotic break.

328
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,880
He became schizophrenia and he's a regular
marijuana user and the people around

329
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,590
him associated that with that.

330
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:54,770
And in fact people that
are regular cannabis users,

331
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,750
we're trying to get them
to stop using marijuana.

332
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,210
If hired close to pricing on the edge,

333
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,900
any use a little bit of cannabis
for sure it can be Tyson can.

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,040
This guy was not on the edge
when I knew him, when I knew him,

335
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,810
he was very rational,
very rational.

336
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:11,390
But something happened
somewhere along the line was he,

337
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,610
did he become a pretty
heavy smoker over time?

338
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,430
I do not know because we don't
live in the same area anymore,

339
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,880
but he got really heavily,
uh,

340
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,130
really heavily medicated and did some
really crazy shit and want to being

341
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,973
hospitalized.

342
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,420
And this was not the case before I'm
in whatever it was that triggered him.

343
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,360
I mean it, when I was around
him, when he was younger,

344
00:19:32,361 --> 00:19:34,220
I would have said he's a total normal guy.

345
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:38,360
And I would have never saw that coming.
He was a heavy marijuana user, heavy,

346
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,650
heavy. But I don't, I don't know how he's
doing now. I hope he's okay. But we're,

347
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,340
you know, we have mutual
friends and uh, he became uh,

348
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:50,840
schizophrenia and, and you know, you
will see, you know, cases like that.

349
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:54,280
But you know, when you do look
at a lot of the larger data on,

350
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,860
on cannabis and violence, I mean
it's just, it's just not there.

351
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,220
Like there's lots of data
that suggests that, you know,

352
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,970
medical marijuana laws for example,
can actually have a decrease in overall.

353
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,260
I mean,

354
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,190
I think that's a study that says it
gives no comfort to the people who lose

355
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,920
their children because of the
psychotropics. That's right.

356
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,670
And those studies are really bad.

357
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,630
So the place that you can criticize
a bad though, because there,

358
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,810
because state level data is not great,
the place the book has been criticized,

359
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:21,410
right?
Mandra.

360
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,230
There was a rand review though in 2013
and I mean that again that state by state

361
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,800
conclude that marijuana use does not
induce violent crime and the links between

362
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:34,690
marijuana use and property client
crime are thin right there.

363
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,480
I think we all agree that marijuana
use by itself with people that aren't

364
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,820
schizophrenia probably does
it induce violent crime,

365
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,900
but with people that are schizophrenia or
people where it triggers schizophrenia,

366
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:48,760
it could potentially induce violent crime.
My friend did not get violent,

367
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,200
although he did do a violent thing.
It wasn't to a person. I think.

368
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,180
I think we have to be really careful
because there's no, just like with diet,

369
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,290
just like with food and
you know like a allergies.

370
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,870
All of these different variabilities
when it comes to human beings,

371
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,120
I think we have to be really,

372
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,240
really careful about lumping all people
together when it comes to how they get

373
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:17,410
affected by various compounds. So the
state level, if you want, I'll, I'll,

374
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,240
the place the book has been criticized
in my mind sort of the most fairly is it

375
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:26,170
points out that in the four states
that legalized first, which is Alaska,

376
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,820
Washington, Oregon, Colorado. Um,

377
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,020
if you look at 2013 and then you compare
that to 2017 murders and ag assaults,

378
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,040
violent crime,
um,

379
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,600
are up substantially in those states
and substantially more than in the u.

380
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:41,620
S can I stop you there?

381
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,200
But is there a possibility
there's a correlation between
organized crime because

382
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,790
one of the things about selling marijuana
is the people that have always been

383
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,930
selling marijuana have been criminals.
When you make things legal and estate,

384
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,380
the people that were selling
it illegal flock to that state.

385
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,690
And that's been proven to be true,
that there's,

386
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,530
there's a direct correlation
between people being robbed,

387
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:07,030
that there was also a significant
problem with credit cards and banks where

388
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:09,680
everyone was having to do all
their transactions with cash.

389
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:13,690
There was a lot of violences
was associated with
marijuana in regards to that

390
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,660
and also massive increase in population.

391
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,790
And that's the way,
the reason why,

392
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,040
why Trump has actually not really
against cannabis in some ways,

393
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,420
it's because he feels that if we
have medical marijuana laws that,

394
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,090
especially the states that are,
that are border states,

395
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,960
that the crime's gonna drop and drops
a lot tremendously. And it has dropped.

396
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:37,380
They did a study last year
and it dropped over 50%.

397
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:41,400
It's all around drop 7% in
Arizona. And then again, you know,

398
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:46,310
Benjamin Hanson, who, who's,
who's an economist, the wrong
data. So for his charge,

399
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,450
okay,
so he,

400
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,760
he said that the murder rate did not
demonstrate that marijuana legalization

401
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,510
increases violence, then it may have
actually demonstrated that legalization,

402
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:59,870
it's slightly decreased fonts.
And he thinks that,

403
00:22:59,871 --> 00:23:02,670
that the reason that there was
an increase in the murder rate,

404
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:06,270
particularly in Washington,
is because there was a large income gap.

405
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,890
They say that Washington has
a 10th largest income gap,
uh, in the United States.

406
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,760
But that's why, how did that
change corresponds to the
murderer? Good question.

407
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,070
I'm so, I haven't, you know, I didn't
get to speak with Benjamin to about this,

408
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,460
but sounds like confirmation
bias. Well, he, I mean if that,

409
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:28,461
that is one thing that has been shown to
increase mental illness like we talked

410
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:32,430
about and can definitely increase
violence, is when you have an income gap.

411
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,070
But how's the income gap shifted?

412
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,920
That directly correlates to
the legalization of marijuana

413
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,690
because during the scene, because
during the same period, the income gap,

414
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:45,620
particularly in Washington in increased,
so he that

415
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,200
the corresponding number, right? So
he feels that, that it's likely more,

416
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:52,880
more to that. And I mean
he, I mean, I understand,

417
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,840
but I mean you have to respect this guy,
man.

418
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,490
I respect him because I know what he did
with his data and telling me what to do.

419
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,280
This, this is maddening to me. Okay. Okay.

420
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,110
Violent crime in those four
states increased more rapidly
than in the u s period

421
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,820
between 2013 and 2017 who Jamie
just posted the conjecture aside,

422
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:14,940
no credible data exists.

423
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:17,960
It supports a significant association
between the increase in violent crime and

424
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,850
marijuana legalization.
Furthermore,

425
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:24,230
study suggest that so far violent crime
decreases in states with legalized

426
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:27,950
medical marijuana until new
research credibly suggest otherwise.

427
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:32,510
The claim that a demonstratable link
between the two exists will remain

428
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:37,280
classified as false, so that's just
not true. Okay. I know it's Snopes.

429
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,050
Okay. And I know we trust
Snopes. I don't trust them that

430
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,130
I was going to say that too, but they
give all of their their sources. So again,

431
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,940
by daily. So do you, are
you, where are these sources?

432
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,550
I've read this stuff and
what's wrong with them here?

433
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,530
Let me just go back to what I'm saying.
Yeah, please do it. 2013 Oregon,

434
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,020
Washington, Colorado, Alaska.

435
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,230
There are 450 murders
in those four states.

436
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,260
There are 30,000 agg assault period.
Okay.

437
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,120
2017 Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Alaska.

438
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,930
There are 620 murders in those four
states, that's an almost 40% increase.

439
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,760
There are 38,000 agg assaults at the 25%
increase. If you adjust for population,

440
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,710
you still get big increases. In
Denver, 2018 almost 70 murders.

441
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,650
There were about 35 and 2013 Seattle,

442
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,910
27 2018 there were 34 35 murders.
There were,

443
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:36,560
I think 19 in 2013 these
increases are real. Okay.

444
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,450
Now now, now, okay.

445
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,040
Can we say that marijuana
legalization caused those increases?

446
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,120
We cannot yet there are
other possibilities and
you're, what are those? Um,

447
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,500
well, one positive first of
all, population did increase.

448
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,120
It's also possible that these states,

449
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:56,810
quote unquote imported violent crime and
other ones that you've got a population

450
00:25:56,811 --> 00:26:00,860
of transients coming in in part because
marijuana was legal and those people are

451
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:04,010
likely to commit violent crime.
And on top of that organized crime,

452
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,930
people that are selling.
Absolutely.

453
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,340
There may have been some people who are
exporting to, to Nebraska, to Minnesota,

454
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,500
to other states.
There's crime associated with that.

455
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,000
But what I am saying is that
unequivocally, unequivocally,

456
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:20,690
the people who said legalization
is going to decrease violent crime.

457
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:24,770
And people did say that.
And Cory booker in 2010 17 said it,

458
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,670
he said that it actually had decreased
violent crime in states that legalized.

459
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,110
And he didn't say it it randomly,

460
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,160
he said it when he was introducing
legislation to legalize marijuana on the

461
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:38,660
federal level. Those people are wrong
and they need to stop saying it. I know.

462
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:41,060
And by the way that
Oregon economists used,

463
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,860
he used the wrong data set for his charts.
Okay. He used, I used the real numbers.

464
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:49,560
Okay.
The FBI homicide numbers,

465
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,830
he used numbers that include
justifiable homicide, no police,

466
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,320
because the FBI report that the murder
rate went up 1% from 2015 to 2016 as

467
00:26:58,591 --> 00:26:59,910
compared to the nationwide,

468
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:04,911
which one was 7.9% and then it dropped
by 11.6% between 2016 and 20 seconds with

469
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,390
numbers. Do not know what
you're talking about. Okay.

470
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,050
Those are FBI numbers of breeding and
not know what you're talking about.

471
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,180
The numbers are clear. Okay. I
use them reading them right now.

472
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,190
2016 release of FBI uniform crime
reports from Oregon. Okay. Yes.

473
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,130
Oregon. You're not reading the
reports from the United States.

474
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,640
You're picking one state
for women showing something.

475
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,640
We'll state that has legalized medical
cannabis over the entire country from

476
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:36,570
that time period too. So to pick those
four states where marijuana was legalized,

477
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,020
sort of Cherry picking,
no,

478
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,920
that it's picking every state where they
were legalized and comes to the whole,

479
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:44,940
to the whole country. The whole country,
the whole country. You'll see similar.

480
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,140
Is it a similar increase? That's
what I'm trying to show. Yes.

481
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,680
If I'm trying to pull back so we can
see the hole. The hole. So first of all,

482
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:55,900
that's a violent crime.
Crime,

483
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,990
a violent crime and that ag
assaults, aren't they? No. So so,

484
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,770
so the four categories of violent
crime or murder, agg assault,

485
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:08,490
robbery and rape. Rape has sort of
gone sideways the last few years.

486
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:09,810
Robberies actually have gone down.

487
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,940
It's murders and ag assaults that are
interpersonal violent crime. Okay.

488
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,210
Just to go back to this Oregon economist,
because this maddens me,

489
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,740
he used a Dataset that is not
the standard data set to report.

490
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:23,910
Murder rate is a difference.

491
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,150
He used the data set that
includes justifiable homicides,

492
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:30,510
meaning I'm in my house, you come
in, I shoot you and kill you.

493
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:34,760
The police don't charge me with
anything and police homicides but gets

494
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,820
published. Let's not let an
interrupt. Let me finish the,

495
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,530
those two categories of crime are not
likely to be impacted by cannabis use.

496
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,480
Cops are not smoking when they're on
patrol. I hope. And if you are using,

497
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,780
you're very unlikely to have your
murder viewed as justifiable homicide.

498
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
The fair comparison is the base murder
rate in the u s and that's the number

499
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:02,370
that I used. And I am telling you,
I mean, I, I know these numbers,

500
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,700
I sleep, I wake up with
these numbers, cannabis,

501
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,600
the for cannabis legal
states on a per capita basis,

502
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,780
crime murders rose 31% on a per capita
basis in those four states over the 2013,

503
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:20,940
2017 period. Maybe, I'm sorry,
I said 31. Maybe it's 29%.

504
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:23,250
So maybe I say I woke up in the,
anyway,

505
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:28,251
the the for the u s
it's 18% 29% versus 18%.

506
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,790
That's the gap.

507
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,590
And I am not saying that I know that
cannabis legalization caused that gap.

508
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,600
What I'm saying is people need to stop
claiming that cannabis legalization

509
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:42,010
reduces violent crime. It in, it has

510
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,370
increased in those tasks. You in those
states was at universal, the increase,

511
00:29:45,371 --> 00:29:49,060
was it almost identical? Yes.
At Alaska was the most, uh,

512
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,410
then I think murders went up
more in cow in Washington. Uh,

513
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,510
and what's also
interesting, Joe, if you're,

514
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,670
if you really want to go into the numbers,

515
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,220
is the gap actually widened year by year.

516
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,020
So that's sort of what you would expect
if this is the result of a psychometric

517
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,811
effect.
In other words,

518
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:08,830
a psychosis causing effect
because cannabis doesn't
cause psychosis right away.

519
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:09,820
People break down.

520
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,620
But if it's causing heavy use and
some of those people are sliding into,

521
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:16,600
you know,
paranoia and psychosis,

522
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,560
you'd sort of expect the gap to increase
over time. And that's what's happened.

523
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,200
Okay. So, you know, I'm gonna go
back again to the Netherlands. Okay.

524
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,610
Because they've had,
you know,

525
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:32,260
cannabis legalized forever and they have
one fifth of the homicide rate that the

526
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:36,610
United States does. And they also have
a lower cannabis use. That's true.

527
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,000
They also, but still, you know,

528
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,570
one warrior for kickboxers bus,
but,

529
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,370
uh, one, one fifth. I mean, it's still,
it's, it's pretty drastic overall. And,

530
00:30:49,371 --> 00:30:51,910
and again, you know, Alex, you know,
you know, I appreciate some of the,

531
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,340
are we talking about the
correlation between cannabis use?

532
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:58,630
One of the things that we have to accept
in America is that when you're in a

533
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:03,280
place like the Netherlands has a
long and accepted history of use,

534
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,370
people are accustomed to it.
So I think things kind of even out.

535
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,650
I think one of the things that we're
dealing with with the United States is

536
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,510
people that have just,
they don't,

537
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,350
they don't have a long
history of experience and it
becomes legal and then they

538
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:16,060
use it.
And maybe some of them,

539
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,960
like we're talking about don't have
a tolerance for it, have too much.

540
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,400
And like I was talking about with my
friend who's like this really cotton,

541
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,410
the one who, uh, had an edible and
became suicidal and fucked up for weeks.

542
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,180
You guys very confident, very
articulate, very intelligent. He's not a,

543
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,320
not a Weirdo, not a non transient
extreme, extremely successful.

544
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,870
You know,
I think there are,

545
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,110
there are variables that we need to take
into consideration and there's certain

546
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,100
human beings at exhibit a pattern of
behavior that's directly correlated to

547
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:51,750
cannabis use that I don't experience.
So if I,

548
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,930
I could say from my own personal biases
that that's bullshit. That's nothing.

549
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:58,330
It doesn't do anything. I've been
smoking for years. Doesn't do shit.

550
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,870
Well you probably don't have one of those
three genes that we were talking about

551
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,780
and you probably also to, um, you know,

552
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,460
don't overuse or you have
some type of, you know, um,

553
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,530
legitimacy as to why you are, you
are using it. And you know, one,

554
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,470
I want to keep going with this, but
you know, at the end of the show,

555
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:22,471
I think that we should make some type
of like recommendations for people just

556
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:27,070
because I hate when you know,
you have this big three hour podcasts.

557
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,240
Then at the end of it it's just like,
hey guys, just be safe. You know,

558
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,700
it's like,
it's like,

559
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,150
fuck it. Let's have some type of like, um,

560
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,890
recommendations. Like I love
the podcast with, uh, with,

561
00:32:46,891 --> 00:32:50,660
with Chris Kresser and Joel.
Right? But, um, at the,

562
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:54,140
at the end of it was just sort of like,
hey guys, do anything there can die.

563
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,340
I think most people realize that one
person was going on data and the other

564
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,360
person was. Yeah. I mean, I,

565
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:04,490
I find it so fascinating that now
when you think back through your,

566
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,910
through your life, you've,
you've thought of somebody who,

567
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,810
who was affected and
there were several people.

568
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,500
I'll bet I'll bet as you think about it,
you'll think of more people maybe.

569
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,620
But those are the big ones.
And like I said,

570
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,740
my friend who is a martial arts instructor
was a pretty significant issue with a

571
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:19,461
lot of our friends.

572
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:21,590
We were trying to figure out what
was wrong with him beforehand.

573
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,970
He was sending me these videos that
didn't make any sense. And uh, I was like,

574
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,040
what in the fuck is this? Like, uh, I'll,

575
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:32,210
I'll explain to you more off air so
I don't have to uh, out this guy.

576
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,360
But what will the,
all La,

577
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,100
a lot of people that were close to
him were really seriously concerned.

578
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,990
And now is it something that would have
happened anyway? I don't know how he,

579
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,400
he's in his twenties. How old is
that? Late twenties. 20, you know,

580
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,090
that's right around the age.
So it is a little,

581
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:53,660
a little bit late Ish. Like, cause
like I said, a lot of the studies,

582
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:58,370
even when you look at the
ones on adolescents, like
for sure it's, it's below,

583
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:58,971
like they've,

584
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:03,971
they have done studies like below 18 is
worse than say below 25 blow 15 is worse

585
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:07,840
than say 18. Like the
younger you go, the worse.

586
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:12,440
And He seems to be fine now
and it's,

587
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,880
uh, you know, I'm not an expert on the
subject, but it's because of this, um,

588
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,710
if somebody called pruning
that we go through,

589
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:23,180
so everyone goes through this and
basically if your adolescence,

590
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:24,420
you're going to drop off some,

591
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,010
some weak neural connections to kind of
pick up some stronger ones. So, you know,

592
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,000
it's the best way to kind of explain
it. Um, when you use cannabis,

593
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,820
you can potentially
accelerate that process.

594
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,580
And then because you
accelerate that process,

595
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,150
you don't get those good neuro
connections. And then, you know,

596
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:45,700
people unfortunately, you know, develop
things like psychosis and, um, and,

597
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,410
and schizophrenia. So, you know,
that's kind of where, where they were,

598
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,940
where the issue lies. So, you know,

599
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:54,650
one thing that I am very happy that we're
talking about and I know Alex will be

600
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:58,760
too, is that, you know, we want to
discuss the benefits and in this podcast,

601
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,340
make sure that people understand that,
you know,

602
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:05,090
I believe that marijuana is Madison.
It's an excellent medicine. Um,

603
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,120
but the other thing though too is we do
want to mitigate the risks because there

604
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:14,590
are real risks out there. So, you
know, I do appreciate, you know, um,

605
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,170
US talking about adolescence and
making sure that they do stay away from

606
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:22,880
cannabis, especially that's like twice.
I've read these, you know, these cases,

607
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,880
there's a case file sometimes then,
you know,

608
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,400
the kids started using when
he was 11 and you know,

609
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:31,380
it's like that kid never had a chance.
Right. I mean, and obviously the,

610
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,060
oftentimes these are kids coming from
disadvantaged backgrounds anyway,

611
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:38,430
but you know, they're using by
11 it's 16. They put a, you know,

612
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:41,470
put a gun to somebody's head and
pull the trigger. I mean, the, the,

613
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,620
the pre adolescent and early teen news,
we got to do everything we can to stop.

614
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,940
The problem is, yeah, like if you, if you
smoke pot in junior high, like say seven,

615
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,430
eight, nine, like you're probably
going to smoke pot in high school.

616
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,640
Like that's the know what I mean?
That's what I saw when we went out,

617
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,080
when I was growing up.
And you know,

618
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,600
even when I was home for Christmas
for a few days, like yeah,

619
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,510
a couple of my friends even talked about,
you know, um, some people that we knew,

620
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,000
you know, smoked a ton of pot in high
school and like now like they're there,

621
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,470
they're crazy or they're not really
doing too too much, you know?

622
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,650
So you do have to,
because with the,

623
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,570
I think we're dealing
with a lot of ignorance.

624
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,980
We're dealing with a lot of ignorance
when it comes to biological variability,

625
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,890
right? We, we,

626
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,270
we don't really understand how a lot of
these different things affect people,

627
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:32,460
including like just diet and what, what,
what causes depression, like how much,

628
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,330
how much of what we constitute or
what we just decided as depression.

629
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:41,100
Is Inflammation a poor gut health?
There's a lot of variables. A lot of them.

630
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,000
Marijuana is absolutely one of
those variables. And uh, again,

631
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,360
I don't have an issue with it. I liked
it. I love the stuff, but it does,

632
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,350
it doesn't fuck with me,

633
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,570
but I'm also honest and so I see these
people where it's pretty obvious to me

634
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:58,050
that something's going on and that
marijuana is not a good idea for them.

635
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:01,470
And I just think, you know,
like I said in the past,

636
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:05,670
I myself have been guilty of using this,
uh,

637
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:10,380
this sort of a blanket description of it
as being a positive influence and that

638
00:37:10,381 --> 00:37:13,630
it's a good thing for people. I don't
think it's a good thing for everybody. No,

639
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,350
it's definitely not a good thing for
everybody and it's definitely not a good

640
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:20,550
thing for the people who have those
genetics that I discussed earlier.

641
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:23,430
And you know, also too,
like, you know, if you,

642
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,520
you need to have some type
of like self awareness,

643
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,090
like the people who you know don't
do well with cannabis, you know,

644
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,630
you shouldn't have your,

645
00:37:31,631 --> 00:37:35,550
to have your friends tell you that he
came in like you're not doing too well.

646
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,030
You should be able to figure out yourself.
But that's hard for people.

647
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:40,980
I mean that's one of the most
difficult things for people to do.

648
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:45,440
Is it self upset, self assess to be
objective? You know, it's a real,

649
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:46,231
I've obviously,

650
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,190
I've heard from a lot of people who used
heavily and seen other people who've

651
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,160
used heavily in the last month.

652
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:53,670
And I think it's very interesting why
people continue to use when they're

653
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:58,590
getting paranoid and, and you know,
the, the most cogent argument,

654
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,330
and again, I'm, I'm not, you know,

655
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:02,760
I've smoked a handful of times
in college and after college,

656
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,390
I actually don't think I'd be comfortable
using high THC cannabis now knowing

657
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:10,360
what I know. But anyway, so the
people, the most Godson, Ryan here,

658
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,230
okay,
I'm going to get hot box.

659
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,520
I'll give you the shit that,
but,

660
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,000
but the most, the most cogent arguments,
I thought it was so interesting.

661
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,950
This guy said, well, you know, my
friends, I talked to them and say,

662
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm paranoid now,
but I'm going to smoke through it.

663
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm going to smoke so much that I'm
almost comfortable being paranoid.

664
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,320
And I think that's a dangerous thing
to do to your mind, cause you're,

665
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,670
you're sort of counting on being able
to step back from that and stop using.

666
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,180
Yeah, that's a, that's a
silly, we're looking at it. Um.
