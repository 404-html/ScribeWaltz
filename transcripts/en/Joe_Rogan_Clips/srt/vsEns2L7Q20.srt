1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,060
But I just think, um, I
mean it's a fucked up thing.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,200
I mean it's a weird thing to say,

4
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:13,201
but I really think we all collectively
as a species need to emphasize and learn

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,960
how to be nicer to each other.
Nobody teaches you that. It's rare.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,670
They teach you in school, be nice when
you go to offices. There's, you know,

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,380
there's certain standards of behavior
that you're supposed to behave in,

8
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:30,550
but there's not like

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,550
an emphasis on kindness
and just being friendly.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,190
And I think that that doesn't
diminish competition now.

11
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:44,220
Like you can be friendly and kind to
people that you're competing with as hard

12
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,054
as you can.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,780
That was also a thing that you find at
Jujitsu guys who were just trying to kill

14
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:52,530
each other all the time or like really
close friends, really close and you know,

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,030
very competitive like, motherfucker, I'm
getting you tonight. No bitch not right.

16
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:57,810
You know, like that kind
of shit. But friendly.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,300
Well because there's a safety,

18
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:03,830
because there's rules and in the workplace
the rules are much more nebulous and

19
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:08,270
what you do to get ahead kissing a boss,
his ass sabotaging a project.

20
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,520
Is that part of competitive
or is that over the line?

21
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:13,550
Whereas with Jujitsu you'll
get called on a foul.

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,950
Yeah. Sabotaging a project. God.

23
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,570
Imagine working with somebody and
they're sabotaging what you're trying to

24
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,404
accomplish.

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,670
Go to the boss and talking shit behind
your back about your project and what

26
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,600
you're trying to achieve.

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,070
That's one of the most soul sucking
things about jobs. The fakeness.

28
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:35,340
Yeah, the, the office banter.

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,070
Nonsense fakeness. I just
think as a, as a species,

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,250
just the human race,

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,820
especially us as Americans because
they're so God damn competitive,

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,440
kinda learn how to be nicer.

33
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,390
I think it starts with manners.
I think it starts with,

34
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,660
I mean as a parent manners,
they seem trivial,

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,690
but it creates the paradigm
for Nice just thank you.

36
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,700
Please hold a door,

37
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,790
don't eat till it like don't eat
until everybody's served their food.

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,440
They're all little signals to people that
you care about them and respect them.

39
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,070
And I think it spills over and it informs
your other actions when you have good

40
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,230
manners. Right. Look, people in the eye.

41
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It'd be deployed.
And when people do that to you,

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,330
you get a good feeling.
You know, when you don't,

43
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,750
when someone holds up in the door
for you or someone says thank you,

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,890
like I said hi to some guy the other day
I was walking by him in the hallway of

45
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,120
a hotel. I go, how you doing man?

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,070
He just stared at me and
immediately I was like, why?

47
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,540
I was angry. Yeah. You know? Immediately
like, pardon my instinct was like,

48
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,740
fuck you man. Yeah. Then part me, it was
like that poor bastard. Right. You know?

49
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,200
And I went with that poor bastard.
That's his life.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,180
I just said hi and just tried to be nice,
but he looked,

51
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,300
looked at me like I was almost like I
was weak in saying hi to him. Right.

52
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,293
You know?

53
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,120
I was raised to like,
like if I see somebody with bags,

54
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:59,860
I helped them and it makes
me feel fucking great.

55
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,940
It feels good to help people.
And I think I was raised,

56
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,950
and that's the thing about being raised
Catholic because I was raised very care

57
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:09,050
were you raised Catholic?
I was raised Catholic too.

58
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:12,340
First grade after first grade
we kind of abandoned it. Yeah.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,580
But even up until then it's it,
it gives you a lot of um,

60
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,040
it's a life of service. It's very much
about helping people. It's very much she,

61
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,590
you know, he could say what you want
about the Catholics but you know,

62
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,880
they were in the trenches and a lot of
third world countries, nuns and you know,

63
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,960
they, they, they did a lot of good and
a, and I think that rubbed off on me.

64
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,840
My parents both always
did a lot of charity work.

65
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,770
I do a lot of charity work with
my kids and you know, that's,

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
that's going to stay with them.

67
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,490
I think we throw the baby out with the
bath water when it comes to religion and

68
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,520
even just rigid ideologies.
I think there's,

69
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,000
there's something about religion
that can absolutely help some people.

70
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,930
And there's aspects of it that are very
beneficial, having that code to live by.

71
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,500
You know, even if the, it's because of
the fucking spaghetti monster in the sky,

72
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,820
like whatever it is that you believe,
but if you really act that, that thing,

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,180
act like that thing is watching over you
and that there's codes and tenants that

74
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,840
you have to live by.
Like most of the tenants of Christianity,

75
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:11,890
if you look at them, if you really follow
Jesus's rule, which most people don't,

76
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,590
but if you really did, you'd be
doing a lot of great work. You know,

77
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,640
you'd be helping people,

78
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,460
you'd be treating each other as if
they were your brothers and sisters.

79
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,990
The neediest.
I mean,

80
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,980
that's who Jesus helped you helped the
beggars in the street and the prostitutes

81
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:28,310
and you know, that was some hardcore
shit he was doing back then. And um,

82
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,710
yeah, I think it's like, uh, the 10
commandments he can live by, I don't know,

83
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:35,260
eight of them.
Eight of them are pretty good to live by.

84
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,860
I'm still going to cover it. My
neighbor's wife Covet. She's fucking hot.

85
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,900
Do you know what that was about though?
It wasn't about that. What was it?

86
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,010
Your neighbors Wa she was possession.
She was covet,

87
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,840
like she was a a possession of the
neighbor. Yeah. Like she, he owned her,

88
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,340
right. Oh, that's right. And the
same thing stood for the commandment.

89
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,190
If you really read it says,
do not cover it.

90
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:01,150
Thy Neighbor's wife or thy neighbor slave.

91
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,720
Is it slave? Slave? It's a donkey.

92
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,030
I think it's donkey enslave. Really? Yup.
Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Don't,

93
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,760
don't try to steal their slave.
You could keep slaves.

94
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,950
Just felt want them from your neighbor.

95
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,460
It's just so obvious that what they were
talking about back then was all wrapped

96
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,510
around the way people thought
about things then. Yeah. You know,

97
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,200
but they knew even then,
even thousands of years ago,

98
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,750
they knew there's a right way to do things
and there's a wrong way to do things.

99
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,260
There's, when you pick up the
people's bags, you feel good.

100
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,820
Let's tell kids that was, teach people
that you pick up the bags, you feel good,

101
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,200
you hold the door open, you feel good. You
help someone, you feel good. Like, okay,

102
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,860
let's, this is obviously that
we all want to feel good, right?

103
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,730
How do we feel like there's moments in
my life where I feel terrible or I've

104
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:56,350
done something wrong or a fucked up
something or just failed and I just feel

105
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,500
terrible. And I always think when
I do have that feeling like, God,

106
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,990
I fucking hate this feeling.
Why can't I feel great?

107
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,410
Why can't I just feel awesome right
now? Well, because it didn't go well.

108
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,260
And this is like the psychic reminder.

109
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,990
This is that jolt of energy
that's letting you know like, hey,

110
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,460
you went on a wrong path. You
fucked up you, you'd tank this,

111
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:21,000
you crash that you did wrong. Like
you're supposed to feel like shit. Right.

112
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,350
So that you don't do it
again. Yeah. But conversely,

113
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,770
when something good happens,
when you help someone,

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,830
when someone can't get their bag in the
overhead because it's too heavy and you

115
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,230
help them and you hand it to them,
they smile at you and you smile at them.

116
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,350
You walk off the plane, you
feel good, you feel good.

117
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,100
You got to teach that to like, you have
to remember that and you have to go,

118
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,320
why do I feel so good? Oh, I felt so good
because it helped that lady, you know,

119
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,520
I felt so good because I said hi to
that guy and that guy say hi me back.

120
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,470
And we looked at each other
and go, you know, made some
niceties or whatever. Yeah.

121
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,403
And that's,

122
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,270
that's part of the joy of
life is those friendly,

123
00:06:56,271 --> 00:07:01,100
fun, Nice interactions with people.
But when you got your shit in order,

124
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,030
it's easier to have those experiences
when you don't. My personal experience,

125
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:08,140
when I don't have my shit in order
and I've made mistakes and um,

126
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,430
I fucked something up. It's very
hard for me to enjoy anything. Yeah.

127
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,370
I just go through the motions.
I just, I feel like, Oh,

128
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,300
if I have something that I fucked up and
then, um, I have that terrible feeling,

129
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:23,780
but I have to hang out with my family
and my kids. I just ride it out.

130
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,200
I just have to ride it out. I tried
to be real friendly and real sweet,

131
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:30,410
but I don't feel good inside. I
feel terrible. And I go, well,

132
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:34,460
this is going to go away
with contemplation, with
understanding. It's going to,

133
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,760
this feelings going to go away, but
you got to ride it out. You know?

134
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,910
And I know I can ride it out because
I've read it out, wrote it out before.

135
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,630
But for some people, man, they
don't know what to do there, right?

136
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,930
Don't they don't know what that feeling
is. They feel like this is their life.

137
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,650
And then that feeling, if you don't
conquer it, you get comfortable with it.

138
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,070
You get used to it. You used to failing,
you get used to that terrible feeling.

139
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:58,180
And then he started pouring booze
on that terrible feeling, right?

140
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,480
Or pouring drugs or,

141
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,040
well, it also becomes like, uh,

142
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,870
I was in therapy and I remember
the therapist told me that you,

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,960
we all have a narrative of our lives
and you can choose that narrative.

144
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,190
It's that fucking simple.

145
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:16,140
That's basically what behavioral
therapy tells you is that it's all a

146
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:19,890
projection. Everything in your life
as a projection. You know, you say,

147
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,600
I have these attributes, I've
accomplished these things. Or you can say,

148
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,400
I lacked these things and I fucked up
these things and you can live your life.

149
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,230
What putting that energy out to people.

150
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,310
And it's as simple as just literally
sitting down and thinking about how you

151
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:38,850
want to see yourself and just keep,

152
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,880
keep reminding yourself of that and
you'll start to live. And I mean,

153
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:46,350
this sounds so fucking hokey and over
simplified, but it's real, but it's real.

154
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,350
You know, and I, and part of the thing,

155
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,240
the downside of religion is that I was
raised with a lot of shame and guilt.

156
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,133
And so those,

157
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,340
you're talking about where you fucked
up and you're feeling bad and you've got

158
00:08:58,341 --> 00:08:59,174
to ride it out.

159
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,370
You throw shame on top of that and it
extends it and it makes it more profound.

160
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,690
And it's not just about your action and
how it might've affected other people.

161
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,060
It's about original sin. You know, heavy,

162
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,750
original sin should garden of Eden
where evil, you know, we're dirty.

163
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,300
We need to confess,
we need to be cleansed.

164
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,230
Throw all that on top of a simple mistake.
And again, it makes it complicated.

165
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,740
[inaudible]

166
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:34,900
yeah.
