1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,340
I get a lot of letters from
people asking me, well, you know,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,630
I'm facing a similar situation. What
should I do? Uh, professors out?

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,740
And my answer is fight back hard.
So I've had a couple of these situations.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,630
I had a guy on Twitter, the guy, the
guy who money referred to as a retired,

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,000
started,
started contacting my university,

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,680
trying to get me fired when he,

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,940
when it wasn't working with his
tagging my university on Twitter.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,760
He actually contacted the HR department,

9
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,270
Human Resources Department at my
university. This is a random person.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,163
What's a troll?

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,800
You got in touch with a troll and you
gave him what he wanted attention and then

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,160
he just started to run with
it. You basically gave him
an opportunity to score.

13
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,980
He's playing a video game. Exactly.
But now here's what happened.

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,730
The university's HR person
contacts me after hours.

15
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:51,680
I mentioned this actually recently
on the Ruben report. The, the, the,

16
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,330
the lady in question contacts me to say,
look,

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,030
here's a complaint that's
been filed against you. Now,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,770
my first react instinct was,
oh,

19
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:03,771
someone in my job as a professor at
the university has complained about me,

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,760
which I couldn't think who that would be,

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,610
but I would think that that's where the,
the,

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,060
the template of their influence
over me would reside. No,

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,690
they had actually taken seriously a random
person on Twitter contacting them and

24
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:22,470
filing a complaint under the guise of
he's a student. Well, he's not my student.

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,270
Right? I mean, if a student, uh,
costs me in an alley to Mug me,

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,430
I can't fight back because Bruh, he's a
student or I'm allowed to, to deck him.

27
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,100
Right? So this is a guy that I'm
just having fun with. I mean,

28
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm doing it with a smile.

29
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:41,010
We're going back and forth the size that
he's willing to go as far as try to get

30
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,690
me fine.
Now let's suppose that he had succeeded,

31
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:46,500
let's suppose that I hadn't fought back
because basically what I did with the

32
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,334
university,
I said,

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,720
are you literally thinking that it is
reasonable for you to be monitoring what I

34
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,770
do on my Twitter account? And the
example I gave her as an analogy, I said,

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,690
if if I see you coming out of the pharmacy
with your daughter and I feel that

36
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:04,740
you're speaking to her and occur manner
that I don't agree with as a parent,

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,780
can I report you to the university?

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,120
And that pretty much ended
the conversation very quickly.

39
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:13,470
But the fact that they felt sufficiently
in bolden to actually reach out to me

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,640
to address this complaint shows you
how chilling the environment is.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,130
It is. Right, but let's
play devil's advocate. Sure.

42
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,350
If I was someone who was taking your
class or if I was someone who is very

43
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:36,531
sensitive or someone who has certain
ideals or morals and the professor who's

44
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:41,550
teaching the class that I take
called somebody a retard, I would,

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,290
I mean just being honest and I
love you, I would, I would say,

46
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,050
why is this guy doing that?
Like that's a stupid thing to do.

47
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:52,170
Like why are you engaging with
these people online and these,

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,330
these base insults like
that distasteful insults.

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,360
Fair enough.
And I engage with people like that.

50
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,660
I mean literally the reason I do it as
once in a while, my wife falls asleep.

51
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,830
I don't feel like working on my
scientific papers or my book or whatever.

52
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,831
I'm tired and I'm on Twitter and I heeded
your advice to try to not engage with

53
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,990
people. Some idiots
catches my eye. Oh Gee,

54
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,110
I use the word idiot idiot
for some strange reason. Okay.

55
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:24,100
It ain't call more on his own. Okay. You
just can't call them. So someone, someone,

56
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,610
our word catches my attention and I
decided to spar with them. You, you,

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,640
you like to get into the
octagon and do MMA sparring.

58
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,800
I go on Twitter and I
have fun with some idiot,

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,540
but when I just enjoy it and usually
we both laugh it off and we move on.

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,660
It's just part of my personality,
right? I'm, I'm, I'm a fun guy.

61
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,900
I could be deadly serious and
very academic and scientific.

62
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,470
And as you've correctly pointed in the
past, I could not take myself seriously.

63
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,550
It'd be just one of the guys.

64
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,790
So this is a manifestation of that now
that this person felt sufficiently in

65
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:57,430
bolden and his indignation
that he would try to fire me.

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,180
That's where you should be focusing
on sort of. I don't think that's real.

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,080
I don't think he really
felt so emboldened.

68
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,820
I think what it was is he recognized
that there is a climate today where a

69
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:10,780
person like yourself,

70
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,710
who is a professor who uses a certain
word that is deemed to be offensive by

71
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,980
society, that he can call you
on that word and get you caught.

72
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,700
You got caught up in a net of your
own doing, sir. Well, I'm, I'm,

73
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,310
I'm still here smiling and looking fans,
so that's okay. Do you do look 10 d,

74
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,420
do you regret using that
word at more than anything?

75
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,450
I regret that I ever get sucked
into these battles. That's,

76
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,130
that's it as much because again, it's
a slippery slope today. It's retarded.

77
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:41,560
Tomorrow it's more on the
next day it's schmuck. Yeah.

78
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:46,561
Well that is true in terms of like were
people don't understand calling someone

79
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:51,460
to retard, like say if you're a 30 year
old person today or 25 year old person,

80
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:55,810
let's try 25. Um, you realize
that that is forbidden.

81
00:04:55,811 --> 00:05:00,370
Taboo war when you and I were
25, that word was nothing, right.

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,480
That word you would, you'd get taught
called it by your teacher. Right? I mean,

83
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,590
it's true. That was, and it,

84
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,060
and it was known to be someone who was
retarding you or growth or retarding the

85
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:18,841
class or saying things that were
retarding development of ideas and,

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,130
and logic moving forward that
you're, you're, you're a roadblock.

87
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,580
You're a pile of rocks in the
road. Right. You fucking retard.

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,670
Like that's how people talked about it.
Like that's how they said it,

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
but then it's become a new word
that's victim to this war on words.

90
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,170
Because you're not saying you
have down syndrome. Right.

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,720
What you're saying is you're
a dumb person, you know,

92
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,950
and that terminology, like,
especially the word retarded,

93
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,730
it is not even used
medically. Right. So it's,

94
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,790
it's not a word and the to say that
there's no nuance in this word cannot be

95
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,490
used again about a really
stupid fucking person, right.
