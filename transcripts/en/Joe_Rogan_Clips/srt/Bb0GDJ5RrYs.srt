1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,280
Rent, so I got a bunch of points
for that. It's so funny out to,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,510
to talk about something very interesting.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,250
It's very interesting where this
Harvey Weinstein case is going to go.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,030
Yeah.

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,250
It's very interesting
where it's going to go.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,650
Right now he has Benjamin Bratt as a
charity and if you see what happened,

7
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:24,450
Benjamin Bratt push for
dismissal and he didn't get it.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,270
The lawyer said,
the judge said a trout day,

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,250
they're going to get a trial date.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,990
Harvey Weinstein's going to go
through a more money to pay off time.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,270
I was going to go for time.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,670
Then he's going to fire Benjamin
Bratt and show up with two women,

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,870
primarily one black and one
Asian or one white and one Asian.

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,410
This is when this trousers
and they get very interesting.

15
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,310
Harvey's also going to hire billions
of dollars and prosecute in a private

16
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,430
investigators.
They're got interview boyfriends.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,700
They're going to interview this case.
It's going to be very interesting.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,790
I like the Cosby case where
cars be didn't really fucking,

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,020
how do you know he's going to do other
stuff because I know this is what I would

20
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:14,854
do.

21
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,490
I know if you come to me and you go home,
I'm getting busted for this.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,230
What do I do? Because of how I grew up
around those people. This is what you do.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,480
Benjamin breath can not ask a woman the
same question a woman can ask a woman,

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,070
so I'm going to go in there
with either a black woman,

25
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,660
an Asian woman,
or a white woman.

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,390
My first two choices were
black on the national month.

27
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,160
You want to get the diversity angle and
I got the diversity angle and I want to

28
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:50,830
get that. You can't. You're saying
that because you're a black woman,

29
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,200
Chinese woman.
What I'm trying to step,

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,640
did you ever really watched
the people versus Oj Simpson?

31
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,160
Very interesting and said, it's time
that you sat. Now the holidays they go,

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,990
yeah, the FX version. I watched
one episode that seemed very good,

33
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:11,510
very interesting. How he put
a Dream Team together. Geez,

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,850
it's going to cost you 10 mil. Listen
to me. Gee, you got two options.

35
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:20,020
You're going to like Cosby being paid
two mil and make believe you're blind or

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,950
we put together a fucking, you see
him? He wasn't there with that milk.

37
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:27,400
You should over Xyz.
Like the guy from Kung Fu,

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,280
let me when we was kids come
the food's father. Yeah.

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,910
Kung Fu followers like that blind
and shit. Yeah, I remember that.

40
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:38,520
That milk of Magnesia designed shit.
That's how cosmi willing that plane.

41
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,870
Like I'm sick. Routine.
He's got cataracts.

42
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,700
Yeah.

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Oh Cosby. Yeah, but he didn't have
cataracts when he was like that,

44
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,530
that when he did you put the
pill in the water either.

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,020
He knows what he knows what the fuck. And
so three steps read your shit. Fucking,

46
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:56,620
you know. Yeah, he knows. But
Harvey has to play this hand.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,740
This is what America's about the watch.

48
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:03,070
They're going to watch something
fucking crazy. He probably knows.

49
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,840
He can't go in there. And
Benjamin Bratt, Benjamin Bratt.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Gravano look at the list of Benjamin
Bratt has and Benjamin Bratt can attack a

51
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,130
woman show. You look at it
like legal cases, like sports.

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,180
He's got this one paper.
Listen to me.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,120
John Jones versus Gustafson.

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,340
I went to New York last week and I went
to the Metropolitan Museum of art with

55
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,600
my daughter.
She loves art.

56
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,730
And while I was sitting there I was
added saying them goatee on your own,

57
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,600
cause my daughter didn't want me taking
pictures in front of the statutes anyway.

58
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,540
She's like, Daddy, get out of the
pictures of the statute. So I'm like,

59
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:43,020
what the fuck am I hanging out with
you for? She was in a Chinese wedding.

60
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,490
I wanted to see the Armenian wing,

61
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,580
but it was funny how I was thinking
about when I was 21 and 22 Joe Rogan.

62
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:55,230
I would get stoned to the gills and
go to the Museum of Natural History,

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,240
the Museum of my hobbies back then
since I was such a loan and then people

64
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,400
looking for me,
I was always a criminal.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,590
I would go over the bridge to either go
to one of those museums while I would

66
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:08,460
sit in the courtroom.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,670
I would go to a place that had a fucking
Italian sandwich and I got a bag of

68
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,290
wise potato chips in a 16 ounce
coke and you go to any court room.

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,920
Court starts at seven at
the metropolitan downtown.

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,120
I take the a train and I'd walk.
I forget now what you know.

71
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,520
This is 1983 81 I was a
kid and I would sit down,

72
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,240
observe night court.
I learned how to,

73
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,430
plus I grew up in that.
You were what?

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,280
You'd sit and watch Nightcore like
you'd watch a basketball game,

75
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:47,281
like a pick up game with a sandwich
and a soda and potato chips.

76
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,080
I think it was a lot of people don't
realize you could just go to court and I

77
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,510
would watch do what? 12 people,
how I would learn how to set bail.

78
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,120
Can you do that anytime you walk and you
just get in there and watch in the 80s

79
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:02,770
yes. Now this bomb detectors you up
that the reason why you're there,

80
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,210
do you have to if you're
interested in the case? Yeah,

81
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,850
he'd go down and just
watch it. If you, you know,

82
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,280
for whatever reason
there's a speeding thing.

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,700
Like someone lost their license and they
got arrested driving and trying to get

84
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,760
away from cops or you can go watch
that and go, go home support and Joan,

85
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,950
I would like to go and I see,

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,120
I would like to see what the fuck was
going on when those guys are trying to get

87
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:28,210
away from the cops to helicopter chasing
them with the spotlights and they just

88
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:31,450
keep going like, what the fuck
were you thinking? Like what?

89
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,230
I would like to get to that courtroom
here. I want to see that guy.

90
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,401
I want to look at that guy.

91
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,160
And it was like running from the cops
at the fucking spotlight from the

92
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,140
helicopter on me knew he wasn't going to
get away and he's gotten people off and

93
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,920
traveling the fucking side though.
Nobody ever gets away.

94
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,820
Does anybody ever gotten away recently?
The other night,

95
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,580
that parking garage,
I couldn't find them in garage.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,690
They get away the percentages lemme
lemme explain something to right.

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,230
The percentages are very fucking low,
right? It's tough to get away, bro.

98
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,064
They got you.

99
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,170
Once those helicopter spot you running
through neighborhoods three you're going

100
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:10,430
into a mall, they have cameras, they
can rewind the cameras and watch you go.

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,260
If you're running into the mall,
they got over there.

102
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:16,280
He has I spot on the cards
and stuff. They, they, they,

103
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,250
what happens here? You want to know what
happened to see what happens to you.

104
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,360
All right. First of all, it's usually
spot. Skyline is following you.

105
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,410
So they got, yeah, they got to put
you on the floor, kick your legs,

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,540
do everything by procedure on camera
that they pick you up, they handcuff you,

107
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,160
they put you on the side of the car.

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,670
The guy tells you this whole white
version of what happened to the pursuit

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,050
started on wanting, yes.

110
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,740
Suspect was moving at a high
rate of speed. Fucking, you know,

111
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,930
if I just had to chase you for 20 miles,

112
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:51,140
I pissed him my you for they
put you in the fucking trunk.

113
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,130
They put you in the back
seat in front of everybody.

114
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:57,890
So the cameras take pictures and they put
a cop next year learning to drive day.

115
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,640
You got a couple back hands to your
face. You know what I'm saying? That you,

116
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:04,760
you hit the steering wheel or
something to hey a couple of times.

117
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Then you go in there and you sit in
the holding tank and then you fucking,

118
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,730
if you're with one another person,
you just shut your fucking mouth.

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,100
You want to call your lawyer.

120
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,740
I call him glad that you want to call
your lawyer because you want one of the

121
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:26,650
other guys to get a lawyer. So then
like that you'd have to get uh, it's,

122
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,380
it's pump, it's, it's
conflict of interest. So me,

123
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:35,240
you and Jamie got arrested right now I'm
going to shut my mind how you want me

124
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:39,020
to call my attorney later because I
know for a fact Jamie's going to get a

125
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:39,890
public defender.

126
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,270
So now I can't get a public defender
because that's conflict of interest.

127
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,420
So the state has to pay for
a different attorney for me.

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,320
Well a lot of people don't know that.

129
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:54,920
So if you got arrested with two or
three people, you keep your mouth shut.

130
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,160
You had call my attorney and later you
have an attorney. Yet. I forget his name,

131
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,320
but Jamie cop,

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,760
public defender now to public
defenders can't represent you.

133
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,450
How you got a better chance
of getting a better attorney

134
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,590
and the state pays for it.
It's on the young.

135
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,980
So next time you pay for your mortgage and
go, God damn it, this state Texas side,

136
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,370
it's cause the jerk off like me went
with fucking Johnny run battlebots and

137
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:27,010
fucking he wants 800 an hour even though
the state will give him a 400 and now

138
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,420
it's like wholesale,
you know what I'm saying?

139
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,450
But I at least I got a better type
of attorney. You game the system,

140
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,160
you game the system.
It really is fucking crazy.

141
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,100
How I love figuring this shit
out. You'll do, you break,

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,110
you're writing things down
like you weren't even thinking.

143
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,890
You just automatically started writing
down numbers and percentages. Oh yeah,

144
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,670
I know this shit. I grew up in
this shit and it's like a sport.

145
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,340
So that's what he'll do
heartened by the time.

146
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,900
How are we bringing on a rape case?

147
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:58,890
You got to go up there and we the story
and tell the dates and if there was a

148
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:01,440
rape kit,
it's very fucking tough.

149
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,300
There's going to be very interesting
pro what's going to happen.

150
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,470
The only thing is anything he cops to,
he's going to come,

151
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,770
they're going to come back and I'm
like, oh, Jay. And tried to sue them.

152
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,630
So then he'll just live in Florida to
make them fucking super eight films down

153
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,960
there. Fucking Miramar, Florida,
whatever. Fucking go crazy.

154
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,230
When you see somebody get sued
because they work the system.

155
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,990
I'm not saying nothing bad here.

156
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,850
That's what your advisors and your
people around you will tell you.

157
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,250
He's in hot water for the rest of his
life because even if he gets that down to

158
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:41,010
like an assault charge and he has
to serve eight months, 12 months,

159
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:44,690
which is really eight,
once he gets out,

160
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,360
all the civil suits are
going to come at him

161
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,930
and then he has to pull an old jam moved
to Florida where they can't touch your

162
00:09:52,931 --> 00:09:57,610
pension or some bullshit money.
He had something like that.

163
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,170
Wow.
