1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,620
Ages and what I like about him do
we stand for the same thing, Eh,

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,590
then I stand for, for against
the performance enhancing drug.

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,100
And I think is very important for me.
And it,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,060
for me it was that cannot
honor to fighting him.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,330
It was like a lot of guy he lost to this
guy that they would have been cut on

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,210
performance enhancing drugs
and, and um, he's very open.

7
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,840
He talks about it all the time
and then I think is great.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,610
Great model for this part. Yeah, I know,
I agree. I agree. And a great model for,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,020
it's just an example of how you can
achieve great things if you work hard.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,640
And that's what he's done is
he's one of that guy that like,

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,600
I hate him when I wasn't trying again,
but I loved them as well. And the same,

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,493
same time.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,420
I remember at one point I want to point
where in a conference in Toronto and

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,430
that is it. And the larger
story, I've thought a conference,

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,440
we go by the bag, kind of the
back door of a mall. And um,

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,950
there's like a, I don't know if it's
a, it was staged or not. I've, I mean,

17
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:06,150
I'm not aware if it was stage, I wasn't
that aware of it. So there's a camera,

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,070
like I think he's said was TMZ or
something. It was a camera that follow.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,380
So there were kids following us
too. They're about to ask us. The,

20
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,490
asked me to take pictures and then
I say camera coming towards me.

21
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,040
And then that's Michael.
That's after the,

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,210
the governance and Michael the
system using, they'll let you f book,

23
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,820
you're an on me again
because then, and then, uh,

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,910
then I look in his face and I was like,
what as I do it, I'll put you back.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,580
And then he create, create
kind of a buzz word, a fight,

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,370
and we start to shout at each other and
it kind of almost pushed each other.

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,070
I'm Jason [inaudible] boys
leave it fortified. Boy,

28
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,210
that is so, but it's, it's
not staged. It's true. Now
I'm like, man, what the hell?

29
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:50,940
He is doing there,
but then after I realize it go,

30
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,460
it was on TMZ where I come out
right there. Then they kids,

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,080
they came through asking me for
another graph. They can, they can.

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,140
They kind of get a intimidating,
they were like,

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,520
they went back. Then I turned
around, I was like, it's okay.

34
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,970
It's Spanish and all you can
come in and go. They get,

35
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,250
when they went back to their, I read,
I'm like, Oh God, what? It is what it is,

36
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:15,390
you know? But that was probably the
best promotion of the old fight,

37
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,970
like that particular as an incident,
you know what I mean?

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,140
So I hate him and I love him the same way.
Michael just kind of a guidance.

39
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,250
He's,

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,250
he's a pro at at boosting the
anticipation for a fight hype.

41
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,520
You want to hate them,
but you kind of love him.

42
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,610
And then the same way for the human
being that he is, you know? No,

43
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:39,800
he's great to talk and shit
for sure. Yeah. That is a
big thing these days. I mean,

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,400
especially after Connor,

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,410
Connor Mcgregor has kind of changed the
sport and a lot of ways and that there,

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,440
that shit talking is a, it's
a huge factor now. It is,

47
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,410
but sometimes you don't know when is
really when it's not because I'm not,

48
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,850
it's not part of my personality.

49
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:58,470
And same thing at the Espn in Boston,
same thing.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,910
We do an interview, we go back
and forth, Blah Blah Blah.

51
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,390
I kind of almost insulting each other.
So resource me.

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,000
Then, uh, the UFC does everything to
separate us for me, one of each other.

53
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,830
Like I'm like,
I don't know if it's real or not.

54
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,740
I don't even know if he's trying to push
my, I gotta push him back cause I feel,

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,690
I felt threatened thing.

56
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,560
So you don't know if it's hype or
myself because I'm not an instigator.

57
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:23,020
I don't like golf rotation,
but it is what it is.

58
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,390
So I go to the bathroom in between.

59
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,240
Who comes next to the bathroom with us?
It's by code base back then.

60
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:34,680
Is that Camaro that Paula was in a
bathroom. I'm, we're taking a piss now.

61
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,560
Next to each other. We're
like this. Then I see Michael
Bizarre, like, oh, this shit.

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,130
Then the camera at any telecom
area, two to f out is, I get out,

63
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,040
the number camera goes out. They
need, look at me, look at him.

64
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,890
Then he started laughing,
then started laughing.

65
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,980
Then I told him, I said, hey, you
get a range rover? He's like, yeah,

66
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,610
but now he's in the garage.
I'm like, yeah, it's a,

67
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,430
you need to get rid of it because after
a while it does start breaking down is I?

68
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,860
Yeah. You know, it was, I
came game phase two later

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,490
on. Do you want to hate that guy
like this? You know what I mean? Oh,

70
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,210
that's hilarious. But I hate him
because when we, we insult each other,

71
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,020
we say real and salt and real things
that we think about each other, but in a,

72
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:20,380
in a way we have the respect.
Yeah. So it's really,

73
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:24,820
but so with that relationship that
I have with Bisping was very unique.

74
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,910
I didn't have the same relationship
with Diaz, for example, Diaz.

75
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,610
I didn't know if like if I meet him,
him even industry too,

76
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,510
they may be hates my guts. Like I
don't know what he's going to write.

77
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,470
I don't know if he wanted to fight me
or he might really want to fight you,

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,750
but he's not a hype guy.
I think he's,

79
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,110
I think he takes it personal
and I think he, it's, man,

80
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:49,060
it's a freakin spark man is
more to life than what it is.

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,960
It was a are fighting his might now,
man, fighting is not my life, man.

82
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,400
My life is my family. Man is,
is my friend. The people I love.

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,140
This is what I do in my life is not
my life. I need, the fighting is over.

84
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,000
It's over. I turned around and do
something else. You know what I mean?

85
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,790
Like is what I do in my life, some
of my life. You know what I mean?
