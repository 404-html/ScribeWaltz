1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,050
I was military for four years.
We really are.

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:08,580
We in commerce as it, I was the
word. I was a cop in the military.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,713
Really.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,170
Nobody believes I was the worst cop
ever have made one arrest in four years.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,150
And I was because of girl
came through the gates,

6
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,930
he has some big titties and I
decided I needed to pull her over,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,920
but I was the worst fucking car and I
had to get out of the military because I

8
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,370
used to hear this phrase all the time,
airman Rollins,

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,520
your blatant disregard for established
military policy shows a lack of military

10
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,040
brain and integrity. I
didn't hear that. I was like,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,980
these muff was going to gun to
kick me out if was four years.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,610
I was a cop station and coons on
Korea station in Bolan and you SEO,

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,080
Tom saying NSCO Nuna how you go.
They get talked to care. Herso wow.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,080
Um,
four years military,

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,800
three years to two years in Korea,

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,300
two years at Bolling air force base.

17
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:02,160
And I got out and just randomly went
to a comedy club, became a heckler.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,590
I was an asshole.

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,790
I just go to his comedy club every
Wednesday to fuck with the comedians were,

20
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,990
was it Kami connection to greenbelt?
It was like the black comedy club in DC.

21
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,320
This was the time of when Martin
Lawrence is on fire to def jam thing was

22
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,050
popping in and they had on
black comedy clubs. It would be,

23
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,070
it would be a pizza shop. They'll just
turn. Okay now. And it's a comedy club.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,150
Monique had a club that she made a turn
from a restaurant to a comedy club just

25
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:30,360
because she got more business on the
weekend as a comedy club in restaurant and

26
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:34,120
it took it over and I used to go
heck with the comedians and I,

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,260
I was such a good heckler that people
used to come to the show to hear me

28
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:44,190
heckle. There'd be at the door like, Yo,
is that asshole do gon be here tonight?

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,870
And that was me and the club owner dare
me to go on stage because he wanted to

30
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,180
shut me up Java.

31
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,220
So cocky after four weeks of Hecklin I
tried to make a deal with the club on,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,380
come on, I swear. I know,
I'm telling you. I said,

33
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:04,110
I know I've increased business by 30%
we just started working on the door.

34
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,030
He looked at me like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

35
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,940
Anybody in DC to tell you this story?
And they wanted me to shut up.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,050
They asked me to go on stage and I went
on stage and the first time I went on

37
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,180
I've murdered to shit and I knew that I
wasn't going to be doing anything else

38
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,510
with my life by doing that. I just
knew it. It was just like, fuck,

39
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,550
fuck all like Pat, Pat, pat. How did
it feel? It felt great to remember it.

40
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,770
I remember it because
she was in your mind.

41
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,980
I remember it because I had
talked so much shit to this point.

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,750
And the thing about it was,
but th th th the room of the energy,

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,960
the energy of the room was there because
there was a lot of people that came.

44
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,860
They saw me and they were like, I think
like when you gonna go with you should,

45
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,110
you know, they were like, you
should try. You should try.

46
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,660
So the first time I went on,
people were excited about it.

47
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,750
They didn't know what to expect and I
wrote all these jokes. I'm like, I got,

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,730
I got 30 minutes. I was like,
I was so cocky. We say have
an open mic and you know,

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,090
Mike List is like 30 people and I would
be like 10 on the list and they would

50
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,670
keep bumping me. And I thought they were
just trying to save me the headline.

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,190
I didn't think they were just trying
to give me the shittiest spot,

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,400
but half the club came to see
me so they will stay there.

53
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,260
And at first time I went on,

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,280
I had all these jokes I planned I was
going to do and when, what else date? Uh,

55
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:20,080
drew a complete blank. I don't remember
shit. And then I went, what I knew best.

56
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,710
I started fucking with someone in
the audience. I got a laugh. It did.

57
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:26,800
I did my material and I've,
I didn't know what the light was.

58
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,400
They gave me the light and
I was like, oh, I got go.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,220
Like you're not a light means
just make that your last joke.

60
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,190
And I got off abruptly.
As I said,

61
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:40,930
I got to go and people started
booing. Hosts went up and
there was, I know Daniel,

62
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,740
he doesn't know he's new. Is this first
time he don't know what the light me,

63
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,450
he'll be, he was like,
he'll be back. And um,

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I was there almost every Wednesday for
eight months and then I moved to new

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,740
first I moved to New York and six months.
Wow. Said I'm Outta here. Where'd you go?

66
00:03:56,741 --> 00:04:01,630
First Club was on live, either
one. Brooklyn, Brooklyn.

67
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,420
You got them as a bad barrel. That's
why I till it stops. But Brooke,

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,910
it was interesting to me cause I didn't
go from DC to like mainstream white

69
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,280
colors. I was doing still
to kettle rooms and shit.

70
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,780
And a lot of times I couldn't get spots.
So I would go to a, I will go to the um,

71
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,280
poetry open mikes,
cause that she used to be so dull,

72
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,740
the water was shifting the
wave wave and I'd be like,

73
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:30,960
does anybody want breaks for the shit?
Right. And then I will go do Chelsea.

74
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,040
When I couldn't do Conoco's,
I would do that too.

75
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,220
I started making a name for myself
and never looked back. It was dope.

76
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:40,010
New York is a great place
to get your chops up. Great.

77
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,560
What year do you enter New York?

78
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,780
It had to be probably like 95,

79
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,530
probably like 95 giant already moved.
I'd gone,

80
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,680
I left in [inaudible] 94 to come to la.
Oh yeah. When did you get out of here?

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,270
I got here like seven years ago,
maybe eight years ago. And there was,

82
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:59,560
because my,

83
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,240
my sister was different because I wasn't
getting a lot of roadwork and I was

84
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:04,890
like,
well fuck,

85
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,170
if I'm not getting a lot of road work I
might as well try to get more film and

86
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,990
television stuff to move out to la
and they to move out here. I um,

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,600
started getting more personal.
Parents are.

88
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:19,601
So basically I moved to La and became
a road comic and I wasn't mad at it

89
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:23,880
because after you've done it for a while,
you just want an,

90
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,280
where the fuck can I can make money doing
this shit. You know what I'm saying?

91
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,520
If it's the road is the road, you
know what I mean? If it's Hollywood,

92
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,280
it's Hollywood.
But who's going to pay me some money?

93
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,760
And it was the road to now
like I do 40 weekends a year,

94
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,550
but with me having a,

95
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,920
a young kid now trying to focus more on
film and television and get some more

96
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,410
stable shit, cause I'm, I'm getting a
little, you know, it's getting burnt.
