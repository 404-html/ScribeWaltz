1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,810
Now, worse part is the
Old New York speaking of,

2
00:00:02,811 --> 00:00:04,920
of the people who are
older people are retiring.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,050
They can't stay in New York state because
it's too expensive, too expensive.

4
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:12,150
So they pack up and go to
a North Carolina, South
Carolina, Florida. Is it taxes,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,880
real estates?
Both its taxes and it's an opportunity.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,890
It's both of those two
things, right? So it's so,

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,680
so they decided to head on down in
North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,

8
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,140
Tennessee. They actually have
a name for us in the Carolinas.

9
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:26,400
They call us halfbacks. We went to
Florida and halfway back. That's true.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,620
They calls halfbacks.
That's how many New Yorkers go there.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,360
But he's the worst part. Go
to Florida. Go, ah, this is
a mistake. There we go. Say,

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,540
well the sad part here is though,

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,770
Florida actually has more people than
we have and half of our budget and,

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,710
and Scott actually the governor Scott
actually thanked Cuomo for sending all the

15
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,640
people down there because 15% of New
York state's budget is actually pensions.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,510
And so many people who are pensions
are actually leaving New York state and

17
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,010
going someplace else.
So New York state,

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,370
people are paying for the pensions and
then they're being spent in other states.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,700
It's a terrible idea.
We, the state is broken.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,330
It is so broken and people are
talking about if you're Democrat,

21
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,240
you're saying everything's still great.
If you're Republican, you're saying,

22
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,630
well tweak this or tweak that.
I'm saying rebuild from scratch.

23
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:11,100
There are things you have to change.

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,730
You have to change the route so you
can make the branch is actually died.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,010
We keep clipping branches,
the weeds to keep growing.

26
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,000
Now we got way off track with this um,
school shooting thing.

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,740
And I wanted to get back to it because
I think it's a very complex issue and I

28
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,680
need is,
I don't know what the answer would be.

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,150
I think there is no one in town,
right?

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,610
I think you've found problems and these
problems that you're willing to discuss

31
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:38,730
it. Very few people are. Yep. Are
these people are lonely and sad,

32
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,730
but it's a public suicide and that
they're on psychotropic drugs? Absolutely.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,150
And I don't know why you don't think
that other people want to fix it.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,620
I just don't think that they have a
solution that they can discuss that is not

35
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:54,150
so controversial that it overwhelms
the rest of their messages.

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,970
What could be done? Sure. I
have a couple of answers. Okay.

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,470
The issue is this is an issue that's
been going on literally for decades,

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,220
so there is no do this and it's done.
Right? Right. There are several things.

39
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,290
One of them is fixing education.

40
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,860
The other one is fixing family courts
is said two things. You can start slow.

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,870
We'll show how do you fix education?
Absolutely.

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,090
It is a complete reboot right now.

43
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,940
The first thing you gonna do
with education is you want
to make sure there is no

44
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:20,760
standardized testing until high school.
None whatsoever.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,550
Santa's nice testing is bad for
several reasons. Number one,

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,270
it's an unfair way of getting teachers
right teachers and are graded by how

47
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,310
their students do on a standardized test,
which is silly.

48
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,770
That doesn't mean you're a
good or a bad teacher. Next,

49
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,850
it makes a bunch of kids who are 10
11 1213 years old feel stupid because

50
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,190
they're not good test
takers and you create.

51
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,790
Now a secondary class of student for
absolutely no reason because the next

52
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,670
reason is standardized testing is
no indication of success in life.

53
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,810
You could be a great test taker at 12
or 13 or terrible test taker and it does

54
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,090
not mean you'll be successful
or not successful in life.

55
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,600
Last is how New York state,
often we'll decide how to fund schools,

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,210
so it's a way of funding schools.
That's also unfair.

57
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,990
There's no advantage to standardized
testing except it meet means the federal

58
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:03,670
government now begins to
control our schools more.

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,870
So when you say the standardized testing
has an, there's an effect on funding,

60
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,930
does that mean that if a school does
really well, they get more money? Yup.

61
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,220
Often it's part of a,

62
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:16,300
a very complex algorithm that New York
state has that almost no one can actually

63
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,120
find. That seems like it
should almost be the opposite,

64
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,630
that if a school does poorly that they
should put more resources into that

65
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,600
school because it's not being
effective in theory. That's true.

66
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm not sure that's accurate either.
We,

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we throw about $22,000 per student per
year in New York state more even in

68
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,260
California and it doesn't work.

69
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:35,050
We have mediocre results at
best dollars isn't the answer.

70
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,870
It's revamping the system.
Right? Funding is not the answer.

71
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,680
So how do you revamp the system?
There's more parts of that.

72
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,730
First one was just covering of that.

73
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:46,060
The second thing is we shouldn't even
have k through 12 k through 12 was an

74
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:50,380
anachronism and shouldn't exist because
the last two years she be k through 10

75
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,030
the last two years of high school
for a huge chunk of people, Jim,

76
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,470
study hall,
Video Games and probably smoking weed,

77
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,400
just nothing but bad foot.
Too many students just
sitting around doing nothing.

78
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,990
They have no purpose. They had no
community. They have, they had no,

79
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,970
no reason to do anything.
They're unhappy. Right?

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,380
Another reason why they're unhappy.

81
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,770
It's not a gross generalization that
they're unhappy and an unknown thing and

82
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,210
you just probably a lot of kids listening
to this that are 16 and 17 they're

83
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,540
working their ass off right now and I
have a passion for that future and I have

84
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,790
a solution for them. That's even
better. I have a solution. Again,

85
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,060
your limits that's going to keep
moving. Okay, go ahead. Right.

86
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,410
First thing is how do I know
what I just said is true, right?

87
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,140
You just asked that question. I'll
tell you why. What I just said, why no,

88
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,350
it's true because for the vast majority
of students going to college now,

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,580
the First Year of college is 13th grade
because they're not ready for school

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,320
because the last two years didn't
prepare them for college. If it did,

91
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,260
we wouldn't require it. 13th grade,
I don't know how to say 10th grade.

92
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,410
The average student now take
six years to graduate college,

93
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,590
so the results show me that I'm correct,
right?

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,110
The results of what's happening
and here's the worst part.

95
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,690
Now we shipped these kids off to college
who many of them don't even want to go

96
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,840
to college. So we sent him anyway.
It takes them six years to graduate.

97
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,600
The 24 years old with at least 50 k in
debt, if not more, minimum for decay,

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,370
some a hundred k something,
200 k depending what it is.

99
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,670
And now there's no job for what they
want to do and now they're working at

100
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,900
Starbucks. Wow. What a disaster that is.
We wonder why our kids coming back home.

101
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,940
So how about this, since that at 10th
grade took a test, you pass the test,

102
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,730
you get diploma. Whether you were
home, school, private school,

103
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:26,560
Public School is yours.
Awesome.

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,320
Now you have five choices and
this is exactly to your point.

105
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,560
You have five choices. Choice number
one, you're a kid who's hardcore.

106
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,560
You think that college is your answer?
Good. Go to to your prep school.

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,440
Imagine that kid who right now
he just had is busting his ass.

108
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,010
He could be in as in a prep
school of his choice. And,

109
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,680
and the people in that prep school are
all kids who want to be in that prep

110
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,590
school.
It would change his entire situation,

111
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,680
no more knucklehead who don't want to
be there, who are forced to be there,

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,700
who are cutting class.

113
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,130
The kids who would be there
are those who want to be there.

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,740
The teachers and in this planet,
no disciplinary issues.

115
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,060
They kids who want to be there better
for them. They could hustle better.

116
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,780
Now they're ready for college.
When they get there,

117
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,810
they take advantage of incubators of,
of internships.

118
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,350
Maybe even graduating three years now.
The Rock and roll them less debt.

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,610
Better off life is good. Better services,
better everything for less money.

120
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm not done. You're not that kid.
You're the kid who is super smart human.

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,690
Become a scientist. You want
to be, get a phd. Awesome.

122
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,770
Go right to an associate's degree.
Start right away. 16, 17, 18,

123
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,590
continue to agree because you're that
good. Take your sats. You're that smart.

124
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,520
You're Einstein. Awesome. Go do that.
Not, you know, want any of those things?

125
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,140
No worries. Cool to it's school. Uh,
become a plumber or a carpenter, Mason,

126
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,370
whatever the case,
let me go do it.

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,520
New York state desperately
needs tradesmen desperately.

128
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,070
The average trade's person in New
York states about 50 years old.

129
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,940
Too old for an average should be 30
something for an average 35 and before an

130
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,290
average,
it's too high,

131
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,080
which means we have a lot of
trades jobs that are not filled.

132
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,910
I mean a lot of foreign labor, it has to
come to New York state, right? New York,

133
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:54,830
your kids aren't doing it.

134
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,210
Why we've been told a lie and that
lie is the only way to success.

135
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,670
The only way is to do well in high school.

136
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,550
Get a great for you degree and go get a
job and sit behind a computer all day.

137
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,880
That's a lie.
That is a way to success.

138
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,970
It is not the only way to success.
There are a lot of kids now,

139
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,850
and I'm sure you know people like
this who they spent the first five,

140
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:18,410
10 years of their life trying to make
it that way, struggling through school.

141
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,990
Then at 28 years old, they go, I
just want to build houses, man.

142
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,530
Then they go build the house or that's
what makes us so to be a computer guy and

143
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,720
they just make apps. He's
gonna do something, want to do.

144
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,690
They should have been doing that
at 18 well, I'm still not done.

145
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,480
Most people though,
they don't know what they want to do.

146
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,600
This is a big part of it. I get the
whole time, don't have a passion.

147
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:39,080
They don't have a direction
and they're confused. Yes. I,

148
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,240
this is one of my biggest complaints
I got about this plan, right?

149
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,510
Because then the two ideas are
because he'll get a job, right.

150
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,730
Just go work or sort of
business and what you just said.

151
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,710
That's why I get all the time.
But Larry, they're 16 they're not.

152
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,120
They're doing good.

153
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,210
Make Your mistake at 16 not 26 we're
making mistakes at 26 and we have people

154
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,040
who are lost at 26 we
have a generation now.

155
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,400
If you ask the people in their twenties
right now across this across this nation,

156
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:04,610
and you say, do you feel like
an adult over half will say no,

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,710
have have you say no 40 year olds
also though? Not as much, but yes,

158
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,500
but not as much though. It probably would
be over half. It won't be over half.

159
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,680
Okay. You go to your 20
somethings over half will say no,

160
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,300
I don't feel like an adult.
Right,

161
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:21,110
because they're making the same
mistakes that many people May,

162
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,880
1819 16 they're not making a 25 26 28
it's also not a rights of passage things

163
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,850
though thing that actually happens.
This would actually be that.

164
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,480
They'd have to make that choice
at 16 but here's the issue.

165
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,090
How do I pay for it and it covers the
entire sheet that we just talking about.

166
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,400
That's the next question I get. How
you paid for it. New York state says,

167
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:40,990
I have to pay for full 12 years of
school. Have to pay for it, stay next,

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,900
pay for it. No worries. I was a
marine when I got the Marine Corps.

169
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,780
I got a Gi bill x dollars,
I think it was $100,000.

170
00:08:47,781 --> 00:08:51,210
I forgot what it was back then. This
is in the 90s. Um, I think at $100,000,

171
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,130
like 10 years to use it,

172
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,100
we're going to give all of our kids
$20,000 and five years to use it.

173
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,240
They don't get the physical check,

174
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,260
but the state will pay a check to whatever
school they want to go to for $20,000.

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,470
They have five years to use it.
Where does that mean? You can at 16?

176
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,650
So experimenting. You can say, you
know what? I know colleges for me,

177
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,920
I'm gonna go to prep school. Here's what
I promise you. I promise you this, the El,

178
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,830
but any amount of money you want,
I promise you this.

179
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,120
As soon as this comes into play,

180
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,980
you will find tons of all of a sudden
prep schools and trade schools the pop up

181
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,870
and guess how much they're
going to cost for two years,

182
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,560
$20,000 that's going to be a
tuition. You might say, well, wow.

183
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,460
Laris a lot of money. It isn't. We're
paying $44,000 now, if each of those kids,

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,260
we're saving $24,000 per kid and
giving them better schooling,

185
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,410
more accurate actual choices,
they can learn something.

186
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,500
They make their mistakes at 1617 which
is way better than 26 or 27 and maybe

187
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:46,050
they figure what they want to
do. Well, why is it so cheap?

188
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,710
Why are you going to be able to do that
for $20,000 when it costs so much more?

189
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:54,170
Now? What's going to be different? The
people who can be choosing, right? Yeah,

190
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,970
so the people that are
educating these people, how are
they going to get paid? Oh,

191
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:00,600
and where's the money gonna come from?
Great question. Now, a couple things.

192
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,090
Remember teachers ask me all
the time, they say, Larry,

193
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,010
how are you going to help us?
Here's what I tell you.

194
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm going to get rid of a bunch of
your administrators in New York state.

195
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,030
We actually have school districts that
have more administrators than teachers.

196
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,560
Why? Yes, that's correct. Do you own home?

197
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,860
What's the value of having administrators?

198
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,960
Because you have to check
boxes for government.

199
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,500
You have to check boxes for coming. Did
you do x that you do? Why did you do z?

200
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,240
These administers required, that's
what's going on. That's correct. There's,

201
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,800
there's about $60 billion in our
budget in New York state for education,

202
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,470
give or take about 4 billion
comes from the federal government.

203
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,980
About 35 billion comes from the state
and about 20 billion comes locally.

204
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,100
Give or take it a d. These
are round numbers and they
change yearly depending on,

205
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,020
on, on who you talked
about. It's about that.

206
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,520
Once we get rid of the federal
government, being involved in, in the, uh,

207
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,050
in New York state for being dollars
goes away. People get afraid. Oh my God,

208
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:51,330
we lose that money. Good, good.

209
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,700
Let it go away because all of
the administrators go away. Also,

210
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,620
if you can get rid of three, four, five,

211
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,840
six administrators for every one or
two teachers, oh my God, I'm not good.

212
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:01,860
You national educator. But I
would imagine that if I was, uh,

213
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,270
I would be upset at this.

214
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:07,170
I would say that there's a reason why
those administrators are there and we need

215
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,930
them to take some of the administrative
weight off of the teachers.

216
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:12,630
The teachers are stressed out
enough by teaching students.

217
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,000
They don't have the time
to be taken care of.

218
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,660
All the formalities and the things
that these administrators too. Um,

219
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,510
I have never heard that ever
because that's not true.

220
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,870
You're the first person that ever said
to me ever in over a year of me doing

221
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,200
this. So, and the reason is,
or what are those administered
with you? No, no, no, no.

222
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,660
Not every teacher. I never
heard it. You never heard it.

223
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,680
I'm not just talking to a lot of, lots
of them. Doesn't absolve them. Does,

224
00:11:34,681 --> 00:11:39,600
what did they say about administrating?
They say awesome. It's not in those words,

225
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,590
but yes, because most of the
administrators are actually
administrating teachers.

226
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,060
The teacher telling them
how to teach, what to teach,
when to teach, grading them.

227
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,850
They don't. Who Will the parents?
Well, the parents will. Yes.

228
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:55,600
You think the parents have the time or
the of what an education should comprise

229
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:59,650
of to be able to direct not just their,
their student,

230
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:04,300
what their child needs, but you
know, a group of 50 or however large.

231
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:08,620
The classic question and generally
speaking, probably not, but teachers do.

232
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,360
Teachers too. Yes, they're going to self
police. There'll be some administrators.

233
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,850
You're, you're assuming that I'm going
to get rid of all administrators. No,

234
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,520
no I'm not. I'm not
saying that. I'm saying,

235
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,190
but you're definitely saying that
you went to school with a, hold on,

236
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,024
you went to school.

237
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,630
Do you remember how many vice principals
that were any of your schools you

238
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:29,320
remember? No, I don't. Probably
two or three. That was normal.

239
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,230
It met most schools when I was his goal.
Often it was two or three.

240
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,243
I don't remember.

241
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,140
Now there's 1212 ten four two.
Why?

242
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,440
Why is that? Because their administrators
and they're making sure other things,

243
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,370
they're making sure boxes are checked.
So here's your alternative.

244
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,930
You're alternative is keep funding
a broken system and be afraid,

245
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,180
which is what you're saying. No,
I'm not saying you're saying,

246
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,790
you're saying teachers will be
afraid because afraid. Yeah,

247
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,530
because I afraid who educated our kids?
No, no. Overwhelmed. Overwhelmed. Okay.

248
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,500
Fear of, of being overwhelmed.
Not just, not just that,

249
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:07,240
but also like having
a mandate like having,

250
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,920
Yup, a very strict, I'm
with you. Curriculum. Yes.

251
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,020
Teach these children and that
is nothing but a bad thing.

252
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,850
I'm going to give you real
fast if you don't mind them.

253
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:20,270
Me Give you a list of all the time.
Centralized control has worked. Finished.

254
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,060
Centralized control doesn't work
in in education meaning what?

255
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,390
In anything when a centralized
control make things fun. Bet defined.

256
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,370
Centralized control. A strict mandate from
Albany, a strict mandate from DC. I'll,

257
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,261
I'll ask you a question.

258
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:39,250
I'm assuming you're old enough that you
were in school at one point at 1980 or

259
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,190
older. Oh yeah. Well before I was, yes.

260
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,880
Prior to 1980 basically the department
of education didn't really exist as it

261
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:49,240
does now. It did exist, but it was
basically as a repository for information.

262
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,280
It didn't really do anything.

263
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,850
I didn't have any power since 1980 up
again and have power do this and we'll

264
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:58,150
give you money. Don't do this. We don't
give you money. Here are your rules.

265
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:01,060
Follow them. I'll be punished you
that. That's what they are now.

266
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,450
You learn to read and write. You learn to
function in society, so to die somehow,

267
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:10,060
every American part in 1981 to school,
learn how to read and write,

268
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,430
learn how to function in society.
Somehow it worked.

269
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,130
Do I trust the administrator or a teacher?
I would rather trust the teacher. Now,

270
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,170
does that mean it'd be no ministers?
Of course, that there'll be a minister.

271
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:20,950
Of course they will be.

272
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,230
There'll be still principles and
things of that sort of course,

273
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,420
but the difference is an administrator
cares about checking a box, check a box.

274
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,690
Your citizens aren't better
off because boxes are checked.

275
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,410
You said it's a better off because the
students are getting better and and

276
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,950
because the parents are happier.
Right,

277
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:37,960
but when you're saying
boxes being checked,

278
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,020
that means things being covered that
they feel for a standardized test. Yes.

279
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,790
You two said that they feel significance,
correct? Yes. Well that's someone,

280
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,540
I mean I would said,
I don't know how curriculums are set up,

281
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,550
but I would imagine that
people get together and they
decide that children need

282
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,760
to have a certain amount of
ability. Yup. With grammar,

283
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,670
certain amount of understanding
of mathematics. Yes, I agree. Yes.

284
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:03,230
Who's going to do that? How about
teachers and the local administrators?

285
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:06,500
And how about the local PTA,
which was so less administrators,

286
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,910
not an elimination of administrator. I
never said that. So I didn't say you did.

287
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,660
But how we decide how many administrators
are necessary and how many can you cut

288
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:17,360
out? How much money can you
save? And this is even better.

289
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,520
You know that you're going to love
my libertarian ways on this one.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,070
Right now what happens is there is
a convoluted way of deciding house.

291
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,430
What a convoluted way. Oh, I thought
you said come loaded. Did you hear that?

292
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,960
It could be, but no, I don't think it
alluded to compliment complimentary way.

293
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,450
Like this is a new word and I don't think
it should be used as that. Is that new?

294
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,820
No, not convoluted. The other ones, yeah,
I'm loaded. I was like, this is, boy,

295
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,580
there's a fetish there somewhere.
I'm sure there is.

296
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:46,970
I just haven't heard of me there.
See you. You're ready to go now.

297
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,230
So there's a calm that a way of
actually of funding these schools.

298
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,150
I don't want that.
I want to be very simple.

299
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,360
I want a flat fee to come
from the state here, district,

300
00:15:56,361 --> 00:16:00,230
depending on how many kids
you have, here's your money.
What does that mean? Well,

301
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,780
the reality of it is there are about,
if I'm not mistaken,

302
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:06,830
about 700 school districts in New York
state. A lot. A lot. That's a lot.

303
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,920
It is a lot. And so what happens
now is there's your money.

304
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,010
Most of them are going to make no
changes because they're gonna be afraid.

305
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,090
But it's like anything else.

306
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,700
There'll be early adopters and early
adopters are going to say, wait a minute.

307
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,280
So the federal government
isn't telling us do this.

308
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,260
The state government isn't
telling us to do that.

309
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,380
So we can change some things here.
So when you say here's your money,

310
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,410
they're going to get less money than
they're getting now. It depends.

311
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,140
It depends on the school district.
Some will, some won't there.

312
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,960
It's not like you'll have less jobs there.

313
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:36,860
They're going to have to decide whether
or not they [inaudible]. You got it.

314
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,640
Exactly right. Yes. And you're
saying, oh my God, that's scary.

315
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,820
Some of our school districts will
fail. Yes. But in New York state,

316
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,960
they're all failing now,
so why do I care?

317
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,500
But the west trailers in mass right now,
I'm okay.

318
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,050
I don't want government to be
what you always hear, which is,

319
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,110
you know, elections
have consequences. So I,

320
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:01,280
when I now get to impose my will
upon all of you, because I won.

321
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,240
So what I say goes, I'm supposed
to know everything, be everything,

322
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,620
create boards and make things happen.

323
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,420
I instead want to be the guy who
when you have trouble, I can help.

324
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,620
So as go districts begin to have trouble,
I will without question,

325
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,940
try to help them. Of course I wrote,
but there's 700 that's correct.

326
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,870
How would you have time to
do that? I won't. Personally.

327
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:21,790
I'll have people who would ever,

328
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,980
right now there's already an
infrastructure to handle that already.

329
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,340
I don't have to create a new one
already exists, but right now it's just,

330
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,500
it's making up reasons to punish people.

331
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,250
I don't want it to make up
reasons to punish people. I
want instead to say, okay,

332
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,620
this school district is lost.
How do we help?

333
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,800
I only have one string
attached to the money.

334
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,400
I give only one and that is transparency.
As I told you before,

335
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,780
I'm a business guy and here's what I know.

336
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:48,200
This is an actual equation that
works every single time. Very simple,

337
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,034
simple equation,

338
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,970
personal freedom plus transparency
plus accountability equals innovation.

339
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,880
If we do that,
the other adoptees will come on.

340
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,070
They will find great ways
of making things work.

341
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,950
They will get rid of some administrators,
they will get rid of them. Teachers,

342
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,860
they will hire new ones. They will
decide which one should be given raises.

343
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,380
That will happen. Okay, please go ahead.

344
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,150
Because what you're saying may work in
the world of business because people have

345
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:17,151
incentive to succeed in business and
that accented IV is monetary success when

346
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:21,900
you always monetary, but yes. Okay. Not
always, but for the most part. Yep, sure.

347
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,160
When you're talking about a school yet
and you cut the funding for the school

348
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:27,600
and say, hey, figure it out.

349
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,320
You guys decide how many
administrators you want to keep art.

350
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,270
The administrators'
essentially the bosses,

351
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,980
aren't they the ones who are in control?

352
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
I mean they're not going to
get rid of their own jobs,

353
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,190
so what are they going to do?

354
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,130
You're going to pay the teachers last and
they going to get an inferior teachers

355
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:44,670
and is a great question. Ramp
up their, their control of the,

356
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,740
of the cash flow because they realize
that there's less of it. It is, oh,

357
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,640
it's a great question and here's the
issue. It's not going to happen overnight.

358
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,120
It's not like I went in
November. I go, great,

359
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,860
all the money's gone to how it works.
I went November.

360
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,890
People know what the plan is.
We start talking about it already.

361
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,010
We start bringing parents on board.
We said, coming up with plans already.

362
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,100
The plans, it's like, it's like
it's like any other organization.

363
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,290
You're saying business and think,
oh, it's works in military.

364
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,930
This works in this works in business.
It is matter what's in everything.

365
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,880
We'll see your family.

366
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,530
It doesn't matter if you knew that six
months from now you were going to have a

367
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:20,010
sniff decrease in your income, you
would start to make change. Typically,

368
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:22,020
if there was someone above you saying,
hey Joe,

369
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,620
you're going to have a decrease in
your income. How do we make this work?

370
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,610
What can we do?

371
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,930
If someone's there to guide you and
you already have infrastructure there,

372
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,160
you'll begin to fix it.

373
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,780
My fear would be that they would have
less teachers and they would have the

374
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:40,680
larger classes. Totally possible
administrators because they're in control.

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,030
People don't like to give up control
unless you're a minute control. Well,

376
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,120
who's actually in control with the PTA?
Right? The pantry. Dissociation can.

377
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,180
You can have a lot PTA board decide.
Boards would decide,

378
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,050
but they would have to agree with you.
Yes.

379
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,360
They want to get rid of administrators
and if they didn't universally,

380
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,690
if they didn't universally across the
board in this fails miserably and then

381
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:03,780
classes get larger and then
kids get less attention. Yup.

382
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,900
And then the already Piss poor education
system sinks further into the abyss and

383
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:13,260
we have two choices. Number
one, we can be afraid of that

384
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,780
and stay a hostage to a terrible system
that's not working as failing our kids

385
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,150
and making us in happiness Jordan estate.

386
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,570
That's option one or option to
do that and just watch over it.

387
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,410
Right.

388
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,370
Understanding that that could happen
because those were the only two options.

389
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,110
One other option, the other option is yes,
funded more. Ooh, fuck the bad system.

390
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,700
Boom. No. Why that? If
you had a 10 what's,

391
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:39,940
what's wrong with the system?

392
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:41,740
What's go over that I just
told you I don't know but no,

393
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,360
but I mean in terms of like how
much money are they making, right.

394
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,870
And what would increasing
that amount of money enhance.

395
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,150
Okay.
Two things.

396
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:57,151
Remember the first thing is there's no
way in the world that a governor should

397
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,140
be deciding what every teacher
makes. An estate. Okay,

398
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,450
that's just philosophically wrong,
so I'm never going to do that.

399
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,110
That is simply philosophically wrong.
It's against who I am. Centralize,

400
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,910
centralize.
Control was a bad idea.

401
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:14,740
Localized control is always a better
idea for so that's so that, that premise,

402
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,630
I'm never going to even touch that.

403
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,110
What I'm trying to achieve
here is to make change.

404
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,620
I know that locally there will be people
who do it right because that always

405
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,140
happens. That's just how it works.
You will see out of seven districts,

406
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,430
some of it decide to, you know, get
together and and and mix this together.

407
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,670
Some will decide not to. Some will do
different things. You'll see it happen.

408
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:40,050
My point is this is a major overhaul.
I get it right?

409
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,280
Businesses that all the time,
families do all the time.

410
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,050
If you're able to watch it,

411
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,840
I don't want to be the
mother or the father, right?
Democrats will be your mother.

412
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,860
They would give you everything.

413
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,690
Probably going to be a father and
protect you from everything. I wonder,

414
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,260
your brother, let me to got you love.
You don't want to live with them,

415
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,410
but you love him. And when you need a
ride to the airport, he's there for you.

416
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,440
And with the firefighter, the guy
who comes to help when you need me.

417
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,650
Now you're saying, but Larry
is good. This will fail. Yes.

418
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:09,350
Some ways I want them saying, well, okay,
some might fail. That's you're saying.

419
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,170
I'm not even saying they might fail.

420
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:14,440
What I'm saying is that you're going to
put them in a compromised situation. Yes.

421
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:17,620
You're going to give them less money and
you're going to say figure it out. Yes,

422
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:22,120
but not just see. You're assuming that
it's just here's money. Good luck. No,

423
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,640
here's less money. Yes,
he has less money. Yes.

424
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,740
I think you have too many administrators.
Yup.

425
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,370
And let's talk this out over
a series of several months.

426
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:31,870
When you talk to
professionals and educators,

427
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:35,890
do they agree that they have too many
administrators? Oil wasted money? Yes.

428
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,830
So far everything's your,
I've met, they want,

429
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,260
but they agree they do well with less
money if they didn't have to miss as yes.

430
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,440
And how much less money are we talking
about? I'm not sure to be fought with you.

431
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,423
Not sure yet.

432
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,330
There's someone show you that you feel
like the way to fix the education system

433
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:53,560
is the cut funding that would like for
people like me who are on the outside,

434
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,640
you hear that and you go,
Ooh,

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I already feel like teachers
are underappreciated and
probably because of that

436
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:04,270
unmotivated because you decided
to say the answer is cut funding.

437
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,210
It's not what I saw. No, no, no, no.
This is what you were saying. Yup.

438
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,800
Regardless of what you're saying. Yup.
What I'm saying is currently, Yup.

439
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,600
Even in California, forget
about New York. Yup.

440
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,390
I feel like teachers are underappreciated.

441
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,960
I would agree with that and I feel
like it's a noble profession that's

442
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:23,260
incredibly valuable and the people
should be able to make a decent living.

443
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:23,740
Agreed.

444
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,760
I don't know how the solution to that
is to give less money to the school.

445
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,120
You're missing a very valuable,
very important point.

446
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,030
If you ask most teachers whether
underappreciated, most of them,

447
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,640
they're not going to say that people
like you and I don't appreciate them,

448
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,460
they're going to say,
the system doesn't appreciate me,

449
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,130
and that's why they're always
fighting the system. Oklahoma,

450
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,860
they fought the system.
They're always fighting the system.

451
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,420
What I'm saying is fix the system.

452
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,170
The system is heavily controlled in
many cases by the federal government.

453
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:54,890
$4 billion worth.
So we have to lose $4 billion unless we,

454
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,290
unless we want to keep the
federal government in our system,

455
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,160
but you don't want that.
Your fixes to let them figure it out.

456
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,700
Get the federal government out. Hold on,
let them figure it out with less money.

457
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,670
I have to have to push back
here. Okay. You, you keep saying,

458
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,180
let them figure it out as
if I'm just gonna walk away
and say, oh well good luck.

459
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:14,030
I hope I'm going to go off and now you
know, hang out in Puerto Rico for a while.

460
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,750
No, I'm saying I'm going to facilitate
it because you know what I do?

461
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,120
I trust teachers more
than trust administrators.

462
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,540
I trust the local people that
if I give them the right tools,

463
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,650
they'll do the right thing,

464
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,220
but more importantly they'll
show others as also transparent.

465
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,250
What's going to happen is they're going
to figure out the right way to do what

466
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,120
teachers should.

467
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,800
Should School district one hire more
Spanish teachers versus going to stick to?

468
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,330
I don't know.
I'm not supposed to know that,

469
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:41,360
but they do and if they make
a mistake then they'll fix it.

470
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,340
And then other counties, yes, you.

471
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:46,820
Are you talking about the teachers
themselves or are you talking about these

472
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:48,380
administrators who you want to eliminate?

473
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,410
I'm talking to you about the
school boards. The school,

474
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,500
the school boards are going to be
the ones with, with the PTA, with,

475
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,580
if we make this work the right way,

476
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,520
it will be everyone talking together.

477
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,160
It will be school boards
talking to administrators,

478
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,960
Toma teachers talk with parents.

479
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't want schools graded
beat by standardized tests.

480
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,140
We've been doing that for years and
we have very, very unhappy people,

481
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:19,040
unhappy students, unhappy parents.
I want parents to be happier.

482
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,620
I supposed to be happier and
you might say, but then Larry,

483
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,140
they won't learn certain things.
Is that a horrible thing?

484
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,330
I'd rather than be happy
then learn AP chemistry. Yes.

485
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,960
If that means one school nurse decides
the AP Chemistry isn't that important in

486
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:34,220
a school district,
it's fine.

487
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,490
Those kids will learn it in the prep
school and some kids won't learn AP

488
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:39,440
chemistry.
If that makes your school district happy,

489
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,900
I'm okay with that because
it goes to the next level,

490
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,220
which of course becomes kids with special
needs. You have a special needs kid.

491
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,660
How do you make that kid happy?

492
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,310
How do you decide whether
that kid successful or not?

493
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,650
The standardized testing doesn't work.
What do you do? He said doing checkboxes.

494
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,950
Does that work?
Of course.

495
00:25:54,951 --> 00:25:58,700
That's why you literally have hundreds
of of parents every single year suing New

496
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,310
York state because they were unhappy
with their kids getting services but not

497
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:03,980
getting better.
I want your kid getting better.

498
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,000
You're assuming that because the federal
government puts these standards in it

499
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,180
that makes them good or bad. It doesn't.
If anything, it makes them worse.

500
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,740
If my kids, if my kids are
happy, that's what I want.

501
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,350
Happy New Yorkers means
they stay in New York.

502
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,170
Happy New Yorkers means they grow
their businesses in New York.

503
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,910
Keep the families in need.
I get that,

504
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:26,990
but saying happy and the saying that
solution and the key to happiness is

505
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:31,700
funding them less and getting rid of
administering my the Democrat Joe,

506
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,990
I'm the Democrat. Yes you are. You ought
so a democrat. How am I a democrat?

507
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,050
You got, I mean the world's ending
less funding means the world's anymore.

508
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,550
A lot of people, they hear that you're
going to take money away from school.

509
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,570
The person who only hears that,

510
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,830
if the person says all he's going to do
is get rid of money from schools, that's,

511
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,050
that person is never going to vote for me.
That person is probably a democrat.

512
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,840
That problem's person's going
to go for Cuomo and that's fine.

513
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm not going to win everybody.
I can't win everybody,

514
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,270
but I'm going to change a system that
is completely broken. If you say this,

515
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,420
what you're talking about people talk
about with the MTA also in New York City,

516
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,070
the MTA,
you got to keep funding the MTA.

517
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,020
I'm not going to be hostage to a
ship system, period. I don't care.

518
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,590
I'm not going to be
hostage to a shit system.

519
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,470
This is a terrible system
that is failing New Yorkers.

520
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,060
That is failing people in New York City
when it comes to the MTA mass transit.

521
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,940
I'm sorry. Yes. If those of you who
are not in New York, it's a bad system.

522
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,010
I'm not going to be a
hostile because of fear. No.

523
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:30,780
I will fight my jailer period
and my yellow is a system
that is broken that says

524
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,410
if you, if you, you better give me
more money, otherwise it'll happen.

525
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,580
You better give me more money.
Otherwise this will happen. No, no.

526
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:43,320
I'm going to fix that system. I'm going
to help facilitate fixing that system.

527
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,050
I'm just going to let them go away.
I'm not saying that.

528
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,500
What I'm saying is I'm going
to help facilitate that
system and to do that we're

529
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,320
gonna lose $4 billion and we'll
get over that. We'll fix that,

530
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,183
we'll make it happen.

531
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,480
We'll make it work so by and if you get
more people into this state and this is

532
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:58,470
the most important piece,

533
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,510
you can raise money through other ways
and just raising taxes on people and this

534
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,410
is the most critical piece when we
hear funding, and this is why I'm,

535
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,940
I was teasing you and Kanya Democrat
because we need to about funding.

536
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,340
You're talking about more taxes.
I'm not talking about that.

537
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,040
If you get more people to
stay in New York state,

538
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,500
you raise your revenue without
having to raise taxes on anybody,

539
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,700
but if you raise your revenue,

540
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:19,840
we're going to put more revenue
into the school of course,

541
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:23,040
to be more people in the schools.
More reverent. Yes, absolutely.

542
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,930
Your money and there'll be more
people in the schools that more.

543
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,390
Of course we would if we could
re of course we would. Of course,

544
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,010
New York state has a $170 billion budget
with about a four bay now deficit and

545
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:36,990
$300 billion in debt,

546
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,500
and the answer for every Democrat
Republican is more funding.

547
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,510
There's going to be nothing left.
This state is going to go different.

548
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,140
It's going to go, it's gonna,
it's gonna go under in 10 years.

549
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:48,690
How do you get more people to come
to the store, right? First thing,

550
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:52,800
we're having a really super cold cases
and I talked about super cool education

551
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,990
that'll get people to come back.

552
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,260
Are you going to hire someone to create
this super cool education system?

553
00:28:57,261 --> 00:29:00,540
Are you gonna let these teachers figured
out on their own? If we hate teachers,

554
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:03,280
build me a super cool education
system so that we get more fun.

555
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,170
I already have the, I already have the
infrastructure for the super cool system.

556
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:09,930
I just told you. I've already told
you what the, what the instructor is.

557
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,830
Then the concept already a
skeleton is already there. Okay.

558
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,530
Now once I went in November,
we begin to build it out and yes,

559
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:18,330
it will be me and other people be clear.

560
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,550
It's not like New York
doesn't have enough.

561
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
New York's doesn't have enough workers.

562
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,860
We have tons of workers that we can
absolutely use to make this happen.

563
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,500
Tons of them that if I'm not mistaken,

564
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:33,130
the New York state has the
most by percentage, uh,
government employees I think.

565
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:35,220
And I think in the nation,
I know we're the most unionized,

566
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,690
but I think we're the most, uh, uh,

567
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,970
government employees by percentage or
you're going to move their jobs. Sure.

568
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,060
Love it. Yes, let's do
that. Love the idea.

569
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,620
You're asking details that are simple
to fix when the time comes and simple to

570
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:51,580
fix. So you're going to take people out
of what professions and move them into

571
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,000
fixing.

572
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,540
I think I actually have decided for every
person in New York state where they're

573
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,500
going to do, I don't know. That's why
I'm asking course not you. This is a,

574
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:03,550
you're doing it like a show. Now. I'm
not doing a show. You, you're a democrat.

575
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,430
Look at you. You're a democrat. You
are a democrat. I'm not, I'm giving,

576
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,330
I'm just asking you a
real clean questions here.

577
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,370
You four times said you're going to take
money away. Flicks. You are right. Yes.

578
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,320
You've said like four times,
right? Because you going on
about these other things,

579
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:23,560
which is what matters more than losing
$4 billion from education. Right?

580
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:26,830
But I just want to be clear about what
you're saying about what the actual going

581
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:31,831
to fix this system by creating a good
skeleton off the bat that people are going

582
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,600
to enjoy and like,
and then once I went in November,

583
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:38,680
we're going to fill that skeleton up
to make an amazing school system that

584
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:39,730
people can be proud of.

585
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,520
They're going to want to bring their
people then to come back from North

586
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,220
Carolina that had come back from
Tennessee. They're going to move from,

587
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,880
from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
I'm going to be part of this system.

588
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,100
They're going to see schools
that actually work well.

589
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,020
They're going to see prep
schools get kids into college.

590
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,290
They're going to see colleges and actually
educate kids and get them into jobs.

591
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:59,530
When they see that happen, they're all
start coming. That's going to happen.

592
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,530
It doesn't happen by me saying,
how do I fund this?

593
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,080
It doesn't happen by me saying,
being afraid of making a step.

594
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,500
You don't have to have the
perfect plan to move forward.

595
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:13,780
No plan is perfect anyway. You want a
good solid plan with motivated people.

596
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,650
If you have motivated people to take up
a plan, it'll wind up being successful.

597
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,470
Again, it's how it works. So
this grandiose plan is I like,

598
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,950
you're going to get rid of the last two
years of high school and you're going to

599
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,951
offer potential prep school for
children and you're going to,

600
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,770
for other kids, offer them
trade schools, schools. Sure.

601
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,890
You're going to get rid of $4
billion in federal funding.

602
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,940
You're going to let the schools figure
out how many administrators they should

603
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,120
have with help with help, with
help, and what's the help?

604
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,060
Who are you going to hire it oversee
this whole thing? We'll figure it out.

605
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,650
You figured that out.
Look,

606
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,990
I'm two months from the election and
from the election and then at least six

607
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,480
months from fermentation,
right? At least if I met,

608
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:03,120
that's probably low by mark
nine put anytime this is,

609
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,540
this is come into play until next
September. Right at earliest. Right.

610
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,200
The earliest you can come into play is
next September. I hope it's that fast.

611
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:14,020
That'd be amazing. I hope it is that
fast, but it isn't five minutes.

612
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,380
It's like I'm not doing
this so I can become king.

613
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,440
We would have a king and that's
why we're in trouble. Right, right.

614
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:24,070
I want to give localized control
many more options. I, I'm the,

615
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm the crazy guy who actually means what
he says. When I say let teachers teach,

616
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,530
I actually mean that most
people say it and then they,

617
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,650
and their response then becomes,
give more administrators.

618
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,480
So you think what's stopping them now?

619
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,050
Standardized tests and
administrators and then funding.

620
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:46,590
That's based on the success of the test
and it's correct in the school district,

621
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,200
correct.
The answer is always more funding.

622
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,330
The answer is always more
funding and it isn't.

623
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,080
It is not that people always
say we have to fund fund fund.

624
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,990
That is not the answer there. There are
better answers out there. Of course.
