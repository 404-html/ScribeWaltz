1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,570
Staph infections.
Exactly.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:07,680
So to be able to stop it in its
tracks before it gets systemic, right.

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:11,880
Spray this stuff on a cruise
line for, for the virus, a virus.

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,920
Um, even if it turns out to be that
safe, we're not just wipe down, uh,

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,980
schools.
Oh,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,550
because I was worried about the negative
aspect, like what's gonna Happen?

7
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:26,250
Like what's, what's gonna
be the blowback, right?

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:31,251
Like antibiotics is what's created
medicine resistant antibiotic or staph

9
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:36,000
infections. Right, right, right.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,640
Your mind always jumps to the worst
possible scenario. Love it. Um,

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,610
we'd make it good. Good team. So I'm
the, I got a buddy cop movie. Yeah,

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,620
let's do it. So we've tested, does
it induce antibiotic resistance?

13
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:54,240
And so far it's negative. Hmm. Okay.
Interesting. Oh, nothing. I'll tell you.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,490
Um, so I work with a company
that detects organisms.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,250
So we wanted to detect if there's
another virus coming across the planet.

16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,470
So how do you do that quickly?
Um,

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,450
and how do you do it if you don't
know what you're looking for?

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
So we can take a drop of blood or a swab
off the table and we can see all the

19
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,680
organisms that are there. Um,
we can do your microbiome,
but that's easy. We can do,

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,150
uh,

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,420
so a drop of blood will tell you all the
bacteria and viruses in there and it'll

22
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:26,130
tell you how to kill it, which is
great for healthcare because right now,

23
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,020
microbiology labs I've worked in one,

24
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,940
I used to swab urine and poop on plates.
It was very glamorous.

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,510
That's how it's still done.
That is, that's 19th century,

26
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:40,770
early 20th century technology growing on
a plate. Wait a few days, see what grows.

27
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,270
But that's useless for diseases like
viruses and Lyme disease, Lyme disease,

28
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,520
you know, the, the one from
ticks in your, in your spine.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,440
My daughter got Lyme disease
and she was really sick.

30
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,800
She was losing her eyesight.
Um, it was serious.

31
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:58,140
It got into her brain and the hospital
wouldn't give her the antibiotic because

32
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:58,800
they,

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,820
the tests weren't quick enough and they
wouldn't give her the antibiotic until

34
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,610
the test were positive for
insurance reasons. And I said,

35
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:09,960
just gimme that gimme the DNA of my
daughter, the spinal fluid, I'll test it.

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,820
They wouldn't do that.
So I was furious.

37
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:16,821
So I spun out a company out of my lab
with some very smart bioinformaticians

38
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,510
mathematician software engineers.
Uh,

39
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,690
we built super computers to be able to do
this. Teamed up with a guy in Stanford.

40
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,950
Um, my friend, I mentioned
him, Carlos Bustamante, he's
the guy that, uh, did, uh,

41
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,570
oh, maybe I shouldn't, but he did a
famous person's genome recently. His,

42
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,260
he'd been trained on mummy's,
um, and he did Kennewick man.

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,260
And so this technology can be teamed up
with what I've done to be able to get

44
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,220
rid of all the human DNA out of
blood sample, leave the viruses,

45
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,850
lead the bacteria, and then run that
through us, a computer supercomputer,

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,340
all the DNA and tell you
within probably seconds,

47
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,200
eventually what it is.

48
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,040
So my daughter would have a diagnosis
within eventually be just 10 minutes

49
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,290
instead of waiting a week.
Wow.

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,490
Lyme disease is terrifying there.

51
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,510
There are so many people
that are infected with it.

52
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:12,511
And I know personally maybe 10 people
that have it and a couple that have had

53
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,910
significant issues with it
that have lasted for years.

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,270
I know a guy who was hospitalized
for a full year on it. It's,

55
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,880
it's really bad and it, and it can
hide as well. That's the problem. Yeah.

56
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,810
And it Rick's joints.
Um,

57
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,010
and that thought a lot of countries
actually deny that they have lung disease.

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,690
Australia's a good example.

59
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,230
People are getting what seems to be Lyme
disease and no one knows if it is or

60
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:38,350
not. Give those samples to us. We'll
tell you what's in there. Well,

61
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:43,351
it seems to be very difficult with
certain doctors for them to tell if they

62
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:47,350
don't see that bull's eye infection.
Exactly.

63
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,380
So my daughter outdoor at
Natalie and middle daughter,

64
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,820
she didn't have a bullseye.
She had nothing to first
thing we hit the bullseye.

65
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,960
Oh, so it's inflammation
around the bite of the tick.
Right. And um, and there's, uh,

66
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,830
there's the actual bite and then
there's a circle on the outside of it.

67
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,980
And for whatever reason,
this occurs with Lyme disease,

68
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:07,960
but oftentimes goes away quickly.

69
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,050
So if you bring a person in
and they have the Lyme disease,

70
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,670
but they don't have that bullseye anymore,

71
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,010
which is what happened
to my friend Steve Son,

72
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,710
he tried to tell them that
it was Lyme disease. They,

73
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,870
the doctors were incredulous.
They didn't believe him.

74
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,940
It took until the kid had bell's
palsy at his face. Exactly.

75
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,790
That's what happened. If Emily
it, it's crazy. And so, um,

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,480
I was bitten by a tick last year,

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,710
right behind the knee and it didn't form
a bullseye. Maybe I didn't give it time,

78
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,730
but it definitely was very painful thing.
Um,

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,860
I could tell that there was something
going on. It was really itchy.

80
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,090
And I went to the pharmacy and I said,
can I, the antibiotic, it's, you know,

81
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,600
it's probably costs a few dollars for
the antibiotic. And they said, no,

82
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,770
we won't give it to you till we see a
bullseye and you need to bring the ticket.

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,340
While I didn't bring the tick with me.
So again, I'm the doctors and nurses.

84
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:59,980
Worst nightmare. I wouldn't leave
until they gave me the antibiotic.

85
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,010
And I'm glad because I don't want to
wait the wait until I give it to you.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,770
They did. I wasn't going to
leave until I got it. Uh,

87
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,590
but I don't want to wait a week
and I'm starting to lose my,

88
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,720
did you get signed up with them to say,
listen,

89
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:15,430
you dumb mother fuckers super
smart. I worked with jeans. Uh,

90
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,070
no, not that occasion. It's tempting. It's
tempting. And now you can always say, Hey,

91
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm a professor at Harvard. And then
they probably just really kick you out.

92
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,560
Yeah. What did he say? I mean, how long
did it take before they listened to you?

93
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,800
Uh, so I went through, I basically,

94
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:37,220
I started spouting biology so that they
knew their, I knew something about it. Oh,

95
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,900
it was about 15 minutes. Oh, that's
not bad. He knew what to say.

96
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,790
I can be there for days.
Bye Bro. Trust me. Right.

97
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,790
Let me draw you a picture
of the tick. Yeah. I mean,

98
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,090
I would just think they'd want to hand
that stuff out quick with so many people

99
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,850
getting it. It's so common. I mean,

100
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:59,150
we looked at a map recently on the podcast
of Lyme disease infections across the

101
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,820
east coast and the east
coast of the United States.

102
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,620
Obviously that's where you live is just
a hotbed. It's crazy. It's everywhere.

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,150
Well it is an, and I've got friends on
Cape Cod where it's really prevalent,

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,040
really bad, so bad that, so they keep
the antibiotic in their kitchen drawer,

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,880
cheeses.
And if you catch it quick enough,

106
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,310
does it stop it in its tracks?
Yeah.

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,850
So the real problem is when it gets into
your blood stream and you don't treat

108
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,820
it long enough or quick
enough. Exactly. And so my,

109
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,800
my daughter needed
what's called a pic line,

110
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,440
which has delivery the antibiotic
to straight into the heart. Oh.

111
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,470
Cause they left it too long.
God, I'd want to kill them.

112
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:41,210
And she didn't have a ring of bring
of inflammation. But you knew, uh,

113
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,580
I didn't,
I thought it was meningitis.

114
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,540
Bacteria in the brain or something like
leukemia was the other possibility.

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,750
Those dirty fucking bugs,
what can be done to,

116
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,740
to somehow or another eradicate
those things. Oh. So, um,

117
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,350
again, one of my friends
got a few friends here. Uh,

118
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,240
she was working at Mit and she's developed
a way using the CRISPR system to kill

119
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,900
these, as you say, demo fuckers. Um,

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,870
and so there is possibly going to be
the first test of releasing a modified

121
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,800
organism, the Lyme organism
to kill them off. Wow.

122
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,720
And you know, that's going to cause some
new super bugs going to kill everybody.

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,670
It's going to be like that. A Brad
Pitt movie, the Zombie One, World War z

124
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,850
might be, but on the other hand, we
might all be saved from Lyme disease.

125
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,090
I would like that though.
It'd be great. I just, I mean,

126
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,510
where did Lyme disease come from? There
was, uh, some conspiracy theory website.

127
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,580
There was thinking that Lyme
disease was some sort of a,

128
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,440
some sort of a biological weapon.
That's probably bullshit, I'm sure.

129
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,380
But it came out, it was in
Lyme, Connecticut, right?

130
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,630
Wasn't that one of the first cases?
Yeah.

131
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,840
So that's a close enough to
Harvard and she's stayed away,

132
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,180
which I thought he said Russians
who are behind it. Oh No.

133
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,950
I said conspiracy theory. I didn't say it
was Russian, but as a biological weapon,

134
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,810
it's a, it's just an awful thing.
And that, and now there's the,

135
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sure you're aware of the lone star
tick that gives people that I'm a Alpha

136
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:18,080
Gow d disease, the one that, uh,
makes you allergic to red meat,

137
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,650
which is, I mean, where,
where was that before?

138
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,890
It's crazy to see these
things morphing and morphing.

139
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,450
And there are a lot of bugs.
We don't know,

140
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,190
somebody just published a few days ago
that they took surveys of the microbiome

141
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:35,510
on the skin, mouth, gut across
the planet, different races,

142
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:37,790
different foods,
geographic geography,

143
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,600
and they have 100,000 different
organisms living on humanity.

144
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,610
And most of them are unknown.
That's crazy. Right? Right.

145
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,490
And all they have to do is just more,

146
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,180
a little bit one way or the other way
and all of a sudden people are dropping

147
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,560
like flies.
Yeah.

148
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,900
And what's interesting is on the skin
and in the gut of people in India is very

149
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:01,510
different than what we have and the
different smells you might, yeah,

150
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,440
they probably think we smelled bad.
Um,

151
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,330
but I know this because while they're
wrong. Yeah, right. Cause yeah,

152
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,500
I smelled like old spice.
But these wounds there actually,

153
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,900
if you want to kill the bacteria in a
wound, they're different in the wounds of,

154
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,430
of people in India than they are hearing.
Oh Wow. That's interesting. Yeah.
