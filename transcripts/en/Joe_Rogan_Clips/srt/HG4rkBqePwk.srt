1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,470
Living with monks? Yes. What is
it called? Living with the monks.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,980
Living with the monks. Um,
does your new book? Yes.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,440
Why did you start to do that
and how long did you do it for?

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,460
I did it for 15 days. I was enough.
That's more than enough, man.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,890
Yeah. We're going to go like this for
an hour. Your finger all fall off.

6
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:22,380
What are you doing with your finger?
Up and down? Just a repetition.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,270
What did you have to do? I uh, well I live
with, they were, they were eight months,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,160
four, which had been there for
50 years. 50 50 on a monastery,

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,060
800, 800, 500 acres, kind
of in the middle of nowhere.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,560
And um, I went for 15 days.
So I figured, you know, I,

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,030
I'd invested so much of my life on the
physical side and ran a hundred miles and

12
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:50,031
just always active and this and that and
have really invested very little on my

13
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,920
own inner work. And I just felt like, man,

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,270
I just felt overwhelmed a little
bit. And I said to my wife, you know,

15
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:01,380
who are the masters? And everything
pointed to monks. And I said,

16
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:04,320
I want to go live on a monastery. There's
something romantic about that, right?

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:07,260
It's almost like the guy who goes
off into the woods to write a book,

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,060
like being with a,
with a monk like,

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,350
and just being in a monastery with monks.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,750
There's something very
romantic about that, right.

21
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:20,751
Does that you've shed all your worldly
belongings and you no longer care about

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,280
the day to day nonsense that everybody's
fixated on. Just decide to just, Oh,

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,220
[inaudible]

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,020
yes. Oh, all day. You could do it.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,580
I don't want to do it, man.
You should want to do it.

26
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,540
I've lived the opposite of amongst life.
My life is filled with bullshit.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,320
I get it. Yeah. Where'd you go? So I went,

28
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,970
I went to a monastery just south
of Canada in the states. Ah, yeah.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,540
But no, what state is it? It was in
upstate New York. Oh, okay. Yeah,

30
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:58,630
like on the Vermont border.
And it was, um, you know,

31
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,350
no phone total kind of separation
from my family. I have four kids,

32
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:07,210
my wife and just got to, uh, get
to know myself a little bit. Wow.

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,150
Now, when you were up there, was
there any time where you're like,

34
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,420
what the fuck am I doing?
Like one minute into it,

35
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,230
I got, when I first got up there, the
main monk, like my goto monk, brother,

36
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,710
brother Christopher took me to my room.
They call the rooms that a cell,

37
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,240
which is about the size of this
table. And I had a bed. I walked in,

38
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:28,960
there was a bed,

39
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,770
there was a little desk with a night
lamp on it and nothing on the walls.

40
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,160
And he said,
tomorrow we're going to start prayer,

41
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,090
reflection and meditation at 7:15 AM.

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,050
And I looked at my watch and it
was 6:00 PM and I asked him, well,

43
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:47,980
what do we do between now and 7:15 AM?

44
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,370
And he looked at me dead in
the eye and he said, you think?

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,000
And I said to myself, I'm fucked. Ah,

46
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,660
because I'm like,

47
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,440
I don't really like spend a lot of time
in thought. So I went and I said, okay,

48
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm going to, I'm going to
meditate. You know, like I'm here,

49
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,000
let me start this journey with meditation.

50
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,910
I'd taken the little a course
in transcendental meditation.

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,910
I'm not a big meditation
guy other than running.

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,270
And so I set my timer for 20 minutes
and I sat down in my chair and I started

53
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:26,100
like focusing on my mantra. Like
immediately I'm bombarded with how it was.

54
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:29,050
My wife had the kids, the hawks,
it's like all this, you know,

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,710
bumping against the Atlanta
Hawks. I live in Atlanta, like,

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,370
you know about your kind of
hawk. Everything's coming
at me. And um, you know,

57
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:39,520
time is going by and I'm just getting
bombarded with thought and I'm like,

58
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,210
why isn't my timer buzz like it's been,
I've been here forever.

59
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:46,630
So I was going to look and reset my
thing. I'm like, that would be cheating.

60
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,020
Let me keep going and going.
And all the time's going by and,

61
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,790
and finally I'm like, fuck is
going on with my time or, you know,

62
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,730
so I opened my eyes and I
looked to reset my timer.

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,030
It's three minutes and 27 seconds.
No, and I said to my, I like studying,

64
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,170
really thought it was 20 minutes.
I thought it was like hours, man.

65
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:07,171
I mean like I'd never really sat in a
room like with nothing going on and just

66
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,590
closed my eyes alone and
thought and time to stop.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,150
And I calculated how much time I have
left, like 15 days times, 24 hours,

68
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:20,840
a 60 minutes. And I said to myself like,
man, I'm in trouble. This isn't like,

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,220
like this isn't what I'm
on Gilligan's island.

70
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,910
This is a real like I can't
get out of here. And I,

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,830
I had a really hard time with it.
What was the commitment?

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,370
The commitment was 15 days. So the only
you, it was a personal thing. Yeah,

73
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,710
he did it up to you. Like there
was no, nothing in writing.

74
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:44,590
And did you have a way to escape?
I mean I was thinking of escape plans,

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,680
but I'm on the monastery and this is a
little crazy that the way the monks keep

76
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:54,130
the lights on is they breed German
shepherds. That's how they make money.

77
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,990
They breed. German shepherds
are the largest I've seen
is they wrote a book. Yeah,

78
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,600
they wrote a book. I have the book. It's
a book about raising puppies. Correct.

79
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,990
The same guys. Same guys.
Oh, so they weren't Buddhist.

80
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,410
They were Russian Orthodox and
they raise German shepherds.

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,000
So they live on this property and there
are these 11 German shepherds and at the

82
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,020
end of the property,

83
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:17,920
the only way off the property where
two mobile homes unconnected to the

84
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,770
monastery at the end of this road
that leads up to the monastery.

85
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,930
And both of those homes had German
shepherds as well that were a little

86
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:30,610
territorial. So there really was no
way for me to escape. Like I couldn't.

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,040
I ran 120 miles up and down the driveway
while I was there because I couldn't

88
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,110
leave the property.

89
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,550
So you just timed herself or paced
yourself using an APP or something?

90
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,930
I said like 2000 steps equals a
mile. You counted your steps. Oh,

91
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:50,440
Jesus Christ, dude. Yeah.
I counted and I marked it.

92
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,260
What did they think about you
running back and forth like that?

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Thought it was a fucking psychopath.
I'm like,

94
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:00,140
you guys have been here for 50 years
then I'm just trying to get some extra

95
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,920
sales. What are the, the guys like
that had been there for 50 years?

96
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,600
Uh, quiet. No they were,

97
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,550
they were extremely listened to date.

98
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,170
They were doing what they wanted to do
with their life. So they were super happy.

99
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,420
Really? Yeah, super present.

100
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,180
I mean very present and I mean I live
in a world that to do list man and like,

101
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,450
you know, they were very
present, very happy and really,

102
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:31,220
really nice to me. And
everybody. Did you talk to them?

103
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,970
They speak English. What was the
conversation like? Like what, what,

104
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:38,090
what do you say to a guy who's
been in a monastery for 50 years?

105
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,890
Just staring at the walls while I wanted,

106
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,570
if I could have talked
to him about the pageant,

107
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,650
that would have been just a conversation
he brought. I know, super confusing. Uh,

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,880
when I first got up there and they would
ask me a little bit about my background.

109
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,520
I told them, you know, I was
in the private jet business.

110
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,360
They didn't understand private
jets really. And then I said,

111
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,640
I had a coconut water company.
They never heard of coconut water.

112
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,020
I told them I was involved
with the Atlanta Hawks and
one of the monk said, Oh,

113
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,560
I've been to a an expos game.
And I'm like,

114
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,950
that's a different sport and they
don't play, they don't exist anymore.

115
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,930
And this is very like time warped
at first. It was really interesting,

116
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,120
really interesting. Jesus. Now what led
these, these guys that are 50 years,

117
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,130
50 years on the Montessori, how old
were they? Uh, so some of the, the,

118
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,080
the age range from,

119
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:31,970
I think the youngest monk was
probably 35 up until late seventies.

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,550
So late seventies with the guys
that had been there for 50 years.

121
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,470
They checked in when they were 20. Yeah.
And the young twenties in the same spot,

122
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,140
they actually built
this monastery by hand.

123
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,460
They bought 500 acres for very,
you know,

124
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,710
I think it was like $50,000 or
something. I mean, something crazy.

125
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,440
And then they built the monastery by hand.

126
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,040
And so it's been a passion of love and
labor and they've been there since.

127
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,900
And so the vow of celibacy, the
whole deal and celibacy, poverty,

128
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,050
poverty and sober 20.
Yeah.

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,060
They take a vow for things of um,
celibacy.

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,540
Poverty's, they pledge all their
personal belongings to the monastery.

131
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,610
So really the only possession is a
driver's license, obedience and stability.

132
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,780
Meaning we're not leaving. This is
what we're going to do. So I mean,

133
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:27,440
talking about discipline, just off
the charts do forever. Forever.

134
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,090
And where do they get funding?
They're self sufficient. So they,

135
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,630
they breed German shepherds, they sell
them. That's kind of one income stream.

136
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,400
And then their master's world,
masters of dog training training.

137
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,490
So every two weeks they have 10 dogs
that come in and they, and I've,

138
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,630
I watched this,
I mean they literally,

139
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,870
dogs come in like spuds
Mackenzie and leave.

140
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:53,910
Like they just left etiquette
school. Like it's, it's, it's,

141
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,110
it was like anytime you're in the presence
of the people that are the best in

142
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,520
the world and what they do,
it's fucking fascinating.

143
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,730
And these guys were masters.

144
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,410
They are the masters of imagery that
there's a lot of people that are great but

145
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,020
in their space of dog
training and breeding.

146
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,550
What was so special about the way they
train dogs? Just the command like,

147
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,000
like they had an energy
that the dogs responded to.

148
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,450
I mean like I would walk in and the dogs
would go crazy. They'd sniff my nuts.

149
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,510
They just, they go nuts. Right.

150
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,940
These guys would walk in and like they
could just sense that they were in

151
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:34,860
control, they were in control and like
the eye contact that they, everything,

152
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,670
the way that they talk, their
tone, their hand mannerisms.

153
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,860
They just have mastered this and they
have a deep connection with dogs.

154
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,660
Dogs are weird in that way.

155
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:49,620
Like I have a one year old golden
retriever and he has different rules for

156
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:54,621
different people and he knows who he can
get away with what with like my wife's

157
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:59,820
mom has zero shot at controlling this
dog. Like it's like, he's like, ah,

158
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,920
no, no, no. I'm the boss. I
think I'm going to jump up on
you and kiss. Yeah, yeah, no,

159
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,170
no.

160
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm going to just run around and put a
pause on you and you sit in a chair and

161
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,890
you know, we're like, Marshall, come
on man. What the fuck? What is this?

162
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:13,620
You don't do this?
And it doesn't matter when she's here,

163
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,620
he just decides Mac new set
of rules with this lady.

164
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,670
She doesn't seem to know what the
fuck to do with me. But when, uh,

165
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,840
I had a trainer that I worked with him
for in the beginning when I first got him

166
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,670
and when Ryan, the trainer comes
over, he just like sits down,

167
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,690
he's super chill, he listens. He's like,
Oh, this guy knows what the fuck to do.

168
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah. He knows how to control me.
Right. So it's, it's very interesting.

169
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,290
He's even different with me
than he is with my friends.

170
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,170
Like my friends would come over, it's
like, let me try you out, motherfucker,

171
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,240
pause on you and see what's up.

172
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,800
And I wish you would be like across the
board with everybody. But he's just,

173
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,180
it's all love. So it's not bad. You
know, he's just a lovely dog. Yeah.

174
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,440
But just like pause on you and shit. You
know, and I'm not really a dog person.

175
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:02,490
I liked dogs, but we have one. No,
no, but we don't really connect.

176
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,610
You don't connect with the dog.

177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,590
I mean not like instant love when they
see me the way that they are with other

178
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:08,590
people,
I don't know.

179
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,480
But the monks were using that
were teaching me various lessons,

180
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:15,660
almost like karate kid
style through the dogs.

181
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,120
So like the first day I got there, every
day I was signed to different role with,

182
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,450
I would shadow one of the monks and
there were eight and they had different

183
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,730
responsibilities around the monastery.

184
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,550
The first day I was in the training
center with one of the monks,

185
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:33,780
there was training the dog and
my job was to be the distractor.

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,400
So rainbow,

187
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:39,890
this dog would walk around and I would
fucking go Adam and jump and run and like

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,770
try to, you know, whatever, get
them to break his goal of going.

189
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,120
They would kind of simulating a park
scene or a city scene and making this dog

190
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,650
not get distracted. So I would go nuts
with the pork chop and this and throw it,

191
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,590
whatever. The dog would just go
unwavering from point a to point B.

192
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,670
And the monk said to me at the end, he's
like, it's just like life man. He's like,

193
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,240
if you have

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,073
goal,

195
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,390
just like rainbows goal
is to get from a to B,

196
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,660
you can't be distracted and your goal.
And I was like, that makes sense.

197
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,870
Some karate kid stuff. I
was like, Mike Song. Yeah,

198
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:16,871
like wax on and but all these
different lessons started to emerge.

199
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,360
It was pretty interesting. Wow.
So that, that isn't just, it's,

200
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,860
it's interesting too that they're doing
it with German shepherds are really,

201
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:28,250
really smart dogs. I want
like, what's a dumb dog?

202
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,050
Uh, what's like a generally
thought of downward dog?

203
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,120
Let's think.

204
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,280
Trying to think like what would
generally be thought of as a dumb dog.

205
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,110
There's no like prejudices for dogs,
right?

206
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,760
Is there, this is like, like one breed
or you're like this dumb fucking breed.

207
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,130
I don't think of like when you say like
a dumb dog, this dumb individual dogs,

208
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,260
but I don't ever think of like, oh, that
there's some dogs that are like spastic,

209
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,960
right? Like Jack Russell
terriers are kind of spastic,

210
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,080
but that's because they were raised
to kill rats and they just like,

211
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,170
they have a high kill drive and
they're super hyper. But like,

212
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,460
I can't think of a dog
that's supposed to be stupid,

213
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,560
but German shepherds are generally
supposed to be smart English bulldogs,

214
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,980
but I don't know if that's really true.
I think they're just lazy. Man. My dog,

215
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,140
Brutus is half English
bulldog and half Sheebu.

216
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:31,140
He know he just has bad joints
and he's just lazy. He's
just, I don't, he's stupid.

217
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,070
He's kind of a Dick.
He's a dick to other dogs.

218
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:39,300
But I just think that's because he's in
pain a lot. These dogs were super smart.

219
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,800
They're so smart, man. Those dogs look at
you and they love, they're sizing you up,

220
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,770
checking you out, see what the fuck
you're up to, make sure you're cool.

221
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,730
But there's really this feeling
like they know they can kill you,

222
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,150
like they're looking at you like I could
kill you but I'm just checking you out.

223
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,870
I had that feeling that they could kill
me too. Yeah. It's a real feeling. Yeah.

224
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,540
Yeah, they can. And they
be like, I was scared.

225
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:05,380
They were sensing that he's trying
to like down downplay my fear. Yeah.

226
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,520
My friend who trains them
has a dog that's like,

227
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,640
he does police work and
it's like a serious fucking
dog and he'll attack like a

228
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,220
thing.
If you're holding like a stick,

229
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,670
like on command and he jumps
and one of the things he does,

230
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,480
he bites the stick and then to pause,
go right into your nuts.

231
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,680
And I don't think it's on purpose,
but damn, it's an effective strategy.

232
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,610
Like it's like bite and then nuts
stomp all in one maneuver. Right?

233
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,310
Yeah. But those dogs
are, you know, they're a,

234
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,830
they're a dog that's sort of bread and
designed for protection work and police

235
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:45,150
work and stuff. Yeah, they are. And
they train their dogs for as pets.

236
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
So they didn't do any kind of, you
know, police work or anything like that.

237
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,060
So that the 11 German shepherds that
were the property was super well behaved.

238
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,890
I mean,
like ridiculously well behaved.

239
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,950
So when they train them or they just
training them to make sure that they're

240
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:02,390
obedient, you know, they just listen,
wash the house, bark at strangers,

241
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:06,440
that kind of shit. Yeah. Hand signals,
obedient, you know, not jumping,

242
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,650
but really that, you know,
they know who's in control.

243
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,060
So did these guys do that before they
started running the monastery or was it

244
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:17,990
something that they decided to do while
they had the monastery? No. So they, uh,

245
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,883
they fell into it.

246
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,220
They didn't go up there that none of them
had any experience in dog training. Uh,

247
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,630
they, that wasn't the intent. They just
said, we got to keep the lights on here.

248
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,670
And they had a dog,

249
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,210
they had a dog as a pet and
fell in love with a dog.

250
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,670
And ultimately they, when the dog
passed away, they all got killed. Uh,

251
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,090
they wanted another dog and they went
to a breeder and they got two dogs.

252
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,550
And they actually just, they
realize that they, you know,

253
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,590
once they bred an amazing puppy,
I live their first litter,

254
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,450
that and train these dogs that there was
demand and they just scaled it like any

255
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:57,500
other business, you know, and they
learned along the way. Trial and error,

256
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,070
just like any entrepreneur. I mean
these guys were like, first of all,

257
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,160
they were monks and there they're
super spiritual. They're religious,

258
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:08,300
they were Russian Orthodox, they
weren't, they're not Buddhist. And, um,

259
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,100
but they're amazing entrepreneurs.

260
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,810
I mean like they ran this thing
super efficiently, but the,

261
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,340
but the point would only be to make enough
money to keep the lights on. Correct.

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,530
So as an entrepreneur,
it's almost like they're,

263
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,250
they're limited in their ambition.
I think excess,

264
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,110
you know, it's not like they're, if
they have excess money and revenue,

265
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,240
it's not going to material things,

266
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,280
but it's for the life and
the extension of them,

267
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,110
of the monitors monastery and put it
away for taxes or what have you. Yeah.

268
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,240
Or they have, you know, they're
in the hands of God. They have,

269
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,240
they don't have a lot of litters or
they don't have a lot of puppies or they

270
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:48,860
have no income. Right, right.
That's fascinating. Now these guys,

271
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,480
what do they do for recreation?
Uh, they pray, Jesus,

272
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,730
they think they read,

273
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,740
what do they read and they have
like an amazing collection of books,

274
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,280
fiction,
everything really super well red.

275
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,410
So they do have some entertainment in
terms of like fiction. Yeah. And you know,

276
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,170
periods of it. And that went up
there with no expectation. The only,

277
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,660
like I'd heard of monks,
I watched,

278
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,190
I've seen monks in movies and read
articles and blogs, but I never,

279
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,740
I didn't know much about it,
about the culture,

280
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,670
certainly about Russian Orthodox and the
different factions and this and that.

281
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,690
Um, so I went up there, eyes
wide open and um, but I,

282
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,550
I went up there really just to detach
and get away from feeling overloaded and

283
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:36,470
feeling distracted.
And Man,

284
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,650
I'm a father of four and I have a
business and my wife has an entrepreneur,

285
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,440
et cetera. And I just wanted
to see like, you know,

286
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,720
it's kind of been my journey.

287
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:48,440
I learned best by diving into the unknown
just like I did with Dave and it just

288
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,790
says I have done in
businesses and other things.

289
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,670
It's just like I learn best
by going into the unknown.

290
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:58,560
So I didn't do a lot of research around
them or how they made money or this or

291
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:02,130
that. I just kind of
showed up. Wow. That's a,

292
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,290
it's a crazy undertaking. But I guess
if you knew you only had 15 days,

293
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,250
at least you have like some
light at the end of the rain.

294
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:14,670
But when that 15th Day came and what
did you get in a car and drive away from

295
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,490
that place? Yeah. How fucking good
did it feel? Did you check your phone?

296
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,840
It felt really good on day.
What's going on on Twitter?

297
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,830
Like Day four and five I was
already kind of making excuses.

298
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,500
I was rationalizing in my head
that's seven days would be enough.

299
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,160
So like in my head I was going home
day seven. Oh, well, I mean I was like,

300
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:35,700
no one's going to know the difference
or care if I went 15 days or seven days.

301
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:39,870
Or is that like if you're at mile 50
and you're like that's enough. It is.

302
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,733
Same kind of thing.

303
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,490
Same kind of thing until you wake up the
next day and you're like, I dropped out.

304
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,570
Right. And you feel like,
you know, so, um, anyway,

305
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,060
I decided like, you know,
I'm going to stick this out.

306
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,620
And then when I left it was a, it was a
good feeling and the feeling was proud.

307
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,510
I felt proud of myself for sticking
through it. You know? Isn't that funny?

308
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:03,150
These guys had been there for 50
years. 50 years, man. And you're like,

309
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:07,560
I did two weeks, man. Yeah, it felt good.

310
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,800
I bet it's it. It also felt
good to go through a bed. Well,

311
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,170
it's the 50 years when
you're describing that,

312
00:19:13,171 --> 00:19:16,260
that seems so insane to me
that I can't even relate.

313
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,640
But when you're talking about your 15
days, I'm like, man, you poor bastard.

314
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,520
Like I feel bad for you.
The guy that 50 50 years,

315
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,150
he might as well be living in another
dimension. Yeah. As far as I'm concerned.

316
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:27,990
Yeah.

317
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,730
I mean when in there in his
twenties that is just so nothing,

318
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,710
no sex, no family, no, no neighborhood.

319
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:42,570
Nope. No fucking hobbies.
No drive to work. Nope.

320
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,320
Fuck. And you know their,
their impression of it is like,

321
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:47,910
we made this decision so it's not,

322
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,970
we didn't sacrifice it like we decided
this is the life we want to live,

323
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,900
but when he made this decision, it
was 19 what? 1960 [inaudible] shit.

324
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,150
Black and white TVS. Oh my
God. That's a crazy decision.

325
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,510
That's crazy to, to
decide back then like, I,

326
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,300
I see what's coming and I've had enough,
I've had enough these daily newspapers.

327
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,700
It's just too much
information. Right, exactly.

328
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
That's a crazy time to check out.

329
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,280
So they don't know what the
fuck's going on in the world.

330
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:21,900
Did you quiz them on shit, I didn't
really quiz them. I mean they,

331
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,460
every Sunday night they have one,

332
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,370
there's one TV and one back
room and they watch the news.

333
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,870
So they get a sense of just like,
you know, it's kind of where we are.

334
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:34,370
State of the war. Yeah. If
there's a nuclear meltdown. Yeah.

335
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,000
One hour. Uh, yeah. They watch
about an hour on Sunday night,

336
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:42,290
one night a week. And that's how
the tuner, who do they, who did,

337
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,630
he was going crazy. I was immediately
like, my head went to like,

338
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,780
I'm sure we're being attacked right now
and I'm stuck at the monastery. Right.

339
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,130
Yeah. I'm sure the airlines are flying
and I'm stuck here for another 30 days.

340
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,070
Right.
No,

341
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,050
my mind went to a place where I was
thinking just the worst of everything.

342
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,730
You know, what news do they trust? Uh,

343
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,260
I think they trust it all, but like
which channel do they go to? Oh,

344
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:11,530
they would just watch like,
you know, uh, the local ABC,

345
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,980
see the local whatever is local
in the upstate New York. Okay.

346
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
They weren't Netflix options.
Do they have internet?

347
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,950
Uh,

348
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,820
I had no access to the Internet and I
think they have access probably for their

349
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,810
job, but I didn't know access. So the
dog training Jesus Christ, it was,

350
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,310
it was wild. But why is that so
romantic to people? Because it is,

351
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,480
it's very romantic, right? There's
something about this idea of checking out.

352
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,310
Just, I had a buddy who did it mean
for all I know. He still does it.

353
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,340
I lost touch with them 25 plus years ago,

354
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,760
but he was a a taekwondo guy and he
started to meditate because he was always

355
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:56,530
very nervous about sparring and
very nervous about competition.

356
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,520
So excuse me, he was trying to figure
out what was going on. So he said,

357
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,530
let me just take some meditation classes.

358
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,770
It took some meditation classes and
really enjoyed it and got really,

359
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:06,604
really into it.

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And then one day decided to give up all
the worldly possessions and all of the

361
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:17,650
trappings of civilization
and move into the monastery.

362
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,190
And I remember we went up and
met him for lunch one day.

363
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,290
He'd also become a vegetarian.

364
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:27,330
So w you only ate vegetables and we
were all just hanging around and he,

365
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,170
he seemed oddly a piece and it was so
confusing to me because at the time I was

366
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:36,610
like probably 20 and I was just didn't
know what the fuck is going on in the

367
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:40,210
world. He was maybe 10 years
older than me and this guy,

368
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:45,070
he just decided I've had enough. It was
weird to me though. He made me nervous.

369
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,930
Like, you know, like he made me nervous
that like, he was on to something.

370
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,740
It may be nervous that
he was wiser than me,

371
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,910
that it highlighted how fucked up I am.
And you know,

372
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:01,160
especially at 20 years, it's
so life is so chaotic, right?

373
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,030
No idea what the future holds for you.

374
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,760
If it's going to be success or failure,

375
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,820
if you're going to slip it every
fucking banana peel you run across.

376
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,200
But he seemed to have it figured out,
sitting there and eating vegetables,

377
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:19,000
all common shit. Where's he now?
I've no idea. I lost touch with them.

378
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,430
I lost touch with them, you know,
probably like 30 years ago. But, uh,

379
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
when I was 20,
those guys freaked me out too.

380
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,370
They must have freaked you out just
when you did this book. I mean,

381
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,440
I freak them out. Really. I was an alien
and I came in there high energy, you know,

382
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,520
rod rod, like he's the only
guys ever done that. Uh,

383
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,320
probably probably at this particular
place I think for an extended period of

384
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,940
time like that. Yeah. Wow.

385
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,520
What w w why they let you do it?
Well, I had written a book, Pryor,

386
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,180
uh,

387
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,180
living with a seal and they knew I was
coming up there to write a book and uh,

388
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,890
I guess they liked the first book.
Well,

389
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:04,760
I'm sure it'll be good for the dog
business too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

390
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,130
So they read your book,
they read my book.

391
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,970
Were you allowed to read books while you
were there? I was allowed to. I brought,

392
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,370
I brought, uh, I'm not like a big reader,

393
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,930
so I figured two books would carry me for,
for 15 days.

394
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,530
But I read them know I read
both in like the first day,

395
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:24,920
like the first two days because so then
I was like a check whatever they have.

396
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,930
Oh look, Mary Poppins. Yeah, I read
the stupid shit. Yeah, I said I'm good.

397
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:31,520
Just thinking.
Wow.

398
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,600
So was there any point at
like day 13 when you're like,

399
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,730
I actually kind liked this?
Yes.

400
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,510
I think around day seven
once I realize like you know,

401
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,230
I got the excuses out of my head that
I'm staying, I'm not, I'm not leaving.

402
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,620
I mean this, this is what I'm
doing and I settled into it.

403
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,180
I got tremendously energized because
like at the monastery you don't make any

404
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:57,740
decisions. You eat when they tell you to
eat, you eat what they tell you to eat,

405
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,780
you go to service when the
church bell rings you go, you,

406
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,030
you w w one outfit. I showered
once. So all of these,

407
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,580
all the decisions were
taken away from you.

408
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,690
But when all the decisions are taken away
from you, it frees up so much energy.

409
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,920
So as we're getting like super
clear, and I was like, I liked this.

410
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,530
This is like no one could get to me.
I'm not getting bombarded.

411
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,670
No one can schedule appointments with me.
This isn't so bad.

412
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,850
Have you ever done the sensory
deprivation tank? [inaudible]

413
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,210
there's the thing about the sensory
deprivation. You know what it is, right?

414
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,750
The thing that's most interesting about
it is that in the absence of input,

415
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,340
your brain is freer and you can make
decisions better and think about things

416
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:43,310
better because there's no input coming in.
You don't think about it.

417
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:48,311
But as we're sitting here just touching
this table is input you and not looking

418
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:51,800
at each other across the lights.
All this is input.

419
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,790
And in that tank there's no input.
And in the absence of input,

420
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,870
if frees up more resources for your brain.
So in a sense,

421
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:03,830
what these monks you're saying or doing,
by having everything on a schedule,

422
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:07,310
you don't have to think about anything.
And there's nothing coming in.

423
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,390
There's no Twitter, Facebook,
all that jazz. You're,

424
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:15,050
you have more resources. Correct. And
you feel better. That's exactly right.

425
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,260
That's exactly right.
