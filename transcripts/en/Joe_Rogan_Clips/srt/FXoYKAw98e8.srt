1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,320
Is Steve Bay going to get another shot
at? It should. Huh? You know what I mean?

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:07,230
This is what people are thinking
and people thinking, you know,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:12,231
the guy fights wins more
UFC title defenses than
anybody in the history of the

4
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:18,840
sport. Three becomes a, you know, the
most accomplished heavyweight of all time.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,580
I mean,
you think about what he's done.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,310
Do you think about the fact that he
knocks off for BC over doomed to win the

7
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,950
title? He knocks out ouster
over and defend the title,

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,710
knocks out junior dos Santos stops,
uh,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,010
beats Francis when everybody's
terrified of Francis. I mean,

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,920
he became the most accomplished
heavyweight of all time. Right?

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,190
Then he gets knocked out in the first
round of crazy perfect punch by Daniel

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,210
Cormier and a perfect strategy
and you got to go. Well, he, uh,

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,190
for sure I'd like to see a rematch.
It's like,

14
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:50,220
when do you want to see them beat
somebody first and then have a rematch?

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,150
I actually want to see,
but for me, Dan Daniel, me,

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,880
I've always said is the most impressive
fighter to ever step in the octagon in

17
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,490
terms of his stature. I just
think he's incredible, right?

18
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:03,420
He said to me the best I want
to see him fight Jon Jones.

19
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,590
I know that John John's,
they say Islamic.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,400
Phil is where the big money's
on him versus Brock. Okay.

21
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,410
So even with Alexander Guts, when all this
tool, five donkeys Yoel mail, he's like,

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,380
well that's not happening.
Yeah, I'm retiring in March.

23
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,560
We ready to go January worsen.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,740
Just ask for a title shot now after
he just beat Glover. And so, you know,

25
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,410
he said something like, Hey, you know,

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,040
like I love the UFC is
going to be as Brock.

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,510
The fight is broad questions.
The narrative guys. Ken Brock,

28
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:37,980
pass tests. Look at me. Yeah. Yeah.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,020
You know, how long do you
need to go back? Goes out.

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,030
How long do you need before?
It's like dancers. Never.

31
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:50,031
Brian Gustafson opens up on crazy
situation taking him off UFC two 27th this

32
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:54,360
year's. Well, it, what's, what
happens, we'll talk about it. Oh,

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,160
he won't talk about it
then how is he opening up?

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,810
Cut will cause people were like,

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,230
oh you won't find Anthony Smith but you'll
fight DC or you'll find a heavyweight.

36
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:05,520
But now all of a sudden injured and they
fight Anthony Smith versus Shogun was a

37
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:09,290
fight that I was concerned about.
I thought shogun retire. Yeah.

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,980
However he won three in a row.

39
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,430
If you would have one that I wanted to
see him get a tough shot against DC cause

40
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,290
I went to DC to get paid.
Well show gun is,

41
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,940
he was ranked I think
eighth eight for this fight.

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,760
But even though he's not that old.
How old is Shogun?

43
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:29,130
134 how old corridors and fight
world fucking Brazilian tortoise.

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,510
The unibrow. How old is showing up? I
think it's like 36 right? He's my age.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Is he 36 year old older even though
he's 36 like look when Bernard Hopkins,

46
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,650
who's 36 is when he knocked out
Tito Trinidad is in his prime.

47
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,520
His prime when he beat
Kelly Pavlock he was,

48
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:51,810
I think he was close to 40 or all
it might have been 42 and yeah,

49
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,190
so that's not a Kelly Palette
killer. Yeah. Not for everybody.

50
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,890
It doesn't mean that they're
past their prime, but Shogun,

51
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:03,070
I've in so many wars and he got knocked
out by Dan Henderson, Stephane brother.

52
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,940
Everybody's different. In 19 came on
the Grand Prix. It's terrifying, man.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,450
Pride days too. It was different.
Different world, different world.

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,270
The drugs and don't like,
and now we got the grant snitch.

55
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,340
It's such a different
environment. Yeah, man.

56
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,490
You'd never know who was doing
what back then when they were at,

57
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,330
there was a mother fuckers five.
He's a town on the fucker.

58
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,410
Let's not just propel them to fight
gusts. No, no, no, no. Dude, let me them.

59
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:29,670
While he was ready, he was ready.
He wanted the fight looking.

60
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,980
Here's the argument for it.
The argument for it is he knocks out,

61
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:37,390
were shot on short notice. He knocks
out shogun and then he'll say, look,

62
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:41,740
I'll take this fight to,
that guy's rolling and he's
a veteran. He's got momentum.

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,740
You don't know, fight the fight. The
most intriguing fight to me would be,

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,770
I mean it's not Brock and I liked that.

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,120
I liked PROC DC because DC gets
paid by me. The only reason,

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,190
but the demo,

67
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,640
the most intriguing to me and a lot of
ways would be y'all out Ramiro at two oh

68
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:02,370
five and deal with that weight
cut with Daniel Cormier.
Well, cornea was like, Nah,

69
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,940
Nah, you can't lose at this fight.
And you miss wait, go. Yeah, sure.

70
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,560
And you miss wait, smart. But
then Yo L's like, listen DC,

71
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,010
you cheated when you made weight.

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,000
You know you were pushing down that
towel that one time. Okay, that one time.

73
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,810
That one time. That was real. We want to
talk about cheating and for ELL to DC.

74
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,830
What are you saying? A branch.
Dual gate. Oh, still get here.
