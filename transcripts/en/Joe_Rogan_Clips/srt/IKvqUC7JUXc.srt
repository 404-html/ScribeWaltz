1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,980
When Elan was on the podcast,

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:05,340
he was talking to me about his neuro link
thing that he's going to be coming out

3
00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:09,120
with. He said back then, and this
was what was that, three months ago?

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,630
Yeah.
Somewhere around three months ago.

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:15,930
He said that they were going to be coming
out with it within four to six months.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,470
So that's any day now.
So I don't know what the fuck this is,

7
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:21,170
but he said essentially it's going to,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,890
it's going to open up the bandwidth
between you and information.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,500
It's going to radically change the
way human beings information. Uh, it,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,970
the way human beings access
information and it's like a,

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,030
an internet thing wouldn't tell me.
Oh mark,

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
that's all he would tell the link nor
a link. Yeah. Cause it's on, you know,

13
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,840
we were on air when he was saying it.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,010
I oddly trust him to be a phenomenal,
uh,

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,030
a net positive for the universe. Oh
hundred percent. You know, it was like a,

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,580
like Zuckerberg and like other times
like a net doesn't net negative for us.

17
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,460
Like they are the reasons.

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,120
They are a lot of the reason why society
has gone the way it has like cause you

19
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,150
can confirm whatever the fuck.
But Ilan, I'm like, yeah man,

20
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:07,080
why not fucking build a car that
you don't need any gasoline for?

21
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:11,960
Why not fucking send shit to this space?
I think he's a net positive for us.

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,120
I'm 100% convinced he's a net positive.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,020
I think he's a legitimate genius and
I don't think just on a broad of them,

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,110
I think Mark Zuckerberg is a smart guy,
was very ambitious.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,400
I think there's a big difference.

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,590
It wasn't Zuckerberg quote that I read
recently that what's good for the world

27
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:32,070
is not necessarily good for Facebook.
I'm like, that's it. Shut it down.

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,480
They said that burn it to the ground.
That's whole out.

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,530
Pull out, pull out. He's I,
what the fuck did you just say?

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,180
How much money do you have? Jesus, first
of all, don't you have like $18 billion?

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,740
How much more do you need bitch?

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,120
You sitting over here talking about what's
good for Facebook is not necessarily

33
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,830
good for the world.
Got All the good,

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,810
you got all the good for 18 fucking
hundred lifetimes. Jesus Christ.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,580
He said that, that's exactly
that. My favorite Zuckerberg joke,

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,860
uh, we, I was at, we were at update
and this was when Zuckerberg is, uh,

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,023
uh,

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,030
being grilled by Congress and when he's
sipping water like this and Chris rock

39
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,210
comes by and he goes, uh, you know,
I didn't like about that trial.

40
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,530
There's nothing worse than watching
someone or being grilled by Congress when

41
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,580
there's no stakes.

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,350
Nothing happens to mark Zuckerberg if
even if the shit goes worse for him,

43
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:31,450
you know, like the nothing happens
to that guy. Right. That's my face.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,313
Like I'm just like,

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,300
you never think about it that way
where nothing happens to him. If,

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
if even if Facebook blows up,
well,

47
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:43,500
here's what could happen if
Facebook intentionally colluded,

48
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,860
if there was some sort of proof that
they received some financial compensation

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,610
to lean one way or the other.
Is that,

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,970
is that was it's percolating
right now? No, but it could be,

51
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,520
this is what they were searching for when
searching for is what we're trying to

52
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:01,120
find out.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
How is it that these Russian bots are
able to disseminate propaganda so readily

54
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,430
and so easily and so efficiently?
What are you doing? Stop that.

55
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,210
How has all this stuff propagated?
Like where's this coming from?

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,730
And the people that were asking were
techno ignorant and that was a part of the

57
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,564
problem.

58
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,010
So it was like a Google makes the iPhone,
right?

59
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,730
He's going to fucking ask him to
Google it. So how come my niece,

60
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:34,020
who's got bad words on her iPhone and
that someone has to tell them Google

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
doesn't make the iPhone
and the whole place,

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,400
Roy is like back when you
can get Congress to laugh.

63
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,710
Like everybody's laughing at
what a fucking idiot you are.

64
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,780
These are the people that
are asking the questions.
