1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,390
Clinical trials. Yeah, just in
clinical. That's right. That's right.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,440
Now wasn't there a Lyme disease vaccine?

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:07,410
But the problem was it was actually
causing people to get Lyme disease.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,590
So that's a talk about
controversial topics.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,480
So there was a Lyme disease
vaccine that was developed, uh,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,110
actually from a colleague of mine
at Yale University than it was,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,400
and they licensed it,

8
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,960
I think it was to Glaxo Smith
Kline and they developed it as a,

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,940
they called it lime rex. It was
a, the Lyme disease vaccine.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,980
And actually most of the studies suggest
that actually worked pretty well. Uh,

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,020
the problem was there were a number of
people who felt that the vaccine made

12
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,630
them worse, or they said they had chronic
Lyme disease, that it wasn't effective.

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:43,530
So it was really a market perception
problem more than anything else.

14
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,960
And ultimately, uh, it hurt the
bottom line of the company and they,

15
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:48,490
they withdrew it from the market.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,230
Friend of Mine's Dad got the
vaccine and then got Lyme disease.

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,190
They think he got Lyme disease
from the vaccine. Probably not.

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,790
Probably is a weird word. When someone
with Lyme disease that's being nice. No,

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,320
he didn't get Lyme disease.
Impossible. Impossible.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,510
Cause Lyme disease is
caused by the Lyme bacteria,

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,270
the spiral [inaudible]
called Barellia Burgdorferi.

22
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,090
And the vaccine is not a live vaccine.

23
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,540
It's a recombinant protein based vaccine.
So it's not.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,070
So there's nothing in that vaccine that
could've caused this adverse reaction

25
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,620
that they directly attribute
to that vaccine? Probably not.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,880
That's what you're saying. Well I
don't know the patient. I don't,

27
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,880
I haven't examined the intimacy.
I hate taste swear.

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,730
I mean that's the narrative
that household, well again,

29
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:35,910
you know what's reinforced by a lot of
negative information out there on the

30
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,450
Internet. It's also reinforced by the
fact they pulled the vaccine. Yup.

31
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,090
Well they pulled the vaccine
not because it wasn't working,

32
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:45,750
but because of market perception
and and all that sort of,

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,770
and that was a time before the number of
cases of Lyme disease have really taken

34
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,800
off. So strange to me because they
didn't pull the measles, mumps,

35
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,290
rubella vaccine because of perception.

36
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,560
Why would they pull the Lyme disease
vaccine? Because of perception.

37
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:02,220
I think the reason was
is because, um, the,

38
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:06,930
the cost benefit equation works a
little differently. Um, with measles.

39
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:10,530
Measles is a killer disease.
Lyme disease was not a killer disease.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,800
And people now in some
cases it seems to be, uh,

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,900
connected to a host of other ailments
to correct like Lyme disease.

42
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,360
It just exacerbates a
bunch of different maybe,

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,770
possibly even existing health
issues. Well, you have to
be careful, you know, the,

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,420
the, and this gets into another
controversial rabbit hole.

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,540
I'm not sure we want to get into
or not today, but, um, you know,

46
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,120
the Infectious Disease Society
of America for instance,

47
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:43,230
has come out with a strong
statement saying that there's
really no such thing as

48
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,690
chronic Lyme disease. And, um,

49
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,320
the scientific evidence does not support
something called chronic Lyme disease.

50
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,530
Yet there are lots of people suffering
with chronic debilitating illness who

51
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:59,430
claimed that it's caused by Lyme
disease. So this is something that, um,

52
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,940
is out there right now. Why is
there a debate like what is, what,

53
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,400
why are they saying that there is no
such thing as chronic Lyme disease?

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,750
What's their evidence?

55
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,090
The evidence is that there's no evidence
that they can detect spiral Keats in

56
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,940
the body in many cases, uh, uh,

57
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,630
people who have had Lyme disease don't
have persistent evidence of having a

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,470
antibodies any longer to,
to the [inaudible]. So, um,

59
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,090
it's a whole different area,
right?

60
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,780
But they do have this chronic inflammation
and pain in their joints. They have,

61
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,270
somebody starts breaking down,
they have something,

62
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:38,680
but it doesn't seem to the Infectious
Disease Society of America, uh,

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,740
which is one of the leading infectious
disease bodies and our country.

64
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,210
And I'm not an expert on Lyme disease,

65
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,680
so I'm not too comfortable going there
with you are saying that there's no

66
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:49,000
evidence that,
uh,

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,930
that that's actually associated with
active infection with Lyme disease.

68
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,620
And what are they, how are they
describing it and what, how are they,

69
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,280
so in other words, we'll, so
what's causing all the decent
unknown unknown. I know,

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,610
but isn't it bizarre that these
same people got Lyme disease first?

71
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,940
And then how about these host
of issues afterwards? Well, the,

72
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,320
I guess part of the problem is in some
cases they had Lyme disease first.

73
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,100
And in some cases they really didn't
have Lyme disease. Unfortunately,

74
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,990
there are a number of
unscrupulous healthcare
providers and even physicians out

75
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:23,500
there that are making the misdiagnosis.

76
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,910
Either they're making a misdiagnosis
of Lyme disease, or in some cases,

77
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,500
they're actually taking everyone who
comes through the door and diagnosing them

78
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,950
with Lyme disease. I'm sure you're
aware of the lone star tick,

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,820
the allergy to red meat. Yeah.
Right. That's really fascinating.
