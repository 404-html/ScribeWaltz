1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,740
The joe rogan experience
like that's been solved.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,240
You know, I, I'm into the geopolitical
and domestic policy shit, right?

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,220
That's where I, I was drawn more about
what's really going on, you know,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,250
behind the news, all that sort
of stuff. This is bullshit.

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:20,520
And I was lucky to train a lot of law
enforcement and then military high level

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:24,570
military and get connected to Intel
guys who go, pat, we need to talk.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,280
Like now you're completely off. Let me
explain things to you. Right. It was like,

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,410
as far as like, what will you
completely off about? Well,

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,600
I can tell you what I was right about when
I called up my buddy and I go, hey, uh,

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,540
four years ago, whatever it was,
four and a half years ago, I go,

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,100
we're funding Isis, aren't
we? He goes, well, yeah. Yeah.
Those the go between guy.

12
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:48,360
What do you think?
I'll news row Isis friggin Al Shabaab.

13
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,310
W what are you fucking think
fun dices to take out Syria?

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,870
It was obvious,
right?

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,900
The mujahideen in Afghanistan was
the frigging take out the Russians,

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,490
but the way I looked at it was
when that was going on funding,

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,330
the mujahideen was to
bankrupt Russia. Right? Right.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,770
We wanted them to go bankrupt
and it worked. Reagan was,

19
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,730
was a genius in that park. The diabolical
part, of course, is rushing in America,

20
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:16,570
both fighting over the resources of
Afghanistan, but Isis was just theirs.

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,121
That's some weird shit.

22
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:23,070
When you have a 50,000 man army just
appear out of nowhere with professional

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,080
cameramen and editors and producers and
directors making the high level films

24
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,070
that they were putting out
where it's every three seconds,

25
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:35,790
they're cutting different
angles professionally put
together films of people

26
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:39,820
being burned. I go, this is this.
This is too weird. This is too weird.

27
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:41,400
You know when people stop talking about,

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,780
do you remember when they blame
Bengazi on some bullshit video,

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,000
some video that someone made?
Right.

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,630
What's it like the tears of Muslims or
something like that or I forget that.

31
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:52,710
Nobody even knew it existed.

32
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,310
Nobody knew it existed and everybody knew
it was bullshit and they were pushing

33
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,340
that as a narrative. Like this is
what was the motivation behind.

34
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,420
And everybody was like, what have you
had Perato on your show? No. Who's this?

35
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,720
Uh, Toronto's last name. Former
seal. What's his name? Toronto Peel.

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,830
Rol Name. T a. His last name's Perato,
but I think he's a former seal.

37
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,730
There were several seals obviously
that ran to try and help, uh,

38
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,520
the ambassador and some of the other guys,
Toronto lived through it,

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,170
but you know, he, when he talks about it,

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,610
they're moving massive amounts of
weapons through Libya, into Syria,

41
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,440
into other places in the Middle East,
right there.

42
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,150
It's just a fact that it's happening.

43
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,700
And that whole thing going down I think
was a way for them to just cover it all

44
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:42,420
up or remove and erase any people that
knew about it. You know what I'm saying?

45
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,590
That's the way it spells out to me,
pretty obvious because it's documented,

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,040
it's all documented that weapons were
being moved. And if you look at, um,

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,780
arsenal weapons manufacturing in Bulgaria.

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,500
So de Leon had guts and shy by who I had
on my podcast, the conspiracy. Right.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,850
She was the Bulgarian reporter that got
fired for it. Now you had a podcast?

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,390
He has called the conspiracy farm. Oh,
okay. Yeah. Oh, I'm going to Google it.

51
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,090
We don't, we don't start the
conspiracies. We just add the water,

52
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,290
but I've got to click the name.
Yeah. My cohost Jeffrey Wilson.

53
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,970
He's a really bright guy. Cool. Cool name.
Yeah. So we have fun with tee shirts.

54
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:19,331
Can I wear it?

55
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,340
Conspiracy theory that was going to bring
you on and why he couldn't ship me one.

56
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:26,410
So I will, I will. Okay. Yes. So it's
a bar. It's a barn with a CT Fletcher.

57
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,390
It's a barn with a satellite and the
satellite dish down next to the bar. Oh,

58
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:35,590
that's hilarious. That's it. Are you doing
it out of Iowa? Oh yeah. Perfect. Yeah,

59
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,450
it's pretty, yeah, that's right. But,
um, arsenal weapons manufacturing,

60
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:43,670
she exposed,
the Isis fighters took here.

61
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:48,010
I took her to their weapons caches and
there was massive amounts of artillery

62
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:51,460
rounds, depleted uranium
stuff, a small arms stuff,

63
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,850
and it was all arsenal weapons,
Bulgarian weapons. Right?

64
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,800
And she got fired for exposing it. Now
at the same time, silk way airlines,

65
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,060
who is a Azerbaijani airline,
they're manifests,

66
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,070
got exposed by Bulgaria and anonymous
with manifest of all the white phosphorous

67
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:12,310
weapons, the depleted uranium, our
artillery rounds, all these shipments,

68
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:17,260
massive shipments going into Turkey,
going into Libya, going into the Ukraine,

69
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,600
right? We're a bunch of
shit was going down there.

70
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:24,160
And every one of those places who showed
up, the broker, the deals, John Mccain,

71
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,410
Whoa, John Mccain, right?
And look, we can't prove it,

72
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,640
but there's people telling
me that potentially there's
an offshore company that

73
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,450
owns a big percentage of arsenal
weapons manufacturing in bull. Right?

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,710
So that's the kind of stuff I'm going in.
I'm into who's who's causing it?

75
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:45,550
Why are they causing it? The truth.
I'm just a truth seeker. Right, right.

76
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,800
Would you seem like that kind of guy?
For sure.

77
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,450
Do don't you think that that stuff is
exposed at a level that's never been

78
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,510
possible before because of
the Internet? Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,170
And that these people are probably
used to operating in a certain way that

80
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:03,540
they've been doing for decades and now
they're having to adjust. Yeah. Well, and,

81
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,690
and people like you just doing
these podcasts and talking about it,

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,980
which opens the minds of other people
and has them thinking about it. We,

83
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:14,830
you know, w w who are the people
screaming the most of the, I wasn't, uh,

84
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,310
I wasn't even a Trump supporter.
Right. I'm a rand Paul Guy.

85
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,830
You got to fucking Rand Paul Shirt
on right there. Ron Paul Guy.

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,360
You've got to teach him, take down defense
off of a lawn. A lawn mower. Right.

87
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,750
So you got blindsided in his
defense, right? Yeah. But yeah,

88
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,860
I was that about this neighborhood tack.
Those neighbors alluded tech. Right.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,930
Good Times.
You know,

90
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:39,310
but it's a risky thing to do live right
next to a guy and attack them like

91
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:40,720
you're a fucking burning the bridge.

92
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,080
I don't know what kind of sentence
that guy got though. I don't,

93
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,720
I haven't kept up on that,
but that was given sentence.

94
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,900
Yet during the presidential run,
I was given speeches for Rand Paul,

95
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,240
a couple of them to introduce him.
So I give a speech,

96
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,650
then bring him out and I got to know him
a little bit better in Iowa. Yeah. Yeah.

97
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,580
Amazing Dude. We had great conversations.
Big Fan of his dad. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh,

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,200
but the people that are yelling the most
now about Trump and all the other stuff,

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,240
you wonder what they're guilty
of, right. The deep state is just,

100
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,710
it is a way of doing business right there.
Smash and grab.

101
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,800
There's pay to play,
smash and grab his,

102
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:22,490
me as somebody who is very powerful in
government, going after an industry,

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
crushing, it ruined that stock.
And then my buddies by the company,

104
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,440
right when the stock collapses and then
bringing it back up like the Gi bill for

105
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,990
a University of Memphis,
we go after it.

106
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,560
No longer will there be any
GI bill money put toward that.

107
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:40,280
The stock goes from 100 down to $3
Obama's buddy goes in and buys it.

108
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,040
Then they go, wow, we're going to
allow GI money to go back into it. Now.

109
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,740
Stock goes back up. Right. That's the
kind of shit that's going on. It's,

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,570
it's some bad stuff and we just do
our best to follow it. Educate people.

111
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,100
And we have a lot of people to say you're,
you're not,

112
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,590
you're wearing a tin foil hat. Well,
you just talking about Jamie, about, uh,

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,640
something that you'd seen
about politicians being
exempt from insider trading

114
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,233
rules.

115
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,740
Someone on Twitter. I couldn't, I'll find
the name later, but, uh, if this guy,

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
he told me about this guy, his name's
Peter Schweizer. He's a Stanford

117
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,390
per secret empire. So that's the
book. That's the book you want to,

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,190
he wrote Clinton cash also.

119
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,940
Yeah. There was another book
that he hit me up about. Yeah.

120
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,950
But this is the one they had.

121
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,700
Have you had him on your show? You have
no, that's a guy that I've been here.

122
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,450
I would love to have them on
how the American political
class a hides corruption

123
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:32,010
and enriches family and friends. Yeah.
Without a doubt. There's that Shit's real.

124
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,980
Yeah. Without a doubt. That
shit's going on. I mean, look,

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,500
we were just talking about this recently,

126
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:41,130
about how half of what it is to be
president and is to get yourself into a

127
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:42,540
position where after you're out,

128
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:46,550
you can make these crazy speeches for
these bankers. Like why is that? Like,

129
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,220
I mean it's, it's almost
like a man. I tell you,

130
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,060
there was a time when a good friend of
mine who was an agent for me at the time

131
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,940
got me involved because of all
the years in MMA and martial arts,

132
00:07:56,941 --> 00:08:00,240
I've met people from all over the world
who had eventually moved in the piece up

133
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,190
positions of power in government or
cities or this or that. And so they said,

134
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:09,510
we want you to help us get our foot
in the door to sell waste to energy

135
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,430
projects. So it was basically a
facility that bonds anything garbage.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,430
I mean, you can burn tires in
the thing at low oxygen levels.

137
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,750
So the emissions are very low, but
that generates electricity, right?

138
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,890
And in Europe it was everybody
from the city province,

139
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,090
uh, that country and the European Union.
Everybody wanted a piece of the projects.

140
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,110
Right? That's just the way
they do business in Europe
and South America and other

141
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:34,944
places like that.

142
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,580
They have to have a different model
for it here for the corruption. Right.

143
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:41,460
They just do things differently
here and that's just the way it is.

144
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,310
They've made adjustments and either way
they're going to find their way around

145
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:49,140
it. Yeah. The idea that there's no
corruption is ridiculous, right?

146
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,250
No one thinks that.

147
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,850
So it's how much corruption is there
and how how many people were out there

148
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,640
exposing it and their neck
out there to expose it.

149
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,010
That's a big part of the problem
because if you really know about it,

150
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,490
that means you're probably
entrenched in the system too.

151
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,600
And the cognitive dissonance of the,

152
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,780
the citizenry of knowing that Hillary
Clinton and a few other people sold,

153
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,770
you know, the document just came
out. It was 15 million kilograms,

154
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,660
15 mil million kilograms of
depleted uranium. Yellow cake,

155
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,600
right.
Sold to the Russians.

156
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,020
At what point in any part of
a discussion on any planet,

157
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,350
is it okay to sell your enemy 15
million kilograms of frigging uranium?

158
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
What was the justification behind it?
Dev,

159
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,210
they agreed that this is a fact
and this is, it's a fatty greed.

160
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,070
I mean there's this, is there any dispute
that this is a fact? No, there is no,

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,390
there's no they, but they sit
there and use the excuse. Well,

162
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,690
there was eight other people that
had to sign off on this. Right?

163
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,100
What does that mean? Right.
But suddenly that company,

164
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,080
suddenly that company invests $145
million in the, in the Clinton Foundation.

165
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,710
Yeah. That's a big problem. That
Clinton Foundation is fucking insane.

166
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:04,500
And all these people that were blind
supporters of Hillary that didn't look at

167
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,440
that like, how do you not, how do you not
find a giant problem with that? Right.

168
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,470
And that book by Schweitzer talks about
it, he goes in detail about that stuff.

169
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,840
Yeah. I'm sure. How's his sobriety?

170
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm surprised that that's what
that was just going to say.

171
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,190
He's not going after the Russians do it.
Clinton cash was bad enough.

172
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,110
This one's even worse.
I'm surprised he's not dead.

173
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,470
I wonder how many people are actually
reading it. You know, it, I just,

174
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:28,230
I feel like they think that there's always
going to be a certain amount of that

175
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,720
stuff out there and they just
tolerate it and they just,

176
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:33,720
as long as it's not really fucking
up their business cause it's not,

177
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,310
the politicians are still allowing it.

178
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,310
Law enforcement still allowing it
and no one's really going after them.

179
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,210
It makes you wonder like if Hillary had
actually gotten into the White House and

180
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:45,450
she faces the same scrutiny that Trump is
facing right now over the Russian pros,

181
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:48,710
we know none of this would be uncovered
had she won. Right, right, right.

182
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,820
Know that right.
Yeah.

183
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,030
All of this stuff would have been swept
under the rug most likely and all this

184
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:56,010
stuff with McCabe and uh,
uh,

185
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,040
struck and page and call me and all
these people of going out of their way to

186
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:06,330
try and derail Trump to get these FYSA
court frigging spawn surveillance,

187
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:11,331
frigging warrants to spy on a president
elect and then a sitting president.

188
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,370
Are you kidding me?
At what point is our people not,

189
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,780
not charged with treason
for that? Right. When

190
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,570
they were recent, they were doing this
spine before he ever won the presidency.

191
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,390
Don't you think that if he was doing
something wrong with the Russians,

192
00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:30,900
they would have frigging
made it mainstream news
and and bustled him for it?

193
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:31,651
Yeah,

194
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,880
there's for sure some dummies in his staff
that made some inappropriate meetings

195
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,730
and had some, I mean they definitely
had some intentions. Well,

196
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,490
but they had something on him.
The way I look at it as this,

197
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,560
I mean if you win the presidency, I'm
going to send whoever is underneath me.

198
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,430
If I'm the president,

199
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,910
we have to have meetings with diplomats
from other countries to make the

200
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,090
transition. That's, that's
part of the, that's part of
the deal, right? It really is.

201
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,230
That goes on.
That's just the way it is.

202
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,480
But that's not what they're talking about.

203
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,980
They're talking about
before the presidency.

204
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:04,030
They're talking about having meetings
with Russians long before, right,

205
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:07,300
where they had planned this whole
thing out. Look, they got enough.

206
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:09,220
They're all dirty. They got
nothing. They got nothing.

207
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,530
I mean like if they had something new,
it would be out there.

208
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,190
It's that projection and diversion
and everything else, because you know,

209
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:15,831
the Podesta is,

210
00:12:15,831 --> 00:12:19,570
we're doing lobbying for the biggest
friggin Russian bank in the world, right?

211
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
Right.
In Washington DC that it never comes up.
