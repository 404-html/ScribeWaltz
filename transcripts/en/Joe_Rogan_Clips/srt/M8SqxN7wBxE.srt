1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,680
Conversion therapies, the weirdest
shit of all time. There was a,

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:08,570
an article that I've read,
uh, about, uh, they were,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,830
they were manipulating pleasure.
It turned out it's, I started,

4
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,300
I started reading it from a,

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,850
a study on rats and they did this
thing with rats where they, um,

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,410
provided they've, they figured
out a way to give rats orgasms.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,470
They figured out a way to jazz up
the pleasure center of the brain

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,750
and they would do anything to do
it. They would, they would shock,

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,610
they would run up, pass an
area that shocked them. Like
they, they, they did do it,

10
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,980
do anything to get to this area where
they can have these orgasms and they

11
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:41,850
wouldn't have him up to 2000 times a day.
They would just not just all day long.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,570
And in reading male and female rats.
Yeah,

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,450
just rats just right there.
Just, just rats trying to come.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,140
And so when I was that
we're in hour three.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,690
Oh, it's amazing. She studies amazing.
Well this is what's amazing about it.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,350
Sorry folks.
Mr Mrs [inaudible] time to turn away.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,560
They did it with a, a gay man. While they
were doing this, this is in the 1970s.

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,560
There's a couple different
studies that they did,

19
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:18,561
but one of them they did with this gay
guy where they tried to stimulate certain

20
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,130
parts of his brain while they were showing
him heterosexual porn and they were

21
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,440
trying to convert him
into being heterosexual.

22
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,360
And apparently they had some meager amount
of success with this where he engaged

23
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:35,340
in sexual relationships with women and uh,
and apparently even enjoyed it.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,930
And they did something to the,

25
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:41,931
literally stimulate a part of his brain
that would excite arousal and tried to

26
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:47,060
connect that with, um,
with heterosexual porn and,

27
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,210
and made him orgasm,
uh,

28
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:56,211
made him masturbate to orgasm while
they were doing this and showing him

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,890
straight porn. And the idea was that
they were going to reprogram his mind.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,180
How'd that work out? It didn't, but
it did. It did in terms of short term.

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,530
But it didn't mean it must have been just
massively confused, easily sexuality.

32
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,950
It's not just about what makes
you have an orgasm. No, it's not.

33
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,380
It's also incredibly,
it's incredibly complex.

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,150
And one of the things that
happens is, uh, you, you get,

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,710
you can have gay experiences
when you're young,

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,830
if someone does something to you in
imprints upon you arousal at a young age

37
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,880
with,
with gay experiences,

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
sometimes even heterosexual men will get
aroused by certain gay images and gay

39
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,280
things because of their past.
Because of that.

40
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:43,281
Like Chris is talking about that we're
all on a spectrum and speculative.

41
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,780
Yes, I think so for sure. We all
certainly are. But it's also speculative.

42
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:53,781
How much of that spectrum is influenced
by your environment versus your jeans

43
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,930
and you know, and this is very
taboo for some people discuss,

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,140
even though it's really the human
sexuality is incredibly fascinating and

45
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,590
there's,

46
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,590
there's some major taboo
areas of exploration and when
you start looking at like

47
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,820
what makes a person gay or straight,
whether it's nature or nurture,

48
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,800
whether it's a combination of those
things where it's someone's just radically

49
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,550
gay from the room or whether someone's
radically straight from the womb. These,

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,260
these studies where they were trying to,

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,580
they were trying to turn someone with
science and they were trying to turn

52
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:31,000
someone straight. It's cray. It's, uh,
it's very, you couldn't do it today.

53
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,110
You'd never be able to do
it today in America. Yeah.

54
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:37,780
I believe it was [inaudible] 71 they did
it. Yeah. I'll send it to you. It's crazy.

55
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,460
It's crazy. Um, widely criticized,
but heavily studied. You know,

56
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,580
the woman, they did it to a woman
to, uh, they, they stuck these,

57
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,790
this woman had a problem
with pain killers and so, um,

58
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,940
they figured out a way to wire her brain.
Is this like electric shock therapy?

59
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,770
These fucking dental drills,
they put holes in their brain.

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,140
They fucking can do whatever they wanted.
Do this.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,530
Now's the time we break
out the Ilan Musk weed.
