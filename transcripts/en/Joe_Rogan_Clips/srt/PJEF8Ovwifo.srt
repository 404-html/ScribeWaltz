1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,070
A lot of experts out
there talking about stuff.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,100
That's why a fight like next weekend is
so fascinating because between Tony and

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,890
could be, nobody knows what
the fuck is going to happen.

5
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:17,470
It's one of those fights where
everybody's like, damn, I don't know.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,380
And you got all these people breaking
it down on one side and then you've got

7
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:24,670
people making compelling arguments on
the other side and you're like, okay,

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,370
this one's going to be weird.
I've been,

9
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:31,210
I've been bouncing back and forth
between my pick for that fight. But um,

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,270
I guess because I've been
bouncing back and forth,

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,460
this isn't necessarily where I'm
going to stay, but I feel like, okay,

12
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:41,740
I don't see how that can change.
But again, like you said,

13
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,580
there are people that are making these
arguments and if somebody convinces me of

14
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,150
something that kind of defeats
this argument, then it's like, man,

15
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:52,240
now you opened the door for this again.
And what I think is like when I first,

16
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:54,640
my first thought was,
could be with this guy.

17
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:57,630
He takes everybody down and he
controls you and beat you up. Right?

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,210
And you think he's going to do that?
And then, um, but Tony is this guy,

19
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:04,920
he just does not, he's like one of the
submission first kind of guys. You know,

20
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,880
that argument submission.

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,170
Our position told me he wasn't even
too worried about the position.

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,370
He'll create scrambles.
He's,

23
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,220
he's aware of where he is at all
times and what he's giving up.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,760
So I feel like he would
just continue to scramble.

25
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:18,280
He'd be able to get back
to his feet at least. Um,

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,050
and then I go back to Khabib and seeing
Tony Against Kevin Lee and Kevin Lee

27
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,330
kind of control them early in that fight.
You know,

28
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:28,630
he was able to pass his guard and do some,
some good controlling things.

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,190
Now if a guy like could be,

30
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,580
you can do that right then he's
not getting back up and could be,

31
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,270
he was going to be able to take him now
and he is the best wrestler in the game.

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,690
Like without a doubt. Yeah. Good
arguments. Good arguments. You know,

33
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,960
I think another argument is it Kevin,
when Kevin Lee fought Tony,

34
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,230
I think everybody knew Kevin
on the staph infection. I knew.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,560
I saw him walking to the cage. I look
at his chest. I was like, Holy Shit,

36
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,110
that guy's got staff.
I knew it was going to be weak.

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,760
I knew in compared to the Kevin Lee,

38
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:00,140
the destroyer that you see when he's
on point and in shape, I was like,

39
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,650
this guy is going to be compromised.
Yeah,

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,960
and he's also a big one 55
so it's a hard cut for him.

41
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,990
Whereas Tony makes it mean Tony can get
pretty heavy, but he's super disciplined.

42
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,880
He makes it easy. His endurance,
his endurance is off the charts,

43
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,560
off the charts impeccable.

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,860
He was posting the other day that he
went on a six six mile run at one o'clock

45
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:22,430
in the morning. It's like extra credit.
He wrote Hashtag extra credit. I mean,

46
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:23,510
he's an animal.

47
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,060
I mean Eddie Bravo trains with them
up there in big bear all the time.

48
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,190
He said he's never seen anything like it.

49
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,210
So to do is just everybody else like pace
and everybody up the hill coming back

50
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,520
down. They're still trying to make it up
the first time he's running past them.

51
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,690
The second time he's a fucking
animal. Like aw, he wants it bad.

52
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,440
But so he knew that Kevin going
into that fight was compromised.

53
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,760
So if he knew Kevin was compromised,
maybe he decided to just let them work.

54
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,970
Let them work that first round.
And Kevin's don't know joke.

55
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,290
Kevin's fucking dangerous. Very
skilled. Very skilled, very aggressive.

56
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,470
Very strong. Very dangerous.
You know. So Tony,

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,290
he got in bad positions in fight though.
Did you get mounted in the first round?

58
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,280
He is guy got passed. Pretty convinced.
Like pretty easily early in the fight.

59
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,420
Um, but that's crazy because if, if he,

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,000
if he did take that time off even
knowing that a guy like Kevin Lee was,

61
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,380
you know,
compromised.

62
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,200
That's still a high level guy to be,
I'm going to take this time off.

63
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,300
It'll be a little bit laxed. Might
just have been Kevin. Is that good?

64
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,060
I really wish that fight took
place with Kevin Healthy.

65
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,040
Really wish that fight
took place with Kit Kat.

66
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,890
I think Kevin is an interesting
guy because he's, he
talks a lot of shit. Yeah,

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,500
he's really aggressive. He fights well.
He looks the part, when you look at him,

68
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:43,060
he's fucking jacked. You know, that's
a bad break for a dude like that.

69
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,010
He had like a golf ball growing out of
his tit. Yeah. That was crazy. I mean,

70
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,770
it could happen again relatively soon
depending on how this fight with,

71
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,370
with Barboza goes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,340
That's an interesting fight for Barboza
to Barboza has got to recover from that.

73
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,500
Mauling the can you put on them?
That was horrendous. But you know,

74
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,310
I'm an opponent Tony. Yeah,
exactly. And I want to look back at,

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,880
um, the bibles to fight, but
when I, when I did look at it,

76
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,500
he defended, he defended some of those
takedowns early, you know what I mean?

77
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,570
It's against cubby now.
Yes. You can defend,

78
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,420
you're going to be the strongest
in the first round, but still, um,

79
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,010
there's not a lot of people defending
it could be his takedowns no. You know,

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,990
there's a great New York Times
article that was us just on, um,

81
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,330
like three or four days ago about
wrestlers from Dagestan. Yeah.

82
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,380
And about how wrestling is their way out
because so many of them trying to prove

83
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,550
themselves, they wind up joining
those Islamic terrorist groups and uh,

84
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:47,551
that these coaches try to take these
young aggressive kids and give them

85
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:52,300
something, something else and give
them another alternative, really,

86
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,250
really well written article.

87
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Interesting stuff about like how powerful
these guys are and how young they get

88
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,980
him into it. And when you see
Khabib, the thing about him,

89
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,950
it's like he's not doing different
things than everybody else.

90
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,873
You know what I mean?

91
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,500
Like some people are doing different
things like wonder is doing different

92
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,470
things. Like he stands totally
sideways, his hands are down,

93
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,240
he's thrown front leg sidekicks,

94
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,920
he's doing a lot of different things
and you're like, oh, okay, this is some,

95
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:23,110
a new thing to adjust to
Khabib's doing standard shit.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,440
But he's just doing it at not just a
notch but several notches past what

97
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:33,790
everybody else is doing. I think that's
the thing about these Dagestani guys. Um,

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,840
it's crazy because like this American
wrestling style folkstyle wrestling of

99
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:41,770
being on top and having that control,
that's a big deal. But like Nick Lens,

100
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,630
that's one of his strengths. Like when
nick gets on top of you, it's like a,

101
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,190
the Dorf, you know, like
he's not going anywhere,

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,280
but he can also escape that. A lot of
guys, same thing with Mike Brown, but um,

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,920
Nick Lance got written out at the w in,
in the fight in Brooklyn.

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,610
I forget which car that I'm
Holly Holmes and Jermaine demand.

105
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,410
You know that car he wanted by getting
right. No one's lost one, which fight,

106
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,380
I forget who, who he fought, I
forget he fought a Dagestani guy. Oh,

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,270
he just got written out against his
own style. That's what I'm saying.

108
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,690
These guys are better at what
they're with the American style is.

109
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,820
But like for something like that,

110
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,630
I want to see one of those guys against
a guy like Greg Gillespie, you know,

111
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:28,040
cause that style of wrestling of being on
top and grinding on you, that's a high,

112
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,910
like a high level wrestler like
that no fault at four time.

113
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:35,420
All American national champion kind of
guy with that kind of conditioning who's

114
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,720
not going to break. I want to
see that battle. That's like,

115
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,710
cause that'll be like a,

116
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,640
a national championship with two
guys that can punch and kick a bit.

117
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,360
Well look at garlic, Jordan Burroughs or
Jordan Burroughs getting into MMA. Yeah.

118
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,990
Like what happens when he fights when
those Dagestani guys. Yeah, exactly.

119
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,080
But see there's Dagestani guys
and then there's could beep.

120
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,340
He's another notch above them.
He's a notch above them.

121
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:01,820
Like there's a lot of those guys that are
real good. They're real tough, you know.

122
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,880
But he's another level.
He is a scary level.

123
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,900
I when you see him on top of guys like,
like especially the Michael Johnson,

124
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,860
that was helpless. That was
mauling man, horrifying.

125
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,850
And having a conversation with him,
pleading with him to give up.

126
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,810
You must quit title shot.
My title shot. They deserve,

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,050
just keeps it and he's got
his arm tied behind his back.

128
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,930
He's punched him in the face. It's
horrific. Yeah, it's horrific.

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,980
I mean he can do shit to you that like,
it's like white belt,

130
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,390
black belt beat up against the best guy.
That world. The best guys in the world.

131
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,270
Michael Johnson.
Michael Johnson clipped him now.

132
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,520
But here's the thing about that fight.
It's interesting to me.

133
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,370
Could beep came into that
fight with the same problem.

134
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:45,410
He went into the Tony Ferguson
fight that was canceled.

135
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,770
He cut too much weight in his liver,

136
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,360
apparently shutdown making
wait for that fight.

137
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,920
So then they went into the next fight.
Um, and he didn't make weight at all,

138
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,510
rushed to the hospital. Then he hires a
nutritionist. Looks fucking fantastic.

139
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:00,650
Had been against Barboza,

140
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,440
has zero problems making weight
now he's got it all under control.

141
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,430
But you got to wonder if he was
compromised in the Michael Johnson fight.

142
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:11,390
How much of a factor did that play? Is
the him getting stunned? Yeah, he got,

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,313
he got clipped.

144
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,520
You got clipped and you know as well as
anybody that when you're dehydrated or

145
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,490
you have been dehydrated, you just
don't take a punch as well. Yeah, yeah.

146
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,790
Dehydration, conditioning,
those things. You know,

147
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,480
those things help you recover when you,
when you're hydrated,

148
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,810
your conditioning is, is up to
par. Um, yeah. I don't know. He,

149
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,300
you seen him take some punches.
He always backs guys up.

150
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:35,960
He's always coming forward and he does
eat a lot of shots coming forward.

151
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,780
But you know,
if his conditioning is fine,

152
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:42,110
and that's the only time that I can
remember him getting hurt in a fight from

153
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,260
taking shots. Like the same thing about
both of Barbosa was throwing at him hard,

154
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,350
hard, you know, specially Bali.
Yeah, just stuff. Everything.

155
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,760
Cause he's like a Zombie.
He got wheel kicked a couple of times.

156
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,190
Nothing club in the back of the head
would wheel kicks. Nope. Sorry. Not Today.

157
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,980
Just constantly charging forward, man.
He's a fucking tank. Terrifying guy.

158
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,370
But this is the fight.
To me that's the most intriguing.

159
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,690
Other than him fighting Conor,

160
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,560
him fighting Conor for the name value
is like chaos, right? Like Holy Shit.

161
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,340
Like they might do that. If he
wins, they might do that. Do that.

162
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,650
Russia ood if they do that in Russia,
Connor better bring his own food.

163
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,580
I tell you that. Hey, better
bring some fucking corn,

164
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:25,080
beef and cabbage right from
the motherland. You don't
want to take any chances.

165
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,490
But when Khabib,
um,

166
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,320
when Khabib's fighting, Tony, the thing
about Tony is that Tony so creative,

167
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,120
like he's very unpredictable.

168
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,290
You don't know what he might step in and
throw an upward elbow. You know, he, he,

169
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,050
he'll do all kinds of weird shit.
He'll do Granby rolls on you.

170
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:46,410
He'll die for a leg. You know,
he might try to take Khabib down.

171
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,400
Who knows what he's going to do and
stand up. He's got legit knockout power,

172
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,750
legit and he can take a shot. Rolls
with punches real well, doesn't mind.

173
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,270
When he gets hit hard,
he just kind of rolls with Shit,

174
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:59,340
comes back like the Barboza fight.

175
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,150
The Barboza fight with him was a
very interesting fight. Yeah. That,

176
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,370
that fight was fun to watch.
Like I can't,

177
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,430
I can't remember all the details
right now, but I remember thinking,

178
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,080
I remember tweeting, man,
I'm watching this and these
guys are savages. I, I can't,

179
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,130
I can't believe I thought one of these
days I have that daddy can steal.

180
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,870
It was like, man, I fought them both.

181
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,810
But yeah, that fight was
fun to watch. And that's,

182
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,560
that's that common opponent thing
that you say and I don't know.

183
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,880
It's one of those things also though,
because you know the rule fighter ABC,

184
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,970
that thing is a play on like stout beats,
like stat Jeremy Stevens beats down.

185
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,340
I'd be Jeremy and Jeremy Stout beats me.
It's this crazy,

186
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,940
crazy thing where it just doesn't add up.
It doesn't add up MMA.

187
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,050
Math just doesn't work.

188
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,540
Okay.
