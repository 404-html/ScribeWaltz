1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Who was your grade? Because I had
Tyson to there, you know, he was,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,540
he became one of them.
And um,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,650
I remember it was funny because when
I would put it down, like I said,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:14,430
everyone lied about to experience, but
you know, they lied about everything.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,060
But I would put down, uh, you know,
the, the age and everything else,

6
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,620
all the stuff for what it was worth,

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,300
you had to have something
to try to believe in, right.

8
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:27,630
And then figure it out from there.
So Tyson, when I first had him,

9
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:32,190
he was 190 pounds, not a bum. Also 12
years old. Okay. That's what it was.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,110
But that's what he was. I
mean, that's what God made
it so crazy. So I go down in,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,800
I put the first fight. Nobody's seen
Tyson, nobody's ever seen tight.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,310
But at 12 years old,
zero five. Okay. Hello

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,990
Daddy. Now you go too far.
You like more than us.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,220
You learn a lot from us. I said, thanks.

15
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,240
That's a compliment. I said, I think
that Nelson, that's a compliment. I mean,

16
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:13,190
I'd take a dyke as it is, right,
right. I'm not lying. 12 years old,

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,430
190 pounds, please, please, please. Now.

18
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,170
So I'm going to learning, okay. He's
12 years old. It's going to be 13 soon,

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,370
but he's technically, he's 12
years older. Gay. Oh, come on.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,700
I said, all right, I'll
make you feel better.

21
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:32,160
I'll put down 70 [inaudible] now
you tell the truth. I think that 17,

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,900
but I knew what I had and know
like cost side, I knew what I had.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,040
So I fought a 17 year old.
I wasn't going to find no 12 year old.

24
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:48,510
That wasn't going to happen. Right. And
plus I get arrested for murder. So, oh,

25
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:53,310
what was he like at 12 years old?
Physically, mentally weak, but physically,

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,830
what do I mean? Mentally weak. Not Weak
for the average guy, but before fighter.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,113
Um,

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,630
okay.

29
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,630
He's still have remanence
he still had residual,

30
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,763
okay.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,210
Stuff from his upbringing. Listen,
you are, know the truth about the guy.

32
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,180
I mean he oldest,

33
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,410
but he used to hide in between abandoned
building walls in Brownsville is a

34
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:22,710
rough place. No doubt about
it. Didn't have a father,
whatever, the mother, whatever.

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,690
And, uh, he,

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,580
he used to hide between
walls to not get picked on.

37
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,320
And I believe when you do that,

38
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,650
you never get outside of that
wall to a certain extent.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,860
You're always hide in a wall for the rest
of your life as this is my belief that

40
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,270
teddy, what are you talking about?
It became heavyweight champ.

41
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:43,790
Some people think it's the greatest.
I'll bet

42
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,260
I don't have his record in front of me.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,710
And this is going to blow some people
crazy, but what are you going to do?

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,253
I don't have his record.

45
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,070
Let's just say we're going to make an
arbitrary number because your man's going

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,770
to pull it up.
But let's just say it's 50 and six.

47
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,790
I would say five 15 five but whatever.

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,880
I think his record is truly,
if you're going to be this,

49
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,880
and we're not truly in life with anything,
but if we're truly,

50
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:20,020
truly in an absolute world,
which we don't live in,

51
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,540
but I would say he's all in five high now.

52
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,210
Everybody says everyone who is
listening to you think he's just like,

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,280
let me get with Teddy's drinking. Like,
I don't see them drinking nothing,

54
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:36,310
but he probably had some
before he came in. To me,

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,290
a fight is not a fight into
this resistance to, there's
something to overcome,

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,930
something to overcome.
Otherwise it's just an athletic venture.

57
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,010
It's an exhibition.
I think life is that.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I think the, you don't know of a
lawyer is a lawyer into, into the some,

59
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,670
the overcoming the courtroom. Something
goes for, okay. I know he's a lawyer.

60
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,720
I know he went to, I get it. Nobody has
to tell me that, but he ain't a lawyer.

61
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,490
He Ain't dad until everything goes wrong.

62
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:13,390
The judge droves all this crap out and,
and he's,

63
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,660
he is aft,
so to speak and,

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,050
and he figured and he's still handles it.
Then he's a lawyer.

65
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,410
A doctor is not adopting to,
he opens up this kid,

66
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,530
a kid just like he's got it home and
arteries are bleeding all over the place

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,730
and it's not in a textbook.
It's not in a fricken textbook.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,090
And he got to do it.
He got to figure it out and he got,

69
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,630
then he's a doctor then he's
a surgeon at that level. You,

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,030
you're not, you are not in a fight. I,

71
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,010
I, look, I admit it. I
equate life to a fight. I do.

72
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,020
You're not in a fight.

73
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,450
And so there's pressure
resistance overcoming something.

74
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,920
Otherwise it's just an exhibition.
Tyson's talent was so great.

75
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,240
His physical ability,
his talent was so overwhelming.

76
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,760
Just like somebody
intellect to some bodies,

77
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,603
charisma,

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,920
whatever beauty until it
came to something else.

79
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,190
But his talent was so superior that
the other stuff never got tested.

80
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,980
He was blown guys out and
he had never got tested.

81
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,920
If there was anything in the warehouse,
so to speak,

82
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,570
is there anything inside you never knew?
And then five times,

83
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,990
whatever the real record is,
five times there was resistance.

84
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,130
Five times it became a real fight.
Five Times.

85
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,360
There was something to overcome
and he fell in all five times.

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,000
He was only in firefights in his
life and his own five, I'm sorry,

87
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,070
sal graves, because we know my
history with them. Right. Am I in my,

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,720
am I capable of didactic Newman?
Yeah. But I can honestly tell you

89
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,760
that I, I, I took, um,

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,850
I try to be better than
that, that, that I've,

91
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:14,600
I've called many fights where the people
in the call and I couldn't stand them.

92
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,030
I had no respect for them.
But if they,

93
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,350
if they did a good drop in a
corner of their Friday did job,

94
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,990
I talked to about them,

95
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,991
like they were Ray Arcel like they were
Angelo Dundee because that's what it was

96
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:31,220
supposed to be. That's all. And
it's selfish because I don't want,

97
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,210
I wanna have,

98
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,210
I wanna know and I want my kids to know
that I can be better than that. That,

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,890
that it's,
it's about,

100
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,590
it's about the code of the profession.
It's a, it's about you. It's about,

101
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:49,070
you believe in that.
Would you say is,

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,080
should be honest. It should be what you
believe. It shouldn't be tainted or, or,

103
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,270
or influenced by lesser things that,

104
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,970
that it does represent you.
It does represent your family.

105
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,090
It does represent where you came from.
It does stay.

106
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:10,590
Do you know your blurted out for those
five minutes or maybe two hours on ESPN,

107
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,440
but it stays,
someone can go back to it.

108
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,640
You could go back to it. How do you
feel about it? It does mean something.

109
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,890
It really does it.

110
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,680
And so I'm only saying it because I
would say it about somebody else in a way

111
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,980
that I calibrate things.

112
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,990
The way that I evaluate things that I
don't think that you know crap about

113
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:39,890
somebody until they're tested.
You don't know the friend,

114
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,730
you don't know if they're good wife. You
don't know if they're a good girlfriend,

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,280
you don't know crap you think you'd do,
but until they're really tested,

116
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,890
you don't really know. And Tyson, when he
got tested, when he had to overcome some,

117
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,020
when,
when he didn't run him over with like,

118
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,500
like one of those big monster trucks
running over Volkswagen because he was a

119
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:04,940
monster truck pull Volkswagens.
Yeah, he was. Yeah, he was. And was,

120
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,670
he wanted the greatest
punches all day? Yeah. Yes.

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,060
Could he punch from either side of the
plate like Mickey Mann or the greatest

122
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:14,840
switch hitter? Was He that in by?
Yes. Could he could punch evenly.

123
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,670
Great with either hand. For me
side. Was he all those things? Yes.

124
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,030
Was he as great an
intimidators Sonny Liston? Yes.

125
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,370
Was he a great finisher like Joe
Louis? To a certain extent, yes,

126
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,660
but he wasn't a great fighter

127
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,380
because great fighters won.
The fight came to them.

128
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,000
They found a way to do
what they had to do.

129
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,160
He found a way to disappear.
They found a way to show up.

130
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,140
Yeah,
show up.

131
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,550
He found a way to go and
not show up and look.

132
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,210
You could go

133
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,210
talk to psychiatrists and you could go
to for the reasons why the old hiding

134
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:04,970
between a war when he was a kid.
Yeah. That, that's part of it.

135
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,470
I'll tell you another part of it.
To be that,

136
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,060
not to be the power puncher, not
to be the aggressor, not to be.

137
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:18,740
Just those things. To be, to
tighten, to be the Viking,

138
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,290
to be the Samurai, to be the
warrior, to be those things.

139
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,970
It has to be inside you.
You have to believe in it all.

140
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,390
A lot of times people lie in life.
This is Fullerton plays, you can't lie.

141
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,070
Okay.

142
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,490
You know, sometimes we'd say that the
ring is a chamber of truth, you know,

143
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,430
it sounds good and all that,
but it does.

144
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,220
It is because just like in
other places in life too,

145
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,330
when the moment comes
for those kinds of serious things,

146
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,000
you have to feel like that.
You say that you're the conqueror,

147
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:00,720
you Alexander the Great, your all those
things. Right. Okay. Word sounds great.

148
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,130
Makes good soundbites.
Probably bring more people to the TV,

149
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,260
but when the moment comes and you didn't
intimidate a guy that didn't work. Okay.

150
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,200
We all try it to a certain
extent. Right? Probably. Yeah.

151
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,240
I'm sure you've looked at guys certain
ways when you were younger and you'd

152
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:22,200
purposely looked at them in
a way to invoke a certain

153
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,440
kind of action,
a certain kind of result from them.

154
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,470
Just just look at them in a real serious
way that you hope that we can do. Yeah.

155
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,210
And but because I know your background,

156
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,590
you will prepare to do what came
after that, but some people aren't.

157
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,690
Some people aren't.

158
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,220
And Tyson was in as great as he was.
I just said it.

159
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,890
He's great guys that hate
me for [inaudible] today,

160
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,390
your hero or whatever your favorite guy,
when he's great,

161
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,560
she's not great and in his
area and when that moment comes

162
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,600
you have to,
that's where the truth matters.

163
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,590
You have to believe that you really,

164
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:15,591
that guy and if your guy that he and he
was convicted so I think it's fair that

165
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,100
rape somebody. Okay now listen, I
wasn't in that room and I don't know,

166
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,830
a lot of people don't take
okay but he was convicted or,

167
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,910
but I know enough people in the business
that there was a lot of other bad

168
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,870
things that he did that it just not things
that that you would probably want to

169
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,640
hang around with somebody if you know,

170
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,840
if you're a halfway decent human being
that he did devil week things. Okay.

171
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:37,321
Week thing.

172
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,100
So when you do read things and you know
you did though and I don't know what,

173
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,140
but I'm just saying you do week things
and you know they will week things and

174
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:47,880
now you got to do a strong thing.

175
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,810
How do you become strong when you know
that you did those weak things and you

176
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,970
know that's really you and you got a guy,
a causeway from your name,

177
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:58,810
Nevada Holyfield that doesn't give
a shit about how hard you punch.

178
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,240
Does it give a crap about
what a finisher does?

179
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,610
It give a crap about how fast you put
your punches together. He wants to find,

180
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,940
you're going to have to make him a
believer by doing it and doing it in a

181
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:13,520
difficult place because he's gonna make
it difficult because he ain't gonna

182
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,373
cooperate.

183
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,780
When that happens,
you got to feel like that person.

184
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,870
And when you don't feel like that person,
you got a problem.

185
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,190
And as what happened wasn't
a matter when he bit his ear,

186
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,850
it was a matter that he was hungry. It
was a savage and who's was from the suit?

187
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:40,610
Stop the crap.
It was a way to get out

188
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,520
because he knew he wasn't that guy. And
when you're not that guy, guess what?

189
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:47,780
You have a great talent off.

190
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,330
Recognize when somebody is
there as your greatest talent.

191
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,090
He can recognize when somebody is,

192
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,820
and he recognized that Evander Holyfield
was and I was his way to get out.

193
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,463
Okay.

194
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,010
And he did. So that's why,
again, it's not sour grapes.

195
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:11,610
It's really not because I'm more selfish
than that. I really do care about

196
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,680
what my reputation is and whether or not,
uh,

197
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,390
I've been honest about things they say.
It doesn't mean I'm right per means.

198
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:25,830
I believe it. I do care about that. I do.

199
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,010
Yeah.

200
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,780
And so it's not,
that doesn't mean I'm right,

201
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,430
but it means I have a reason to
believe on right from the way of live,

202
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,820
from what I've seen,
what I've experienced in the business,

203
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,500
the human condition,

204
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,960
how strong it can be and
how we could can be. And,

205
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:54,400
um, he was his strongest guy,
if you ever going to see,

206
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,820
but he was his weaker person
as you ever going to find.

207
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,953
That's intense.

208
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,150
But I see what you're saying in terms
of you are judging it by the highest

209
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:11,800
standards possible. You're judging
it in comparison to other champions.

210
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,080
You're judging it. You, you, you, what
else you got to jump through with Joe.

211
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,810
Of course.
Well,

212
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,820
you look at guys who are known for
incredible heart and their ability to come

213
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:25,280
back like Diego corrals,
David Corral, sin,

214
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,230
some of those wars when you would
say, Whoa, we could steal. Yes.

215
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,870
That was one of the greatest fights
of all time. The forest of credible,

216
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,250
greatest fight of all Micky ward. Arturo.
Gary the first one, right? Not the second,

217
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:41,130
third, the first, the first HUD
believable. Unbelievable. I mean, no,

218
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,010
if you want to go back,
if you want to go back farther,

219
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,320
lot of people will know this,

220
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:47,710
but you should call him was involved
in a lot and unfortunately he paid the

221
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,860
price. Okay. Yes. But
Bobby should it in the 70s,

222
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,400
eighties he was involved in those
fights every other day. Yeah, no,

223
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,850
I'm just kidding. But he was invited
to many of those fights. Yeah.

224
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,810
And unfortunately you don't know about
Bobby Chicago and you talk to somebody

225
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,190
again, I'm going to like the baseball
thing. You talk about the average guy,

226
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,940
Bobby Chicago.
Who the hell's that?

227
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,760
Who the hell is an unforeseen, is the
guy that would know his name anymore.

228
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,220
But, uh, he was a pretty special guy
in that ring. He was pretty damn tough.

229
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,620
Tougher than most people.

230
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,850
There's guys that unfortunately
relied on that toughness. Right? Yeah.

231
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,870
Like when you, when it comes to
guys known for incredible Chins,

232
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,160
that can be a detriment. Yes. And
it can be if that's all you have.

233
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,510
Do you think that's what you have?

234
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,690
Cause she used to put it this way cause
she used to that because he wanted me to

235
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,170
be a great trainer. So she used to always
be with me, all the terms, you know,

236
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:48,480
saying things and costs would say day

237
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,980
two tough guys. Okay, Gotcha.

238
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,940
Now what's tough?

239
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,760
It's a prerequisite to being a fighter.
You better be tough. But what Lovell.

240
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,940
So all levels the greys and I got you.

241
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,570
But how special is being tough?

242
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,590
Because if you're a fighter you should
be tough. I got Ya. Homelessness.

243
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,900
So you got two tough guys,

244
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
but one of them is smart.
Taught,

245
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,753
developed.

246
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,403
That's him.

247
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,070
He's tough one now. That's
how he explained the tougher
because he's smart. Yeah.

248
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,150
Tough. Yeah. And smart.
He, he goes from here,

249
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,830
he's here because he's not just
dependent only on toughness.

250
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,820
So He's tougher than this
guy. Right. Cause he don't
have to depend on just that.

251
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,410
Right. You might not even have to
get to it. It's there as a reserve.

252
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,180
It's always there to call on like an
army. You call on, you need it. Right.

253
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,590
But he's not dependent just on that.
Isn't that the balanced though,

254
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,750
is knowing that you have it. Yeah.
Knowing that you have it and it's there.

255
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,090
There it is. See what you just said.
You have to know that you are it.

256
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,580
Tyson didn't know he was it.
We ever met that night.

257
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,070
He probably knocked me and say, does
it whatever. I don't. It's okay.

258
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,110
And so I get I,
it's okay.

259
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,410
Well there's certain people that you
can't question and Aranda Holyfield's one

260
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:23,870
of those people. That's why that fight
was so fascinating because it was,

261
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,960
Phil was, he is a 100% warrior.
Well, he had to write nickname.

262
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,280
Most of them don't.

263
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,550
Most of them don't have the right
fight nickname and whatever they do.

264
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,030
But the real, the real deal,
he was the real deal. Yeah.

265
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,680
And you know why small heavyweights, you
want to know why? I mean trace it back,

266
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:45,190
cause always told me this but I
learned it innately on my own too.

267
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,730
But trace it back to the parents,
trace it back to the background.

268
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,560
Tracy trace it back to all that stuff.
Trace it back.

269
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,280
He did. He didn't live up to
something. He didn't face something.

270
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:58,140
He didn't do whatever was there was about,

271
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,120
he had a mother that he talked
about a few times and I, I'm sorry,

272
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:07,290
event of, I'm not saying exact
but, but it's, it's there.

273
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,660
Yeah

274
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,280
that and a great model obviously,
but she,

275
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,540
they had, or the grew up in
Georgia tech goes Atlanta pub,

276
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,430
whatever suburb of Georgia and she,
you have definite age, you know,

277
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,920
different time down south and all that.
Had a little,

278
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:30,080
I guess a little shack in the back
with a thing called twitches switch.

279
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,670
It switches. I'm sorry, I'm twitching

280
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,570
switches.
And

281
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,780
she basically had different size
switches, you know, short ones, long ones,

282
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:48,210
medium ones depending on the occasion.

283
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:54,210
And when he didn't live up to what
he had to tell the truth, whatever,

284
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:58,860
be accountable. Okay.
Face what he had to face,

285
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,670
whatever.
Um,

286
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,700
she had a switch fam and you know what

287
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,970
it um,
informed him cause he faced things.

288
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,470
Tyson, Tyson on the other hand and
listen, did he ask for it and no,

289
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,380
no. He didn't ask for
that opinion. I get it.

290
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,150
But I know people have that upbringing
and they get to a point they can take and

291
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,650
make a left turn instead of a right turn.
Is your ability to make,

292
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,290
don't you think there was also the,

293
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,040
the overwhelming hype and celebrity
involved in Mike Tyson in his prime?

294
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,820
It was probably so difficult for him
to even understand himself. Yeah. But,

295
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:41,730
but what he did understand,
and I'm glad you said that.

296
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,500
Okay.

297
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,570
Right backwards.
What he did and what he did understand

298
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,550
was there was a way out of Anda learn.
There was no way out,

299
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,400
you know, oppose away. You
know what I mean? Right. Yeah.

300
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,040
Like somebody would come and pay.
Yeah.

301
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,440
And he did a lot of things before he
became champion and somebody was always

302
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:10,240
there with a check or cash or whatever.
And, and w would absolve them from,

303
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,540
it would, would not have to face
what he did. Right. And, and,

304
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,570
but there was a switch that Amanda hat
of his face and that's what made him what

305
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,590
made him, and that's what allowed Tyson
part of would move out. Tyson, you look,

306
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,390
you make your own choice
at a certain point life.

307
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,430
So there's not make too many excuses,
but it is part of it that,

308
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,790
that he was formed by what he was
allowed to do when he shouldn't have been

309
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:36,670
allowed to do those things.

310
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,070
And that was one of the issues that
you had with costs, right? Yeah.

311
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,310
That you felt like costs was ignoring
his own principles and teaching because

312
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,960
this guy was so special.
Yeah.

313
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,440
And cause he was getting older and because
recognize you didn't have much time

314
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,670
left in this guy had a legitimate shot
at being a world champion for cause heavy

315
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:57,370
thing in his, you know, everything in the
world of boxing success and everything.

316
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:57,881
He was great.

317
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,990
He was special because his whole life he
didn't get married for a reason because

318
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:04,660
he was married to box.
And as he said that it wouldn't been fair.

319
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,870
I mean this was a different guy that it
was boxing his whole everything life was

320
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:14,500
boxing and lessons were
connected to boxing,

321
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,170
everything and um,

322
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,130
principals boxing and uh,

323
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,310
so there's uh, you know, there's
a guy that his whole, you know,

324
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,810
you used that word legacy,

325
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,070
but really his whole existence was boxing.

326
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,760
And for him it was heavyweight champs.
He had Floyd Patterson,

327
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,400
youngest heavyweight champ ever.
That was cost.

328
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,330
That was because it was about
lightweights. Listen, he had lightweights.

329
00:21:43,331 --> 00:21:46,930
He had welterweights Jose Torres. Yeah,
Jose towards light heavyweight champion.

330
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,610
Exactly right.
He had other guys too.

331
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,390
But it was the heavyweight champion of
the world because it was around where we

332
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,090
talked about before when
box was the biggest sport,

333
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:58,480
bigger than baseball and it
was the heavyweight champ
of the world was Babe Ruth.

334
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,590
It was rocky Marciano and that,

335
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,680
and you're going to say that before you
leave this earth that you have a chance

336
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,410
to have another heavyweight
champ to might be the best,

337
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,400
could be one of the best ever and
could break Patterson's record,

338
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,000
which was part of the plan, part
of the plan. When costs was alive,

339
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,280
you're going to break Patterson's reg.
He broke it.

340
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,650
He became the youngest
heavyweight champion.

341
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,460
And so when you float that
out there w if you will, and,

342
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,970
and tempt the guy with that,

343
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,660
even a great guy like cause some things
are going to be pushed to the side and

344
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:41,980
he did. Yeah, compromised and he did.
Do you think if he didn't do that,

345
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,570
the Tyson would have
been a different person?

346
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,730
I'm going to use his words there
was told to me by a great promoter.

347
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,390
Mickey thought he passed away.

348
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,940
He was close to Jim Jacobs who was close
to cause and he was up there sometimes

349
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:58,241
we have to.

350
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:02,440
I left and all that and Mickey wanted me
to train all those fighters and he was

351
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:06,400
a great promoter. Mickey, he had great
sayings. He was a very witty guy,

352
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:09,340
but he was a sharp guy.
Boxing was his life too.

353
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,400
And he ran everything in
London with three partners.

354
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,660
One of them was Java to stay who owned
Wembley Stadium. So they were powerful.

355
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,040
They ran everything.

356
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,390
They were the cartel in
London back in those days.

357
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,740
He told me that performed cost died that
cause had said some nice things about

358
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:36,530
teddy atlas,
but he said and loads,

359
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,030
I know there's a danger that this can
be convenient. You know what I mean?

360
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:44,980
Self serving crap.
Sometimes you got to trust whatever.

361
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,850
I was told by Mickey that he said that

362
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,620
Teddy Atlas was right but was wrong,

363
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:59,621
was who's going to get in the way of the
possibility of making a great fighter.

364
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,213
Um,

365
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,630
if he did things his way as far as the
disciplining in the in or whatever.

366
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,820
Um, eve, in other words, whether he
left it like that, so I don't know.

367
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,090
So I know what I think it meant that
title wouldn't have been around if you did

368
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,940
it, if you're disciplined, that he
would have laughed. I don't know,

369
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,640
cause I don't know that he had those
options because he was a ward of the state

370
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,020
and uh,
you know,

371
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:32,021
it was coming out of obviously a
criminal situation who's coming out of a

372
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,890
juvenile detention center
called Trion up outside of old,

373
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,820
30 miles outside of Albany. Um, you
know, so I don't know that he had,

374
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:45,290
but basically that if teddy
did it his way, he was right,

375
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,620
but he was wrong because it would have
ruined the possibility of a great fighter

376
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:54,170
and I could let that happen.
So I don't think that it's,

377
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,750
I don't know if it's true,
actually. I don't know.

378
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,460
You know what I was about to say?

379
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,750
I don't think that's true
because of course it's me. Right?

380
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,310
I want to make myself feel good.

381
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,460
So I want to say you could add
the best of both worlds. So good.

382
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:11,960
We had maybe a better person or within
the realm of a better person. Right.

383
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,580
Boundaries. Right. There
were no boundaries.

384
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,490
Maybe they would have those boundaries
would have made a difference. Right.

385
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,960
And you still would have had the town.
It was so absent.

386
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,820
The talent wasn't going to dissipate
because I have to discipline, you know,

387
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:26,720
that you put on them as a human being.
That wasn't going to change.

388
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,150
But because, because we're saying
that it wasn't gonna happen.

389
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,680
Maybe you'll lose them.

390
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,680
Maybe it goes to someone else at a
certain point in his development.

391
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,030
Maybe that's what he meant.
I Dunno.
