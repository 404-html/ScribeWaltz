1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,830
You know, it's good too, is the rap. You
know, some guys going to fight, you know,

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,810
like rapping. Well, no, it's,

3
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,170
I used to beat guys like you
up on the way to a fight.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,530
Practice fall on asshole. You
know that shit. I like that.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,890
Just like in basketball, you know that
the, the uh, trash talk, trash and toxic.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,960
Yeah. Sometimes it works. Does the thing
about when someone gets inside your head,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,260
someone's really lucky that I was kind
of thinking that when you see listing and

8
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,540
I'll, right, yeah. How could,

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,040
like it looked like listen, was
like afraid of him. How could he be?

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,140
Well, you know, you go back, the reason
why, and this is, Ali did this on purpose.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,000
He acted like a crazy person because he's
like that Sonny Liston was a bully and

12
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,710
Sonny Liston was a big scary man.

13
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,370
And what he felt like sunny lists it
would be afraid of is a crazy person.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,780
Someone who was afraid of him.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,650
So in all the press conferences and all
the different things leading up to the

16
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,940
fight, he would scream at them.
He would show up at Sonny Liston,

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,440
his house and honked the
horn in the middle of the
night and get on his lawn and

18
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:04,410
scream and yell at him.
Like he did a lot of crazy shit to sunny,

19
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:08,200
listened to fuck with them psychologically
he wanted Sonny and he did it.

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,260
He did it psychologically.
They didn't want it.

21
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:14,100
Sonny Liston to think that he was
a crazy person and that you know,

22
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,650
that he would never
stop. Yeah. And that's,

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,260
I mean he essentially did it and there
was one point in time when they were, um,

24
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,610
see we just let me hear some of this.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,450
He,
he laid him down.

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,670
He let him know he wasn't scared of him
and they were doing his blood pressure

27
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,950
and his blood pressure was so high.
As heart rate was so high,

28
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:41,520
they weren't going to let them find
them like doing sunny. Oh No. Ali's,

29
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,910
he had a calm himself down cause he
got himself worked up into a lather.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,930
He was just so, so angry and so, you know,

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
so hyped up trying to
act like a crazy person.

32
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,530
Then when they were doing it's pre-fight
medicals, they were like, hey, you know,

33
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,290
like you can't fight your fucking,
there's something wrong with you.

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,560
And they had this, here it
is. They're calming him down.

35
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,960
He had to relax and calm down. I don't
know. Greatest, greatest of all time.

36
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,890
I beat him all.
He was just so,

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,310
so smart at like psychological warfare.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,660
There'd never been any anybody like
him psychologically that could just,

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,470
he would, he, first of
all, he was very funny.

40
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,220
He would say hilarious shit.
Like Howard Cosell said to him,

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,880
tramp it champion seem very trucky
let, and he goes, whatever on it is,

42
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:33,750
if it's good on that,

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,780
the timing was just perfect.
He was so, he would, you know,

44
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:43,650
say things that were funny.
He would say poetry.

45
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:47,190
He had that Guy Bundini Brown behind
him and they were always, you know,

46
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:50,400
there were always like laughing
and joking around together.

47
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,410
Like he had a tremendous support team
and on top of that he could fight his

48
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:59,920
fucking ass off. And he was a heavyweight
that moved around like a middleweight.

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,510
Unbelievable. I mean, he
was a 200 plus pound, 215,

50
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,620
220 pound man.

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,600
And he would shuffle and move and Bob and
weave and he would be out there almost

52
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,840
like a welter winning. He's
the greatest. He's a boy.

53
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,660
It's hard to say who's the
greatest heavyweight of all time,

54
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:21,160
but he's certainly in the conversation.
I mean, you would have to say,

55
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:24,310
how would he have done
against some of the bigger,

56
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:28,680
stronger guys of the past? Like
a Lennox Lewis who, uh, you know,

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,740
was in his prime in the
high 240 pound range.

58
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,560
She was a much bigger, much bigger
guy, but there was nobody left.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,150
See,
Ali also comes in two stages.

60
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,500
There's Ali before 1967 when they took
his license away. And this is Ali.

61
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,970
After 1970 when he came back and when
he came back, he was never as fast.

62
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,630
He was never as fleet of foot cause he
didn't work out at all for three years.

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,610
He didn't do shit now. And when
he came back, his return fight,

64
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,860
um, uh, he just didn't look right.

65
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,890
He didn't look like he
had the same movement.

66
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:10,780
His body didn't have the same
musculature. He just, uh, he fought. Um,

67
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,480
Jerry, no, it wasn't very
core. Jerry quarry, that's
what it was. And he beat him.

68
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,620
He beat him up,

69
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,830
but he just didn't look like then the
homily that fought like go to boxing

70
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,240
matches. Yeah. Yeah. I'll
still go to boxing matches.
