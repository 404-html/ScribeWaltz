1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,410
Awesome. Yeah. I love when
someone is like that. Yeah.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,800
You know, like your friend
that hasn't talked for 22
years. I love shit like that.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,430
You don't hear about that?
No.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
Or someone that'll stop being in Van
Halen to go fuck with swords or Tom Wally

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,970
and yeah, it goes, fucks with aliens.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,400
Do you to think they're really bringing
him to the Pentagon and shit like that?

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,300
I don't know. Cause he said
they'd like, I have no clue.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,560
And I had watched a little bit of
your podcast where he was like, I,

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,860
you sent me a text message,
you know?

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,150
But I feel like he's made himself
readily available to do that shit.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,990
You know? Like, I don't
know. It's a, it's,

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,270
I sit and scratch my head and go.
I don't know. I don't know either.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,680
I just fucking, he's such a
talented, talented dude too, man.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,950
He's like such a good song
writer. Yeah. He, well,

15
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:58,200
he certainly is certainly
a very talented guy.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,660
It's just so interesting that
that's his main point of focus.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,440
I would think that if aliens were real,
Trump would've told us.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,910
I really do believe that that guy is,
he's such a fucking loose cannon.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,380
He became the president.

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,250
Like maybe they hid it from him or his
fucking chaotic is shit is right now.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,910
I don't know. Something would
slip. You know, I, yeah,

22
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,570
I would think that if they told him,
if they brought him a dose,

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,780
there's two things I would
want to know who killed JFK.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,380
Those are two things I'd want to know if
I became the president and our aliens.

25
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:32,160
Real. What do you got motherfucker? What
do you got? I go to the top generals.

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:36,180
I bet it. Look, I'm going to defer to you
guys. I'm not a military expert. Okay.

27
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,770
And I don't want war, but, uh, I want you
guys to have support. I got full respect.

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,570
Tell me about the alien. What do
you got? What's his trunk borders,

29
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,920
establishment of space for? He did
that. That's right. The space for it.

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,070
But that's because there's,

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,240
that's actually a military
strategy because they're
concerned that as technology

32
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,074
improves,

33
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,520
Russians are going to be in space and
we're going to be in space or war,

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,160
fight off the aliens. Right. Like will
Smith Type Shit. Yeah. Look at him. Yeah.

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,410
Mike pence is behind them going,
Jesus is going to say almost.

36
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah. I don't know man. But if I became
president and I never will, but if I did,

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,470
those are the two things
that I'd want to know.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,760
Who Killed Jfk and where the fucking
aliens. Do you think they know?

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,670
Do you think they know anything
more than regular people?

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,830
Because you've got to feel like
they come in every four years.

41
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,880
Someone would open their mouth.
Somebody knows. Somebody knows.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,270
I don't know what MUSC
say. He's an alien. Yeah.

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,320
So he's not going to rat on his
friends. Right. If you drive that car,

44
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,011
I'll give you the cake.

45
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:41,190
Just take you for a tour or just take
it for a spin outta here. I will.

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,670
That fucking test will make you believe
in aliens. It doesn't even make sense.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
It does not make sense.

48
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,100
I feel like I'm driving a computer
when I'm in a Tesla things.

49
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,050
It's like every car other
than that seems stupid.
