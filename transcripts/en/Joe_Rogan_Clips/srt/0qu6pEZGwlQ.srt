1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,500
Now,
how do you guys start out?

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,350
Do you start out like is there a
like a open mic night or something?

3
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:06,540
If a guy wants to become a rapper,
how do you get going?

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,280
Like I'm from the underground rap
scene in that I like these cults rap.

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:12,900
I like battle rap,
that type stuff coming up.

6
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,290
So I was more out of the open mic scene.
Um,

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,150
I got to hang around the older guys
and the cool guys and the drug dealers

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,490
because I can rap about street stuff.
Right? Whereas you take like a, ah,

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,610
he was always interested,
love music and stuff.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,460
But tip was a trap rapper
from the start. You know, he,

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,680
he was entertaining for
the streets so he didn't,

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,240
he didn't need to go to fucking open mic.

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,020
He just needed to be opened up on the
mic and then allowed the greater public,

14
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,970
the hearing, I'm said, excuse me,

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,000
I talk about him and I'm in big boy
because there are two of my best friends.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,450
So I know I got poetic license to talk
about those guys where I don't really,

17
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:45,330
you know, tread lightly with
other rappers. You never
know. Feelings get hurt,

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,110
but so there's no need for him to do open
mics as much as just find someone who

19
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:52,020
believed in him. And
that was um, KP La Reid,

20
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:56,580
Dj toomp and gave him platform to create
the genre. Now known as trap music. Me,

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,580
I came up more of how to, to battle
rap scene and out of thing, you know,

22
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:02,730
go show your wares. Kind of like a
comic. You get up in front of everybody,

23
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,790
do your shit, see what works, go
home, readjust, come back next week.

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,130
So when you do like a battle rap thing,
we sign up.

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,770
How would that work those days?
You just threw you in the pit.

26
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,360
I mean it was the first time. Yeah.
You show up. Um, I got my name,

27
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,310
my name, my nickname Scott. Right.

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,640
My nickname was skunk or my
family called me Michael. Um,

29
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:25,350
my friends were the unruly scholars and
those guys were like just east coast

30
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:25,681
rap.

31
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,350
One was from Connecticut and one's from
South Carolina was family is from New

32
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,280
York.
They could wrap their ass off.

33
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,500
They were like Rakim and big
daddy came in and sang group.

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,250
They defeated a lot of
guys may better records.

35
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:38,340
And then one day there was this thing
called green lights where people will play

36
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:42,300
their music and then they'd be battled
each other. My homeys income and man,

37
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,970
you could just everybody who
you thought was the homies,

38
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,970
homies was just shitting on them.
And I'm like, what the fuck?

39
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:50,910
Like this is my homies and
my manager, Rod, GG Mcgee,

40
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,860
who I had just seen like
a couple of weeks ago,

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,820
he was the person that kind of pulled
me out of knocking around in a trap,

42
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,830
trying to be a petty drug
dealer into a studio.

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,000
And he was the first person
to say, Yo, this kid could
really wrap. Like, you know,

44
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:07,890
fuck that shit. I know he steals
cars and you know what I mean?

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,800
And he rides around, do a hood
rat shit with his ratchet friends,

46
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,810
but he can really wrap,
let's get them in.

47
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,720
So he was the guy that started
bringing me in. So it offended me.

48
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,920
They were talking about
my friend like that.

49
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:21,410
So I just start fucking off with their
heads paddle wrapping them and a man,

50
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:24,480
they double Dee called me, killed her
that night. He said his kids are killer.

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,130
Mike's a killer. And that's how
I got the name killer Mike. Ah,

52
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,360
what a great story.
So the battle rap scene,

53
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,270
you would just get tossed into a
pit and how much time would you get?

54
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,820
This is in the nineties this
isn't like formal battle rap now.

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,980
Like battle rap has
evolved like boxing now.

56
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,010
Like what I'm talking about is
essentially cockfighting. So,

57
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:47,430
but like when you would battle up
there would be no, no time limit.

58
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,480
You time you just went,

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,290
you just went until you won the crowd
or the other guy shut the fuck up and

60
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,610
walked away with his head down. What was
a long battle? Rap Man died that night.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,630
Those guys were still,

62
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:02,470
I literally took out four and five and
six and those guys were still trying to

63
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,890
come at me before d who was
fucking built like you when? When?

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,910
When we were children.

65
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,130
You know what it was like as I
was dede knock you the fuck out.

66
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,300
Just told everybody shut the fuck up
this kid one. So, and it was decided.

67
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,080
All right, these spoken, you know
what I'm saying? Dj Double d gave me,

68
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,630
my mom gave me my rabbinate.
It gets heated man.

69
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:23,260
I've watched a bunch of them online with
dudes getting each other's face man.

70
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,830
My um, my um, my, my Dj,

71
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,700
Dj tracks star keeps me up with the battle
scene and I couldn't do it like as an

72
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,170
older man, I'm just
saying to myself like, Yo,

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,560
I just the how to fought somebody like
straight the fuck up like by day day man,

74
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:42,190
it's, the disrespect is
amazing but amazing. It's a
martial art of sorts. You know,

75
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,450
it's a mental martial art.

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,480
The ability to stay self disciplined
enough not to wile out the ability to give

77
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,710
it and take it. You know what I'm
saying is, I mean it's an art.

78
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,100
If you've ever seen roast battle,
no roast battles with,

79
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,430
they're doing standup comics, but
the same principle. They go, well,

80
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,690
they prepare for it like sometimes like
weeks out and they tell them who they're

81
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,660
going to be battling against and they
write a bunch of jokes about each other

82
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,560
and just shit all over each other.
Ruthless joke writing.

83
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,100
It's on comedy central and Rickles worthy
shit, ruthless shit. This ruthless.

84
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,380
That's what comedy should be.
