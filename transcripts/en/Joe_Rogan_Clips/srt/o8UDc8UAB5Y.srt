1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,970
Ooh, spin Colby. You got Ben
at Ben Asker in there now.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,660
Now during tail has a shot to be
a champion. I'll tell you what,

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:10,260
even though Robbie Lawler lost that
fight, God damn, he looked good.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,250
He looked good physically while I grab
the way and he looked Jack Best I've ever

5
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,270
seen him.
He looked amazing.

6
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:18,590
Apparently he had a tremendous strength
and conditioning routines. Yeah,

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,920
he looked real good and he was
fighting fucking for Roche.

8
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,640
It's like the Robbie Lawler of old.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,360
He didn't look at all diminished and I
think maybe the time off was good for him

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,040
because he had to get a ACL surgery.

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,270
So it might have been dealing with
something before his last fight.

12
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,050
We don't know.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,250
Do you think maybe it was to where
Ben Adkins very so one dimensional.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,100
He didn't have to worry about
the striking at all. Um,

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,260
there's a little bit of that for sure.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,000
But the fucking fight started because
he launched Ben Astroneer to the ants.

17
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,390
Slammed him on his fucking head, which
was crazy. Then as tough as shit.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,090
Yes, Ben, one controversially.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,930
We don't know that there was still what
two minutes left in that fight dude,

20
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:04,380
I've been watching their dog
choke. Yeah. With that much time.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,380
It could've got pretty dice
for four fucking um, uh,

22
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,790
uh, can we get a dicey, we
can't just chalk go Benz.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,070
Uh, Ben, I think you put it on
his Twitter or an Instagram page.

24
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:21,870
We see Robbie Lawler's arm go limp to
Dick goes limp. Now here's the question.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,100
Did it go limp because he just let it
go cause he was trying to like let you

26
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:28,140
know, just let it go cause he's
trying to like that's a weird,

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,630
hang on cause the choke,
he was like he's squeezing really hard.

28
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,670
It's going to tire his arms out.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,320
Robbie said it was an under his chin now
but here's the thing and this is people

30
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,290
need to stop saying that you have to
be under the Chin could choke a guy

31
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,310
unconscious.
You can do both.

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,120
You can choke a guy on conscious across
his face before she can go across the

33
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:48,540
face. Right like this. And
if you have a real squeeze,

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,660
you have like a Marcello Garcia squeeze.
You could put a guy asleep.

35
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,590
Think I'll strong. Ben is to, Ben has
a real squeeze, phenomenal squeeze.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,190
He's trans and he's in this position.
Would that bulldog,

37
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,830
you can get a lot of leverage
in that position. I mean,

38
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:05,790
I don't know how he's gripping.
It's so much more torque Torque,

39
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,620
so I don't know if he went out and then
Ben let them go a little bit and then he

40
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,170
popped right back awake.
That's what he's saying.

41
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,160
You're your natural movement though.
If you go, if you're fighting a choke,

42
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:21,600
your your natural is to hold onto
it is not to go lip. That's true.

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,270
That's true. That that's why I'm
like, all right. Maybe he was out.

44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,660
We thought he was out. Yeah, he thought
he was out, but in all fairness,

45
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,840
I thought Ben was out earlier. Me
Too. We're not. They're going to stop.

46
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,870
I thought there were a stop and Robbie
slammed. I'm like, he's out. He's out.

47
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,780
He was fucking, I thought he was out,
but damn, he can take a fucking shot.

48
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,781
He can take a fucking shot because
Robbie hitting wants some hammers.

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,600
I was nervous for that fight. Ooh, it's
crazy. We've hooked him up so much,

50
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,580
so much love, so much, and when he came
to Daddy's do Goober, dad bod, I was like,

51
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,250
damn, his justice terrible,
but let's figure this out.

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,530
Let's see. Do you have a video of it?
Check both of his pages. I don't see

53
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,300
he posted it today. I think
it was a Twitter. Yeah,

54
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:09,301
I think it was Twitter and I think maybe
he might've either repost it or replied

55
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:13,790
to it or repost it with a comment. Oh,
he says this is what happened to it.

56
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,730
It's in the conscious to comment.
Okay,

57
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,560
well let's say it when he
said this is what happened.

58
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:22,000
Then go to whatever he was commenting on
and then you'll see the video whenever

59
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,780
he was commenting on
is the video the only,

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,130
basically they were saying
that in the video that he see.

61
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:31,120
Let's check it out here. Jack
Sparrow. There it goes. See carefully.

62
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:35,050
You will see that Ben Loosen his
chalk chalk choke a little bit,

63
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,160
and then herb dean touch. Click on that.
Click on that goes to a long thread. Yeah,

64
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,080
but if you go to the top of that thread,
you'll see the video.

65
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,670
There it is right there at the top right
there. Watch this. So check this out.

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,960
See that right there. Normal
move by Bob. But look,

67
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,180
but Robbie does give them the thumbs up.

68
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,000
That's the other thing that you're not
seeing that it's not a normal movement,

69
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,160
but it is a tight squeeze.

70
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,820
It does look like his arm went limp.

71
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,510
I think it went out for a second
and came to, well, herb said,

72
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,640
what herb is saying is he told Bam
to stop when the arm went limp,

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,511
when the arm went.

74
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:14,890
Lynn Ben said is that he's lightening
up and then he lightened up and then

75
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:18,400
Robbie came back to life. That's fair.
That is entirely possible, folks.

76
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,500
It's entirely possible.
I do not know,

77
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,850
but I do know that Robby
Lawler is a classy motherfucker
because he complained a

78
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,520
little, said what the fuck does.
All right man, good job. Good fight.

79
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,980
He's been in the game so long and he's
like, he can see him. He goes out,

80
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,370
he's got to, he's got a great
attitude. He really does.

81
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,760
He's got a great attitude and a, I don't
think it stock dropped in that fight.

82
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,910
I really don't know. No, I really don't.
And I would like to see the rematch.

83
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,110
I don't, well, I want to see it again.
I mean he says no, but Ben says no big.

84
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,050
Ben Says he didn't want to
fight him in the first place.

85
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,650
Why would you turn right fucking murderer?

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,720
But he was so amped up for that fight too.

87
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,930
So angry and like you could see in his
face he knew what this meant. Dude.

88
00:04:55,931 --> 00:05:00,820
How about Ben versus Uzman
mother fucking fight shit.

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,950
Oh Damn tail. Yeah. Ben, your performance.
Your Shit. You barely one. Your ugliest.

90
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,610
Fuck.
Your Chin is too big not to miss.

91
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,570
You have no respect for no one.
Oh did I say your a curly headed fuck.

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,140
See in London, muppet well till has a
tough fight in London though too. Yeah.

93
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,610
Mazda dials. No joke, man. Maza
dolls. A very technical guy.

94
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,580
He's got a wrestling to men,
he's getting everything. Yep.

95
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,680
Very good at everything
and very good wrestling.

96
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:29,830
And I think that's probably where he's
going to try to put Darren till after

97
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:30,880
that Woodley fight.
He said.
