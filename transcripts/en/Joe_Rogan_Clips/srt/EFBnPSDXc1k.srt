1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
Molly and in wrestling it's,
it's still that way.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,570
I was looking at Tj Dillashaw
Liggett, Tj Dillashaw. Oh yeah,

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,980
but that's hard to say.
Let's go.

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:11,520
Let's talk about that fight because
I watched that fight several times.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,360
I am of the team. That was
a quick stoppage. Early
startups for sure early here.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,650
Here's my, here's my other point
with that. When there 125 pounds,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,580
you can let it go on a little longer
than if they were heavyweights.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,580
I'd hear more on the side of let
it go long because to 125 days,

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,670
it could be a thousand pounds
each in that fight got stop quick.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,900
It's fucking fine.
Especially when talking about a legacy,

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,330
it's spending 69 bucks.
How about Tj?

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,540
Tj legacy fight.
That guy drained his body to get done.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,760
125 pounds. Hey, don't get
me wrong though, Henry. So
who knows a bad motherfucker.

14
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,690
He probably would've beat him anyway,

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,780
but for people that are
paying for the the event,

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,360
we want to see some highlight shit.

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,940
Definite knockout. We don't want to,
you know, I thought I thought the ref,

18
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,040
whoever he was,
he was just in the beginning.

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,650
You could tell he wanted to stop at her.
Like there's guys that they just,

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,050
they just want to get in there
and like saved their lives.

21
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:11,010
He's a really good man. I made a
mistake. Look, it's fucking hard to do.

22
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:15,510
It's a hard job. I am so glad I'm not a
referee because when they make a mistake,

23
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:17,790
they can't say, oh, I fucked
up. Let's do it again.

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,260
You remember they used to be able to,

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,860
do you remember when big John McCarthy
stopped the fight between Marilla

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,580
Bustamante and uh, Matt, uh,
Fuck Matlin. Matt Lindland.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,170
Matt Lindland tapped and said he didn't
tap and Big John McCarthy let the fight

28
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,100
continue. Matt and [inaudible]
got him in an arm bar.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,660
Oh Damn.
We missed an arm bar.

30
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,390
That was some serious Jujitsu right
though. We'll see it in the highlights.

31
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,530
Were were Jesus, fortunately just
warm talk. Let's get those nice.

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,560
Hey Belle towards got some
fucking high level fights now man.

33
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,750
They are like on the way up
there as close to the UFC,

34
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,630
you can get right. They have the biggest
prospect in the sport and Pico. Yeah,

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,000
by far. Yeah. Taking it back a little bit.

36
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,930
What about Conan Sylvia era versus soccer?
Fucking rob.

37
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:07,320
I remember that Shit.
He redid the fight.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,520
The whole fight got read old school.
They got stopped John too,

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,480
and then they decided, you know
what, let them fight again. Big John.

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,790
He got hater that Conan
hit Sakuraba soccer.

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,380
Our dropped and went down for a single
and they stopped the fight and he's like,

42
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:26,010
what the fuck are you doing? But it was
in Japan. They pulled them aside in Japan.

43
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:28,280
It's like wild west,
Bro. You know, like, no.
