1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,100
Y'all deviate.
But what I don't want to do,

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,980
I don't want to work out
brand new material in front
of three trials of people.

4
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:09,814
Fuck that

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:10,760
one night.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,650
Well I think what came to watch your show
at the store and this was like a year

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,870
ago and you had to jet right after the
set and go to Pasadena for another set of

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,770
me. My buddy that I brought with me,
we just look, we're going to hang here,

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,790
see who comes out and like Jeff Ross or
somebody comes out and he's doing his

10
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,410
bit and right in the fucking middle of it,

11
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,360
the back curtain opens and Chappelle
walks out and just kinda like taps were

12
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:34,970
also on the corner on the shoulder.
Like fuck off. I got this, you know,

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,010
and just jacks the mic.

14
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:39,400
I pretty much everybody else has set who
was supposed to perform that night and

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,220
stands there for like three hours. Man.
Just sitting there. I was like, dude,

16
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:46,580
this will probably never happen again
in your lifetime so I'm not fucking

17
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,414
leaving.

18
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,200
And we just sat through the whole time
and he sat there rocking Tequila bombs

19
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,630
and get drunk and just really talking.

20
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:57,620
There were times where it was the
funniest thing I've ever seen, literally.

21
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:00,190
And there were times where like it Kinda
got dark and you're like where's what

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,700
the fuck's happening?
Where's this going?

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,960
And he was working things out and then
later on those Netflix specials land.

24
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:10,010
And I realize I've already heard like
90% of these jokes and cause the guy was

25
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:13,190
just saying I'm going to go hijack
the main room, work my shit out.

26
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:16,490
Cause I got it like that.
I'm Dave Chappelle, you know,
but it was fucking amazing.

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,090
Yeah he does that a lot.
We'll,

28
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,090
he'll just drop into place
and just do a set and that's,

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,360
that's how he kind of works
as material out. You know,

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,050
he just kind of drops in and
keeps tweaking it and it, it's,

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,690
it's if he has a structure,
right?

32
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:35,520
Like if he has a few ideas that he's
talking about, he can just riff.

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,810
And especially if he's drinking,

34
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,080
just go on stage and then the trigger and
then he's always got dudes behind them

35
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:44,260
that are taken down notes, letting them
know like all you talked about this day,

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:49,230
and I'm sure they record it too and
they'll go over it and eventually boil it

37
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:53,790
down to like what that Netflix special
was the two Netflix specials that shows

38
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,050
you how prolific that duty is to put
out a sniffling special and then a year

39
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,380
later put out to Netflix Passion, right?
And then Netflix is like, we'll take it,

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,580
what do you got? And he like, Hey,

41
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,720
I wrote this one this month and I'd
like to put it down for all eternity.

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,613
He cool with that.

43
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,270
But most people like you write something
and it's a good solid year before you

44
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,850
even consider putting in a special,
you know,

45
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,470
some guys were doing like a special year,

46
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,140
but too much of it was like half cooked.

47
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,390
It was like if you just
waited six more months,

48
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,700
this thing would be like
an all time great special,

49
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,370
but instead you're banging
them out one a year.

50
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,280
You never get the essence of the thing.
Well

51
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,080
thing too.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,080
He part of his thing I think is is making
it look like it's so easy for lists

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,350
because the night at the comedy store to
just like it did feel like he was just

54
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,320
sort of making the shit up on the spot
and then you see the Netflix specials in.

55
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:45,880
It sort of feels the same way.
Like he's just being Dave and be like,

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,240
he would with a little subtle things
that I noticed like probably 10 times

57
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:54,230
throughout the night.
It really awkward moments.

58
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:56,990
He would call the waitress to get
him another drink, but he would,

59
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,160
he would only say bar whore and every time

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,980
you say it you get a little,
a little more awkward,

61
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:06,510
like a little less appropriate each and
every fucking town. We're probably like,

62
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,610
eventually everybody in the room was like,
that's not really cool.

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,810
At the end of the night. He's like, the
last thing he says like, I'm really sorry,

64
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,340
I called you bar Raj, don't
have any fucking jokes. And
he walked off the stage.

65
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:22,000
I was like, yeah, that's how Dave writes.

66
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,290
That's one of the ways he writes. But
he's, um, he's got it down, you know,

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,330
he's got it down to a science.

68
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,680
The other thing he does is
he just travels to towns,

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,860
just decides to travel to a town
and then go on stage, show up,

70
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,980
show up for three nights at the Fillmore
with, yeah. But I mean, he doesn't even,

71
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,450
he'll do that,
but that's booked.

72
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,900
He books that you have to craft a book
that shit nine months. Right. It's like,

73
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,940
what if he worked somewhere else?
He just shows up.

74
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,000
Like he'll work at a comedy club
and just show up. Gotcha. You know,

75
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,040
I was in Denver wants
and he just showed up.

76
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,550
I came in the green room after the
show. It was a, after the late show,

77
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,850
Friday night, I went backstage and
Dave's in the green room. I go,

78
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,400
what are you doing man? And,
uh, and he goes, Hey Joe,

79
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm just in town fucking round or you want
to go on stage? He's like, should I go?

80
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,490
Fuck yeah, I grab them.
Bring the people back in.

81
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,730
People already getting up and
leaving. I said, date, ladies
and gentlemen, get back.

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,680
Dave Chappelle's here anyway.
Of course he wants to go on stage.

83
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,120
What else is he there? Like that's why
that's what he does is he does his thing,

84
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,210
you know, but it's just weird to say
like, oh like this guy is so free.

85
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,940
He could just fly into a town where
he knows his friends are going to be,

86
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,130
he doesn't even have to call
you in advance, you know,

87
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:24,160
he just flew in and I see him like,
Oh yeah, get up there. Like he's,

88
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,200
he's as free as a bird.

89
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:29,380
He does whatever he wants and then
he does these Netflix specials,

90
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:33,220
they pay my ass load of money and then
he just does shows whenever he wants to.

91
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,290
But his creative process is like,
almost like engineered around being loose,

92
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,200
like doing whatever he wants,
go on where he wants to go.

93
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,080
Doing one every once and then writing,
you know, and then figuring out on stage.

94
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,410
Then riffing and then just fucking around.
It's fascinating. Fascinating to watch.

95
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,060
It's like jazz almost. Oh, it's very
much like, yeah. I mean he's, um,

96
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,750
he's also got B and Dave
Chappelle down to a science.

97
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,450
Like you were saying that you are
in the Sturgill Simpson business.

98
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,030
He's in the Dave Chappelle
business. Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,050
It does what Dave Chappelle wants
to do. That's the key, I think.

100
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,921
I think that's the key.

101
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:12,190
If we could all be in the business
of whoever the fuck you are,

102
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,820
whatever you do well is I like to write
songs and make Rutgers and pretty much

103
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,300
say no to everything.

104
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,660
Okay.
