1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
For him. For God sakes. Now everyone want
to see him. Verse Earl Spence, but Earl,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,100
his fight, Nike Garcia. Brendan,

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,210
if he was the king or the
president of MMA, how would he,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,250
what would he do about
the steroids situation?

5
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,200
And he said he would get rid of Usada.
Correct.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,850
And then have the commission seeing
her have the commission test,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,070
which basically means that all
you gotta do is just be, you know,

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:27,750
it's a stupid example. You're still
going to do shit, but none of the fight.

9
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:31,160
You're clean night of the fight. What
have you cleaned them out of the fight?

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,300
Well when did that pay a clean from
a piss test. Oh, okay. I think,

11
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:40,530
I think is that how they used to do it?
Well, how they did it when I fought.

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,370
What else are fought? Brock? He was
clean. You know he tested clean. Yeah.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,120
Cause it was a very simple urine test.
It was like quest labs type shit.

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,910
You got a job at ups and I
check with you from mushrooms.

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,980
So you the commission.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,940
But that's how Bellah toward does it. They
just don't really, let me ask you this.

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,850
Did anybody ever approached you and
said, hey man, I think we can, uh,

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,030
we can get you on some stuff. Oh yeah. Oh
yeah, for sure. How do they say it? Uh,

19
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,930
it was like locker room talk like a,
they're like, Yo, I got this guy, dude,

20
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:20,190
he's great. He does this, this, this.
I can afford it. That's how it starts.

21
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:23,580
The fighters. Yeah. Or a coach would, we'd
be like, hey man, you know, can do this.

22
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:27,210
This, I couldn't afford it though. How
much are we talking? Uh, I don't know.

23
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:31,170
Cause they were going through
like a doctor and I just remember,

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,820
Dr, I don't think he's
still in business. And, uh,

25
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,270
I remember that your insurance won't
coach. You got paid cash or MIRA ass.

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,520
And I met Tom. I was like, Oh
fuck, that's a car payment, man.

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:44,970
There's no way I couldn't do it. Oh,
what I've done it probably, yeah.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,460
Probably short window,
man.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,370
Bob Sapp is up to lately.
