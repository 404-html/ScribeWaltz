1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,630
Well,

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,630
what other like crazy trips do you
want to do that you haven't done yet?

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,200
Oh, there's a lot man. I mean,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,030
the one that I've had on my bucket list
and sounds are, so there's a couple.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,490
One is there's one really one place on
earth left where there's true cannibals

6
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,770
and it's pop when you're Guinea.
And um,

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,830
unlike the missionary that
went in with an agenda,

8
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,710
I would just love to actually see these,
these cannibalistic tribe.

9
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,960
So I'd love to do that.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,680
Nobody has successfully and less tapped
in very recently and I'm unaware of

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,730
successfully done source to see of the
Congo River from guerrilla warfare,

12
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,630
from crazy waterfalls disease.
That's an expedition I'd like to try.

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,110
And then when it comes to wildlife,
I mean, the list is infinite.

14
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:43,650
There's so many of these animals that
I'm desperate to try and find those sound

15
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,540
like very dangerous trips.
Like visiting cannibals. Yeah.

16
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,110
I mean like, I don't know how to
say this without sounding arrogant,

17
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:55,830
but that's what sounds exciting to
me. You know, is giving that shot,

18
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,870
that other taking that shot
that other people aren't taking.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,520
So have people visited these cannibals
and come out of there? Yep, Yep.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,420
There was a, there was a
nat geo photographer who
got some incredible photos.

21
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,780
They're called the car away tribe and um,
he went in there,

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,140
took them a while for them to kind
of assimilate and get comfortable.

23
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,330
And then he got these photos
that are just mind blowing.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,620
Now how often do they
practice cannibalism? It is a,

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,150
it's not a daily thing. It is a spiritual
thing where they actually eat the,

26
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,510
eat the other tribes deceased after a
war or an inter tribal conflict as a way

27
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,990
to like ward off bad spirits.
So it's not like a daily thing.

28
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,730
It's not like they're going
out hunting each other.

29
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:40,731
It's more like when these things occur
they have to eat a certain killer,

30
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,560
a certain body to keep
evil spirits at bay.

31
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,070
Do they get that version of mad
cow's disease that cannibals get?

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,280
Was it Jakub Scottsville I know what
you're talking about. I'm not sure.

33
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,950
I think it's probably infrequent
enough that they're not getting it.

34
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,620
Cause like in the, in the South
Pacific they got that all the time.

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:59,220
But they were eating each
other like all the time. Yeah.

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,210
Well I think you'd get it from nerves,
right. And nerve tissue or brain brain.

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,250
Yeah. That's, that's where
they're getting it from.

38
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,770
It's essentially mad cow
disease. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,720
Cause this guy hanging out with them
there, it starts off as sounding,

40
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:13,870
he's eating something I don't think cause
eating people with is going to eat a

41
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:17,150
fucking person. That's that person
that's like a finger or something.

42
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,060
I don't think they'd show that. But
yeah, I look at the tribe. I mean,

43
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,110
they're just look amazing. Yeah. What?

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,660
It is just so incredible that there's
still people that live the way they lived

45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,180
many, many, many thousands of years ago.

46
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:34,740
And they essentially just get the
resources from the land area they live and

47
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:38,010
they're, they're just rocking it old
school. And then for me, it like,

48
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,660
the cultural significance is huge,
but what's the biological area like?

49
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,650
You're right. Nobody's going in there.
How much biological studies been done?

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,940
The answer is none. And these
people have large, popular, like,

51
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:55,260
look at that lady. Oh my amazing. Wow.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,260
Yeah. Um, do you have you,
uh, read 'em sapiens, sapiens.

53
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,940
Now I'm not sure.
A evolutionary book about human history.

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,450
You've all Herati I think that's the name
of his, he's amazing writing it down.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,010
Yeah, it's a, it's a great book.

56
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,510
But one of the things that they talk
about in the book was these nomadic tribes

57
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,940
that would, yeah, that's it. Uh,

58
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,820
you've all Noah Herati I
fucked up his name. Um,

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,930
they would talk about these nomadic
tribes that would kill the old ladies,

60
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,490
like killed the people
that were burdens and like,

61
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,840
cause you sh shows like them
and I'll just kill them.

62
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,670
Just talking about like what people became
a problem. They would just kill him.

63
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,130
And this was normal,
but they got along together great.

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,740
Everybody was like laughing and smiling.
Everybody's really friendly.

65
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,590
But as soon as someone seemed to
be a problem, they'd fucking club.

66
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,790
I'm from behind. And just, it's
like, this is gonna sound just awful,

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,880
but doesn't that make sense?
It kind of does. It sucks,

68
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:56,230
but it Kinda does like you're a burden
on the community or on the society.

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,070
You know, there's no fucking old folks
home out there. Yeah. Like that's,

70
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,610
it's crazy.
Like to us in our culture that's absurd.

71
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,150
But as a culture removed from the
rest of the world, makes sense.

72
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,370
Like you're a burden, you
know, you've had a good life.

73
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,420
It's time to move on and there are
nomadic. That's the other thing.

74
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:16,540
It's like they have to keep moving.
So if someone stops like this one guy,

75
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:21,190
he was sick and so they left him on a
tree and he became covered with buzzard

76
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:25,300
shit cause the vultures would just
sit over him and wait for him to die.

77
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,710
But he eventually recovered and he caught
up with the rest of the tribe and for

78
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:30,490
the rest of the,

79
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,830
they call them something like
buzzard shit or something like that.

80
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,370
That was their nickname for him.
Yeah. Imagine being that guy.

81
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:39,460
Imagine sitting under a tree
looking up at vultures being like,

82
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,400
it's moments till I die and they're
going to drop down and eat me.

83
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,750
At least they're polite enough to wait
for you to die straight. They don't just,

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,790
the guy probably couldn't have
fought him off. That was, yeah.
