1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,150
No drugs, no drugs, no alcohol. No.
He drank a little wine though, right?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,280
No Fat Pussy. I'm telling you
that shit will kill Ya. No fat.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,720
No a little allergic.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,020
I'm a big fan for those who want, but
no, I have to drink a little wine though.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,320
I do drink a little wine, but I don't
think that qualifies as a drink.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,620
A glass of wine with the meal. My sons
and my daughters, my brothers, sisters,

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,550
they Thanksgiving dinner, beer beers,
better than coke. Right? Vastly.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,120
It's when you start to enter the drools
zone and I have a big problem of course.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,730
And all of a sudden if there's a problem,
I can't rely on you anymore.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,270
I want to be reliable and that's why I
have a problem with comfortably numb.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,940
I think in my experience,

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,180
you can't wake up the bass player
cause he's comfortably numb.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,700
The guys don't show up.
He can't tune his guitar.

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:58,110
He forgot the lyrics were not as
tight as we could be. You're fired.

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,200
I know what you're saying, but this
is what I'm saying to you, is it?

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,760
This is just a discipline issue and it's
not the marijuana or anything that gets

17
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:07,950
people like that.
It's a lack of discipline.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,150
I you in the digital world and the
Jujitsu world is filled with people that

19
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:16,320
smoked pot and these mother
fuckers work hard, but they want,

20
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,770
what's the number one karate
guy who was the guy that died?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee
did. He spoke dope. Aww.

22
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:28,830
He ain't hash eight hash. Yeah. You know,
he's into eating hash. Here's my question,

23
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,440
but that's not what killed him.
Here's, here's my question to you.

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,420
As I offered to my son Rocco [inaudible]
because he's an advocate of marijuana.

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,740
Yes. Okay. And I sat Rocco
and I said, and I said,

26
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:45,741
so do you really believe that perfectly
clean and sober [inaudible] taking care

27
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,160
of your health with a conscientious diet,

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,690
good athletic workout,
discipline,

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,670
physical prowess.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,370
Do you really think that an
outside source, payoti mushrooms,

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,010
dope,
whatever you want to call it,

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,460
do you really think that with that
outside influence you can do something you

33
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:16,200
can't do unto your God given gift,

34
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,620
individual self.
I'm convinced Joe,

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,640
that you will be the
absolute best you can be.

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,770
You will accomplish what I think is
a self inflicted curse of modern man.

37
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,180
That 90%,

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,270
98% of humanity might be tapping into 5%
of their capabilities because they get

39
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:39,030
an a treadmill. They
get an uh, a paradigm,

40
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,010
self restricted pier nine ever.

41
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:46,011
So decreasing a view of the world
and experiences and the overwrote the

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,880
destroyed road over traveled versus not
only the road less traveled but the non

43
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:58,840
road untraveled that's my favorite.
I'm convinced that you Joe Rogan. Hmm.

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,310
We'll find your superior definitive
best without any outside influence.

45
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,940
I believe you have the par.

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,470
I think I have the power when I get
onstage tonight and you gotta come,

47
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,980
you gotta come witness this but
my bed and I do like it out.

48
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,680
We'll figure out a time. I
can't come tonight. Secondly,

49
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,370
I got an orgy show at
the Improv of human fire.

50
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,410
We put our fists together and Chant
James Brown and Wilson picket and funk

51
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:34,411
brothers and it's like the last wolves
on an island give gnashing of teeth over

52
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,800
the last bone in Shard
of flesh. It's, it's a,

53
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,750
it's an out of body

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,400
soaring above life itself
experience that we have in us.

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,860
I don't need anything. I
understand me, I understand that.

56
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,810
But you don't use anything,
so you're,

57
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,560
you're talking from a place of non
experience when it comes to marijuana or

58
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,810
mushrooms or any of these things.
But my 70 years,

59
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:06,730
I say at least 55 of those years from
the beatniks to the hippies to the,

60
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,990
to the friends and you got to meet this
Wayne Kramer Guide Mc five guitars,

61
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:15,460
new book, the hard stuff. He and I were
born the same time, same influence,

62
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:20,350
Detroit, the swamps, the outdoors. But Bo
Diddley, Chuck Berry, Motown, James Brown,

63
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,850
he started smoking dope.
I didn't. And he's, uh,

64
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,710
in any got a heroin and the
credit and any prison. Again,

65
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,660
stealing and then arrested and I'm
having the time of my life and he's like

66
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,420
wallowing and assess pool in dog shit.

67
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,640
And I'm not knocking Wayne. I'm saying
that he was courageous to write this book.

68
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:43,120
It's a brilliant book. You got to
have them on. You're going to read it.

69
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,020
You're going to,

70
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,020
you're going to be consumed by his
conversational writing of the MC fives,

71
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,930
a ascension to the most authoritative
power house music I've ever witnessed in

72
00:04:58,451 --> 00:04:59,410
my life,

73
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,060
to a bunch of dirt bags on the downward
spiral because of drugs and alcohol.

74
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,800
I know that happens. It definitely
happens. But it happens with everything.

75
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,530
It happens with people when
they eat too much food.

76
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,870
It happens with people with gambling.
It happens as the merchant,

77
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,480
different things.
But I think it's because of discipline.

78
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,430
It's because they don't have a clear path.

79
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:21,130
I think it's cause they let themselves
become self indulgent and they let

80
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,690
themselves be weak. But I'm saying is
that I know a lot of people who use,

81
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,530
whether it's psychedelics or they use
marijuana and they use it to enhance their

82
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:32,710
perspective, it doesn't become
the primary focus of their life.

83
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,500
It doesn't consume their life.
They don't allow it to consume their life.

84
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,740
There's a whole other world of disciplined
marijuana enthusiasts and they're

85
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:45,190
confused the same way people confuse
hunter's same way people think of hunters

86
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,550
as being lazy,
drunk and so cruel to animals.

87
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:52,570
And you and I know that that's not the
case at all. Some of the most disciplined,

88
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:57,571
focused and best people know are intense
people because to the be at Cameron

89
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,500
Hanes,
to be a John Dudley,

90
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,370
you have to be a superior type of
human being should breath leach. Yeah.

91
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,690
You have to be able to execute
in that extreme moment,

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,900
that moment where that animal walks
out to that shooting window and you're

93
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:16,550
looking at this three 90
bull elk and help screaming,

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,730
screaming,
and overwhelming all over itself,

95
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,820
overwhelming and it's 40 yards
away and your center in that pen,

96
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,380
it takes the magic powerful
human being to execute that shot.

97
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,180
And I don't think most
people are aware of that.

98
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,780
Most people don't know in the same
way that that's misunderstood.

99
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,600
I think marijuana is misunderstood
because there's a lot of dummies in this

100
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,520
world.
If you get a group of 100 people,

101
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,410
what are the odds that one of
them's going to be a dummy?

102
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,340
Fucking 100% right and more
nowadays more than one. Yeah. Well,

103
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,520
if you get a group of a hundred
people that use marijuana,

104
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,640
the one loud fucking stupid one defies
or defines rather what marijuana users

105
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:56,990
are. You see that fucking
idiot who's pissing all over
himself and fallen down so

106
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:59,270
high he can't walk.
That's what you think of.

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,110
You don't think of the Brazilian Jujitsu
black belt at smokes pot and then goes

108
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,660
out and strangles 50 people in in class.

109
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,050
You don't think of people to take
yoga class. I liked hiring marijuana.

110
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,400
Strangling. There should be
a nice whole, Eh, listen,

111
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,700
I am absorbing, absorbing, in,

112
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,110
respecting and considering your
word. It can get away from you. Yeah,

113
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,470
you can get away from me. All I've ever
said, everything can get away from you.

114
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,580
That's all I've ever seen. But I think
it's because these people that consume it,

115
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,560
they don't have those other qualities.
They don't have discipline and focus.

116
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,420
They don't have respect for their body.
See the thing with that,

117
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,200
especially in the Jiu Jitsu community,
it's super common. Marijuana is really,

118
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:42,000
really, really, really
common. Yeah. I mean they,

119
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,720
there's a show called high
rollers where these guys,

120
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:47,690
they put together a Jujitsu tournament
and everybody had to get high before they

121
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:48,350
rolled.

122
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,000
And you're talking like elite world
class Brazilian Jiu black belt competing

123
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,420
high on marijuana and that's gotta be
one of the highest forms of disciplines

124
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,370
very available to us. It's a very,
very right there with the camera names.

125
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,340
Mountain climbing bowl, calling an oak
in your lap. Yes. Well you're, you're,

126
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,410
you're doing an art that's designed to
break bodies and the two of you are going

127
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,201
to do it together.

128
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,840
And the whole idea is that you're going
to get someone into a position where

129
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,660
they have to tap or they're going to get
their arm snapped or they're going to

130
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:19,310
get choked unconscious. It's
intense, extremely difficult pursuit.

131
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:21,470
And a lot of people do it under
the influence of marijuana.

132
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,580
Do you know any of these? Master
Jujitsu Martial Artis? Oh yeah.

133
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,080
That that don't do any, oh yeah.
Oh yeah, and how do they perform?

134
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,450
They perform well. Do very
well. There's, let's look.

135
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:37,040
There's the elite world class athletes
in Jujitsu that don't generally I won the

136
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,370
world champion got high or not well.

137
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:43,700
I know a lot of them I do,
but I know a lot of them do.

138
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,020
A lot of world champions do.

139
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,850
I know a lot of like real
multiple time world champ didn't.

140
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,250
They're marijuana users. Yeah. How about
world champions that don't get high?

141
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,690
There's a lot of those to see.
What happens with marijuana is,

142
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:58,950
is increased sensitivity that a lot
of people talk about and they talk,

143
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,730
they call it paranoia because there's a
lot of things that people put blinders

144
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:06,000
on their life. A lot of
people aren't aware and I'm
sure because of your hunting,

145
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,580
you're spending time in the woods, you're
soaking in all the variables, the sound.

146
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,410
When I'm a radar, you're
there, right? You're aware.

147
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,240
There's a lot of people that
go through life like this,

148
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,670
no pick go through life like
they're looking through a
toilet paper roll over in

149
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,030
the left lane right now they're not.
They're not using their blinkers.

150
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,560
And those people, those people, when
they smoke marijuana, they freak out.

151
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,640
They get paranoid because what's
happening is the marijuana increases your

152
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,311
sensitivity.

153
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:33,210
He makes you aware of all these variables
and a lot of people consider that

154
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:36,150
paranoia. You start freaking
out about all these variables.

155
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,020
He started thinking about your mortality
and instead of embracing this time as a

156
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,780
magical moments that of
being in this moment,

157
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,320
you just start getting overwhelmed and
you feel your own heartbeat and you start

158
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:50,670
freaking out of this all the
time. Yeah. It's without anything.

159
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,350
It's an entheogenic.

160
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,380
It brings you closer to whatever
you are not encumbered by your ego.

161
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,723
I will

162
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,900
admit in escapable that everything
affects everyone differently.

163
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:09,440
Yes.
But once you make it widespread,

164
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,130
I mean I've studied the
results of legalization for
recreational use in Colorado

165
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,730
and how the highway fatalities
and accidents have increased,

166
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:21,300
but you know what else is increased
the population in proportion.

167
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,840
So it causes breeding. Taz is more
people there, more people are there,

168
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,000
so you having more accidents there.
The problem is,

169
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,810
is a boom of population
also boom in the economy,

170
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,510
a boom in the real estate,
real estate's taken off. Yeah.

171
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,660
There's a lot of losers there too. There's
a lot of hacky sack playing, dirty,

172
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,940
stinky hippies that are wandering
around with no shoes on.

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,670
You're going to get those. You're
going to get those. You know,

174
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:46,080
if you have an opening welcome society
that's, that doesn't lock those people up,

175
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:49,800
you're going to have those. It's a
part of freedom. Yeah, it sucks. Look,

176
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,150
losers are a part of this safe world that
our kids are allowed to wander through.

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,060
We want the world to be safe,
so sometimes things are too safe.

178
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,460
You nerf the edges and you get a bunch
of people that are used to hitting their

179
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,380
heads on things and they're
not worried about it.

180
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,280
You're going to have these losers, but
it doesn't mean that everybody who does,

181
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,990
it's a loser. I know a lot of CEO's of
big corporations that have extreme rights

182
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,900
responsibilities and they like
to smoke a little pot. I get,

183
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,850
I get punched back off and on Facebook,
I'm a successful guy,

184
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,280
run my family, I'm a good dad,
I'm a good hunter and I'm a,

185
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm a Trump supporter and I get high
like, Oh God bless you. It just,

186
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,960
I don't want you, you know, babysitting
my kids while you're high. Yeah.

187
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,130
But it's discipline.

188
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,270
Discipline is the thing that fucks people
up and the lack of this lack of the

189
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:37,620
lack of discipline. And I think that's
what everything, it could be with sex,

190
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:41,820
it could be with gambling,
it could be with extreme risky behaviors.

191
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:44,910
People could just get, get real nutty
and get carried away with things.

192
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:48,540
And sometimes those things are just a big
distraction for the lack of discipline

193
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,490
they have in pursuing
their own goals in life.

194
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,860
I think that that is
the real high in life.

195
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,590
The real high in life is pursuing
difficult things. Ratification. Yes.

196
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,800
Getting good at them and then
accomplishing your goals. There's a,

197
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:03,760
there's a high to that that's,
you can't find that in pills.

198
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,260
It doesn't exist in a needle.

199
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,970
That high is a high of discipline and
determination and focus and learning,

200
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,430
but there's so much weakness out there,

201
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,080
especially in a society has been spoiled
for so long and you get a trophy if you

202
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:21,070
don't even show up and you can't
hurt people's feelings and bullied,

203
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,520
get bullied and you're crying,
stood up, fight and back. I mean,

204
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,910
there's so many manifestation
of a cultural deprivation
that runs a muck in our

205
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:32,020
society that my fear is,
and I've studied all these mass shootings.

206
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,080
Joe, the Virginia Tech shooter.
Hi, well, they're all buying.

207
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,420
Hi. Yeah, but they're all on SSR. I's,
they're all on pills and pharmaceuticals.

208
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:48,421
Almost all of them are a presence
on the PROZAC and their parents.

209
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,020
All of them are chemical covering
up a kid that shows enthusiasm.

210
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,480
It's called attention disorder now.
I mean,

211
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:57,850
if they had that back when I was
growing up, I had end up playing,

212
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,110
I don't know it. I ended up being Ozzie,
and the problem is the word drugs,

213
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,620
like you and I are drinking coffee. We're
on drugs right now. We're on caffeine.

214
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,940
This is a drug. There's some drugs
that if used responsibly or, okay.

215
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,780
A glass of wine with dinner is a
drug. Understood. It's a mild drug.

216
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,890
A little tiny toke. Yeah.
For sex with the misses.

217
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,040
That's a little drug.
It makes you most see.

218
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:25,420
I've never smoked because I can't smoke.
I get in when I shoot my machine guns,

219
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:28,150
all I do is chew on a Cuban.
I don't really smoke it.
