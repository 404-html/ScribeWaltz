1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,780
The Bible says the Old Testament New
Testament, which is pretty powerful.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,060
I know people misinterpret itself,
but it's ancient tax.

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,790
The people that are there like,
well,

4
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,500
you read Zinky like three
burning wheels land.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,260
There's a blue from in over 10
it gives me something to take.

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:16,190
I take it and give him the full
data of the plan that that, that,

7
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:19,230
that the genetics has been infested in.
God must destroy everyone.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,470
That's an alien story. Oh, it's 100%
but that's what they always talk about.

9
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,080
There was talking about
that being an alien story.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,030
That's why one of the primary stories
when they, when we talk about the Bible,

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,740
Ezekiel's vision, a wheel within a wheel
that they always thought of, you read it,

12
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,910
it says floating off the ground and
the Hebrew and the King James is pretty

13
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,110
clear to floating comes a thing
with a crystal from it over its head

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,380
and then the face of shifting different
creatures. It's like a video screen. Well,

15
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,380
if you think about how long it
would take for an alien to get here,

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,000
it really only makes sense that unless
they have a constant basis in a robot

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,150
they visit, or if they, if
they came by themselves,

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,610
they came by themselves
a long fucking time ago.

19
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,380
Like if they were able to
make interstellar travel
like two, 3000 years ago,

20
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,400
which is not that big of a leap.
If you think about us 3000 years from now,

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,380
we probably can do something like that,
right?

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,460
So if they were doing that 3000 years
ago and they found human beings,

23
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,910
and these are the stories that we have,
these stories like a Zeke,

24
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,090
you'll and like,
uh,

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,590
there's a bunch of different ancient
stories about contact with the skies,

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,910
you know, the, uh, changing to tabulation.
Yeah. There's a world government,

27
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,270
the beach is 50 feet tall. It shifts.
Everyone can see it the same time.

28
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,270
It's a Hologram.
And you've got these digital systems.

29
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:35,910
If you don't go along when you
can't buy her shell, people say, oh,

30
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,630
that's not real, but it's manifesting
and then go 2000 years. In the future.

31
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,830
They have advanced technology.

32
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,750
They don't send people anymore
and now they send aliens.

33
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,310
If you go back to the old days,

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,170
it was actually some sort of humanoid
or a large thing like all the Zachariae

35
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:53,080
sitch and shit. The covers and Sumerian
texts. Exactly. That's what I'm,

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,310
I make sense. That's what all those
guys are telling you. Like Avatar,

37
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,670
James Camera's definitely dialed
in. It's like, no, we're there jack.

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,070
They're jacking him.
Well,

39
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:07,071
it makes sense that if there was a visitor
to this planet five 10 15,000 years

40
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:10,050
ago,
if there was maybe more,

41
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,650
maybe if there was a visitor hundreds
of thousands of years ago that actually

42
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:17,220
did genetic experiments on lower hominids.
If that was really the case,

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,060
it makes sense that their technology,
would it increase far more rapid,

44
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:24,240
but let's go pass that.
Obviously scientists like to plant things,

45
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,800
gardeners like to plan things and,
but that's Joe.

46
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,710
That's exactly what the globalist believe
is that maybe they're just aware of

47
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,810
what the fuck's going on.
There was powerless as we are.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,960
If they're reading more and more,

49
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,500
they only put soulless people in
charge who are compartmentalized.

50
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,310
Nobody else knows who will carry the shop.
But we're able, because we're advanced,

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,180
look at this because let, let's just get
down to brass tax tax. I love tax law. No,

52
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,220
Joe, you just said it instead of
some weird dumb preacher, you know,

53
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,760
and in Alabama, not bashing Alabama
sang stuff. You'd get mad at this.

54
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,420
Don't look at watch. So demonized. Look
at why it's demonized. Think about that,

55
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,460
right?
Think about how it shares.

56
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,130
Okay.

57
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,100
That there's no reality and god creates
a whole new virtual reality, gives light,

58
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,200
does all of it, and then
his genetic experiment by
rogue elements gets involved.

59
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,870
It's all right there.

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,960
When you actually look at it and you
expand on it and you're like, oh my God,

61
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:24,130
this is like beyond a science fiction
book. And so it's the obvious thing.

62
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,630
That's why they keep telling
us, oh look, Piltdown man,
all this fake stuff. No, Joe,

63
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,120
they did an accelerated immunogenic.
They're doing Jewish now. Something new.

64
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,370
They did an accelerated immunogenic
program on this planet and humanity.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,930
What? What does the Bible start with?
Pick as we are made in the image of God.

66
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,870
What does that mean?
We don't have God's knowledge.

67
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,200
We don't have God's advancement. We're
the image. Well, what does an image?

68
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,830
It's a scan. It's numbers. It's
the genetics. It's the potential.

69
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,780
So we are the aliens. Joe and everybody
already knows this. We are the aliens.

70
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,870
Do you think that we are a
product of alien intervention?

71
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,830
They took these lower hominids and they
accelerated their evolution by applying

72
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,664
their genetics.

73
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,500
Okay.

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,550
Do you know we, here's the deal.
They say we're 97% chimpanzee,

75
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,680
but then they actually get
into the deeper genetics.

76
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:16,050
We're closer to pigs are Rach show.

77
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,960
I think that this was an
environment built for us.

78
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,100
We're the master genetic program
and they're are all subsets of us.

79
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,090
Just for a backstory. Uh, and that's
what the loveless thing. Yeah,

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,670
but do you think that
the aliens created us?

81
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,580
Like this is like one of the primary
what? The elite beliefs, right?

82
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,880
The elders are biological.

83
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:40,470
Android's the grayish and then there's
other systems going on and no one knows

84
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:43,620
because it's all warfare, psychological
stuff. No one knows. The truth is it's,

85
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:47,550
it's virtual reality once you get to that
level. So no one knows. We just don't,

86
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:50,160
we're advanced. But we are, and I'm
not just answering a rifle. Powerful.

87
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:55,110
The globalists are obsessed. The elites
are obsessed because she reportedly,

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,090
obviously humans are pretty fricking cool.

89
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,050
We've got some big giant mission
and maybe that's a program,

90
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:04,770
I don't know that we're
like pretty super advanced,

91
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,910
but you can't put something out like
the Spartans were when their kids were

92
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,680
seven, they throw him out
for two years in the woods.

93
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,520
You can't just put something out
like, like, like, like liberals.

94
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,190
You give her very everything.
There's a little hassles show.

95
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,710
This is like bootcamp
and training and they,

96
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,720
so they had the testis and do all this.

97
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,060
And basically this planet
is what the people say.

98
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a big testing ground for other things
that are going to come. And we are at,

99
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,310
we are God. And I don't mean
I'm God, I'm already God.

100
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:36,060
I've achieved godhood cause you could
see that potential on your shelf and and

101
00:05:36,061 --> 00:05:36,541
the,
and the,

102
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,800
and the lower level ELLs will tell you
that because they already know you're bad

103
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:42,120
ash.
But if they can trick a tadpole,

104
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:45,450
it's going to grow into Godzilla to
they'll kill itself. They're winning.

105
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,360
So you show some of the cash.

106
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,590
The elves are a test
on us to attack us and,

107
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:53,640
and and she the survival of the fittest
but they're nothing. They're like,

108
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,190
well by by the time we've achieved
conscious and we look back and go,

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,260
we're not going to look at it that
because I think when you jumped the next

110
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,990
level, there's even bigger war
going on. What's the biggest war?

111
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,750
Consciousness of the universe is
an interdimensional spacecraft.

112
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,990
Beyond that then looks like a
comment from my research and it has,

113
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,430
it has its head as its corona.
That's consciousness consciousness.

114
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:23,960
He carries evil in the tail end. The
consciousness has a location. No,

115
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,510
there is this giant
consciousness. God, okay.

116
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,220
Swimming in a giant system of survival,

117
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:35,810
a fitness that God has created a test
God self. Okay, looks like a comment.

118
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,090
So you've got God's conscious
and all the good things,

119
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:41,030
the knowledge going forward, but God
knows that everybody has to be tested.

120
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,110
So the tail goes out and at the
end of the tail is basically evil.

121
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,030
That's why Christ says,
get behind me, Satan.

122
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,670
And it's always trying to test God
and infiltrate up into it to sabotage.

123
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,700
Damn.
If they do pull the plug in.

124
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,820
This podcast is a good way
to end this motherfucker.

125
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,230
I of your burnout one is fit. Oh, I'm not,

126
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm just saying it 1,300 and something.

127
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,830
If the fucking governments come in,
but shell,

128
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:11,720
they love [inaudible]. You guys have
been talking about aliens so much, dude,

129
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,290
trust me.
This is not the move.

130
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,570
Biggest youtube videos of all is that
the move to talk about aliens as much as

131
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,910
possible.
They allow me to shut up,

132
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,420
let me call over children's
program one bs alien stuff.

133
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:26,340
Or were they come out of space?
It's interdimensional Eddie. Well,

134
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,930
when you say alien to tell you that
you're talking to them, the Kadian,

135
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,243
that's what it sounds like.

136
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,440
Literally believe they're in
contact with these things. Well,

137
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:36,890
maybe they are probably to
describe what you saw DMT and you,

138
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,820
you tell us you have these experiences
where thoughts become patterns.

139
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:44,630
They become like geometric patterns
that are moving through space and they

140
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,010
change and shift, but they're letting you
know that they know all your bullshit.

141
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,580
They see right through you and
they want the want is creation.

142
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:55,430
They want you to relax.
Yes. There is a lot of that.

143
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,840
There's a lot of thought as creation.
Yes, but but with the only oh, relaxed.

144
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,380
Just so you don't struggle. No one to
call them aliens though. What I saw,

145
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,870
I never referred to them as a,
but that's the term.

146
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:09,290
Everyone knows not of this world. None
of our average thing. I would listen,

147
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,610
I would think it was aliens.

148
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,090
If it woke me up in the middle of
the night and it took me a board,

149
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,510
a ship and that's what I experienced,

150
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,410
how it'd be 100% convinced that I went
to an alien spaceship and I talked to

151
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,720
these things,
the differences,

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,230
how it was like to smoke it and
then laid back and then experience.

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,240
That is like I expected that progression
of events but if I woke up in the

154
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,160
middle of the night I was going to take
a leak and a a light shone down to the

155
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,710
bathroom and they stuck me through
the window. It took me a board,

156
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:41,090
a space ship and I saw the exact same
thing that I saw when I was high on DMT.

157
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,990
I'd be 100% convinced that I was in
contact with aliens. The different,

158
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:49,130
the only difference is how I got there.
Like I got there through a drug.

159
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,270
I got there through smoking,

160
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:53,750
something that's produced by the human
brain that I knew it was pretty safe.

161
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:55,500
No one's ever died of it.
I'm like, let's what happens?

162
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,280
And all that goes back to everyone
I've talked to in mash groups taking

163
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:02,750
particularly Iowasca yeah. They have
group events and see the same things.

164
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,160
They hear the same thing. Yes. Yeah.
Which is the psychic connection.

165
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,610
But it's beyond that. You could argue
a one person's a psychic leader.

166
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,240
They projected everybody else's minds.
But who's projecting that into them?

167
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,530
So that's the only way it's out. This,
this is one of the Pentagon. It will,

168
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,930
it might not be someone projecting
anything into your mind.

169
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:23,010
It might be your new found ability
to perceive things that you could.

170
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,900
The way I look at it, it's like, no, I
agree, but why are they all 43 people?

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,840
You know, in Costa Rica,
all shooting aliens.
