1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,870
What do you think happens with him?
I don't know who can today.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,930
I don't know who can beat him.
Who Do you think can beat him?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,330
That's a good question.
I Dunno. Hillary can't,

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,370
I'm so worried.
Yeah,

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,560
but I'm so worried she's going to run
again and she's going to muscle her way to

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:21,530
the top. I don't know who can
beat him right now and I'm, I'm,

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,600
I don't know. Why do you think
that in the question, right?

8
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,000
If things keep going
further and further south,

9
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,100
what about someone who
was a centrist Democrat?

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:32,700
Doesn't that make more sense that someone
who's gonna, who's a rational person,

11
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:37,020
who's on the right is going to look at
this person who's maybe a economically

12
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,330
conservative but socially liberal and say,

13
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,870
this is really where I'm leaning towards
the one on the far left and like on,

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,830
on an identity politics platform,
right. It scares me. Yeah.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,250
That's not going to work. Well, it
could it though, because I think so.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,880
I don't know. Because Trump's
whole thing was, screw the center.

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,180
I just need to make my base
go ape shit crazy for me.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,390
But there's still apeshit crazy and no
matter what he does and I'm worried that

19
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,750
the left the Democrats are going to try
and replicate that strategy and be like,

20
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,650
we just need to make our base go ape shit
crazy rather than running someone that

21
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,650
can win the center.
I see where you're going,

22
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:14,850
but I think that this is
maybe my liberal bias,

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,550
but I think that people on the
left wouldn't fall for that.

24
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,960
The same way people on the right would,

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,230
I don't think people on the left who saw
someone who went ape shit full woke far

26
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,910
left. I think there's a lot of
people in the center and be like,

27
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,950
well I'm going to just get a vote,
libertarian man.

28
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,950
I'm going to vote for Gary Johnson or some
shit. But okay, so who's in right now?

29
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:36,951
So we have Kamala Kirsten Gillibrand
months dress monster ts ideas.

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,070
Well, when she was 22 she had,
oh she isn't a solid toady.

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,390
What does that mean? She is
a toady. I think that I use
that word correctly. Jamie,

32
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,690
can you check with toady means like towing
the line? Is that what it means? No,

33
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:52,770
I think it's like a

34
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,460
t o a d I. E was, I mean,

35
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,400
okay.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,750
I think it means that.
I think it means

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,443
there you go.

38
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,960
Toady definition of toadies, a person
confess flowers or defers to others.

39
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,830
Can they kind of self serving
reasons I stick a fan.

40
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,430
So she's an Assad sick offense. Is that
what you're saying? Yeah, that's, that's

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,040
okay.

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,540
Known about her. Like what did she say
that, oh, we have to look. I don't,

43
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,920
I don't remember the details.

44
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:30,010
I probably should say that
before we say that about,

45
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,760
or we should probably read it rather
well. I have read it. Not many.

46
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,740
Maybe we should, right? Oh yeah.
Okay. Just so we know what she said.

47
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,400
I've had her on Gab or really enjoy
talking to her. I like her a lot.

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,400
Are you serious? Yeah. Like talking
to her. A lot of talking to her.

49
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:46,840
I don't know about, I think she's like
the mother lode of bad ideas. Whoa.

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,090
I'm pretty positive about that. Especially
on the side. But maybe I'm wrong.

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,870
I don't think I'm wrong.
Well,

52
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,670
my take on her was that I think as
a person who's coming from the left,

53
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,170
who's also a veteran and uh, it's very
articulate and sensible and a woman,

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,530
and in talking to her, and we didn't
get into a sod or any of those things,

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,970
but talking to her about what she feels
is wrong with the current administration

56
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:17,350
and the way things are running in a
direction she thinks things could go in.

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,210
She has a very promising ideas. I don't,
I didn't know about it. It doesn't,

58
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,660
she also, did she ever apologize for
believing in conversion therapy for,

59
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,070
I didn't even know she
believed in conversion therapy.
Am I crazy? Is that real?

60
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,610
I'm almost positive this is real.
I think her father ran con.

61
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,660
When you say conversion therapy, you're
talking about gay people. Yeah. No,

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,460
I didn't know that.
I never heard that.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,990
And I did hear something about when
she was very young, she was like 22.

64
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,930
She had said something about
gay marriage and civil unions.

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,870
If she apologized for and
said that she evolved,

66
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,150
she reveals she met Assad in Syria without
informing top Democrats. Yeah. She's,

67
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,860
she said she went on a fact finding
mission in supportive piece for Syrian

68
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:02,610
people, but characterize us
backed rebels' as terrorists.

69
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,383
Okay.

70
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,840
Yeah.
She's,

71
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,193
I mean,

72
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,650
I can keep looking,
but I just,

73
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,410
I'm telling you the time to research
everything all at the same time.

74
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,230
I can come back on when I do. Well, let's,
let's, we can do this another time. Okay.

75
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:18,720
But what,

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
who do you think stands out for you as
someone that would make a good president?

77
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,930
Yeah. She wants touted working
for an anti gay group that,

78
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,530
that conversion therapy. Anyway, she
wants touted working for an anti,

79
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:31,860
she worked for an anti gay group. She
worked for them, like she had a job there.

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,970
You know, I'm worried as a person who's
been called. All right. Uh, Jason,

81
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,360
I'm just looking at about labels. No,
I understand. But you know what I mean?

82
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,410
Rep Tulsi Galbard in the early two
thousands touted working for her father's

83
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,820
anti gay organization,

84
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:50,060
which mobilized to pass a measure
against same sex marriage in Hawaii and

85
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:54,260
perverted and promoted controversial
conversion therapy. Yeah.

86
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,790
FYI.
