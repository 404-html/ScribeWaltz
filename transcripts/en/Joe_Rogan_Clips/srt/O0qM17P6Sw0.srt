1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,630
Right. This time just flew by. That'd
be because it's a love fest of truth,

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,030
logic and common sense. Well, listen,

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,020
man has been a pleasure to meet you back.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,660
It had to be able to sit down with you
again and have a good conversation here.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,110
My friends were right.
You do to deserve me and I think it's,

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,310
I think it's a good opportunity for people
to get a chance to see you in a long

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,550
form conversation rather than these sound
that they could just choose to hate.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,300
Especially when the sound bites are
edited and a manufacturer. Yes. It,

9
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:31,860
let's make it perfectly clear. I did
not avoid the draft. I did nothing. Oh,

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,200
let's go you that.
I am not raising real quick.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,910
That was an old school story
of an interview supposedly
that you shit all over

12
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:42,040
yourself in high times. Matt,
by the way, Joe, you've,

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,550
you know me pretty well
in the last three hours.

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,700
If I had shit on myself
to get out of the draft,

15
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:50,760
do you think for a minute I would
deny it? No, I would have. No,

16
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:53,370
that would be a great story.
It was a story. Is that about,

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,730
I went in and got my draft
as they're going. By the way,

18
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:59,310
when I went in 1969 I was superman.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,010
I literally would hurdle Volkswagen bugs.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,930
I was all muscle and sinew.
I could, I was superman.

21
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,880
I was the most athletic running,

22
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:13,620
jumping gazelle known to man
and I went in for my daughter.

23
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:16,020
I didn't know anything about Vietnam.
I didn't know anything about war.

24
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:18,360
My Dad was a war hero,
but nobody talked about it.

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,370
I'd never heard of the Bataan death march.

26
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:25,080
I graduated from the American education
system so I knew nothing and there was

27
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,160
all protest around me,

28
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:30,450
but I wasn't really tuned into the protest
because I was making music every day.

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,860
I mean just obsessed with the Amboy
dukes and playing gigs every night and I

30
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,080
didn't pay attention.
I never watched a newscast in my life,

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,330
but I was given a draft
notice and I went down,

32
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,140
I went down and I had my draft physical
and I passed with flying cover colors

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,370
and I got a draft card in the mail a
couple of months later through my mom and

34
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:52,080
dad's house. And One why not a
deferment? It's uh, uh, uh, uh,

35
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,400
designation. I was in, uh, Oakland
Community College at the time,

36
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,660
so I was why was a student,
uh, designation I believe,

37
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,270
but I was ready to rock.
Um, I didn't want to go.

38
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:07,410
I didn't understand any of my buddies
were going, uh, uh, uh, John Break,

39
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:12,180
my singer had to go, uh, uh,
Rob Leonard from, uh, uh,

40
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,430
Amboy. Dukes had to go. Uh,

41
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,830
so the only way you could have gone
is if you dropped out of school.

42
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,200
Is that what it is? No, it wasn't
a deferment. No. I would, I could,

43
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,510
I would have been called anytime.

44
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,510
So you could have been
called or just weren't sure.

45
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,400
And then the Wikipedia claims,

46
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:30,900
I got a four f four f what does a four
f fourF and means you're physically

47
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,380
incapable. I'm never been
physically incapable of anything.

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,850
So they make this shit up. So, so I
did an interview with the high times,

49
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,340
which by the way, let's make it
clear. I've done this so many times,

50
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,770
but people ignore my actual statements.

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,820
So I had been doing interviews all cause
the employee dukes were on fire and I

52
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:52,160
was just an outrage on stage with a loin
cloth and the bone Arrow and feedback

53
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,480
and he's killed her songs.
And the band was so good,

54
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,890
greatest musicians in the world.

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,890
So I did interviews all the time
talking about the music I loved,

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,850
and they never got anything right.

57
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,190
These stone dirt bag hippie writers get
the gas guys in the band's names wrong.

58
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:10,330
They got the facility wrong. They,
they've mentioned songs we didn't perform,

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,500
they got nothing, right? And every
time I'd read the inner voice of God,

60
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,670
we are talking about my music.
You didn't even get the song titles right.

61
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,060
So I started having fun
with these interviewers,

62
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,450
much to the entertainment of my band mates
who would break out in hysterics when

63
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:28,810
I'd make up stories because I'm not
gonna even try to be accurate anymore.

64
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,360
It was an ongoing maneuver of mine.

65
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,500
We'd have these hippie writers come
in to take notes and I'd say, yeah,

66
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:39,160
I played this fender stratocaster
as I hold up my Gibson bird land,

67
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:44,140
which has known for, and
they'd write down, he played
in a Gibson a stratocaster.

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,760
There's no such thing as the gifts,
Reddick gas.

69
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,890
So I was having fun with
dirt bag anti journalists.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,180
So now I'm invited to high times
magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug.

71
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,920
So I go, we had, and this guy
is, and his inner is typically,

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,630
so, uh, uh, so, uh, tell me about, uh,

73
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,170
this I Amboy dukes. What is
it like a band? I went, yeah,

74
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,004
it's like a band.

75
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,930
So it's almost exactly like a band
fuck kind of question. Is this,

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,180
how did this draft Sony,

77
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:23,950
how he started talking about when I'm
with the MC five and the stooges and we

78
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,520
would party and I go, yeah
man, I was snorting something.
I don't know what it was,

79
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:30,210
man. I just got higher than
a kite. And he goes, wow,

80
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,530
you think I might've been a
crystal meth? And I mean, yeah,

81
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,870
that's what they called it. I never
snorted. Crystal Meth is made up. Shit.

82
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,130
Just when nuts and I,
we went into the war thing and I go,

83
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:41,620
I don't know anything about
war. I'm a, I'm a guitar player,

84
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:45,970
but I went down for my draft physical
and when I went into the booth to give my

85
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:48,970
urine sample,
I made sure I ate Mexican food all week.

86
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,590
So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,

87
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,770
I took a big dump in it was green and
went all over the place and the guy went,

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,780
wow. He really, yeah. Really?

89
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,680
And so I made up the story for
High Times magazine, you know,

90
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,270
the great magazine of in
good information and uh,

91
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,180
embedded turned out that
my drummer Kj night,

92
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:14,890
God blessing me to actually admitted this
and testified that that's what he did.

93
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,070
It is. We thought it was the
funniest thing in the world.

94
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,310
We're teenagers and this guy
went into the draft physical,

95
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:25,750
just an absolute near death lumpy
shit to get out of the draft.

96
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,250
And we thought it was funnier and hell.

97
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,880
We weren't paying attention to
important things in life. And so the,

98
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,050
the Ted Hating liberal press
started quoting the high
times magazine and quoting

99
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,630
an ex girlfriend who claimed
that I adopted her, that her,

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,580
I adopted my girlfriend to be read
that one. I did read that one,

101
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,320
I forgot about it. So this
kind of stuff, I was like,

102
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,300
you adopted her so you could
take her on tour with Ya know,

103
00:05:55,301 --> 00:06:00,120
so I could fucker that's the story was,
but that's Ab.

104
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,630
Absolutely.
I don't think that's how it works.

105
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,510
That's not how I think it makes it easy
to talk to him once you adopt them.

106
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,030
I didn't adopt anybody cry.

107
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,590
I never shit my pants since I was,
I think eight months old.

108
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,520
Um, I've never been with an
underage girl since I was under age.

109
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,010
I'm not a racist. And what
else did they say? Oh,

110
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,460
and they seem that they cleaned that I
made Courtney love blow me when she was

111
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:26,150
12. I think she claimed that I,
yeah, I never met Courtney love.

112
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:30,620
You can tell I don't have a rash of,
you've just got to be kidding me.

113
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,890
They just make this shit up because they
know I'm so good at bringing my basic

114
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,230
conservative agenda forward
that they have to go full,

115
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:46,850
solid Lynskey and lie and lie and lie.

116
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,480
And if you go to Wikipedia
to find out about Ted Nugent,

117
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,640
they will repeat these lies. They're
lies. And every one of those things,

118
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,210
every one of those things, if I had
done it and I go, yeah, it was awesome,

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,110
but I didn't do any of those things.
Anyone can edit Wikipedia. You know,

120
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,860
that very strange that she
might have edited it yet. So,

121
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,640
so I'm glad we got that. Oh, this
thing is just persisted forever.

122
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,370
Obviously it stuck in your crop because
you wanted to bring it up at the very

123
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,060
young, just sticking my crotch. Just,

124
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:19,061
it's a fascinating example of the
dishonesty and the anti journalism agenda

125
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:22,310
driven, um, anti-American,

126
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,850
anti Ted anti second amendment,
anti freedom.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,230
Buffoonery the exists. And I think it
makes for an interesting podcast exchange.

128
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,340
I think so. Not In my craw. It's not
even in my universe, but I notice it.

129
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,120
It's hysterical. Ted Nugent, ladies,
gentlemen. There you have it.
