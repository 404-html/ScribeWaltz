1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Somehow or another make it seem like
they would advance in the company more if

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,690
they played along. Could be,
yeah, I'm not going to do it

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,830
because it feels so good. Yes,
yes. Well you should encourage it,

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,030
but I almost feel like, um, yeah,

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,530
but you don't want to shame people.

6
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,680
Like there's some brilliant people that
don't work out at all. They're brilliant,

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,310
but they just, whatever, for whatever
reason, that's their choice and you know,

8
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,890
it should be your choice to go
out like Christopher Hitchens,

9
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,620
it just fucking drink every day and smoke
cigarettes and one day you get cancer

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:38,610
and you're like, well, you
know, I mean this is like,

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,330
he mean he, the way he described it,
like burning the candle at both ends,

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,480
it gave a a beautiful,
brilliant light. Yeah.

13
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,880
He wouldn't have had those ideas
if he had done in another way.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,950
It's very possible. That's true.
Most of the madness that we see in,

15
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,530
in brilliant artists, like it's very,
it's very possible that that man,

16
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:59,880
this would not be expressed if
they had their shit together.

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,130
There was something that Sam Harris was
saying the other day on your show just

18
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,520
about about the free well
stuff and I think that it,

19
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:10,680
that connects to this
information theory kind of thing.

20
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,681
So if we're just sort of a conglomerate
of these actions and words like flowing

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,010
the, the actions through
our body and unique ways.

22
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,330
I mean do you accept his
theory on freewill? Um,

23
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,460
well it's not his theory or
it's a conventional theory
of determinism that a lot

24
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:37,440
of people are, I'm embracing and I think
there's definitely some merit to it.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,671
However,

26
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,600
you and I both know that you choose
whether or not you decide to do something

27
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,260
right. You choose whether or
not you do. Like someone says,

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,890
someone says something to you that's
kind of Shitty and you choose whether you

29
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,600
decide to email them
back something shitty.

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,390
Like you have that initial impulse
like, well, hey man, fuck you.

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,810
You have that initial impulse.
You think on it, you sleep on it.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,580
But why are you thinking
on it and sleeping on it?

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,380
Are you doing that because of determinism?

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,320
Are you doing that because you're
trying to be a better person and are you

35
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,890
trying to be a better person because of
all the factors that played out in your

36
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:12,750
life? Like environment, Jean's
life experience, all those things,

37
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,380
right. It means it's really good.
It's a really good discussion.

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,290
So do you own the words that you're
saying right now? It's a good question.

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,000
Larry Lessig, who's on
here the other day. Yeah.

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,220
You guys didn't even talk about this,

41
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,250
but he basically is one of the founders
of creative Commons and this whole

42
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,190
licensing structure for content. Like
what we're saying right now, you know,

43
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,290
this is going to be licensed.
I don't know how,

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,870
how's it different ways you
and I as I'm a form right here,

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,520
this discussion is going to be licensed
you. Yeah. Okay. I mean, you're,

46
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,730
I think you're licensing it in
a certain way. Okay. So it will,

47
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,590
you have the ability to license it however
you want, right? You could say, hey,

48
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:47,040
anyone can take this and cut it
up and remix it. Or You could say,

49
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,100
now it's locked down.
Um,

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,440
but he helped create this whole licensing
array of like six different licenses.

51
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,430
One says you can do absolutely anything
you want with this and other says you

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,190
can share it but you can't make
money off it. There's a handful.

53
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:08,191
And so the freewill stuff is connected
to how we're dealing with information and

54
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,160
like if you, cause if you,
if you think realistic,

55
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:18,880
we don't own what we're saying,
we're a part of it, right?

56
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,820
We're a conduit where unique conduit.

57
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,210
So it,

58
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,250
I don't think it aligns with how the
universe works to really be locking down

59
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,320
information.

60
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,240
I think that it makes sense probably
in certain short term business,

61
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,390
but you know, I think we have to
open it up to what's really going on.

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,310
What do you mean about like locking
down information like source code,

63
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,380
like classified files like our content,
like music,

64
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:55,300
like video and now how does this,

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,530
how does this connect to determinism
and whether or not you have freewill

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,390
because it's a mess.
Are,

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,230
are you the creator of your information?
Will,

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,920
you are certainly if you put in the work,

69
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,630
like let's say you
decided to write a book.

70
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
I mean you put hundreds and hundreds of
hours into this book and edit this book

71
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,230
and then you release the book
and someone says, no, you didn't.

72
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,680
You didn't create that.
You are,

73
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:24,790
you're a product of determination and
I'm going to just steal your book.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,120
That's intellectual theft.
Intellectual theft is real. It's,

75
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:31,320
it's certainly real in terms of
like creation of content, right?

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,600
If you're a standup comedian and someone
takes your countless hours of work and

77
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,720
steals it,
that's intellectual theft for sure.

78
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,380
And then they try to pawn it off as their
own, through their own selfish needs.

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,940
A selfish means.

80
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,810
That's why attribution is the key
part of the creative Commons licensing

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,130
structure. Always saying if you come up
with a joke, you know it came from here,

82
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,170
but what if it's a profit? Like say
if you wrote a book and a, I say,

83
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,100
hey, this is a great book
written by Bill Ottman.

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,390
Give me five bucks for it and putting it
up on my site and you to it. Fuck that.

85
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,750
I mean, here's the thing, I don't,

86
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,130
somebody makes all the money off of
your book because they have a better

87
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,320
platform to sell your book and
they don't give it to you at all.

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,070
And you wrote the book, you spent
all the time, you did all the work.

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,690
I would for certain content that
I create completely give it away.

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,470
That sounds like a guy who's never written
a book. I've written a book. Did you?

91
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,480
I mean I've, I've written
a lot of content. Yeah. But
have you written, I give away,

92
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:33,340
I give, I've not published, but the book
that you sell, like if you were an author,

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,330
but say if you were,

94
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm not saying people should be forced
to do this or I'm just saying that this I

95
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:44,320
think is how creativity happens.

96
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,840
And I just,
I just don't,

97
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,750
people deserve to make money
on their content. Right.

98
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,220
And you deserve to own your stuff.

99
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,310
But I don't think that that's
actually how the universe works.

100
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,970
And I don't think it's acceptable
to say, Oh, free. You know,

101
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,870
free will doesn't exist. I own
your content. But, um, yeah,

102
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:07,940
that's why I'm struggling to
see how they're connected.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,520
Because if you're not the originator,

104
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,110
then you're not the owner.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,840
That's a weird argument
because you are the originator.

106
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,710
Stephen King wrote all Steven Qr.
You're the unique conduit.

107
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,150
You are the originator of that specific
configuration of information and you

108
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:32,450
deserve to be able to do everything you're
saying with it. I'm just saying that,

109
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,930
I don't know. It's complex.
Well, it is complex.

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,590
If you're saying that all human beings,
essentially,

111
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
all of your actions have been determined
by a lot of factors that are outside of

112
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:53,450
your control. Whether it's genetics,
again, life experience, education,

113
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,380
all the different factors,
your environment. Um,

114
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,710
is that what's causing you to uh,

115
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,310
put out a fucking brilliant record?

116
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,190
It's part of it, right? But maybe
you have 50, maybe you have 50%,

117
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,150
everything else has 50% or there's weed,
I don't know what the percentages,

118
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,920
but if you're a musician and someone
like Spotify comes along and says,

119
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,360
boot do,
you didn't even make that dude,

120
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,870
so we're just going to put it on Spotify
and make millions and give you pennies.

121
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,440
That's not what I'm advocating.
I'm,

122
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:30,820
I'm saying [inaudible]
uses the blues died.

123
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,640
Well more than that. More
than that. There's, yeah.
Yeah. This a real plagiarism.

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,670
So,
but that doesn't,

125
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,070
that doesn't mean that those aren't great
records. That's true. It is true. Yeah.

126
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,300
I mean, it's a led Zeppelin,
this legit gray area. You know,

127
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,560
I found out this bill Burke called me
up and left us really disturbed message.

128
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,190
He was like really bummed out when
he watched in bill's a musician,

129
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,750
he's a drummer. And when he saw
videos of led Zeppelin music played,

130
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,490
and the band that used to open for led
Zeppelin, we played it on the podcast.

131
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:09,350
We were like, Holy Shit.
Like they just stole stuff.

132
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,480
They just stole giant chunks
and rifts and you know, and,

133
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:17,660
and I mean, they made
it better I guess. But,

134
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,620
but yeah, but that's a different
thing than Stephen King's book. Why?

135
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Because Stephen King had
to spend countless hours in
front of his laptop trying

136
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:33,170
to go over each and every sentence and
each and every paragraph and suck you in

137
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:37,880
and it, all this work. No, they stole
stuff, dude. They sold certain phrases.

138
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:42,881
But you think he didn't use
a single phrase anywhere
in any of his books that he

139
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:47,990
didn't pull from something? We certainly
has. Yeah. He certainly has. Um,

140
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,380
I don't think it's the same though. I
think it's similar led Zeppelin, what?

141
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:56,520
They also had to spend countless hours
recording that performance to get it to

142
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,130
the level of awesomeness.

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,100
That way I heard that wasn't easy to do.

144
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,230
They just did a bitch ass move and they
didn't pay those people. Yeah. If you,

145
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,630
no matter what you should be attributing,
if you're taking ideas,

146
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,250
put in the footnotes,
why does it hurt?

147
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,790
It doesn't make your art worse because
then they'd have to admit they stole the

148
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,210
riff for Stairway to heaven from their
opening band. And then people would go,

149
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,870
what? And then they would
see it. Then they would look
at led Zepplin differently.

150
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,690
But you know, human beings are
fucking severely flawed. Um,

151
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,030
I don't know if I buy that with this,

152
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:33,930
this idea that you're saying in terms
of like a authors creating content.

153
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,730
I'm not trying to sell something.
No, I know, but if they are,

154
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,760
I don't think someone should be able
to copy their stuff and sell it.

155
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,300
I don't think they should either.
But what do you think they do license?

156
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,940
I think using it should be
able to do you think? Okay,

157
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,670
you should be able to decide. So if you
the content creator, you should. Okay.

158
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,790
I agree with that.
Yeah. Yeah, it's, it is.

159
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,070
I mean obviously I play
devil's advocate a lot,

160
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,200
but that's how you get to the
bottom and these conversations.

161
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:00,000
But it is a very complicated issue.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,590
The complicated issue of who you are and
why you are who you are and who you are

163
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:08,330
at this moment versus who you are a
decade ago or two decades ago. It's,

164
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,260
it's all very weird,
you know?

165
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,220
I mean you go back and think about stuff
from high school and you're like, Jesus,

166
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,750
what am I really? Even that person,
like I think about like I've,

167
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,910
I've talked to my sister about stuff that
happened when were in high school. Hey,

168
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,660
you remember that guy? And all he said
to say hi and like I was not even me.

169
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,690
Do I ever know that person? Like
is that really me? Cause I, if I,

170
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,320
if I see them again, I'll
be like, oh yeah. Oh yeah,

171
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:35,640
we had a 10th grade science
together. Oh yeah. Huh? Crazy.

172
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,580
Like I ran into a guy from my high school
like a couple of weeks ago and it was

173
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,230
weird. It was so weird. You know,

174
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,430
he remembered some strange story from
English class and I was like, wow,

175
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:47,580
you remember that? Like how weird.
And while he was talking me, I'm like,

176
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,450
is that even really me?
Like,

177
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:54,940
cause even really talking about me
because I don't have any connection to the

178
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,750
stuff that he's saying. And I
understand that he has, it's vague,

179
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,710
distant ghostlike memory
in his mind of some,

180
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:07,000
some slide images that he's pieced
together that he recognizes as a,

181
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,820
a past interaction. I
mean, it's fucking strange.
