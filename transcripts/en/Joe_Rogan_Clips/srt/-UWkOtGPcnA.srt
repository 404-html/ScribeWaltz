1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,470
Oh, Jamie, you pulled up why
Alex was band two, which is,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,700
you know,
it's not very clear that like when,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,700
when you think about the fact that
they were saying that he had never done

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,730
anything on their platform
that was bankable.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,370
And then what was the one
final thing like, and it,
Jack didn't know what he was,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,210
he got it. He confronted
Oliver, Darcy of CNN, uh,

7
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,360
in DC and for several minutes was
yelling at him while they filmed.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,900
And apparently that's my understanding
was the justification for banning him.

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,640
That he was harassing a journalist
or something that effect,

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,260
which is in my opinion, absurd.
And was he doing it on Twitter?

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,970
Um, I guess they post it to terminus,
Clive on periscope. There we go.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,180
Put her bone platform.

13
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,120
So if you do something on periscope
they could get you banned from Twitter.

14
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,280
Well that's the same thing, right?
Cause they're connected. They, yeah.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,090
I don't know at what point last,
I think it was last year,

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,880
there was like an announcement,
I saw it on twitch,

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,820
but I think it also happened on Youtube.
They like collectively said,

18
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,090
if you do something on our platform,
I'm sorry,

19
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,660
if you do something on another platform
and we see that you could lose your

20
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:08,010
status on our platform too, or a
funeral. That means public also.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,800
And we see that with with patriot,
but I don't want to deviate into patriot.

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,650
We can, we can get to that later.
But so, so I, in my opinion,

23
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,690
so it's make it makes a good point.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,710
How does Alex Jones get banned
for giving that guy a hard time?

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,550
But Kathy Griffin doesn't get banned
for literally calling for these children

26
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,180
leading a harassment campaign against
kid names of someone with millions of

27
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,540
followers led a harassment campaign.
I'm going to use their language, right?

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,640
If you're calling on your
followers to do something,

29
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,230
you are engaging in a campaign.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,030
But Alex Jones confronting the journalists
who advocated for his banning is

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,610
obtainable offense.
Here's the important thing about Jones.

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,980
Oliver Darcy said on CNN,

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,490
it wasn't that Jones broke the rules
that got in band because you know what,

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,450
what Darcy said is he's been breaking
the rules in the past. They never cared.

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,410
It was only because of media pressure.
They took action against him. Okay,

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,480
well we know many other
people break the rules.

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,030
We know fall up the accounts
have doxed law enforcement.

38
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,750
We know Kathy Griffin let of harassment
campaign. There's no media pressure.

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,920
That's one of the big problems.

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,610
Twitter knows conservatives aren't
going to be able to level any kind of

41
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,840
campaign against their platform.
There's not scared of it. But you know,

42
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,510
I often wonder why is it that as,
as,

43
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,950
as prominent and powerful as conservative
groups can be why they often lose

44
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,670
these cultural battles. And I'm not
going to say this is the primary reason,

45
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:31,200
but I will point out, do, does,
does Twitter believe that?

46
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,440
Um, you know, I often use
Sargon of a cotton example,

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,540
the liberalist anti SDW character.

48
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,800
Do they believe he'll lead a group of
liberal liberalists and individualists to

49
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:43,710
Twitter headquarters with Crowbars
and Mal toff cocktails? Of course not.

50
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,380
So what did he get banned
for? Um, my under, he, uh,

51
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,070
cause I know what is
happening with Patrion,

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
but what happens is his original Twitter
thing was that he posted an image of

53
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,060
interracial gay porn at
white nationalists. So,

54
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,470
but I, I, I don't, I think
that was the first time and
then he got banned for that.

55
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,470
He, he, well, he, then he came back
to the platform and then got, um,

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,580
I don't know what
happened the second time.

57
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,550
I think it was banned evasion
or something. The porn rules.

58
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,670
Because sometimes I'll be scrolling
through my feed and you'll just see porn.

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,120
I understanding it. It's not allowed.
I porns just not allowed. I mean,

60
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,050
what about porn star? It is, I've
heard it. I've heard it is a lot.

61
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,760
And I've heard it isn't, it's
definitely there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,570
It's like porn stars have porn.
If you go to a porn stars page,

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,710
you'll see porn on it. A lot of it.
Yeah. Like real penetration porn.

64
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,110
They don't care.
Or maybe there's,

65
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,040
there's the truce between
marked by someone that's
saying this is inappropriate.

66
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,100
And if enough people that follow a porn
star, I don't think it's inappropriate.

67
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:42,610
It doesn't then get flagged in the
system. Well, wait, this is good news.

68
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,870
I think we may have found the, uh, the
Switzerland of the culture war porn. Yeah.

69
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,620
No one wants to ban porn. The left and
the right, they're like, Whoa, hold on.

70
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,580
Hold on. It's okay. We can
ban them for their ideas.

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,970
We just leave the porn alone, you know?
But, but the point I was making is,

72
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,470
you see Antifa at Berkeley. Yeah. $100,000
with a damaged lung Molotov cocktails,

73
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:04,720
threatening people in, uh, in Portland.

74
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:09,050
Do you have a Bernie voter carrying an
American flag? These, uh, antifascists,

75
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,380
the Antifa tried stealing the flight
from him, clubbed over the head,

76
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,760
gave him a concoction,
put them in the hospital.

77
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,590
So when I see the ramifications of
iron from the left or the right,

78
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,660
what does, what do
conservatives do? I mean,

79
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:22,720
the GOP couldn't even find a yearbook
in the Virginia Governor Race.

80
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,030
I don't think they're considered to
be that big of a cultural threat.

81
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,060
They react to things. They get upset
about things that are unfair against them,

82
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,390
but they don't go through the streets
with clubs and bricks and smash windows

83
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:35,050
like Antifa and other, you know,
far leftist to do. So if they do,

84
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,610
they're considered racist.

85
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,460
It's always like some sort
of a racist mob that was the,

86
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,620
that's like the label they
get put on them, right? Yeah.
