1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,420
The joe rogan experience is that we live

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,990
into it and you're like, Yep, yeah, we,

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,160
I wish we could start this show
off with flavor and you're here.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,260
Where do we get kicked off of Youtube?
Craig Mack died. Yeah. That's such,

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
that's just a shout out. I know.
I feel like we should be able to,

6
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:27,160
just as a kicking shout out playbook.
It is a great fucking song,

7
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,950
man. It was such a good song.
Dude was only 46 what was that?

8
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,340
I didn't even see what he died of a
heart attack. Yeah. Heart failure.

9
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:38,060
46 fuck man. Major, but we start
off the show a major bummer. Yeah.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,660
We're going to go, we would get pulled
by youtube. Right? If we did that,

11
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:45,310
we played it for sure. We, I'm sure for
sure we won't play it won't play it.

12
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,340
Let's just shout out to Craig back.
You know what you could do?

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,950
You could play like someone else
who did their version of it.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,690
It should have been even then you'd
probably get there he is. Yeah. Oh,

15
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,770
this might be hard. Oh, Biggie's it. Now.
This is the, this is the, yeah, I dunno.

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,180
With notorious lol and bus
a bus. No, Shit. Awesome.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,300
Yeah. Don't, don't,

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,680
don't put that up on youtube is it already
had been up all my shit audios. Huh?

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,280
Okay, good. Ah, everybody's dying for,

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,980
everyone's got 46 is so young to have
a fucking heart attack heart stuff.

21
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,580
Yeah. That's a, that's everybody. I guess
I should have just guessed hard shit.

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,060
Well,
especially in this day and age,

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,870
the way people eat terrible. He
wasn't, was he that heavy of a dude?

24
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,810
I don't think you have to be that
heavy with dude. No clogged arteries.

25
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,600
But then there's super, super heavy
dudes that just had nothing fun.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,580
Nothing phases them.
Yeah.

27
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,140
There's some guys that just
keep on trucking that's like,

28
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:43,690
we're not in from Chicago where I'm
from. That's everybody I know. Oh yeah.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,570
Nobody skinny is offensive.
Well, not only that,

30
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:50,530
it gets zero degrees all day long.
Yeah, so fucking four months. Yeah.

31
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:52,770
You need the padding.
They need something he needed to sell.

32
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,970
You need somewhere to hide all that
sadness, shove it underneath all that.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,050
Scott has gray. You hear bullets from
the south side. And so when I got,

34
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,320
when I got in a little bit of
shape and I went back to Chicago,

35
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,350
I caught this like so much
shit for that from everybody.

36
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,580
You sell out Mr Hollywood. Oh, you look,
you look in lane eaten, eaten. Well,

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,210
we eat an avocado. Karen,
about your future. What does
it say, Jamie? What'd he say?

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,300
No, cause of death was immediately
released. Yeah. Oh No. For Awhile.

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,530
So that's what I saw. I saw they didn't
figure it out yet. Oh, I saw something on,

40
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,570
yeah. See that's a
problem. When someone dies,

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,430
you get a bunch of different
versions of the story. Yeah. Um,

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,670
I went down an internet
rabbit hole last night. Man,

43
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,900
this is a very disturbing one.

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,120
Okay.
