1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
Who attributed or some people at least
are attributing that to Gingiss con

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:07,710
killing some somewhere in the neighborhood
of 10% of the population on Earth Dam.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,150
One out of 10 he killed more people
than aids. Yeah, definitely. Right.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,040
How many people did AIDS kill it?
If you had to guess

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,190
someone was just talking
about that recently and say,

6
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:21,090
no one should die from HIV anymore.
No one should die of AIDS.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,690
It literally shouldn't have to
happen anymore. And that crazy.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,180
This take medication now we were kids.
Everybody was terrified at aids.

9
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,180
AIDS was a death sentence
while eating Twinkies,

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,630
terrified of aids while eating
that thing that slowly killing you.

11
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,630
Terrified of getting some aids.
Chubby little kid gets it.

12
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,220
Everybody who doesn't want
to go to school no more.

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,050
Remember that one kid go to school.
Yeah, the magic God in there.

14
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:50,610
But they were though, right? Magic.
Got It. I remember being in my car.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,710
I was in my car. I was living in
revere Massachusetts right here. Yeah.

16
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,544
This uh,

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,510
apartment complex and I was driving
my car and I was on the hot.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,550
I was on the road listening
to the radio like you know,

19
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,490
you see where the traffic
lights are, you see, you see,

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,380
you remember it's like burned in your
brain. Like Ah, Magic Johnson has aids.

21
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,180
What in my car?

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,160
That's what I remember thinking like it
was a scene in a vampire movie monster

23
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:24,450
movie or something like a Zombie
outbreak. Like, oh my God, now it's,

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,860
it's reached one of the
greatest basketball players
of all time. This is insane.

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,790
Are people going to just start dropping
off like flies? Now I'm going to start.

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,930
We just thought we didn't condoms right
away afterwards. I don't think so.

27
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,880
We need,
you know,

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,430
animals bro Savage,
the savage.

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,860
I mean there's a reason why
there's 7 billion of us. We stop.

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,060
People need to stop pretending
that when they're, you know,

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,060
full fully aroused that they're
thinking straight like you,

32
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:59,400
you are operating at about like 10% of
your normal resources. I see. Like A's,

33
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,740
whatever.
Who's got aids?

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,290
He still got A's after they got
rid of it with a code. Well,

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,213
you know,

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,110
it's crazy that it was just primarily
gay people in drug users that we're

37
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:18,060
getting it. It's what a weird disease
man. That's a, that's a weird one. Men,

38
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,100
that's a strange thing that you're,
you're,

39
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,120
when your body starts weakening
and shutting down like Whoa.

40
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,140
But when you really think about
the actual danger and death,

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,210
like I think even while aids was
in its height of killing people,

42
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,990
I don't think it was killing people
as much as the flu was right.

43
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,820
The numbers I'm finding now or depending
on worldwide or u s so worldwide

44
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:47,120
tuberculosis is now killing
more people than aids. But uh,

45
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,800
this says that only 1.1 million people
today in the u s are living with aids.

46
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,390
And I think I saw,

47
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,870
but living with aids, it's like
you're at the border of getting aids.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,200
Is that what it is? It's like, yeah,
you have h supposedly this and again,

49
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,140
I'm not a doctor, right? Supposedly
it's like you have HIV, your,

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,600
your immune system gets weakened.
You catch aids,

51
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,580
which is acquired immune
deficiency syndrome,

52
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,910
which means your t cell
levels have reached a certain
count where they identify

53
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,930
it as aids,
right?

54
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,340
Yeah. It actually did type in
aids and this is going to HIV. So,

55
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,150
so those that's,
they're definitely connected.

56
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:28,470
So it's not people that also their immune
system fails. That's outside of HIV.

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,970
Yeah. This, so I clicked on this,
I'll show what I clicked on it.

58
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,680
So I typed in that end, and
this is showing this, it
says at 1.2 million people,

59
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,650
I've received an aids diagnosis
since the early eighties

60
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,870
since the early eighties okay.
So 1 million people.

61
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,080
And there have been 12,000 in 2014 there
were 12,333 deaths due to any cause of

62
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,860
people with diagnosed HIV infection.

63
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,520
Ever classified as AIDS. And
hmm. What does that mean?

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,060
You had it then at 6,000 weird way
of saying it with people. Well,

65
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,903
I'll say it again.

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,960
It says there were 12,333 deaths due to
any cause of people with diagnosed HIV

67
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:12,510
infection.
Ever classified as AIDS.

68
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,370
Isn't that a strange way of saying that?
Yeah.

69
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,430
With the,
I don't know what that means.

70
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,530
You can lose it to the classification if
your immune system gets strong enough.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,490
It says with diagnosed HIV
infection ever classified as AIDS.

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,370
Okay. Are the, I don't know,

73
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,160
maybe I'm too stupid for that because
what I also saw was that a million people

74
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:37,580
died last year from it, but that'd be
worldwide. And this then contradicts,

75
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:40,790
cause it says a million people have only
been diagnosed and this is only in the

76
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,880
US and that other numbers worldwide.
So it gets really sketchy. And it says

77
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,210
thousand 721 deaths were
attributed directly to HIV. Yeah.

78
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,590
So it seems that they, they definitely
think it's still killing people.

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,740
Definitely still is,
but yeah. But what is,

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,160
how many people die
from the flu every year?

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,830
What do you, what do you would you
think would be the most, the route,

82
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,300
most ruthless,
normal killer would be the flu.

83
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,360
The flu would kill the most people 36,000
way more way more people got jacked by

84
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:16,810
the flu every year,
every year.

85
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,770
And what was the number from the
aids number was total. Right.

86
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,730
How many of those people that flu shots
though? What is it? How many of those?

87
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,250
And then 2014 so it's a third or so.

88
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,640
So what's a third aids to the flu.

89
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:35,450
AIDS is about one third of the
deaths of the flu per year.

90
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,430
Ish on average.
I don't know

91
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,810
that.
Interesting.

92
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,840
It's like we're not scared of the
thing that kills us from way more.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
We're really scared of the thing that
kills less people because it kills him

94
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:51,890
through butts. Eggs. That's what it is.

95
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,000
It has to be,

96
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,720
we're terrified that it kills people
through sex because like the flu,

97
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:59,510
it is like we should really be
concentrating on that thing.

98
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,660
That thing's killing way more people.
People not washing their hands,

99
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,990
but they're like, look, we can't stop
that, but we can stop off his buttocks.

100
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,980
Weird. Right. It's weird, like when we,

101
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,370
maybe it's just because it's a new
thing that was killing people because it

102
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:20,530
didn't exist and then it did exist.
That's probably what it is, right? Yeah.

103
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,000
Like yeah, because it came out of
nowhere because it was in like,

104
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,760
what was it during the 80s and the
Eddie Murphy is dead and you're walking

105
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:32,960
around with the A's on your lip.
Oh, was that, was that delirious?

106
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,160
Do you remember Sam kinisons bid
on it? He goes, they say, Sam,

107
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,430
you shouldn't make fun of AIDS aid.
Sam has a communicable disease.

108
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,110
Straight people can get it too.
He goes, name what name? Hey Fuck.

109
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,680
It's not our dads.

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,120
He had this crazy dangerous bit about
it and like way back then like whoa.

111
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,280
It's like a cro in around like 1980
I don't know if that's accurate,

112
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:03,240
but so 1980 was the highest peak in
thousands. So yeah, it seems like the low,

113
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,410
it seems like it seems
like late seventies right?

114
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,260
Is that somewhere around
1980 the one thing too,

115
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,830
I read that there's around 300,000 total
deaths and a third of them are in New

116
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,650
York,
300,000 total deaths,

117
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,610
a third in New York and the flu.
And this is all told ever.

118
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,090
Again,
the stats are all on multiple pages.

119
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:26,090
So here's how many of them I see.

120
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,090
I get so confused about all this shit
because some people believe that a lot of

121
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,440
these people also are shooting heroin.

122
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,460
A lot of these people were also doing a
lot of drugs. I would wonder, you know,

123
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,400
if they're really partying hard
and they also get aids, I would.

124
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,450
I would always wonder like how much of
you partying hard is destroying your

125
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,470
immune system too. Like if
you're, if you have a disease,

126
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:53,210
like say you have cancer
and you're struggling with
cancer and you just decided

127
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:57,110
to hardcore start smoking meth
and then you die from the cancer.

128
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,850
Like is it doesn't, didn't
something else kill you too. Right.

129
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,140
Not saying that the cancer is good
for you. Cancer certainly bad for you,

130
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,490
but if you have cancer and you just
decided to go on a meth binge and destroy

131
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,730
your immune system,
it's got to contribute to your health,

132
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,480
but we don't consider that.
We all consider up. They'll
fucking cancer. Got Him.

133
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,720
Cancer got him. It did get
him. It definitely did get him,

134
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,130
but he was also smoke and
math all day feeling good.

135
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,330
Doing robberies,
robberies with fucking skulls painted on.

136
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:32,630
It's getting more fights at
seven 11 yeah, man, he was amped.

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,910
Dude was amped with cancer.
That's, that's also,

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,050
I mean if he dies of a heart attack,
I all the cancer gave him a heart attack.

139
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,010
Yeah, probably that probably had something
to do with it. Definitely was not good.

140
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,390
It's definitely not good to have cancer,

141
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,900
but it's also not good to be smoking
math while you have cancer spoken. Beth,

142
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,580
that bat,

143
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,580
so how many of these people that got aids
were like extremely healthy folks that

144
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,710
like jogged on a regular basis and ate a
lot of fruit and vegetables are hard to

145
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,100
get that data. Yeah, I know.
I would like to get that data.

146
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,910
This is not like a prejudice perspective.
I'm just as a curious person,

147
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,170
I would like to get all that.

148
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,570
I would like to know what is it
that actually does it? Is it,

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,600
is it the math that kills you?
Is it a d a disease that kills you?

150
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,920
Is it a combination of all these things?

151
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,170
We always want to attribute
death to one thing,

152
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,390
but I would imagine that with all
the people that have died of the flu,

153
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:27,630
there's certain, there's a number of
deaths. We look at the flu. You're like,

154
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,060
man that the flu could just catch you.

155
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,940
The flu could just catch you and you know,

156
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,320
catch you when you're already week
two, maybe your, your rundown,

157
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,310
you've been working too much and then the
flu hits you when your immune system's

158
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,070
devastated and it gets deep into you
and gets you. I, everybody's vulnerable.

159
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,070
I mean the, the thing about diseases
that so strange to me, he said,

160
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:51,360
some of them are associated with certain
certain groups of people like aids.

161
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,570
Like AIDS is one of those ones.

162
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,490
It's just so associated with gay people
that it's like a really politically

163
00:09:56,491 --> 00:10:00,150
charged disease and we concentrate
on it like really heavily.

164
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,260
But I think it, I really think it wasn't
just the gay thing was also that it was,

165
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,010
it was new, new, there was a new thing
that was killing people that day.

166
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:09,570
We were always worried about that.
Right.

167
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:14,010
There's always these pandemic movies
were some new crazy disease breaks loose,

168
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,080
just runs ramp and we don't
have an immune system for it.

169
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,810
People are start dying and they need to
get the medication to the people and get

170
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:23,640
it to the baby quickly. Ah, we
made people saw a subways, SARS,

171
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,960
just always some shit like that.

172
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,520
We're all SARS of some new shit that's
going to get us swine flu, chicken flu,

173
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,270
so that, well, so aids had a duel,

174
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,920
a disadvantage one that is connected
to gay people and people are like, oh,

175
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:41,760
what are they doing over there? What are
they not going to get it? I'm not gay.

176
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,690
Yeah, exactly. There was that and then
there was also, well blood transfusions,

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,640
car accidents. That's right. Right.

178
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,950
People were worried about
getting from blood transfusions,

179
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,320
so that means back then they were never,
they were like,

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,290
they were just letting random people
donate blood without checking it.

181
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,050
I don't think they had a
test for and for awhile.

182
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,290
I think for a while they didn't have a
task for it. Then they have to find like,

183
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,560
I guess they have to find like antibodies
in your blood or some shit and like,

184
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,250
Ooh, but it's so weird that
while this is all going on,

185
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,400
how many people were dying from cancer
every year just from smoking cigarettes?

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,700
It's fucking crazy numbers.
Crazy numbers.

187
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:17,940
People dropping like flies
and no one thinks about that.

188
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,260
When you see a guy smoking a cigarette,

189
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,340
you don't think that guys killing
themselves. You're like, God,

190
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:25,320
he's outside and for the restaurant and
having a cig normal shit. Now that guy's,

191
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,530
that guy's poisoning it himself
like a guy who the weak livers.

192
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,910
But it's just strange to me.

193
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:34,590
Like we get really specific about what
fears we have in terms of what way we

194
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:37,020
die.
And when a new disease comes along,

195
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,270
that becomes like one of
the most specific ones.

196
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,700
But while you're indulging
in all of these behaviors,

197
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,260
that will also kill you in way
larger numbers than diseases.

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,060
It's fucking weird, man. It's very
weird. But human beings, me included,

199
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,620
were so strange.
