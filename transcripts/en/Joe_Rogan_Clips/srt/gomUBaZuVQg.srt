1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,130
This is going on today in China.
World Cup kiss sparks,

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:08,250
social media debate on sexual
harassment in China. Hello. Why? Uh,

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,450
so he's a male reporter
in these two Russian fans,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
gave him a kiss while he was recording
and it's caused like a reverse sexual

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,340
harassment debate and transparently
it's a big deal. Wow. He looks so,

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,990
what's a big deal that in China,

7
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,310
someone like you're not allowed
to show public affection like fan.

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,840
Is that what the big debate is?
Here's the,

9
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:31,870
it came after a bunch of female
journalists have been assaulted and so,

10
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:34,320
so they started assaulting
the dude the other way around.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,980
I'm going to go out on a limb. He's
going to be okay. He looks fine.

12
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,790
It looks actually better than kissed
on the cheek by attractive women. Um,

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,680
they're not hurting them. They can't
rape him. I think he's going to be okay.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,790
Let's watch on boy get mauled
by these hot Russian broads.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,980
Here it goes. Wow. Kiss.
Nope, nothing. Nothing.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,230
He's fine. He's laughing. Okay. We're
done. He's laughing. We're done.

17
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:06,090
Stop. This. People are fucking crazy. The
guys laughing. He thought it was cute.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,110
Yeah. Why would anybody make a deal
out of that? It's a zero tolerance.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,700
That girl literally had a
plastic Red Cup in her hand,

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,250
which is the universal sign for
being fucked up in public. Yeah.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,740
If you got that Plastic Red Cup in
your hand, that chick's probably lit.

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,350
She kissed that guy.
He thought it was cute.

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,860
They didn't move them around
or push them or assault him.

24
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,130
It was a friendly gesture on
the cheek. That's love. I think.

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,770
Why are we trying to shut down
people enjoying each other?

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,920
I don't think we are anymore.
I think I think things are actually,

27
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,240
think things are getting in
a lot better place in it.

28
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,290
Just all in the media it seems like
they're not. Sometimes you know,

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,243
we'll take that.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,850
That seemed like the not the fact that
someone's making a big deal out of that.

31
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,560
That's true.
You can't look,

32
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:52,290
you can't compare that to a bunch
of guys doing that to a girl.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,160
It's not the same. It's not
devastating. The guy's going to be fine.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
It is different. Men and women
are different. In that case.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,490
That is a very clear cut case
of no one got hurt there.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,850
Did they interrupt his broadcast?
Perhaps?

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,060
Did they ruin what he was trying
to say and I don't know what.

38
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:12,990
He might've had a serious message and
these caught Russian brides come over and

39
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:13,860
kiss him on the cheek.

40
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,720
Maybe they fucked up his little project
and what he's trying to accomplish. Yeah,

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,040
but there's no crime there. That's
not a crime. It's not the same.

42
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,350
If there was a bunch of dudes
doing that to a pretty girl,

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,240
some gorilla looking fucking football
player in her fucking corn Fed Iowa boys

44
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,140
came over and kissed her would be
like, Ooh, what are they doing?

45
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,260
You remember when they were trying to
make it a big deal because Katy Perry

46
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:41,570
kissed some guy on American
idol. Yes. Remember this is
like two months ago, right?

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,480
She kissed some boy and never
kissed a boy. She gets him.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,430
She brought him over and kissed
him and there was like, oh,

49
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:51,170
well what if worth Katy Perry who was
a man? What if that was a girl? Yeah,

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,740
she's not stop.
She's Katy Perry.

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,720
And if that guy's really complained,
that Carrie Katy Perry, her kids are my,

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,970
I was still using my cares for
someone brought that to me, dude.

53
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,620
No one's going to love you.
Shut the fuck up.

54
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,300
If you can't appreciate Katy Perry
kissing you. Oh, she's pretty too,

55
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,040
was pretty. And more people will love
that man because Katy Perry kissed him.

56
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,200
Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry.
Oh,

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,500
he shut down the Katy Perry backlash.
He kissed her to listen.

58
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:26,530
Nothing wrong with that. Looking
at, first of all, homeys gay, right?

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,290
Is He looking at him?
He could be from Idaho,

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,700
which she got shot him and he fell down.
That is not a male movie. That's not, oh,

61
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:38,200
he could be. Okay. It might
be that he's avoiding,

62
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,340
uh,
uh,

63
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,430
that kiss until he really did find the
woman that made him feel like you want,

64
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,970
wanted to be kissed. And maybe she stole
that from him. Yeah. See right there.

65
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:49,510
Right here.

66
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,510
Imagine if a 33 year old male artists
tricked in 19 year old female auditioner

67
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,020
do a kid like Katie pair. Well, imagine
that's a different thing. You fuck.

68
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,130
How about you?
Imagine that's a whole different thing.

69
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,430
I don't pretend to men and women
are the same. You fucking assholes.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,500
Imagine a Volkswagen. Fuck your
stepmom. You know what I'm saying? Oh,

71
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,530
magic.
Now think about your dad does.

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,640
What are we doing? This is stupid.
It's just the same thing, man.

73
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:26,080
It's just fucking not the same thing.
Everybody's okay.

74
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,840
That Chinese guy was laughing, man. Oh,
he probably jerked off to the video.

75
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,720
The House multiple times.
