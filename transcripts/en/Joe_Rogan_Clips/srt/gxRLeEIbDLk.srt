1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,050
Do you go to mass on
Christmas? No. No Mass at all.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,820
I go to Willy Wonka's golden chocolate
factory. Wow. It's all nonsense, man.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,683
Why would I do that?

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,990
I remember I'm just asking tradition
because he grew up that way. No,

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,560
I never grew up that way. You
didn't, you were a kid. Yeah, we did.

6
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:19,590
But it was for a very short amount
of time to say I grew up that way.

7
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:23,400
It would be hard because it was, I was
out by the time I was at a first grade.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,790
Oh yeah. We're talking about
putting me back in for second grade,

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:31,400
but we moved from New Jersey
to San Francisco and uh,

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,050
we didn't find a Catholic school.
And Catholic schools costs money too.

11
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:40,470
You know what? The public school after
that, but I was just done. I hated it.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,560
I was in fear of those
fucking crazy people.

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,800
And your parents didn't take
you to church or make you good?

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,470
They did a little bit. I think the idea
was back then, that if you had kids,

15
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:51,660
he wanted kids go to Catholic school.
You know,

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,540
there's a lot of people that did that
in that neighborhood when I was little.

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:58,260
It was just a normal thing you did. Yeah.
And they were more strict and to dude,

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,450
one thing that was for sure though,

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,860
like I had a conversation with my mom
about it once, she was like, you know,

20
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,200
your grades were way better when
you went into your Catholic school.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,650
And I was like, yeah, cause it was
fucking terrified to get wrong.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,260
They beat the shit out of you want to
live like that. They never beat me.

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,420
They definitely threatened
me. Really? Yeah.

24
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,220
They threatened to make
me sit on the nail.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,810
I'm going to have to sit on a nail and the
uh, in the closet, stay here all night.

26
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,920
I hope you brought your blanket.

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,250
They're like really mean when you're
like a little six year old kid.

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,140
Like that's fucked up.
It's just a weird, oh this,

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,100
we stuck with these people
for nine months and to also,

30
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:35,850
for me it's like my parents
are splitting up at the time.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,560
So it was very confusing and then I
wanted things to have order to them.

32
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:45,500
So I wanted God to make sense. I
remember annoying people with that. Yeah.

33
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm like six years old. I didn't annoy
people talking about what God wants.

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,440
What do you mean? Like you,
God says this, God wants that.

35
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,820
Like I would say that six years old
because I was a little kid who was dealing

36
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,850
with my parents splitting up and there
didn't seem to be any order in the world

37
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,620
and it was very nervous. Right? So when I
finally, when I went to Catholic school,

38
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,730
when I first got there,
I was,

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,040
I was happy that it was going
to go to Catholic school.

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,930
But then as I experienced it

41
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,950
at six years old, I started
going, this is ridiculous.

42
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,830
This doesn't make any sense. I'm like,
first of all, these people are so mean.

43
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,580
They're, they're obviously being mean
and nasty. They're not comforting.

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,390
And I was thinking as a six
year old comparing them the
way like my grandma was,

45
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:31,740
and my mother was like, these are,
these ladies were nasty and so mean.

46
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,760
And I'm like, these, they don't represent
God. And I was like, this is crazy sex.

47
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,810
And then you could see kids getting in
trouble because their parents hadn't paid

48
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,330
for their lunch or this guy
and it was like this really,

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,760
you tell your father to get that money in.

50
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:49,290
Like there was a weirdness to it that
just didn't seem loving or it didn't seem

51
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,210
like what I thought of when I thought of,
you know,

52
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:54,690
Christ and when I thought of
it seemed to me like, oh no,

53
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:58,440
this is a dark little trap.
Get sucked into.

54
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,960
That's what's remarkable about
that is not just the age,

55
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,080
but that you went from a really,

56
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,470
really needing it in a very
real way because what was
happening with your family

57
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,670
to like normally you
wouldn't turn that quickly.

58
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,690
Like within a year it
sounds like, or two. Yeah,

59
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,520
it was over by the time
I was out of there.

60
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,521
Usually that change doesn't happen for
1520 years outside of beating me or doing

61
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,550
something sexual to me, the, this,

62
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:32,080
the mind fuck of dealing with those mean
nasty ladies scare the shit out of me

63
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,460
crying and they were calling me a baby
cause I was crying. I was like, whoa.

64
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,670
It's just not knowing how to
deal with human beings. Yeah.

65
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,810
When you're a six year old and
this is going down and you're like,

66
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,650
what have I done?
Yeah.

67
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:46,750
Like I went from always being with
my mom or being with my grandma,

68
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,400
my grandfather. I was
like, everything's cool.

69
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,070
And then all of a sudden you're going to
school and this is what you're doing in

70
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,670
school. I didn't go to
kindergarten. I went to first grade.

71
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:55,060
It was the first thing I went to.
Right.

72
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:59,050
So all of a sudden the first grade is
like instantaneously being connected to

73
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,460
these crazy ladies. She's,
I was like, oh no poor.

74
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,450
And then I would think about them.
I don't think what kind of like,

75
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,100
and I was thinking about
why this will mean,

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,200
I remember being like six years old
thinking this right. I'm just like,

77
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,190
nobody probably loves them. Like they
don't get, they don't have a family.

78
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,780
I have a boyfriend. I didn't think at
the time they don't have a girlfriend,

79
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:23,200
but maybe they do Holla. Right.
But for sure they didn't.

80
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,070
The whole thing was that they didn't,
you know, they didn't have anything.

81
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:32,071
No connection with another human being
to be lonelier or more angered inducing.

82
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,830
Yeah. It was just dark. They
weren't, they weren't loving people.
