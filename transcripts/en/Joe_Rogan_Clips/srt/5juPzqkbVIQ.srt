1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
Is wack. Yeah. Bella tour.
What is a ballad tour? I
have no idea. I have no idea,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,281
but I'm,

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:07,560
I feel like you can kind of feel the
difference in their promotion when you go,

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:08,880
they're getting bigger and bigger.
Right.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,820
But you can feel a difference
when you're there of course.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,130
But you see the talent that's an
then you're like, oh shit. You know,

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,410
and they got goldy over there now.
I Ms. Golden Oldies.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,460
I saw him when I was there. He's
always, always puts a smile on my face.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,470
I love energy. I miss him. I love Jon
Anik too though, you know, and, and um,

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,720
you know, I just think they just don't
have the funds that the UFC has. Yeah.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,180
It's just,

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,100
they don't have the deep pockets or the
UFC and the UFC has been around for so

13
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,530
long. They just know how to do it.
They've just made the right moves.

14
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:41,880
And we looked, there were these p and man,
that's so crazy. Amazing. I'm so awesome.

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,631
When that was signed,

16
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,990
I was so pumped just to see what it's
going to be in five years when been

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,100
fingers with ESPN,

18
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,740
like how much we're going to be
on TV and the shows they're doing.

19
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,450
They're doing this thing to that.
It's like a,

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,090
not only are they going to fall the
winter around after their fight,

21
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:58,830
they're also gonna follow the loser around
to get into your life. I mean, yeah,

22
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:00,510
it's going to fucking suck.
You think about it. It's like,

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,780
I don't want a camera follow
me around a fire hose,

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,090
but they want to see how it affects
your life. Like, like me, I've been,

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,900
I mean obviously I've been pretty pissed
off about it, you know? Right. Like me,

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,000
if I wasn't staying busy with
my businesses and my family,

27
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,730
like I would lose my mind. You
know, like I would like to see that.

28
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,370
Like say Brian Ortega after
he fought Max Holloway,

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,380
he goes into that fight looking on
beatable and gets just, just touched up,

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,390
you know,
Max Holloway just touched them up.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
We really got to see who the fuck
Max Holloway is after that fight.

32
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:32,580
And his distance control and
just pace and output everything.

33
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,380
He's just a champion. He's just a
fucking champion. His mindset down. Yeah.

34
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,980
He's just a champion. Gangsters,
gangsters. They caught me. I love it.

35
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,640
He's so gangster or tag is as tough as
they come to him and he just wasn't ready

36
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:49,410
for that yet. I think he will be
man. Like he's was saying like that.

37
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,940
Like I have a camera
phone around after loss.

38
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,660
Like I think he's looking for new things
now too. That's what I mean. If you're,

39
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,600
if you're a guy that takes a loss and
you don't branch out to do new things,

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,410
you're never going to get better.
Well his Jujitsu is off the charts.

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,400
When he grabbed a hold out co cubs neck
when he got the Doris at the end of the

42
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:07,480
first round was like, Holy
Shit, it's over. Yeah.

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,410
But the bell rang and he got out of it,

44
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:13,170
but then the sac around when he jumped
on him and grabbed that key guillotine,

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,590
he went over the top of him like other
extended up in a clinch and got it and

46
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:19,650
then came down on it. And then
had it in the air. It's nasty.

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,480
His technique is so fucking sharp.
And he could do that with everything.

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,680
I mean armbars trying, he's got like
a good squeeze cardio too. Oh yeah.

49
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,120
Well you know what, he's,
he's real legacy Jujitsu.

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,230
He comes from,

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,260
you know that Henner and here on camp and
you know from that's Horian school and

52
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:44,070
were hoist was from, that's the
torrents crew. I mean that's,

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,880
that's right from the fucking
motherland. But that is, and you know,

54
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:52,830
there's a term that some people get
offended by that term is basic Jujitsu.

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,780
I'm not offended by that at all because
some of the very best guys of all time,

56
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,990
whether it's hodge,
Gracie or Hixon,

57
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,100
you don't see them doing like weird stuff.
It's all very standard.

58
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,880
It's not, I mean there's basic striking
yeah. At Max Holloway beat or take it,

59
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:13,740
he was basic striking to beat
him. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

60
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,650
I mean basics win national titles
and wrestling 100% a high crotch,

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,700
100% you know, a sprawling stand behind.
But it's the level of the basics.

62
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,830
And this is what I was going to
say about Max Hallways Jujitsu.

63
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:26,650
It's like the level of his basics.
He's just,

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,940
it's so fucking polished.
It's like as a,

65
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,040
as a person who loves martial arts,
for me,

66
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,770
when I see someone who's technique
is that sharp, I'm like, whoa.

67
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,700
That's what I want to tell people.
This is why I get frustrated.

68
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,450
When I see people that are on their
back and they're in the open guard,

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,180
there are,

70
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,750
their legs are just kind of sitting
there flailing away and the guy's got his

71
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,810
arms on the ground. I'm like, Jesus
Christ, he's, he's giving arm bars.

72
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,800
He's giving you all my plots
as he's giving you a sweep.

73
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,580
He's setting himself up and
people don't know what to do.
