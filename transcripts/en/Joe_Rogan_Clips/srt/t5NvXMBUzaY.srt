00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,490
Hello Freak bitches. Um, you know,

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:09,491
just to flip to the other end of the
spectrum in terms of what like coevolution

3
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:15,911
between two different species to
be like over the last 20,000 years.

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,571
Look at what we've done.

5
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:20,210
We've taken wolves and you've
turned them into these creatures.

6
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:24,800
We put Halloween costumes on and
like a finding a couple of years ago,

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:28,910
which floored me.
This hormone oxytocin,

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,840
which is totally trendy.
Oxytocin is completely cool.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,880
Mother infant bonding is mediated by
oxytocin pair bonding in monogamous

10
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:38,714
species.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,870
Oxytocin makes you more trusting and
expressive and generous and economic games

12
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,820
and oxytocin has all these pro
social effects within a species.

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,380
Then it turns out that this hormone
that has spent the last, I dunno,

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,850
a hundred million years,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,790
having mothers and infants connect
to each other emotionally. Um,

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,870
when you and your beloved dog sit
there and stare into each other's eyes,

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,370
you both secrete oxytocin.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,780
And if you pump up oxytocin
levels and your dog,

19
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,580
it will stare at you longer and you will
stare longer back, be more oxytocin.

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,860
This is like an ancient, ancient hormone
having to do with mother infant bonding.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,300
And in 20,000 years, which is like
a blink of an eye evolutionarily.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,340
Suddenly we're doing this weird oxytocin
tango thing with another species,

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,820
another species who we feed and take care
of and they like manipulate as wildly

24
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:41,900
and to like get him like good dessert,

25
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:46,640
treat bones and stuff like that and they
in turn do all sorts of one for stuff

26
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:50,230
for our self esteem because they
like lick us unconditionally.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,180
Where'd that come from?

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,610
I just 20,000 years and you've like hijack
this ancient neuroendocrinology about

29
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:05,021
like parental behavior and now it's got
to do with this weird symbiotic thing.

30
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,730
We end wolf was worked
out somewhere back on him.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,220
What does it have any
effect on friendship?

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,050
Like a human being staring at each other?
Did that, does anybody ever tested that?

33
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,290
I would assume people have looked at that.
It,

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,470
for example,

35
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:26,471
it strengthens monogamous bonds and
there's a literature by now looking at

36
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,460
oxytocin has its effects by
binding to an oxytocin receptor.

37
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,820
There's a gene for the oxytocin receptor.

38
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,510
It comes at a number of variants and if
you have one particular variant that's

39
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:40,520
associated with Oxytocin,

40
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:45,470
having less effective women move in your
nervous system that's associated with

41
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,670
less stable relationships.
Uh, so you know,

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,340
none of this stuff is
deterministic. Your, your,

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,230
your sex life and your romantic life has
not been determined by this one gene.

44
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:01,510
Like nothing remotely resembling,
but that's just part of the mix.

45
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,960
And there I was just wonder if that makes,
applies to like platonic friendships,

46
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,060
like male bonding and stuff.

47
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,790
I wonder if there's like when
guys are out having a good time,

48
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,300
if they're also getting a good
juice of oxytocin. Might guesses.

49
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,750
When you have your,
your basic like pathetic male sociality,

50
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,760
it's just like you've like talk about
sports for five minutes with some guy and

51
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,810
as a result, you're willing to give up
your life for him because like, you know,

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,920
this is male, male body. I bet that's
got something to do with oxytocin.

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:39,840
Okay.
