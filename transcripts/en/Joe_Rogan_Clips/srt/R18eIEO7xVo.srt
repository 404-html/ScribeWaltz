00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,230
Trey, my daddy Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day here.

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,070
Put this hat on and take a
picture with me. Here it is.
Eddie Bravo, Tony Ferguson,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,480
Habib number. Go metal off.
Holy Shit. Holy Shit. This
is the couple of weeks away.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,170
You're going to be there for
that Eddie to be awesome.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,240
It's going to be fucking nuts, man.
Dude, we're doing getting mean. Tony is,

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,720
that's,
that's an exciting fight man.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,570
I know we can't talk about
strategy but um, it's uh,

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,980
it's crazy fight between the number one
and the number two contender in that

9
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:32,814
division.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,620
The obvious strategy for Khabib is to try
to take Tony Down and obvious strategy

11
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,340
for Tony is to keep it up
and got him up on his feet.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,920
That's the obvious and everybody
knows that. Let me think.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,280
How much do you think,
uh,

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,330
like opinion changed when he got clipped
by Michael Johnson and got wobbled?

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,780
People are saying, and I mean if you're
looking at, I mean it's pretty obvious.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,100
Okay. He, he, he, he's human.
Yes. That's really what you saw.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,460
How he saw as exactly cause for 24 fights,
five or 23 fights before that. Right.

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,180
[inaudible] and motherfuckers
basically sad guy.

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,330
He's not one of those guys
that can take anything. Right.

20
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,430
You know there's guys out there
that can take any shot. Yeah.

21
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,900
They haven't been rocked yet. Right. We're
seeing a little, maybe a little chink,

22
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,260
a little tiny Cenk. Everybody's
looking at that. You know what I mean?

23
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,910
It's going to give people confidence,

24
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:27,360
but he's so good at taking
people down and mauling him.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,130
You know that that is the hardest
thing to stop. But you know,

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,690
we're doing everything we
can to prepare for the best.

27
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,850
The worst, the worst case scenario,
the best center we're, we're doing not,

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,590
I mean Tony's doing everything really.
Tony is a fucking,

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,480
he's a maniac is the most fascinating
fight in the division for me outside of

30
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:52,580
Conor McGregor versus I beat those
two fights. Conor McGregor versus IB,

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,270
even Tony Ferguson.
Versa could be.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,510
Those are the two most exciting
fights that in my opinion,

33
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,520
without giving anything away,

34
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:04,521
everybody knows based on the past
that Tony can seriously choke people.

35
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:10,671
Anybody out like any in any wrong move
on the ground and he could hit that Doris

36
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,760
from any position and he just,

37
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:19,410
it just keeps growing and
growing and expanding and he's,

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,280
he's become so unorthodox on his feet,

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,080
on the ground is pulling guard, flying
him a nice, he's all over the place.

40
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,010
He's doing gymnastics. He's doing
flips. He's doing, he's doing

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,130
what he's doing. I don't even really know.
I tried to do it in big bear. I'm like,

42
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,820
ah,

43
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,820
he doesn't steal bowling ball and he
does all this crazy like almost like

44
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,660
dancing does with it.

45
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:49,470
It looks like you brought a
wing Chung dummy up to big bear.

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,280
He's into wing Chung. He's into
everything. Everything man.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,870
He is a true side. That wasn't like
a joke that when he's really into it,

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,150
he likes, he trains, uh, like
no one I've ever seen before.

49
00:03:02,151 --> 00:03:05,170
It just hours and hours just
out in the front up in big bear.

50
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,520
He built everything, the bags, the
stands, everything. He builds everything.

51
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,510
He's got a house out there.
He's the ultimate macgyver. No,

52
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:14,230
he rented it and built it the first
two days. Brought it all out, dude.

53
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,820
He's like the ultimate macgyver,

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,180
a construction carpenter
McMahon would take down.

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,500
Just seems so damn do when I
put my hands on her, you know,

56
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:30,300
like when I put my hand when
the interviewer her back
is like glaze and t bowels.

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,940
Yeah. She she gorilla.
Yeah. She's stupid. Strong,

58
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:38,320
strong woman's stupid strong Olympic
silver medalist. Right? Yeah.

59
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,440
See this. Here's Tony working
with that. The weighted ball.

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,200
It's just so what a
weird way of working out.

61
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,030
Like he does all these
strange moves with it.

62
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,010
Like did you ever ask him like what
his philosophy is? Philosophy is, uh,

63
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,600
obviously he believes in
movement training, you know,

64
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,210
cause this is all just like
some crazy yeah. Capa where uh,

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,190
but with a steel ball, he's
co doing this all day. Yeah,

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,370
he does just, we always
just mixes it. Oh yeah.

67
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,910
He's always doing something for
people trying to sync this up at home.

68
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,970
It's round one. I'm sorry I didn't
do this for the first fight.

69
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,980
Round one three from tron over three 50,
two,

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,850
three 50 triangle task. That's
a wrap. Sam. Sara McMann.

71
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,680
He just pumped that girl Bass Gorilla
squished her. Yeah. You know what?

72
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,710
She's helping her.

73
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Maybe she may be the first girl Jesus
that's known for taking people down,

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,840
passing their guard and choking
him out like that that go to,

75
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,810
you got to stop that fucking,
what did she say?

76
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,430
I don't know. What the Hell is she
saying? She's fucking scary. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,180
One of the girl does that take some down
passes that garden chokes on can choke.

78
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,690
She could be. That could be
your shit right there. Well,

79
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,670
you know she got tagged by Amanda Nunez.

80
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,470
Choked out herself like her stand up.
She has power and it punches.

81
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:00,790
She's a big power puncher,

82
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:05,230
but she doesn't have the kind of power
that Nunez as Nunez is going to be a real

83
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,600
problem for post guys.
She might not need it.

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,580
The way she closed that arm triangle.
It's so professional. She's, she could,

85
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,060
she could take most girls down and because
of a ruffling she understands she's a

86
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:23,050
finisher. She can't keep her
husband's a Jiu Jitsu black belt.

87
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,830
Yeah. Isn't he a, I believe
he's a Jujitsu instructor.

88
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:28,000
She did it from the mount to yeah.
Very interesting.

89
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,780
I saw total she's pumping that grow up.
That's what she's doing.

90
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,730
He's coach telling her she's going
to be going to be all right. I had,

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,920
I had some doubts about her early cause
she said some things about Jujitsu.

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,740
When she first came out to the UFC,
the judge, she didn't like Jujitsu.

93
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,150
She doesn't train digits
or something like that.

94
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:48,090
She was like old school wrestler type
of mentality. But it looks like she uh,

95
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,510
finally, um, had our mind opened, you
know, that was some good, that was good.

96
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,140
Solid guard passing wrestlers just don't
pass God's like that unless they train

97
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:59,720
Jujitsu, you know, wrestlers, some
wrestlers never learned how to pass.

98
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,980
The guard kind of seems like
that's a thing of the past
though, doesn't it? Yeah.

99
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,041
No,
exactly.

100
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,560
That's why I was kind of worried cause
she would say something like that.

101
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,940
She was saying, I don't train
Jujitsu. Go wait a minute. It's 2017.

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,100
Everybody needs to train Jujitsu.
If you're fighting in the UFC. Yeah.

103
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,640
Do you have to love it?
I never heard her say that.

104
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,970
Did you would see if you can just sign up.
When did she say that it?

105
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,220
Was it like real early, early on, man.

106
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,210
She did say something that she,

107
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,160
something to the effect that
she hasn't liked Jujitsu. Well,

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,390
my, I guess being early, early and
it's an old school wrestler mentality,

109
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:39,230
that's all. No big deal there. She ain't,
she ain't the only one like that. Exactly.

110
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,890
There's still Russell's like that and
there's been a bunch that were famous to,

111
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,221
well,

112
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,640
there's a always a bunch of people that
get super attached to their style that

113
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,040
they started out with and you want
to prove that I don't blame you.

114
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,320
I don't blame. The rest was,
look what happened. Hawaii's
shows up. Everyone, these,

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,920
these Midwestern wrestlers
are looking at this.

116
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,330
Who's this little Mexican kid choking
everybody out beating us and they're,

117
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,870
they're doing challenge matches and
great. They're like, fuck these guys, Huh?

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,580
How are they going to take me down
and do that shit most, you know,

119
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,800
most of the rest of his that I ended
that are like that. They don't,

120
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,520
they do that because they're fucking lazy.
That's what it says.

121
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,140
That's what it is because they're,
they're,

122
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,780
they're so good at
wrestling and they just,

123
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,790
I just seems like it's just a,
it's a,

124
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,770
a weird like lazy thing for one because
it's extra work in too because you're

125
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,700
going to get fucking choked out.
Investors don't want to lose, right.

126
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,110
It's that kind of thing where it's hard
for wrestlers to progress. Hey look,

127
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,860
I think it stems from,

128
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,890
it stems from the Gracies coming out
challenging everybody and beat him.

129
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,470
Getting wrestlers. Uh, Dan,
Dan Severn gets choked out.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,320
Mark Coleman's coming in more homeless,
wasn't trying to pass the guard.

131
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,300
He was trying to beat
Jujitsu to hold you down.

132
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,870
But it also stems from the
same thing is with kickboxers.

133
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,150
Kickboxers don't want
to train Jujitsu either.

134
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,670
I mean that was always the
problem with certain fighters.

135
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,120
They just didn't want to get tapped
because still good standing again.

136
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,010
That's from the UFC cause you also saw
the strikers getting taken down easily

137
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:02,300
and getting choked out easily.

138
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,090
So right away dude has been
training 15 years striking thinking,

139
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,470
fuck these Jujitsu guys.
Fuck though.

140
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:10,280
I want to learn a little take down the
fence. And I'm a fucking knock 'em out.

141
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,750
Well that's learning it.
Fuck learning. And I'm alert.

142
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:16,430
Some take down the fence and I'm still,
I'm going to still knock us cro cop.

143
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,500
So I mean back in the day not to stand up.
Even this whole,

144
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,940
even this whole thoughts on the cage
and his training in different, you know,

145
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,060
you're like, no man, you,

146
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,400
and then that was wrestler versus striker
that that rivalry when you eat gorge

147
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:36,230
bulb changin fought Mark Kirk.
Are you kidding me? That,

148
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,900
do you remember how that fight went down?
Mark Change can cracked them. Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,270
Mark and mark curb took him
down at will and then got tired,

150
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,760
would never pass the guard.
Never tried passing the gods above.

151
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,970
Changin had a decent guard.
He had a good survival guard.

152
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,620
He had good guard recovery
and Mark Curtain, uh,

153
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,350
admittedly never worked on passing.

154
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,630
He just felt that he could just
stay on the garden pound somewhere,

155
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,750
but you couldn't do it.

156
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:02,070
Devolved chance involve changin kept
tying them up and then late in the round,

157
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,710
late in the fight,
he couldn't take them down anymore.

158
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,860
They were both on their feet marker was
folded and that's when you go to vote.

159
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,630
Changin lit him up. Remember that?
It was very interesting back then.

160
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,740
If marker would have just spent day one,

161
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,260
once he decided to do MMA, let me get
rid of their passing and mountain. Okay.

162
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:23,640
But we'll, but in all fairness,
that was the least of his problems.

163
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,850
That guy was on a million different drugs
that documented this smashing machines.

164
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,790
Crazy or it didn't matter. I didn't find
out what exactly he was doing. Like, whoa.

165
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:35,910
Like that guy was fighting the toughest
fighters in the world while he was

166
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,830
shooting heroin. I mean, he was,

167
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:41,700
he was shooting like all sorts
of Carol and I didn't know that.

168
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,020
Did you ever see this smashing machine
who shooting up opiates shooting now he

169
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:48,500
was. It was all pharmaceutical
grade. You know,

170
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,070
painkillers raised all the steroids
and stuff. Crazy documentary.

171
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,550
You never saw number this. Yes, but I just
remember the steroid part. That's all.

172
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:01,230
That was nothing. He was slamming
painkillers and it was fucking veins.

173
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:04,320
And he just sitting there and
letting them film the whole thing.

174
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,450
Like fucking yes, exactly what I
was describing for. But you know,

175
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,780
fresh bottles of whatever
painkiller he was fucking taking,

176
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,410
but judging a straighten his arm,
it's,

177
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,370
they thought when they were filming
him that they were filming the baddest

178
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,530
motherfucker on the planet earth
and they were like, oh my God,

179
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,600
we're watching this guy
right as he falls apart,

180
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,410
like right as the filming started
beginning, he was falling apart.

181
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,500
Here it is Tony Ferguson.
So here's the sleep, boom.

182
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,510
[inaudible] boom. What's going on? It's
going to be very hard to take down.

183
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,010
And if Khabib takes him down,
he's gotta be really worried about them.

184
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:41,820
Chokes that we've already seen. Yes.
So He's, he can just take down Tony,

185
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:46,680
like he did Michael Johnson and not worry
about legit chokes from all sorts of

186
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:51,680
pricing. It's, it's all in the
transition. So it tends to,

187
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,680
in great Marcella teens, if he raps,
he's always looking for Darcy. So, uh,

188
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,590
could be, you know, he's one of
the best grapplers in the UFC.

189
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,370
No doubt.

190
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,470
He may be the best at at grounding and
pounding and controlling you like a,

191
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,020
like a legit high level black belt.
He passes.

192
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,380
Who knows how it's going to
match up against Tony Man.

193
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,200
But we're preparing everything we can.
We're doing everything we can.

194
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,660
I don't know how it's going to
look when it's all said and done,

195
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,870
but we're doing the best we can to
prepare for the worst case scenario.

196
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,980
Who knows what's going to happen.
But uh,

197
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,010
the one thing's for sure is one mistake
on the ground and Tony's going to wrap

198
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:35,190
your neck goes yes, but this
motherfucker as well. I mean,

199
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,780
one mistake on the
ground and Habib number,

200
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:39,900
good Madoff's gonna fucking break
your Ross. He's, he's a freak.

201
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:43,170
And that's why this is so an interesting,
because Tony is a freak too.

202
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,730
And like when you see Tony fucking up
Hofeld dos Anjos here. I mean, man,

203
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,570
Tony Ferguson easily could have been the
UFC lightweight champion of the world

204
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,070
if he caught Hofeld
Dosantos when dos Sandra's

205
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,280
had the bell, he coulda
got 'em and you know, Tony,

206
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,870
I think Tony could do that to anybody.
How did the, how did he beat, um,

207
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,230
Barboza was he, did he just choke Barboza
yes. Yeah. He dashed him, right? Yeah.

208
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,590
That was it. Right here. I'm standing
and I'm finished him off on the ground.

209
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,490
It was perfect.
Tony.

210
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:12,610
Something special and that's why this
fight is so interesting because hubby was

211
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,410
obviously something special.
He's the only guy that's in a,

212
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,510
a contender that has been fighting the
best guys in the world and is undefeated

213
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,710
as you fight for the title. That's
so unheard of. Yeah. One or two.

214
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,250
Everybody's got early in their career,
they've got a fight or two that they lost,

215
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:32,251
but he's one of the very few guys that
has only shown one moment in his entire

216
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:36,400
career inside the octagon where
he really didn't look so good.

217
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,430
And that was a brief moment
where Michael Johnson hit him.

218
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,810
Obviously he recovered from that and it
came back to that mashed him smashed out.

219
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,970
He just,
when he gets guys on the ground,

220
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,070
it's almost like he's a
different weight class than them.

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,870
Yeah.
There's levels,

222
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,930
thousands of levels of being heavy
and he's super heavy sticks on.

223
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:00,290
He's a great guy. I saw him in
person at my fight. That fight,

224
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:04,640
the law supposed to happen is passing a
big his passing to from full guard or to

225
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:09,641
like open guard right into he
forces a m a z guard or a quarter z.

226
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Like right away there's movement to set
up the half guard that he's going to try

227
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:19,970
to pass. Brilliant. His knee slice is
brilliant. Uh, his mount is control.

228
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,470
That crucifix move, man. He's
a black. Everybody knows it.

229
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,970
Very few people do it. Yeah, he's, he's
always looking for it and obviously he's,

230
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,700
you know, if you look at his earlier
fights, he's got triangle chokes.

231
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:35,810
I mean he could finish off your back too.
Yeah, he's right. So that's a tall order.

232
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,230
Tall order for Tony.
But believe you me,

233
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,910
Tony is looking pretty damn good
to me right now on the ground.

234
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,020
So it's going to be crazy.

235
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,850
What is he and how it all plays out.
Yeah. I'm so excited for that. I'm,

236
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,080
my head's going to explode.

237
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,890
Yeah.
It's a crazy fight and it's,

238
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,330
it's going to be more crazy for you just
got so much invested in it. You know,

239
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,240
for me as a guy that gets to
sit there and call that fight,

240
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,770
I'm fascinated just because when you
see a guy like Tony Ferguson, you know,

241
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:09,230
he's a problem.
Like how do you solve that problem?

242
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,140
Like what's the solution to that problem?
And um,

243
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,240
I don't know what the answer to that is.
You know,

244
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:18,830
I would say a guy who can keep the fight
standing up and tee off on him and land

245
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:22,490
good strikes like maybe a guy who takes
advantage of the aggressive style,

246
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:26,660
that number go Madoff has, but
you know, maybe Tony's that guy,

247
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,613
it's going to be interesting

248
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,810
as, as um, Michael Johnson show. You can,
you can punch him, you can't hit him.

249
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:36,480
If you can land a good shot, you can
rock them. And I think that, you know,

250
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,120
that's going to be the main place to
catch him. But if you can catch him,

251
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,930
keep on the outside,
you know,

252
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,430
you don't want a guy like
that who fights at that way,

253
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,980
that good at grappling and that could
arresting and take downs and constant

254
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:51,400
pressure in your face the whole
time he got to keep him outside. No,

255
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,360
I think it's only tall enough
to do it because again,

256
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,170
seeing how small could be was
last weekend I was like, man,

257
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:00,110
he's not that big of a guy.
You know? I'm a huge fan of it.

258
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:04,970
I think he's fucking awesome. Bobby
think whiskey walks around big 75 maybe,

259
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,740
maybe, you know, he just didn't see,
and you know how the Russians traveled?

260
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,760
They're always in groups
of fucking a hundred. Yeah.

261
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,670
So it's always entertaining and they're,
they're fucking hilarious.

262
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,230
But he just didn't seem that big at
all. I was like, wow. Huh. So that was,

263
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:19,850
that was the only thing that
shot him because he's so strong.

264
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,120
Okay.
