1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,870
From the animal level to the plant level,
to the fungal level.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:08,020
You find these things
everywhere. Um, you know, um,

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,390
and people say,
well,

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:13,620
there's about 150 species
of plants that contain DMT.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,640
That's only because we've only looked
at 150 species of plants. You know,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,070
if you look at these large genera
that are, that are, you know,

7
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:28,071
famous known for having tryptamines
like Acacias and my most and on these

8
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:32,250
things, uh, we know of a
few species that have DMT,

9
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:35,580
but there's hundreds of species,
thousands of species.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,610
It's just that nobody's looked,
nobody's going to fund this work.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,730
I think you can reasonably say that,
you know,

12
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:46,731
there are about 1400 species
of Acacia in the world.

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,980
Probably 75% of them have DMT.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,580
And actually I would go to the next,
I would,

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,590
I would even claim without evidence.
That's never stopped me before.

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,340
But I think it's reasonable to suppose
that because DMT is so close to

17
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,060
mainstream metabolism,

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,320
probably all plants
have DMT to some extent.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,120
Most don't have large,
large levels of it.

20
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,200
They don't have useful amounts of DMT.

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,230
But if you took with
sufficient instruments,

22
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:24,231
if you just started ranting randomly
sampling plants and analyzing for DMT with

23
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:29,310
the Mass Spec, I'll bet it would
turn up and almost everything.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,370
What is a, which is it? Filovirus grass.

25
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:36,150
It's toxic to sheep because
that's CMT. Yup. That's the one.

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,060
So the DMT in it for whatever reason,

27
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:43,530
way it interacts with the sheeps digestive
system, it becomes poisoned. The, well,

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,330
no,
not entirely.

29
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:48,750
I mean it's got Phil Harris Grass has DMT.

30
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,980
It has five methoxy DMT.
Other trip to means.

31
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,100
It also has something called Grameen,
which has a,

32
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,580
it's like DMT with only one
carbon on the side chain.

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,920
Grameen is more or less toxic. Graming
shows up in a lot of grass species.

34
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,540
That's probably the thing that causes
what's called FileVault staggers.

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,660
So if you just fed DMT
a synthesized to sheep,

36
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,630
it wouldn't be toxic.
Hard to say.

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,100
Did they produce monoamine
oxidase? Nobody's done it
to shape. Yeah, of course.

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,280
So do leopards or jaguars all mammals.

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,180
So when you see those jaguars eating
the leaves and then tripping their balls

40
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,790
off, rolling around in their back,
what do you think is happening there?

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,210
You've seen those videos. I've seen, I've
seen those videos. Well for one thing,

42
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:41,520
many rare eating, uh,
banisteriopsis right,

43
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,990
which is the source of the Mao inhibitors.
Right.

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,210
And I don't know what to make of that.

45
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:53,010
It certainly does seem like some kind
of a catnip for them and caused us an

46
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:57,600
altered state for Mao inhibitors in,
in and of themselves.

47
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,470
They produce some sort of a psychedelic
experience. Uh, they can, um,

48
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,800
not just from the Mao inhibition,

49
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,730
but they often have other effects
that are psychoactive, like harm,

50
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,460
harming Armenia is a good example.
You know,

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,130
we used to think that
harming was basically,

52
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:19,660
it's the Mao inhibitor and Iowaska and
then doesn't do a whole lot beyond that.

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,940
Well, it turns out now harming
this, getting a second look.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,070
It's interesting that the
tar mean, uh, you know,

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,510
was discovered in began,
I'm Harlow about

56
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,210
maybe 10 years before Iowasca
was ever reported to science.

57
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,320
So harming is one of these hoary
old alkaloids. I like to call it,

58
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,310
you know,

59
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,020
it's been known forever and now we're
just finding out it has all sorts of

60
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,980
interesting pharmacology's it's it,
it's an Mao inhibitor for sure.

61
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,210
More importantly,

62
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:57,211
it appears that it stimulates neural
genesis and that's relevant to Alzheimer's

63
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:01,270
and brain development.
And even down syndrome.

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,720
It is an inhibitor of this kinase,

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,780
this regulatory protein called Dyr k
one which has got its fingers in lots of

66
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,730
different cellular pies.

67
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:17,590
You could pile it many different
regulatory, uh, functions.

68
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:22,090
And harming is a very potent,
very selector inhibitor of this kinase.

69
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,510
So that's relates to this.

70
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,130
It actually stimulates nerve
growth in the hippocampus.

71
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,390
So, uh, you know, we're, and,

72
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,470
and we're finding out that there are
a number of other receptors that it

73
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:41,740
interacts with, including
Serotonin, dopamine transporters,

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,690
even one called the imagine
lean receptors that are, uh,

75
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,270
you know,
of undefined functions.

76
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:54,130
So like most natural molecules,
it's not a one trick pony,

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,020
you know, um, harming
has a number of effects,

78
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,680
you know,

79
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,570
and that's why taking Iowasca
is a different, you know,

80
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,990
it,
that's why it's not a pure DMT experience.

81
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:11,440
Cause you've got a whole
mixture of alkaloids that are,

82
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,720
that are contributing to that effect.

83
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,710
Who were the researchers that
when they discovered harming,

84
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,670
they didn't know what it was and they'd
try to label it telepathy mean to,

85
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,960
they realize that it was
harming. Right, right. Well yeah,

86
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,380
this is part of the,
uh,

87
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,870
what you may call the, the, the,
the sad and sordid history of the,

88
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,330
of Iowasca.
Yeah.

89
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,420
In a certain way because
in the early days,

90
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,800
in the 20s, when people
are looking at it, um,

91
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,830
a number of independent groups, we're
working on it. And they were identified,

92
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,310
they were isolated molecules.
They weren't aware of other people's work.

93
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,850
And so they misnamed these
things. Know, I mean, uh,

94
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,350
I can't tell you exactly,

95
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,940
I think initially it was Louis
Lewin who discovered, um,

96
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,400
uh, are mean and he called it bend
the story. And then that turned out,

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,240
well,

98
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,680
another group years before had isolated
the same molecule from began I'm Hormel

99
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,110
and telepathy in was one of
these misnomers that came out.

100
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,300
The problem with with this was that
back in the day people didn't collect

101
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,620
voucher specimens.

102
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,750
So a lot of this chemical work was
done without the benefit of her barium

103
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,531
specimens,

104
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:38,531
which now every everybody that wants to
do fido chemical work hopefully has the,

105
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,430
the good sands to collect specimens of
the original Platte so that people can go

106
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:46,700
back and look at that.

107
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,950
A lot of this early work was reported
and there was no voucher specimens to

108
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:57,200
document the collection.
So a lot of it had to be dismissed,

109
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
you know,
uh,

110
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,050
they cut the Beta carbon lean chemistry
of banisteriopsis didn't really get well

111
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:09,520
defined until, um, some
Chinese scientists, uh,

112
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,530
or at least they had Chinese name worked
on them and discovered harming tetra

113
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,440
hydro harming and the harmer
lien as the main alkaloids.

114
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,220
They could reference that to
botanical voucher specimens.

115
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:26,270
So they really should get the
credit for discovering it.

116
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,860
And then once that was done,
then it was known. And you know,

117
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,930
other scientists had to acknowledge that.
Why did they describe it as telepathy?

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,610
There was supposedly some sort of a story
about some group telepathic experience.

119
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:45,110
Yeah. This was just romantic. This
was just some story, you know,

120
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:49,580
out of the literature. Um, yeah.

121
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,450
I mean, I mean it, it was rumored
to be able to cause telepathy,

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,930
but this wasn't Iowasca they
were only taking hormone.

123
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,520
It's not clear. It's not
clear. It's not clear. Yeah.

124
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,370
I mean they may have been taken
but they may have been taking it,

125
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,650
but whether they were getting telepathy,

126
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,760
I kind of doubt it when we know
we could get telepathy on Iowasca.

127
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:13,760
It's not so uncommon.
It happens all the time.

128
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,480
People have group hallucinations,
group visions.

129
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,190
Has anybody ever bothered to
independently like sequester people,

130
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,830
put them into like different rooms,

131
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,040
have them do Iowasca and then have them
describe a very similar experience are

132
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:35,561
almost identical experience to prove that
these telepath he experiences exist or

133
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:40,550
at least to as far as I know
that hasn't been done. See, yeah.

134
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:44,730
Cause everybody wants to talk afterwards.
It's like I do see the dragon. Right.

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,340
I don't think that's been done. That
seems like a worthy study. Cause if,

136
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,390
if I've heard from more than one person,
uh,

137
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,980
in fact my friend Kyle
Kingsbury and his wife

138
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,080
had an Iowaska experience with a,

139
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:03,081
both had a visualization of their child
and then when they got back she was

140
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:08,940
pregnant and they want to having this
child from their visualization from,

141
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:12,580
from, from this experience. Um,

142
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,420
obviously they're very close and
they were together and they probably

143
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,640
communicated quite a bit. And, you know,

144
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,040
I would just think it'd be
really interesting experiment.

145
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,680
It would be very interesting. I mean,
and that sort of points out there is,

146
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,590
you know,
a realm of experience,

147
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:33,591
a realm of knowing that these things give
access to that's normally close to us.

148
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:38,440
I mean, that's kind of a
trivial statement of course. Um,

149
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,020
but then you get down to questions
of how verifiable is that?

150
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:47,160
How real is that? How uh, you know, and,

151
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,830
and people get,
um,

152
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,420
I don't know if the term is hung up,

153
00:09:52,421 --> 00:09:55,420
but they can get baffled
when you start talking about,

154
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,840
you know, the reality of say the
entities you encounter on DMT.

155
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,380
I mean this is,
this is uh,

156
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,430
some people I know are obsessed with
trying to verify the reality of the

157
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:13,050
entities that you find on DMT.
And again,

158
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,220
it comes down to if you experienced
some, they're real. Yeah.

159
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,640
If anything you experienced is
real because you've experienced it,

160
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,940
does it have a corresponding
existence in the external world?

161
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,050
Well, you know, what's external?
Let's internal, you know, we, we,

162
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:34,220
we throw around these terms,
these,

163
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:39,110
these epistomological metaphysical
terms quite carelessly,

164
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,420
you know,
without really thinking about it.

165
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:46,130
What does it mean when you say
I'm in here and you're out there,

166
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,851
you know,

167
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:50,840
and then you take a psychedelic and you
realize that start official boundary,

168
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,320
you know, we're all one,
there is no separation.

169
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:58,220
It's separate in normal consciousness
though it's separated in normal conscious.

170
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,390
But then what is normal conscious if
not a reflection of year neurochemical

171
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,810
brain state.
I mean,

172
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,840
everything you experience is an altered
state because it's filtered into this

173
00:11:10,121 --> 00:11:14,050
brain processed by the brain and you know,

174
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,660
the brain is a biochemical engine
that, you know, as I say, often

175
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,190
we're made out of drugs,

176
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,220
but it seems that our normal consciousness
is the best state to propagate

177
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:28,010
biological life and to keep our,

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,030
our whatever we've created in terms
of our community structures and

179
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,350
relationships and friendships and the
ability to build structures and houses and

180
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,790
things like that.
These,

181
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,940
all these things are done best
when you're here and present.

182
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,930
Whereas when you're on a psychedelic
state, I agree with you. Well,

183
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,220
the way I've always described it as,

184
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,370
if you had a meeting with God and you
went and God gave you all the answers to

185
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,970
the world, you, you experienced, uh,

186
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,430
undeniable beauty in the most extreme
form possible where you couldn't have

187
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,520
imagined it and then you came back
whether you hallucinated it or not,

188
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,400
it's the exact same experience.
Exactly. I can't put it on a scale.

189
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,330
You can't weigh it.
You can't,

190
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,640
like we've stretched the tape measure
around and God is 47 inches across like

191
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,290
just because,
you know what I'm saying?

192
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:22,040
Just because you can't draw and
measure it with what we term our, our,

193
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,120
our, you know, our metrics for reality.

194
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,860
Right? And that is exactly the, the thing.

195
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,590
Don't worry about whether it's real
and the way we would define real.

196
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,990
Is it good information or is it bad
air, is it not? That's the thing.

197
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,560
It doesn't matter where it comes from it,
it's such a fits good information.

198
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,590
Then it has its own internal validity
of whether it came from some part of

199
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,180
yourself that is normally obscurity.

200
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:56,200
You or it came from the plant teacher
or the aliens transmitting it through.

201
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,930
It doesn't really matter. But
we, we are obsessed with that.

202
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,320
We are in reality because we think
we're being fooled a lot. Right? Like,

203
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,690
and this goes back to
Terrance's Lacera era,

204
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,520
a psychedelic experience
where he had a Ufo encounter.

205
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,860
The easily dismissing amongst us would
go while he's tripping his balls off on

206
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,850
mushrooms. Of course I saw you. Oh, is
there a leprechaun drive in the UFO?

207
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,430
Like all that's nonsense, right, right.

208
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,900
Easy to dismiss. Yeah. And in fact,

209
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:30,390
that is the nature of these phenomena.
That's what's really interesting,

210
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,890
easy to dismiss.
You know,

211
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,410
that that was another aspect
of the experiment of the
La Truro I left out when I

212
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,700
was talking about my lecture.

213
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:43,701
But there's almost always an element of
absurdity in these experiences and in

214
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,750
paranormal experiences. In UFO
encounters, it's like little green men.

215
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,090
Yeah. Are you kidding? But right.

216
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,060
The fuck there are little green
man and little blue man. You know,

217
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:03,460
a guy you should, uh, have on the
show. Maybe you have already, uh,

218
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,210
is uh,
Whitley Strieber.

219
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,300
No, I haven't had them on,
but he's so out to lunch. Um,

220
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,180
I have massive reservations.

221
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,390
There's a video of him
looking at a fly in that flow.

222
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,470
Clearly a fly flies in front of a camera
and he's describing it as this a man in

223
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,080
a suit and it's like,
like there's something wrong with him.

224
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,210
Well, I missed that. I missed that part.

225
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,950
I think what's interesting
about Whitley and I agree, I,

226
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,430
I totally dismissed him, you know,
for a long time I thought, you know,

227
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,110
he is really a nutcase.

228
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,750
He's from the communion books where
people don't know exactly what a series of

229
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:45,770
books about being abducted and yeah,
but

230
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,060
I sort of have to change my
opinion somewhat because,

231
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,770
and uh, um, uh, Jeffrey cry poll,

232
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,960
who I do know,

233
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,480
is it Jeffrey Cripe bill is a professor
of comparative religion and mythology at

234
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:03,680
Rice University.

235
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,910
And his focus initially is sort of on the,

236
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,730
the Superhero as, as in contemporary, uh,

237
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,590
you know, mythology as a mythical
figure on that sort of thing. He, and,

238
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:21,880
uh, I was invited to, uh,

239
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,260
a simple, uh, you know, a workshop
that Whitley was going to be at.

240
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,230
This was a couple of years ago in Hawaii.

241
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:34,640
While I'm always interested in a free trip
to Hawaii, right? So I said, I, you know,

242
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,610
I like to come to this thing,
but this guy is a nut case.

243
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:41,570
I'm not sure I want to appear on the same
stage with this guy. I mean, if it's me,

244
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:46,330
say that, you know, he
said that cancer and,

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,290
and um, you know, and, and the, the
guy who was hosting it said, well,

246
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,800
you know, did you know that he and
Jeffrey Cripple wrote a book together?

247
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,710
And I said, oh, I don't, I said
that, I know Jeffrey cry bill.

248
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,620
I know that he's not on that case.
And that's interesting.

249
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:05,060
And then I found out about
the book and I said, I,

250
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,260
I told the guy,
if you invite Jeffery and Whitley,

251
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,110
then all come and we'll participate.

252
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,590
The name of the book is
a supernatural two word,

253
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:20,030
supernatural,
a new vision of the unexplained.

254
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,050
And it's really very interesting.
Um,

255
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,100
the book is basically,
you know,

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,740
alternating chapters.

257
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,300
Whitley tells us stories
about what happened to it
and what has happened to and

258
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:39,230
what continues to happen to him. He
lives in some kind of alternate reality.

259
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,100
I I t I get that. I mean, I don't
know if I accept it, but I get it.

260
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,380
And then in alternating chapters,

261
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,520
Jeffrey comes along and
kind of unpacks this and,

262
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,510
and explains where does this fit
into sort of the, the, you know,

263
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,140
phenomenology of mythology and,
you know,

264
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,590
reasonable explanations. And, uh,

265
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,570
and it's a fascinating book.

266
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,980
If you just suspend disbelief
for a minute, think about,

267
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,020
assume that Whitley's is sincere.
I don't think he's lying.

268
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,520
I think that these things really
happened to him or he thinks they do.

269
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,290
And some of the most craziest
things, these are not, you know,

270
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,210
the media has made like everything,
they dumb it down, you know,

271
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:30,500
and they put it into the box
of alien encounters. Guys,

272
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:35,330
a nutball, uh, you know, and they dismiss
it. But if you take a culture look,

273
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,660
one thing to Whitley's credit is he
doesn't claim to understand what's

274
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:43,680
happening. He doesn't call it
an alien encounter. He does,

275
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:46,520
doesn't play me anything.
He just says this is happening.

276
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,220
I have no frigging idea what is,

277
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,480
what this is. So that's
all honest. You know,

278
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,570
that's an honest scientific stance.
I do not understand this phenomenon.

279
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,110
So I give him credit for
that. And then he, and,

280
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,300
and Jeffrey wrote this book.
There was a very interesting, uh,

281
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,450
you know, later on, so I read
all this later on in the book,

282
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:15,451
there's a chapter where they get to what
is the possible physical explanation of

283
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:22,880
what's going on here. If there
is a physical explanation
and one of the headings,

284
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:27,881
I think the chapter one of the headings
and the chapter was labeled the soul as

285
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:32,150
a Ufo.
And that kind of blew my mind.

286
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:36,870
That got my attention. Because,
you know, when I did this,

287
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,550
this workshop with them, I was kind of
bringing the flag of psychedelics, right.

288
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,980
And I was saying,
if you don't aggress psychedelics,

289
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,750
you've only got part of the
picture here. And uh, and they,

290
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,880
and they were talking about how the soul,

291
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,470
how this could be some sort of a
physical plaza moy type of thing.

292
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,290
They were in woking, you know, scientific
terminology. I don't know if it was,

293
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,000
it was legitimate or not,
but just the idea of the soul of a Ufo.

294
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,390
And I was able to respond to
that and say, well, you know,

295
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,570
the experiment at La
Chorrera was essentially the
blueprints of how to build one

296
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:18,670
of these things that you're talking about,
you know,

297
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:22,120
which it was really this,
this transformation.

298
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,080
And so that was,
that impressed me.

299
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,910
I don't know what to make of it.
That I think, I think there is,

300
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,450
and they don't really know.
Nobody knows what to make of it,

301
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:39,130
but I think they're just
odd things going on. Um,

302
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,390
but that some people experience yes.

303
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,560
And uh,

304
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,620
and whether they are actual encounters
or dreams or somewhere in between.

305
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:58,650
I'm not sure. It would be
cool. It would be good. I mean,

306
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,960
yeah. I don't know. I mean, when you,
when you, when you meet with Lee,

307
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,130
have you ever met him?
No.

308
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,140
He is like the most drab
person you could imagine.

309
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,620
I mean,
he's like an accountant.

310
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,480
It's probably worn out from telling all
these stories worn out. Yeah. It could be.

311
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,690
Could be. But he was, but
he was a fiction writer.

312
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,520
He was a fiction writer.

313
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,840
And then he comes out with this
incredible real world story.

314
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,380
But he reads like fiction and I,

315
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,220
there's obviously something off when
you talk to him or you hear him.

316
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,360
I've never talked to him personally,

317
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:36,760
but when you see him in
interviews and conversations,

318
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,020
there's something off you now.
What is that something off?

319
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:44,950
Is it a psychotic break? Is it something
that drifts in and out? Is does he,

320
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:49,870
is he having problems with normal? I
mean I don't, I don't know what it is,

321
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:53,770
but I'd thought I'm really needing to
find that video of him talking about the

322
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:58,090
fly. Did you find it?
Oh thanks. The flies,

323
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,750
a man and a fucking space suit. He's like,
it's not a man in a suit. What is that?

324
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,910
And I'm like,
oh Jesus.

325
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,350
Two with lunch called the bed
with quite a few of those.

326
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,830
There's quite a few really
bizarre videos of him. He like,

327
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,740
he's having a hard time
with normal reality.

328
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,880
So which would make sense during the
dream state cause all of these things are

329
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:21,490
happening at night. Right,
right, right. This was the,

330
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,740
this is the big thing that I've always,

331
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,220
the big problem I've always had about
these UFO abduction experiences.

332
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:28,030
First of all,

333
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,550
they all take place when
someone is either, uh,

334
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,490
at night.

335
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,610
It's either they're on a dark road
where there's no one around and they're

336
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,040
sleepy or they're at home and their bed,

337
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:43,090
like the vast majority of them take place
at night or while someone's lying in

338
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:46,150
bed,
which is exactly when you're dreaming.

339
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,920
Right now we don't totally understand
the dream state, but we, there's,

340
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,600
there's a connection,

341
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:56,680
at least an implied connection between
psychedelic chemicals that your brain

342
00:21:56,681 --> 00:22:00,130
produces endogenously that could be
released during the dream state and in

343
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,050
different levels with different humans.
I mean,

344
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:06,070
obviously some people have problems with
producing serotonin and dopamine and

345
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:07,870
then other people have
no problems with it.

346
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:11,760
And this biology of the human
brain varies, right? Right.

347
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,890
So it's not without considerate or it's
not without possibility that there's

348
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,690
someone who has a real issue with
these chemicals just busting through.

349
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,590
Right. Flooding their, there are,
yeah. Oh wait, no, there are people.

350
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,510
I've then does this mental illness,

351
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,680
but then does this contradicts what
we've already said about psychedelic

352
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:34,371
experiences?

353
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:38,780
Like why would we diminish his indogenous
psychedelic experience if that's what

354
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:39,920
he's having?
I mean,

355
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:43,040
it is entirely possible that
you're dealing with someone
who may be perhaps does

356
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,480
have some sort of psychotic breaks,

357
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,780
but also is experiencing
psychedelic experiences due
to some endogenous DMT dump

358
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:51,740
or dump of whatever.

359
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:56,110
And all these things are taking place at
the same time in the dream state during

360
00:22:56,111 --> 00:23:00,850
heavy rem sleep and he's coming back
with his uniform stories of alien

361
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:01,684
abduction.

362
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,640
Yeah, no, I agree. It's, it's, uh,

363
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,970
I mean it's hard to Parse it out
and I'm not saying I accepted all,

364
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:14,280
but I, uh, it's easy to dismiss,
but maybe you shouldn't write.

365
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,030
Well there may be,

366
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:21,031
is something there we should approach
it in the spirit of here's a phenomenon,

367
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,850
right? We don't understand
that. We shouldn't dismiss it.

368
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:30,230
There's something to be understood here.
Not necessarily his understanding of it,

369
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,900
but something to be looked at there.

370
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:36,410
And I thought this book was
interesting for its balance. You know,

371
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,590
I would not have Whitley Strieber on your
show without Jeffrey cry. Yeah. Show.

372
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,580
That was the thing. Cause he,
it would be fun and maybe it's,

373
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,350
you know, maybe it's a bridge
too far and I'm not sure. Yeah.

374
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,740
Maybe then maybe we get to the
bottom of this thing. Yeah. Well,

375
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,260
is there something to be got to the bottom
right? That's where a bottom at all,

376
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:04,220
just one man's delusion or is there
really something at the base of it.
