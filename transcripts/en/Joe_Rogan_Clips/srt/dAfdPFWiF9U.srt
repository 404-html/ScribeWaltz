00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,660
These are called sea org members are
not talking about average Scientologists

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,320
and explain,
explain to me to see,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
because was that established when
l Ron Hubbard was evading taxes?

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,710
[inaudible] ship?
Yes.

6
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:18,711
And He created this ship called the free
winds and whatever that ship called the

7
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,880
free winds.
It is called the free ones now,

8
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:25,360
but that's where they deliver the highest
level of of Scientology, their Ota.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,010
So when you get to Ota, you got to
get on the phones. But before that,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,980
I don't know the name of his boats,
but I think it was called the Apollo.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,060
That was a part of going clear. That
was hilarious. When, um, who was it?

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,960
One of the writers are one of
the, the Haggis. Yes. When he,

13
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:44,370
we received like the highest level shit.
That wasn't even the highest level.

14
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:48,210
It wasn't even, that was OT three.
Really? Yeah. And uh, and when I read it,

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,300
I literally, you know, you
have to go into a secure room.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,540
We just want to talk us through
that. What is that? First of all,

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,850
you have to get invited.
You have to get an invitation.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,650
So you'd been Scientology for years.

19
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:02,760
You'd spend a ton of money around
of my most cited, by the way,

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,080
most Scientologists don't even get to
this most. Most don't. Right? Yeah.

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,690
Cause you have to be wealthy to get to
this knowing you have to be wealthy.

22
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,640
But a lot of times what they do
that the new scam is you got to go,

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,970
you get to a level and then they go,
oh we messed that up.

24
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:18,600
You have to go back down at your expense.
Right. You have to Redo that part.

25
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,030
You were talking about that
on your show. Yeah. Yeah.

26
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,250
So then there will rewrite some new
thing and now David Miscavige rewrites

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,260
things and says he found it in a vault
somewhere and we all believe it baby.

28
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,530
Honestly, we all believe it cause we want
to believe it. So it talk me through,

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,440
so you go through this rigor level. Did
you get to OT five? Oo, yeah. Close.

30
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,150
Yeah. Yeah. Cause um, I uh,

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,180
I got it to a sauna when, so you to
get to this advanced level, this is,

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,190
it's called advanced levels. Right?
Right. Uh, you are put through the ringer.

33
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,840
They go through every folder.
You know,

34
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,540
from the moment you walk into a church
of Scientology, they have folders on you.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,820
Everything you've ever said is written
down and an and videotaped. Okay. So they,

36
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:08,180
they um, they get your folders and
they, they call it, they call it,

37
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:09,710
they go through it.
Okay.

38
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,490
And they go through every transgression
or you still humping your pillow.

39
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,460
Are you still, uh, you know, a nasty
ass home to your mother? Like they,

40
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,970
they go through everything.

41
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,450
Are you still connected to this person
who says something bad about Scientology

42
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,500
20 years ago?

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,010
So they make sure that you're
eligible to get the advanced data?

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,800
And where do they bring you?
Your Room? Where's it at? It's a,

45
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,200
it's on l Ron Hubbard way in Los
Angeles and fountain. It's cool. Hey,

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,390
how nervous are you? Are you freaking
out? Oh my God, I can't wait.

47
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,600
This happened only all the Shit
I've put up with all my life.

48
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,810
It's finally going to be answered.
All my questions of life.

49
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,460
We're going to be answered in this moment.

50
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,220
And you realize this is the moment
you're going to get the sacred documents.

51
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,770
So my mother, yeah, so
because I'm a celebrity,

52
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,620
they let my mother come in and she
was also higher level than me. Right.

53
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,660
So imagine I'm in this like double like,

54
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,810
so you go through one door
and the security and then
you got to get to land new.

55
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,050
Did you like it? You got to get like
clearance. You got to go take a picture.

56
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,480
You've got to sign documents and
say, if I ever reveal this, uh,

57
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,380
it's going to be $100,000.
You know,

58
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,680
you don't ever get to read any legal
document that Scientology gives you.

59
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,900
So you just sign things. You know, you
just, they say sign here, sign here.

60
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,990
It's like today what you did here.
So I don't know.

61
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,250
I could be married to you was for
all I know when I signed today. Um,

62
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,110
I like how you shook your
head. No, you don't need to
shy. Okay. So you know comedy,

63
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,630
you don't deny Joe.
So I don't know why he keeps denying it.

64
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,900
That's how you step up coming
another notch. Got It. You deny,

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,510
oh wait, oh, I didn't get the
memo. Ah, okay. So there's
what we're doing now. Okay,

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,530
got it. Um, so okay,

67
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,260
so you went to her room,
the secure room,

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,360
they take your photo while
they give you a folder,

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,860
you have to get a briefcase that
only, you know, the uh, co two.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,880
So you go up to the window, to the Aao
window and you hand them your briefcase.

71
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,600
They scan your briefcase and they put
the materials in the briefcase and they

72
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,940
close it.
They turn it back to you and you lock it.

73
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,160
Then you attach the briefcase to your
body. I'm not fucking with him. No.

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,220
Like with a little clip like it has
to be physically connected to, right.

75
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,190
So when you go pay, you
have, correct. Okay.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,230
So you get a briefcase,
they go, go to the,

77
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,370
go down the hall and use your thing,
and you're going to get led into one door,

78
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,230
and then you're going to go into another
door and then you're gonna go into the

79
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,340
course room as it was called. So you
go into the three doors or two doors,

80
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,930
whatever it was,
and sit down.

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,590
You open up your briefcase and you
read the material for the first time,

82
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,290
the answers. So my mother sitting there
in front of me, okay, she's so excited.

83
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,310
Understand that like, this is what you
want for your kids. Like you're like,

84
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,210
they're getting up the bridge and
they're getting the answers to life.

85
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,710
So when they come back next lifetime,

86
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:59,500
they're not going to forget everything
and they're not going to be as fucked up

87
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,710
as they were when they were,
you know what I mean? Like it's,

88
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,660
it's really a proud moment,
you know?

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,140
And so my mom's sitting across from me
like so excited and I'm reading this,

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,590
that my body is made up of other beings,
my body,

91
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,580
my whole body,

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,220
my thoughts and everything are mixed in
with these other beings that are make up,

93
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,210
compose my body. Okay. Are
you following me with this?

94
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,190
What's your understanding of it?
Your body's made up of other beings.

95
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,460
Every, every everything.
My thumb is kind of pose,

96
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,130
maybe not the nails, cause they're
acrylic. Your, your skin's other banks,

97
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,270
everything. Everything like
thousands, just here. Just

98
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,240
my thumb is as a person is, uh,
is being trapped into this body.

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,220
Okay. So I read this and the
supervisor comes over and he goes,

100
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,400
do you understand? I want you to draw
it out. I want you to draw it out.

101
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,400
So the supervisor has access
to this information. Yeah.

102
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,220
He's standing there to make sure. Right?
So I go like this Gel, I don't know.

103
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,780
I don't know a person. Okay. I go to,

104
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:11,240
there's a bunch of beings on me like that
and I give it to him like that and he

105
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,850
goes, start again. I want
you to read it again.

106
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,030
And then I want you to draw another
one. It's like, okay. So I did all this,

107
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,220
you know, and I literally did those, Joe,
I mean circles on every part of my body.

108
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,110
He's drawing a stick figure and she's
drawing little circles all over the stick

109
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:28,550
figure right now.

110
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:32,570
These beings were like from
75 trillion meat years ago,

111
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,490
they were put in volcanoes and
blown up and packaged and uh,

112
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:42,350
overlord and a low anyway.
Are you freaking out at this point?

113
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,580
I go, I look at my mother who said,
now the supervisor is standing over me,

114
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,360
so I go,
what in the fuck?

115
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,720
She's like,
no,

116
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,230
there's Ota. Your Mom's Ota. Yeah,
your mom's top of the food chain.

117
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,320
Not only is my mother is probably top
of the food chain when it comes to the

118
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,280
counseling side.

119
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,120
My mother was top of the food chain
when it came to administering cytology,

120
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:15,170
which is very rare. She was what's
considered a height trained auditor,

121
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,390
but she hadn't read this stuff.
You of course, she read it.

122
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:18,890
She was just there to see my excitement.

123
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,580
She was just there as a spectator
to see her daughter received.

124
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,790
The answers were super skeptical.

125
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,450
Supervisor comes over and he goes,
what don't you understand? I go,

126
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:36,690
I understand it. I just, I don't, I don't
love that. Like I'm not happy. I go,

127
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:40,430
I just got to tell you I'm not happy with
this is what it was. And he goes, well,

128
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,560
you don't need to believe it.
You just need to do it.

129
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,580
So that's the answer that's given to you.
You don't need to believe it.

130
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,720
You just need to do it.
So then you have to go and audit this.

131
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,660
You have to go and do it on yourself.

132
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,670
Talk to these beans on the
meter by yourself. So, uh,

133
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,330
on the meter meeting you hold the cans.
And when I say cans folks,

134
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,330
what they look like? It looks like
soup cans. Like it'd be drained.

135
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:08,360
All the soup from a soup can and
it had a string attached to it.

136
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,680
It's connect to some. Yeah, you could just
Google what? Scientology he meter. Okay,

137
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,010
so you, so you have to hold the meter
and discussed this? No, you think it,

138
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,310
so now you got to go get your material.

139
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:23,780
So after you've been checked out on this
and they get that, you get what it is,

140
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:27,230
then you go back to the window
and they give you your actual,

141
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,180
what you're supposed to do with
this information. So it'll say like,

142
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,280
it'll be a piece of paper and I'll say,

143
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,320
ask this question and then look at
the meter and what the answer is.

144
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:43,070
Whatever answer comes to your mind, write
it down. Huh? Do you see what I'm saying?

145
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,510
So all you're doing is awakening
these things to talk to them. Really.

146
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,790
Yeah. Right. And so let them go. You're
basically saying like, go be free. Go.

147
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,680
This is OT three. Correct. And by the way,

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,600
when I was a scientologist and I heard
that this was a story I didn't know,

149
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:03,090
so I would go to the Internet
and go OT three story.

150
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,420
But I didn't know if it was
true so I couldn't verify it.

151
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
Do you see what I'm saying?
So most people who go,

152
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,800
that's bullshit because they haven't,

153
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,390
they don't know what they're
looking at on the Internet. Right.

154
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,020
There's no one to verify it with.
So if I want some of my mother,

155
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:20,610
let's say before I got to
this level, they, you're,
you're told to lie to people.

156
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,610
You can't help people what the answers
are because they're going to get

157
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:27,630
pneumonia, they get pneumonia,
then surely will die. Okay.

158
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,810
So a lot of times when I lied to the price
and then they confronted me on it and

159
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:34,130
said, why did you lie? I was like, I had
to to save your life. I mean, I can't,

160
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,630
I want to give you cancer.

161
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,520
So if you were about to go to OT
three and then you went online and you

162
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:44,670
investigated what is OT three and then
you read a bunch of stuff about these

163
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,770
little beings and you bought
it and then asked your mom,

164
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,430
your mom would have to lie to you. She
would lie to me as she did, as she did.

165
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,310
So after you got through this, yeah.
What made you do four and fives?

166
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:59,280
There's always the carrot of like,
just wait it just by the way,

167
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,880
here's what they do. They set up that
you're the auditor now, so you're,

168
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,500
you're auditing these things in your
body. You're now the boss. So they go,

169
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,560
they tell you, get your hat
on, like your, it's your job.

170
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,880
You don't need to believe anything.
You just need to audit them.

171
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,270
So you need to do your job as an auditor.
That's what they're called.

172
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:22,380
Auditor's people who are the ones who
take you into session in Scientology,

173
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,410
right? So you feel like
you're in a leadership role.

174
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,260
So you're doing these things a favor,
you know, and you're like, well,

175
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:31,650
maybe it's true. I don't know. I mean,
I do sometimes hear voices and you know,

176
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,900
like, you know, you have a moment
with yourself and you're like,

177
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:38,550
I might be really kind of
crazy. Um, so you're like,
maybe this is an answer. It's,

178
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,790
it's sick because it speaks to a side
of you that wants answers about life,

179
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,680
you know? And then you're like,
no, this is some crazy shit man,

180
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:50,810
that there wasn't even people that know,

181
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,870
you know it. Listen, you believe
what you want to believe at the time.

182
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,640
Does it feel to you at the moment
like maybe if you just keep going,

183
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:03,450
it get better.
And I'm confused now,

184
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:05,730
but if I contemplate
this and I write over,

185
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,690
eventually I'm going to receive enough
information. This is all going to be like,

186
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,670
oh right. I was a fool.
Right. So for example,

187
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:18,450
one time I had talked to a friend about
it, I said, you know, I heard some of us,

188
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,470
some Xenu Shit.
She

189
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,860
pulled me into celebrity center so fast
into a secured room and she handed me my

190
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,210
ass. She said, don't you ever say
that word outside of secured room?

191
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,310
I'm writing in knowledge report
on you. She said, I'm writing

192
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,820
you never say that word out loud
in a room that's not secured.

193
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,640
Okay. And never seen again.
So she wrote a report on the,

194
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,210
she wrote a knowledge report on me.
I got sent to what's called ethics,

195
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:52,440
which is like the Justice Department
of celebrities of Scientology.

196
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,170
And they said they brought me into another
secured room because they have to get

197
00:11:56,171 --> 00:12:00,740
somebody who knows this information.
And they said, never ever say that.

198
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,580
W say this. It never
confirm it. Never deny it.

199
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,840
Never give that information out, ever.
That just never discuss it. Just say,

200
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:11,440
I'd never heard of it. You sound
crazy. Wow. And that's what we all say.

201
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,180
You sound crazy or you know,
properly done. You get it. You know,

202
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:19,570
like you'll get it if it's properly done.
Those people didn't do it properly.

203
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:21,640
That's why they didn't understand it.
Do you see what I'm saying?
