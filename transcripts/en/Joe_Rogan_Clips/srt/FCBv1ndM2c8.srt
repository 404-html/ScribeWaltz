1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,920
And laying up and paying attention
to online for a long time.

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:07,450
One of the things that you do a great
job with is just calling bullshit on.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,340
I mean,
you loved called Bullshit clearly,

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,660
but whenever people are overstating
claims or people get ridiculous,

5
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:17,740
and I think this is one of the things
that is a problem with any diet where

6
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:21,730
people get really enthusiastic about it,
that becomes an ideology.

7
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:25,570
Whether it's the ketogenic diet or
the carnivore diet or the, you know,

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,250
fill in the blanks, Vegan Diet. People
decide this is the end all be all,

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,430
it's going to cure cancer, make you
smarter to Dick's, going to grow a foot.

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,570
All of these things are gonna happen and
you do a great job of calling bullshit

11
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,590
on that kind of stuff.

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,490
Yeah, I mean I, I'm not anti
Quito, I'm not anti pagan.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm anti bullshit.

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,640
And one of the problems we
have is nutrition is replacing
religion for a lot of

15
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,474
people.

16
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,510
So you find something that you identify
with and then people start to try to

17
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,410
say, because they identify with that
movement or like for example, vegans,

18
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:04,140
they identify with many of them,
uh, protection of animals. Uh,

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,620
not my job to judge their
ethics on that sort of thing.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,880
But then they kind of try to backtrack
to find the science to support them as

21
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:14,510
well. And they, they pick and choose.
And this is guilty of all groups,

22
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:17,600
not just vegans. This is also a
lot of key digit Dick Diet cell.

23
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:22,130
It's a carnivore diet, whatever
have you. If it has the word diet,

24
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,990
they're zealots out there who are going
after it. And I will stick up for,

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,100
I've stuck up at a scientific conference
for the Ketogenic Diet. Uh, you were,

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,850
we were having a round table
about something different
and somebody said, well,

27
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:36,830
we know that the
ketogenetic diet in prayers,

28
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,110
exercise performance and
endurance athletes. And I said,

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,090
I don't think that's necessarily
true. Uh, you know, the,

30
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,330
it's pretty and ambivalent. The
ambiguous as to whether or not it does.

31
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:50,220
It seems to be kind of
individual. Um, but on the whole,

32
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,760
on the average it doesn't seem
to impair exercise performance.

33
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:57,020
So it's kind of what you like. But when
you have people who you know, like,

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,550
like a Gary Taubes who says, well calories
don't matter, it's all carbohydrates.

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,060
Um, that sort of thing of the
carbohydrate, insulin model, obesity,

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,660
I mean the research is you're able to do
a lot of hand waving about insulin and

37
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:14,060
you know when you burn so much fat
when you're on a high fat diet,

38
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,130
which is true by the way,
you, you burn a lot of fat.

39
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,750
But what they don't talk about is
that it's, it's overall fat balance,

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,840
how much fat you store
versus how much fat you burn.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,690
And when you're on a high fat diet,
you store a lot of fat,

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,040
you also burn a lot of fat.

43
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,910
The overall caloric balance
is what determines whether
or not you will have net

44
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:35,690
storage or net deposition. And it's
same thing for high carb diet as well.

45
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,411
You know,

46
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:40,910
this idea that with high insulin it just
completely shuts down all fat burning

47
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:44,540
everywhere. That's just not true.
Now if you have high carbohydrate,

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,400
you will burn less fat, but you're also
storing less fat as well. And again,

49
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:53,240
the net caloric balance is going to
be what determines how much you store

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,830
because you don't really store
carbohydrates as fat for most people.

51
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,380
They did a study,
uh,

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,850
overfeeding women where they overfed
them 50% above their caloric maintenance

53
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,870
and they found that of 282 grams of
fat that they store during the day and

54
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,670
Adipose, only four grams came from
carbohydrate. 278 came from fat.

55
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,210
So

56
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,620
Glucose. What about fructose? So
fructose causes, we think, you know,

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,620
non alcoholic fatty liver disease.
So that could be, you know,

58
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,621
that that's a de Novo de Novo lipogenesis
is higher with fructose and you think

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,130
about people consuming it in liquid
drinks a hundred to 200 grams a day,

60
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,470
which is not uncommon even for my wife,
not uncommon.

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,620
So fructose does seem to have a little
bit of different hepatic metabolism.

62
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,150
But I was actually across the hall from,
um,

63
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,270
a professor who was doing
a lot of the research on,

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,300
on fructose and obesity
and fatty liver disease.

65
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,540
And even he came to the conclusion that
if you overfeed fructose and it creates

66
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,190
a caloric surplus and
you're overfeeding for dose,

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,210
then you can have some wonky stuff start
to go on relative to other macros dies.

68
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,160
Try to keep this, try to keep this
right next to your face. Sorry. Got It.

69
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,650
Because that's what she says. So powerful.
I talk loud and a lot. It's good.

70
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,430
Um, so if you're, if you're doing that,

71
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,950
if you're creating that caloric surplus,

72
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,630
what you find is when you're in net
storage, when you're driving more,

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,130
uh, nutrients into adipocytes
and sometimes liver,

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,850
depending on metabolism, but it takes,
it takes a lot of fructose to do that.

75
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,860
And a caloric surplus, you start to
create a lot of wacky stuff going on.

76
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,730
Um, the Mitochondria starts to
become dysfunctional. And you know,

77
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,010
people make a big deal about,
oh well you have,

78
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,670
we have claimed now that
everything causes, uh,

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,920
obesity and type two diabetes for, for
first it was fats, then carbohydrates,

80
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,440
and there's actually a professors out
there who actually will claim the protein

81
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:49,450
gives you diabetes and it's type,
can I stop you for a second?

82
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:53,200
What you mean the Mitochondria becomes
dysfunctional? How does the Mitochondrial,

83
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,510
how does that happen?
Okay,

84
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:58,510
so I'm going to state for everybody
that I'm going out in a limb.

85
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,590
This is my opinion. Okay? Um,

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,350
if you look at the research
on obesity and diabetes,

87
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,510
what happens is you have everything
start to elevate in the bloodstream.

88
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,441
So if you measure,

89
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,260
like there was a professor who thought
that branch chain amino acids were

90
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:17,330
causing obesity because they were
elevated in the bloodstream during, uh,

91
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,620
or sorry, during type
two diabetes. Well, yeah,

92
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,800
branch chain amino acids are elevated.
So fatty acids,

93
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,500
so triacylglycerides so as glucose.

94
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,010
So is it really those things causing
it or is it possible that when you are

95
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,640
overfeeding relative to what you
burn relative to that turnover,

96
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,030
that Ma Mitochondria start
to become dysfunctional?

97
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,510
Probably a lot due to inactivity.
Um,

98
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,830
and the Mitochondria is, as we call
it, the powerhouse of the cell.

99
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:51,190
As you probably learned in high school
biology or whatever they taught it to you

100
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:54,730
as that is where
everything fluxes through.

101
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,180
So that is where you're
creating ATP. That's where
you're burning through lipids,

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,010
carbohydrates,
that sort of thing.

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,880
If that becomes dysfunctional and
you're not getting enough flux,

104
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,890
enough pull through that Mitochondria,

105
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,030
what happens is you start to
back up every part of metabolism.

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,430
So all the metabolic byproducts,

107
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,860
almost all of them inhibit
everything within the cell.

108
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,430
There's a metabolomic signature
for that and, and Epi phenomenon,

109
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,480
if you want to call it that,

110
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,990
would be elevated branch chain amino
acids because the consequences of that and

111
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,960
in some people, yeah. So these
things start these byproducts,

112
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:30,020
these metabolic byproducts, because you're
not fluxing enough through the cell.

113
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,010
They start accumulating within the cell
and start to inhibit the Kreb cycle.

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,880
Glycolysis.

115
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,690
And so everything starts backing up to
the point where you also start inhibiting

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,140
the insulin receptor.
And now you have glucose,

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,700
fatty acids and amino acids also backing
up to the point where they start to

118
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,210
overspill into the bloodstream.
And you see these,

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,160
this accumulation of all of them in
the bloodstream in type two diabetes.

120
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,670
And I actually think that again,

121
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:02,720
me going out in a limb that
obesity doesn't cause type
two diabetes and type two

122
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:06,980
diabetes doesn't cause obesity that
they develop in concert from the same

123
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,590
problem,
which is overfeeding under activity.

124
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,160
So a lot of it is about how much nutrients
you're fluxing into cells versus how

125
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,860
much energy you're creating fluxing
them through the cell and out.

126
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,400
So when you're overfeeding,
whether it be carbohydrate, fat,

127
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,240
you're fluxing more energy
in than you can dispose of,

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,530
and now you have to do something with it.
Well when you run out of,

129
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,880
when you do that much to it and
Mitochondria start to become dysfunction,

130
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,343
dysfunctional,

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,190
you start to not have enough places to
put it away and it starts spilling into

132
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,050
the bloodstream and now you
cause all kinds of problems,

133
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,620
problems.

134
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,340
So one of the things that we really
wanted to talk about here is high carb

135
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,310
versus low carb.
Yeah.

136
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,290
Cause this is a just a giant point
of contention today in nutrition,

137
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,610
especially in terms of uh,
athletes with performance in mind.

138
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,360
That's a big factor. Whether or not
high carb or low carb is the way to go.

139
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,360
And there's a lot of zealots on both
sides and there's a lot of bullshit and

140
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:05,180
there's a lot of, you
know, online experts.

141
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:08,000
And one of the great thing about bringing
you two guys in here is because you

142
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,760
could really actually explain
the science behind it.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Now you've been great lane
at pointing out that there's,

144
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,560
it's not a magic bullet and you know,

145
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:23,550
and so many people like to sort
of stress it that way, that they,

146
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,600
they, they like to portray
ketogenic diet. Is this is it,

147
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,970
this is the end all be all.
I figured out what to do.

148
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,090
This is the way everyone should be eating.
You don't think so?

149
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,620
I don't think so because
if you look at the,

150
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,700
the weight loss problem in
our society, uh, and I'm,

151
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:43,400
I'm writing a book called fat loss
forever. I talk about this in detail.

152
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,050
We don't have a weight loss problem.

153
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,920
Six out of every seven people are able
to lose a significant amount of body

154
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,020
weight in their life who
are obese or overweight.

155
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,770
The problem is the weight regained
statistics are absolutely terrifying.

156
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,990
Uh, within one year, 70%, we'll put
it all back on. Within two years,

157
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,930
it's 85%. Within three years, it's 95%.

158
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:08,520
So that means diets have a 95%
failure rate. And of those people,

159
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,150
one third to two thirds will add
more than they originally lost.

160
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,110
And this gets kind of into Yoyo dieting
and I talk about that as well. But the,

161
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,430
the real problem is that people don't
stick to pick something that's sustainable

162
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:26,760
for them. All the research. If there's
one bit of research out there that,

163
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,720
that we have that shows how
to create lasting weight loss,

164
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:35,010
and you look at the people who are
the 5% who actually keep it off, uh,

165
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,000
it's that they pick something that's
sustainable, whether it be key to genic,

166
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,590
whether it be low carb, high or
low fat, whatever it is, Vegan,

167
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,950
something that they can sustain
and make a lifestyle. If,

168
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,280
cause if you look at
Meta analyses, uh, uh,

169
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,330
for our listeners met analyses are,
are kind of a study of studies.

170
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,320
So they take,

171
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,750
researchers take studies that have
similar parameters and they kind of lumped

172
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:04,230
them together and they look
at, okay, what's the consensus
amongst these studies?

173
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,390
And they have advanced statistics.
They used to run this.

174
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,320
If you look at low carb versus low fat,

175
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,680
there's no difference
in adherence overall.

176
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:16,830
On the whole there's no difference and
there's no difference in weight loss.

177
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,300
There's no difference in a blood lipids,
even glycaemic control.

178
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:25,260
So there was a study where they met
analysis of, I think it was 23 studies,

179
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:29,040
over 3000 people where they looked
at, okay, if you control calories,

180
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,210
so calories are acquainted,

181
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,380
does low carb versus low fat
make a difference on weight loss,

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,730
glycaemic control,
those sorts of things,

183
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,130
leave the ketogenic diet.

184
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,900
So by definition we have an objective bio
marker that defines the ketogenic diet

185
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:47,240
is the only diet that actually
has something that you, you know,

186
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,630
you can measure in your blood that say
you're on this diet and when your ketone

187
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:55,320
levels are elevated, that confers
many different benefits, uh,

188
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,480
that I believe can enhance
adherence to the Diet.

189
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,110
Before we get into the woods here,
I want to clarify one thing,

190
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,310
the difference between someone being on
a diet and being able to sustain it and

191
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,200
not being able to stand in
gaining all that weight back.

192
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,590
Isn't that a discipline
issue? Well, partly,

193
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:17,880
but we kind of had to start
looking at, okay, if we,

194
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:21,180
if we go in, let me
read, let me re circle.

195
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,800
We have to find what requires the least
amount of discipline for somebody to

196
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:29,190
stick to. Because discipline is
is while some people have more,

197
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,770
some people have less,
um,

198
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,620
it is a finite resource.

199
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,210
So when doing only find that people like
kind of drop off whatever they're doing,

200
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,900
it's when they're stressed out,
work stressing them out,

201
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,990
they're going through a divorce,
those kinds of things, right?

202
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:49,890
That's where are our discipline kind
of wanes because we're trying to be so

203
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,680
disciplined for this other
thing and it's draining us.

204
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,150
So what happens with,

205
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,810
with diet is it in people who are busy,

206
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,640
people who have a lot
of stress in their life,

207
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,450
that's where they really start overeating.

208
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,450
So we have to find
something that requires,

209
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,380
I look at it is let's find something
that requires the minimal amount of,

210
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,310
of discipline for a person so that
when your life goes to absolute shit,

211
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,840
you can still stick to it.
And so for some people that is a very,

212
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,160
very individual thing.

213
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,290
And they see this in the dietary studies
that what works for one person to

214
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,160
create a deficit and sustainable
isn't the same way for another person.

215
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:31,020
And Dom even commented on this
about his wife Chella. Um,

216
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,830
she does much better on a higher
ratio of carbohydrates to fats.

217
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,170
Yeah. I mean, early on it was obvious that
she wasn't going to change her diet. I,

218
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,020
the time that we met like
10 years ago, most, we,

219
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:46,640
I was really getting into this and I
really felt that for me at least. Uh,

220
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,830
but she would stop at checkers and,
you know,

221
00:12:48,831 --> 00:12:53,150
get a burger and with the sugary
drink and she's in tremendously carbon

222
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:57,440
tolerance. She was very skinny as a
kid. And, uh, she taught me tolerance,

223
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,840
carbohydrate. She's very carbohydrate
tolerance. Did I say intolerant? Yeah. Uh,

224
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,160
yeah. So, and, and you know,

225
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:07,220
if the Diet low carb I feel,

226
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,960
and maybe in ketogenic putting
in an under that umbrella works,

227
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,480
I think for up to 25 to 30% of people,
uh,

228
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
especially at their
carbohydrate intolerant.

229
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,220
And I believe that it does that
by virtue of elevating Ketones,

230
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:28,940
shifting, you're a, the neuropharmacology
of the brain, for example,

231
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,410
it works through Ghrelin.
It works through,

232
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:35,411
there's new science emerging right now
showing that appetite regulation is

233
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:39,080
influenced positively by,
uh,

234
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,410
nutritional ketosis in ways that were
just starting to learn now. Well,

235
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:46,160
you can certainly feel it. It's one of
the things about the ketogenic diet.

236
00:13:46,161 --> 00:13:49,340
When you're in that state, all of a
sudden you're just not hungry. The same.

237
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,860
There's not a, an overwhelming
need for food. Yeah, I'm,

238
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,890
I haven't had anything to eat today.
I mean,

239
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:59,891
when I was eating massive plates of
Pasta 25 years ago and I went to this,

240
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,930
this long without food, I would
start getting shaky. I would,

241
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:08,270
I would have a hypoglycemic response
and I'm completely resilient to that.

242
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:11,510
And that has major implications for
military personnel being keto adapted,

243
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,940
not just for performance,
preventing seizures.

244
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:17,250
And I think for a cognitive function too.

245
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,240
But you, uh, it's very liberating.

246
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,180
So meal frequency is not an issue.

247
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,780
So if you're in austere environments
where you have limited food availability,

248
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,160
that becomes a major issue. And if you're
working as a scientist and you can't,

249
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,200
you know, you're working with
animals, you're doing experiments,

250
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:36,830
you don't have time to eat. I need
to maintain that cognitive function.

251
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,780
I needed to be sharp,
you know, with limited.

252
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,710
So it worked very good for me
throughout my professorship. You know,

253
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:45,560
getting tenure and things like that where
I could just put more time and energy

254
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,570
into my work without having to stop,
prepare a meal, eat a meal, cleanup.

255
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,530
Like I think I wasted a lot of time
doing that when I was eating five to six

256
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,130
meals a day.
