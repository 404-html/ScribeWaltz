1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,690
Worse environment. I was on this,
uh, discussion about Kratom.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,533
Are you familiar with [inaudible]?

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,060
I'm on it right now. Oh
Wow. Yeah. I just took some,

4
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:10,630
I fucked my knee up the other day.
I did something and uh,

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,570
it's been stiff and painful.
So I used to,

6
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:18,460
before I came here and then I just took a,
took six of them, see what happens. Wow.

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,730
10 once, ten one gram capsules.
I don't know how much,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,380
I don't know. Can you grab that? Tell
you exactly what's in it. But uh,

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,160
now I get why people might think
it's a drug. What is the drug? Yeah,

10
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:36,070
for sure. But when I took
four, I was like, well,

11
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:37,750
I took two for the first time I took it.

12
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,780
I took two and a couple of
times I took to him like,

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,900
this is like a mild stimulant,

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,880
but then when you get into the range
of eight to 10 pills, it's like,

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,910
oh, this, this will
fuck you up. This stuff.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,190
The stuff I take is urban ice organics.
And um,

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,090
see it says,
it says take two.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,670
It doesn't say the amount of material
in the capsule. What's it say there?

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,810
750 milligrams. Okay,
so not quite at Graham.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,350
Not quite a grim. Alright. It
seems like a a reasonable amount,

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,220
but they always construct these things
in these ridiculous dramatic oppositions.

22
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:21,221
Like it was me versus a woman whose
son had died of some Katam associated

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,920
overdose.
And it turns into a thing like,

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,510
what do you have to say to this
woman whose son died? And it's like,

25
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,430
I don't know. You know, there are people
that die from caffeine overdoses as well.

26
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,030
It's tragic that this happened.
How people died from this. Yes.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,100
They have to have to take
an enormous amount. I mean,

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,700
I think a lot of people set up these
unrealistic expectations with these drugs

29
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:44,690
where they,
if they'd like a drug,

30
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,470
they want to say it's impossible for
it to kill anyone. It's impossible.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,200
There's no possible way.
If you set that as your standard,

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,290
you'll always fail because people
will die doing absolutely everything.

33
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,590
Running, having sex, defecating,
aspirin, aspirin. Absolutely.

34
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:05,150
There's nothing in this world that
can't find its way into a human death.

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,570
So if people want to say,
and even you know, cannabis,

36
00:02:08,571 --> 00:02:12,320
obviously people say you can't overdose
on cannabis and essentially you can't.

37
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,700
But if you look in the medical literature,

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,330
there are a number of these cannabis
associated fatalities. You know,

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,100
you can debate them endlessly,
but the point is,

40
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,950
once a drug enters a
large enough population,

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,460
there'll be a number of sensitive
individuals and someone will die.

42
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,900
It doesn't mean that
the drug is dangerous.

43
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,620
It means that it's unrealistic to set a
standard where if anything bad happens

44
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:34,370
to anyone, we have to decide that the
drug is dangerous and should be banned.

45
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,600
Yeah, I agree. I mean,
look, water kills people.

46
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,630
There's a lot of these hazing things
where the fraternity kids will be asked to

47
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,810
drink a shit ton of water and Oh yeah,
people have died from an,

48
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:50,500
a woman died in San Jose
a few years back from a,

49
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,900
a contest to drink water to get her son
like an x box or something like that.

50
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,310
Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's a lot of
things that are lethal, but the LD

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,380
50 for cannabis,
I mean,

52
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:04,750
you literally have to smoke your
body weight or something. Right.

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,550
It's something crazy would
be very difficult. Yeah,

54
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,080
but it doesn't mean that you couldn't
get so high that you did something really

55
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:13,510
stupid wind up dying. Right? Yeah.

56
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,250
Especially dependent upon the person
and the biological variability.

57
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,800
Right, right, exactly. And it's just,

58
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,560
I think it's also just as
sort of a bad road to go down.

59
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,460
People always want to emphasize the
safety of things. Right. In my opinion,

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,670
safety isn't the point.

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,570
It doesn't ultimately matter to me
whether or not something is safe.

62
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:35,290
I think we should have the freedom
to do dangerous things. If we choose,

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,740
we're allowed to ride.
Motorcycles were allowed to shoot guns.

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,120
You're allowed to go skydiving and bungee
jumping. All those things carry risks,

65
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,450
but it's assumed that any adult that
does them is aware of those risks. Yeah.

66
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:49,900
I couldn't agree more. I
mean it's, it's also who is,

67
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,420
if the society that we
live in was just you and I,

68
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,740
we were the only two people alive who
are you to tell me what I can do or me to

69
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,300
tell you what you can do.
It's ridiculous.

70
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:02,230
And so when you have grown adults telling
a grown adult who's informed what they

71
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:06,260
can and can't do, then it
becomes a question of children.
Well then it becomes a,

72
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,420
an an education issue and it becomes
a parental issue. I mean it's just,

73
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,230
you can't lie to your children about
the effects of certain drugs cause then

74
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,180
they're not going to believe
you about the really actual,

75
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,340
the actual dangerous ones.
Brilliant.

76
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,800
And this is of course reflected in the so
called opioid epidemic. Yes. Right now,

77
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,810
yes.
There's endless finger pointing.

78
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,080
Everyone wants to find a
culprit that's behind all of it.

79
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,520
And the easiest person to blame,

80
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,670
of course our pharmaceutical companies
because everybody hates pharmaceutical

81
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,150
companies. So why not
blame them? But you know,

82
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,110
and I'm not pro pharmaceutical by
any stretch of the imagination,

83
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:43,540
but I'm also not anti
pharmaceutical either.

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,900
And when you look at the way,
for example,

85
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,510
the New York Times is
covering the opioid epidemic.

86
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:53,200
It's always in this tone of
like documents were uncovered,

87
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,840
the show that executives at Purdue Pharma,

88
00:04:55,841 --> 00:05:00,841
we're aware that morphine was addictive
as early as 1999 and it's like,

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,150
well, of course, of
course. They were aware.

90
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,880
People have known that morphine is
addictive for hundreds of years.

91
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,210
This is old news and this whole idea that
doctors were convinced by some letter

92
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:16,330
in the New England Journal of medicine
that said that Oxi content isn't

93
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,360
addictive, is absurd. These are all
morphine derivatives. Any adult,

94
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,510
especially in medically trained adult
should know that no matter what little

95
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:24,310
variation you make on that molecule,

96
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,910
if it's structurally and pharmacologically
and qualitatively similar to morphine,

97
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,690
of course it's going to be addictive
and that in of itself isn't even a bad

98
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:34,870
thing. It should be okay to give
people addictive drugs as well.

99
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:36,580
As long as everyone's aware of the risks,

100
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,450
as long as they understand the protocol
to get off of it. The you, you know,

101
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,430
there's so many people that get on these
things and then wind up taking them far

102
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:49,090
longer than they're supposed to because
it's easy to get hooked. I mean,

103
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:54,091
we need to at least have some sort of
responsible direction that these people

104
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,800
need to go to to get off of them

105
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,820
once they're on them. Because people
that get back operations, any,

106
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:05,510
anything where they prescribe
you a high doses of opiates,

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,080
it's a huge problem. I know many, many
people that have gotten hooked because of,

108
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,960
and in fact I should tell you
that my good friend Justin wren,

109
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,250
his wife found out about Kratom
because of you, because of your show.

110
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,770
He had a problem with his shoulder,
got shoulder shoulder surgery,

111
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,390
they put him on Oxycontin's,

112
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,110
he was fucked up on them and he was
having a really hard time getting off and

113
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:28,610
having the shakes really bad.

114
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,770
And Kratom is the only thing
that got him off of it.

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,730
Right.
And that's not surprising.

116
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:36,450
I mean this has been known for a very
long time in Thailand and that was

117
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:38,910
actually the reason that it
was originally prohibited.

118
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:39,870
I don't know if you're aware of that,

119
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,871
but because the government taxed opium
and people started using Chris Tom,

120
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,720
then they made Creton Elisa. And the right
way to say it, cause people say Kratom,

121
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,020
you're the only one I've heard say
Creton people in, it's a Thai word.

122
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:55,830
People in Thailand call it [inaudible].
So people in the u called Kratom,

123
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,690
it's Aye. It's also, they have, you know,
it's maybe it's a, something like that.

124
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:03,720
They're not going to go that far, but Tom
is closer. If you did, it would be weird.

125
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,140
But I feel I was, you know, yeah.
Like American people that say Ecuador,

126
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,000
Argentina. But it is Creton.
Yeah, Chris. Tom. Okay.

127
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,920
So we'll try to call it quits
or something close to that.

128
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,630
It's closer to that than Kratom.
Right.

129
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:22,080
And so the reason why it was made illegal
was because of the fact that it was

130
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:26,040
pinching some of the profits off
of the opium trade. Yes. Wow. Yeah.

131
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,060
That's fucked up.

132
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,660
And so this has been known for a long
time that it helps people get off more

133
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:33,810
addictive opioids. And
how does it do that? Well,

134
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:37,440
it's an opioid itself and a lot of
people don't want to admit or acknowledge

135
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:37,621
that,

136
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:41,220
but I think we need to get beyond this
idea that drugs are inherently bad or

137
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:45,030
opioids are inherently bad just because
the ones that we're aware of have a lot

138
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,530
of problems.
You know,

139
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,850
in some sense medicinal chemistry and
pharmacology and all of this are still in

140
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,910
a very primitive state and
there's so much to be learned.

141
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:57,360
So we're mostly giving people these
derivatives of morphine that have been

142
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,530
around for a hundred years
and there are better things.

143
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:06,570
We're going to continuously discover
less addictive treatments for pain.

144
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,750
And I think that the alkaloids in
Kratom are a step in that direction.

145
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,180
And then,

146
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,040
which is so tragic that they're trying
to now make it illegal because this is

147
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,290
something that as far as I can tell,

148
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,880
has genuinely helped an enormous number
of people reduce their intake of more

149
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:27,540
addictive and more dangerous opioids.
But one of the things that I've felt,

150
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,850
and again, my dose was not extremely
high, but when I was on it,

151
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,860
I was very coherent.
I was clear,

152
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:39,600
it was clear to me that was affected by
something. But uh, it felt kind of good.

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,460
It didn't feel bad. It felt a little, uh,

154
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,110
a little uneasy, like a little like, whoa,

155
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,420
the world feels a little weird right now,

156
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,730
but it did not feel like a,
I was impaired.

157
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,330
I know a lot of people who take
it an like a, I have a friend,

158
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:59,580
he'll take 10 pills and exercise,

159
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,990
which is just seems kind of fucking crazy.
Yes.

160
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,350
But he says he has a great workout right.

161
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,490
By taking that stuff before he works out.
Yeah.

162
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:12,540
I mean it seems to lend itself to a lot
of different applications in Thailand.

163
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,540
It's used almost exclusively for
that sort of purpose. In the south.

164
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,670
It's a drug that Labor is
used so they can, you know,

165
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,690
collected the latex from rubber
trees and just get their job done.

166
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,440
That's what it's about.
I mean,

167
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,810
that's what opioids are about
for a lot of the world. Um,

168
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,860
both in the United States and in
Africa and in Thailand is, you know,

169
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,940
people live hard lives and, and manual
labor is painful and repetitive.

170
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,570
And difficult and anything that makes
that a little bit more manageable.

171
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:42,780
It's a very important tool for humans.

172
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,520
I always felt like people that did
heroin or opiates or something like that,

173
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,560
we're on a very short road to death.

174
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
That that was my perception
when I was a kid.

175
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,880
And then I had a friend
who was a long shoreman.

176
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,120
They worked on the docks bring,

177
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:01,440
they would bring fish in and a fillet,
the fish for the market.

178
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,203
And um,

179
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,410
he worked with a guy that every
day at lunch the guy would go cop,

180
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,520
he would get his heroin,

181
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,850
he would shoot it up in his car and
then to go back to work. And I was like,

182
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:14,680
you'd go back to work and you're
like, Yup. He worked every day.

183
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,050
Like every day shut up. And every day he
worked like, yeah, who's never late? Nope.

184
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,730
Just did his work. Right. Wow. I
didn't think you could do that.

185
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,350
I thought you did heroin.
The next thing you know,

186
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:29,490
you'd just be on the floor in a fetal
position and your own urine and you just

187
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,640
would fall apart and die. Right? Yeah.

188
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,850
There's this idea that people sometimes
refer to is pharmacological determinism

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,940
that a certain drug has
to do a certain thing.

190
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,150
So alcohol has to sedate
and disinhibit you.

191
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,380
Heroin has to addict you and make
you a slave to it and kill you.

192
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,280
Cocaine has to be a euphoric
thing that's done at parties.

193
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:55,200
It's also very addictive. PCP has to
make you strip nude and run around,

194
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,150
uh, fighting constant and fighting
cops and punching holes in wood,

195
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,810
in fences. Um, but when
you look at this, you know,

196
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:06,930
anthropologists have looked at certain
drugs that are used cross culturally like

197
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:07,764
alcohol.

198
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,510
And what you find is this whole idea
of pharmacological determinism is

199
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,860
fundamentally flawed.

200
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,900
Drugs behave differently in different
cultures depending on the set and setting

201
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:19,734
of the user.

202
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,010
And so you find all sorts of instances
that are major exceptions to these rules

203
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,580
that we've set up for these
various drugs. For example, PCP,

204
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:34,500
which is arguably one of the most
ubiquitously maligned drugs in the world.

205
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:37,830
I mean, no one can imagine that PCP
is medicinal. But even to this day,

206
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,950
PCPs in schedule to not schedule one
like cannabis and LSD schedule two,

207
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:45,240
it can still be prescribed actually.

208
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,290
And that's because it had
a history of medicinal use.

209
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,540
There was even PCP psychotherapy in
the UK and in the fifties so this is a

210
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,800
something that most
people wouldn't believe,

211
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,930
but to those patients that were taking it,

212
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,980
then there is none of this cultural
association with PCP being a drug that

213
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:09,210
causes psychosis or makes you strip
nude who is simply another tool for a

214
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:14,211
psychiatrist to use and help people
release repressed memories or traumas that

215
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:17,280
they were afraid to talk about when sober.

216
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,050
Hmm. Well, we're seeing that now with
Mtma, right? I mean, and also ketamine,

217
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,940
ketamine, you being used as an
actual tool for psychotherapy,

218
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:30,870
particularly for people with depression.
It's having really good results. My, uh,

219
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,250
my friend [inaudible],
excuse me,

220
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,580
Neil Brennan a WHO's a hilarious comedian.

221
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:40,670
He's had struggles with depression.
Yeah. He got great relief from, uh,

222
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,030
from taking ketamine.

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,230
Right. And what I think is
really interesting is, you know,

224
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,040
this is often packaged as a
sort of psychedelic renaissance,

225
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:50,840
but I think in a larger context,

226
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:55,370
it's a drug facilitated psychotherapy
renaissance because this was not just

227
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:56,600
limited to psychedelics.

228
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:01,070
People did something called narco
analysis where they would give people, um,

229
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,610
sedatives like propafol the drug
that killed Michael Jackson or, um,

230
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,560
various barbiturates
or various other drugs.

231
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:13,160
And the relaxing effect would allow
people to talk more openly to a therapist

232
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:14,600
and it was considered very effective.

233
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,280
Now this idea of a psychiatrist injecting
you with a drug in order to help you

234
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,810
talk about your problems is,
it's unheard of.

235
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,370
I don't think anyone does it anymore,

236
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:26,910
but it used to be very common and I think
a return to that is going to be really

237
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,630
beneficial.
