1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,710
You can say something ridiculous and then
say feminist theory and they're like,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,360
oh, it's in feminist theory. Yeah,
yeah. That's the thing, right?

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:08,940
It's so much of the stuff they come up
with. Let me throw him on olive branch.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,070
Like so much of the stuff they
come up with is a creative idea.

5
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,040
Maybe there's something to
some of this stuff, right?

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,590
But what they're putting
forward is hypotheses and
then they're treating them as

7
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:20,160
conclusions so they're putting forward
this idea. I saw one on Twitter today,

8
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,140
it was something like
there's about South Park,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,830
how it's been laundering racism into
society and making everybody comfortable

10
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:26,431
with racism.

11
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:29,940
And that's why everything's so racist
and people are shooting Jews is because

12
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:34,080
southpark made it normal that they're
treating that as a conclusion.

13
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:36,480
But that's a hypothesis,
right? So we could test that.

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,160
It's conceivable that you could actually
try to parse out what variables need to

15
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:45,180
be controlled. C, you know, South Park
came out and started doing these themes.

16
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:46,890
What?
How does it track?

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,470
Statisticians can do kind of
amazing things with that stuff,

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,100
but they're not doing that. They're
not testing it and send it, testing it.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,700
They're concluding it and they're using
theory to do so and they're like, oh no,

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,180
it's even bigger than that because
why don't they test it? Well,

21
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,660
if they tested it, and this is, I'm not
making this shit up, you won't believe me,

22
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,494
but this is true.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,710
If they tested it and the test showed
that their hypothesis was wrong,

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,600
they would say that the test was racist,

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,810
but the test is condoning racism and
that's why it didn't give them the desired

26
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:17,520
result. How would you test something
like, cause I mean I'm not a statistician.

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,650
I actually am a mathematician,
but I'm not a statistician.

28
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,740
They're two different things. So I'm not
exactly sure how you would test that.

29
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,870
But conceivably you could gather data,

30
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,570
survey data and see how
attitudes have changed.

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,380
Maybe you could track kinds of articles,
kinds of events that are coming out.

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,340
You could kind of pair that up with
what's been shown on south park who aren't

33
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:39,540
self park and track out with attitudes.
I mean there's no effort to do this.

34
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,650
They're like, oh, South Park presents
these ideas, which they then cherry pick.

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,890
Cause there's other ideas that they
don't talk about their, you know,

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,740
point the other direction. These ideas
are problematic. That's the big word.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,710
Theoretically that's a problem. Why?
Because they, and I'm not joking,

38
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,400
they literally believe that use of
language creates the power dynamics that

39
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,270
defined society.

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,830
So South Park's using language and
imagery that creates a power dynamic that

41
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,480
makes people more comfortable being
racist. Boom. It's theory done.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,830
No tests needed. No even attempt to
test. And then if the test happened,

43
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,310
the test itself would be racist unless
it confirmed the hypothesis. Right.
