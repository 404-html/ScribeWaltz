1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:06,030
Hello Freak bitches when they were Amash
essentially Democratic Party was gone.

2
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,270
Come on America, like let's
vote a woman in. Come on.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,060
Like we just had the black president.
It was amazing to have a woman president.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,470
And I think if they'd gone with almost
any other candidate that didn't have as

5
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:19,180
much baggage,
it'd be a different story.

6
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:22,870
But they were asking you to like
somebody who I didn't have an issue with,

7
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:25,030
but a lot of people have
got a big issue with,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,890
if she was a man it would
be a giant problem. But we
gave her, what do you mean?

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,250
Well, if she had all those problems,
if she, you know, all the, you know,

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,760
[inaudible] all this shit.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:38,620
I mean we saw a guy with a lot of
problems and you seem to squeak through,

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,850
but I'm saying if he was,

13
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:44,050
she was a man and she was up against
Trump and she had all those problems. Oh,

14
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:47,410
I see what she was crushed. She would have
no chance. But because she was a woman.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,330
Oh, you think she got further
because, oh, 100% yeah.

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,220
They wanted to make history.
They wanted to make history because look,

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,660
from a social standpoint,

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,250
Barack Obama was very important because
here was a super articulate guy who's

19
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,360
really calm.
He just,

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,830
he has a very even a
presence about him always.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,630
He never seen him riled up. You'd never
see him crazy. Even like he gets heckled,

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,870
you just see that thing with a Trump
supporter was heckling him and he,

23
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,300
he handled it with grace.
He has a graceful God.

24
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,910
That's like probably the best
way to describe them. You know,

25
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,920
like that was important for the
country because that represented like,

26
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,860
wow, hey, here's this black
guy who's super articulate.

27
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:30,890
It's so calm.

28
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:35,720
And so like the way he expresses
himself is so perfect for a president.

29
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,710
So presidential, like there's a what a
what a perfect example for our country.

30
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,700
This is us.

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,240
And then I think a lot of people felt
like Hillary Clinton would be another one

32
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:51,830
of those things. Like, look, we can have
a woman running things. We're not sexist.

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,400
Like, look, we look, we
are a really articulate,

34
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,430
incredibly well experienced woman who's
been in business for a long time with

35
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:06,020
the government. She's deep
inside the public service
and she was a teenager. Yes,

36
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,880
but it was just too much.
It was just too much shit for people.

37
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,080
But I think if that was a man and
she had all those same problems,

38
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:20,081
it was a man and tied to some foundation
that was getting all these people that

39
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,480
eventually got arms deals
and they donated and the,

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,340
they're all part of this weird
sort of incestuous political world.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,930
A man would be skewered with that same
record because Trump was running as an

42
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,980
outsider.

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,750
You know what he had going against him
is he's borish and he says ridiculous

44
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:41,930
shit and you know, they could,
they could point to that,

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,160
that recording of him talking
about grabbing pussies and
they'll look, look, look,

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,070
look, look. We have here like that.

47
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,350
That was like the big thing against him.

48
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:54,860
But at least to these people that
hate the system, he was an outsider.

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,310
If she was a man, she would've represented
even more of an insider, you know,

50
00:02:59,311 --> 00:03:01,210
to I think to a lot of people.
I think her,

51
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,390
her actions and what she's done
in the past versus her as a woman.

52
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,250
That was like sort of a
situation there because like,

53
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,330
do you ever see the video where she was
talking about a Kadafi being killed? No.

54
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,810
Crazy video man,
because she's joking around.

55
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:21,010
It's before they interview her and she
goes [inaudible] before the official

56
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,450
interview starts. Like she, yeah,

57
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,040
she had just found out that Kadafi had
been killed and she was like laughing

58
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,720
about it. She goes, we came,
we saw he died. Ha ha ha.

59
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,420
And she throws her head back and she's
laughing. She was kind of hawkish. Ooh,

60
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:41,230
she was hawkish. If that was
a guy, if a guy did that,

61
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:46,060
he would have been thought to be a
fucking serial killer. A sociopath.

62
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,440
Right. If a guy did that, like
say if Joe Biden, like we came,

63
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,460
we saw he died.
People would be like,

64
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:59,270
do you want that guy in charge of
the fucking nukes? But we let her go.

65
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,490
We'll give her a pass.

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,070
There's a lot of stuff that she's
done where people give her a pass.

67
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,610
They put a more interesting
cat in charge of the dukes. Oh,

68
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,570
there should be no president. This is
what I say. Everybody's like, well,

69
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,960
who would you think should
be the president if you
have a problem with Trump or

70
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,794
if your problem,

71
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,930
no human being should be in control
of 350 million human beings.

72
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,760
It's a pro posture. His job. Explain
this this way. Too many of us.

73
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,880
It's impossible. Would it be done?
Can we don't have to do it this way?

74
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,240
The road down the idea.
I don't have one,

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,390
but when we can't have an Alpha chain
to figure it out right here were smart.

76
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,530
The Internet. What about, what about
education? The Internet, mind reading.

77
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,010
Well essentially it does it
come down to, uh, what was the,

78
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,340
was that movie with the girl?
Shoots, bows and arrows and shit. Oh,

79
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,170
a hunger games or games.

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,670
Can we district the country and then
their heads of district or same thing.

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,580
We'll go to war with each other. You
can't do that. All right, so that's gone.

82
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,520
This is the think tech is, he's out.
Happened like every idea to get there.

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,160
He was one dates states are problematic.
So then what does people like? Fuck Utah.

84
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,620
This is Texas Sun.
That's true. Gosh, this,

85
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:08,800
I grew up in New Jersey and New York
hated us and fucking everybody hates

86
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:12,850
everybody. Hated the Banya. Oh yeah, you
hated Pennsylvania. New York hated Boston.

87
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,980
Connecticut got a pass. Okay, so it was
like some little kid with a limp, like Ah,

88
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,710
don't pick on let's Connecticut doesn't
get mentioned in the tri state area.

89
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,800
Whenever they did credentials it would be
like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.

90
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,870
Exactly. I didn't know. I thought
Connecticut was New Hampshire, Ohio.

91
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:31,210
It years and years like Connecticut is
a highway to highway between Boston and

92
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,960
New York, but we were like
a poet, Connecticut Psi
where everyone could I get,

93
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:36,130
it's like fuck you.
They are like fuck you.

94
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,070
But you know want to talk to them
about bitch bitch. You know I'm right.

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,140
All right. Wait no states cause
we'd war with each other. Yeah.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,570
Can you something that
somebody has to govern? No,

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,550
they have to be police and shit like that.

98
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,670
I think the best way to probably handle
it is let every human being have a say

99
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,900
every human being that's of adult age
and I think registering to vote should be

100
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,240
just as fucking easy as getting an email.

101
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,260
It should be just as easy as doing
everything else that you do online.

102
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,480
You had a Twitter handle,
you should be able to vote.

103
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,860
You should be able to use your id,
like whatever, whoever you are,

104
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,310
whatever your name is, you know, call
yourself who are the fuck you want.

105
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,940
That is one individual vote.
That's what I think.

106
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,450
And I think as long as we could figure
out how to make that system pure where

107
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,690
people can't hack it through it, he
can't log in from 15 different computers.

108
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,160
If you have a fucking birth certificate
and your birth certificate aligns with

109
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,620
this number and that's
this and this is you,

110
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,380
as long as they could figure out how to
make it so people don't hack into it.

111
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,610
Everybody who's an adult should be
allowed to vote and voting for the people

112
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,070
that have gone to jail.
I think people that have gone to jail,

113
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,950
the idea that someone goes to jail for
four years and now they can't vote for

114
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,670
the rest of their life. I think that's
fucking crazy too. That's ridiculous.

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,530
You paid your debt to society back and
you should be able to reenter society.

116
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,321
Exactly.

117
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:57,410
You're telling me you can't be a 20
year old to do something stupid and rob

118
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,640
somebody or something and then I'm
supposed to think of you a certain way for

119
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,320
the rest of your life.
You're 80 now.

120
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,610
You robbed somebody when you were 20
that's still you. You're dangerous, man.

121
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:09,440
Talking about tearing down institutions,

122
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,580
but institutions are a problem no
matter what. There always a problem.

123
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,290
I think the real issue is
government, right? Governing us.

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,340
So the real issue is what
everybody wants is safety,

125
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,420
security, protection and unity.
That's what everybody wants.

126
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,530
All the other stuff in terms of
like restrictions on your behavior,

127
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,870
we have to just figure it out.
Cut it down.

128
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,740
The middle between hurts other people
and hurts yourself. It hurts yourself.

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,280
You're on your own, just like you're
on your own with rock climbing,

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,010
just like you're on your own.
Would Bungee Joe Open. So wait,

131
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,510
give me an example of exercise.

132
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:49,511
Like you're on your own hobbies in
high school they'd call them elective.

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,140
Yeah. Yeah. How come you could
just go to the roof and jump off,

134
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,860
but you can't do heroin
like no one will stop you.

135
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,510
You can go to your roof and
practice backflip. Megan.

136
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,570
So much science and ready to boot.
Dude,

137
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,840
I'm ready to fucking Jack a needle
in my 12 gauge it right now.

138
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,460
You have people tickets telling other
people what to do. You've got a tyranny.

139
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,080
Yeah,
you got a fucking problem.

140
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,160
Even if even if they sort of can get
away with it because it's written down on

141
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,680
paper. Did you agree
to it? No. You weren't.

142
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,700
Nobody asked you about like child labor
laws, do you haven't? You've never,

143
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,360
no one's,

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,840
no one's pulled you aside and saying
that for years since I was a child. No.

145
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,410
It's pulled you aside and
decided, well, you know, and you,

146
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,110
you've decided with them how old you
should be when you drink, right? No, it's,

147
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,640
it's, it's all been done. It's
all, most people don't have a say.

148
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:41,750
It's all written down somewhere and
the mat of people that vote versus the

149
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,960
amount of people that are affected by
that vote. Completely disproportionate.

150
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,870
It's fairly weird, man. It's really weird.

151
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,871
We have a ton of systems that are
set up completely to do two things.

152
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,070
One,
to control people and to,

153
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,730
to ensure the survival of these systems.
And that's what bureaucracy is.

154
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:02,850
That's a giant problem with government.
Like the Dea.

155
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,860
The DEA wants so badly to keep arresting
people for marijuana because if they

156
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,400
don't, they don't have to shut up.
I'm like, I better not light up.

157
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:14,930
Perfect timing again. Would you and I are
in sync? Um, what do you mean? Why? Why?

158
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,330
Cause they their jobs, they're
jobs are gonna go away. There's no,

159
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,320
there's plenty of other drugs.

160
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,750
Hold little 46% of all arrests.

161
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,733
They said,

162
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,950
what was the number more people or
arrested today or have been arrested today

163
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:34,850
for marijuana.
Then all other arrests combined.

164
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,590
You see me smoking,
man,

165
00:09:36,591 --> 00:09:40,460
you want me to the door for the next hour
to hour where I'm like, what is that?

166
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,430
I heard a noise. What are you doing? But
we live in the correct state, right? Yeah.

167
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,660
Tell me I'm right. Well, we're,
we live in several years.

168
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,050
If you're going to scare me. Hmm. Then
throw me of, uh, Dick tickle a little bit.

169
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:54,260
Like, tell me everything's
gonna be okay. [inaudible] okay.

170
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,170
We're here. Uh, Washington state,
Oregon with the west coast in DC.

171
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,640
Large Smoking section,

172
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,290
Washington DC and Boston now
Massachusetts and my state.

173
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,790
Florida is Lee as medical,
medical, legal. Yeah.

174
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,180
Bunch of medical step though for Florida.
What are the other legal state? Alaska.

175
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,160
Alaska's legal. Fuck Ya'll asco.
So are gangsters to the north,

176
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,380
do you believe the, just not in
love Alaska. Um, Gee Gee, gee,

177
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:25,250
you believe the theory that as
goes California, so goes the union,

178
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,840
like for years they said if
California goes legal, there you go.

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,020
Ah, that's interesting. I think there's
going to be states that resisted still.

180
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,090
There's guys like that, Jeff
Jeff sessions guy who's, um,

181
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,110
coming into office with Trump who's,
who could be an issue,

182
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,520
but I don't think it will be because I
think Trump is a business person. Yeah.

183
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,770
He's a business person. He's not just a
business person. He's a populist. Right.

184
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,020
He's going to, he's going to want
people to like him and you know,

185
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:52,550
and it doesn't make sense. It's
not a logical move, you know? Wow.

186
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,500
It's weird as he is,
he's not illogical.

187
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,060
Like Hillary Clinton was illogical and
this is why I say that. And people like,

188
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:02,130
cause I've got a lot of shit from people
that are like Super Pro Hashtag I'm

189
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:03,960
with her. And I'm like, look man,

190
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,830
she didn't support gay
marriage until 2013.

191
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,780
Do you know how crazy that is?

192
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,850
Until 2013 Hillary Clinton was saying
that she believes that marriage was

193
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:18,540
between a man and a woman. It was a
sacred union and it should be protected.

194
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,280
So it's one of two things.

195
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,820
Either she actually believed that or she
was in bed with people who were forcing

196
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:25,650
her to behave that way or say that,

197
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,290
or she thought that she had to
say that in order to get elected.

198
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:33,150
Did Ordway you're not
getting either way? No. No,

199
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,070
you can't. You can't. You can't be a part
of that. I attended my first gay wedding.

200
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,220
Okay.
