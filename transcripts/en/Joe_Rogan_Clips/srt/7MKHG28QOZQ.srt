1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,250
A lot of this early work was reported
and there was no voucher specimens to

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,470
document the collection.
So a lot of it had to be dismissed,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,880
you know, uh, they,

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:18,720
the Beta carbon chemistry
of banisteriopsis didn't
really get well defined

5
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:22,770
until, um, some Chinese scientists, uh,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,800
or at least they have Chinese name worked
on them and discovered harming tetra

7
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,710
hydro harming and the harmer
lien as the main alkaloids.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,460
They could reference that to
botanical voucher specimens.

9
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,510
So they really should get the
credit for discovering it.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,130
And then once that was done,
then it was known and you know,

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,200
other scientists had to acknowledge that.
Why did they describe it as telepathy?

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,250
That there was supposedly some sort
of a story about some group telepathic

13
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:57,750
experience. Yeah. This was just
romantic. This was just some story,

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,620
you know, out of the literature. Um,

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,690
yeah. I mean, I mean it, it was
rumored to be able to cause telepathy,

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,190
but this wasn't Iowasca they
were only taking hormone.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,760
It's not clear. It's not
clear. It's not clear. Yeah.

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,640
I mean they may have been taken
but they may have been taking it.

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,890
But whether they were getting telepathy,

20
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:24,000
I kind of doubt it when we know
we could get telepathy on Iowasca.

21
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,030
It's not so uncommon.
It happens all the time.

22
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,750
People have group hallucinations,
group visions.

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,930
Has anybody ever bothered to independently
legs a quest or people put them into

24
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,070
like a different rooms,

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,310
have them do Iowasca and then have them
describe a very similar experience are

26
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:48,630
almost identical experience to prove that
these telepathic you experiences exist

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,860
or at least to as far as I
know that hasn't been done.

28
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:58,110
See yeah cause everybody wants to talk
afterwards. I do see the dragon. Right.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,640
I don't think that's been dug. That
seems like a worthy study. Cause if,

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,050
if I've heard from more than one person,
in fact,

31
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:11,330
my friend Kyle Kingsbury and his wife
had an Iowasca experience with a,

32
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:16,331
both had a visualization of their child
and then when they got back she was

33
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:22,200
pregnant and they want to having this
child from their visualization from,

34
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:25,890
from, from this experience. Um,

35
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,680
obviously they're very close and
they were together and they probably

36
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,900
communicated quite a bit.
And you know,

37
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,300
I would just think it'd be
really interesting experiment.

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,940
It would be very interesting. I mean,
and that sort of points out there is,

39
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,850
you know,
a realm of experience,

40
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:46,851
a realm of knowing that these things give
access to that's normally close to us.

41
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,650
I mean, that's kind of a
trivial statement of course. Um,

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,280
but then you get down to questions
of how verifiable is that?

43
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:00,400
How real is that? How, uh, you know, and,

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,040
and people get,
um,

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,690
I don't know if the term is hung up,

46
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:08,690
but they can get baffled
when you start talking about,

47
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:15,350
you know, the reality of say the
entities you encounter on DMT. I mean,

48
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:16,680
this is, this is, uh,

49
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,700
some people I know are obsessed with
trying to verify the reality of the

50
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:26,320
entities that you find on DMT.
And again,

51
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,230
it comes down to if you experience some,
they're real.

52
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,910
If anything you experienced as
real because you've experienced it.

53
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:39,210
Does it have a corresponding
existence in the external world?

54
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,280
Well, you know, what's external?
What's internal? You know, we, we,

55
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,480
we throw around these terms,
these,

56
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:52,370
these epistemological metaphysical
terms quite carelessly,

57
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,680
you know,
without really thinking about it.

58
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:59,390
What does it mean when you say
I'm in here and you're out there,

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,111
you know,

60
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:04,100
and then you take a psychedelic and you
realize that's an artificial boundary.

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,580
You know, we're all one.
There is no separation.

62
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,490
It's separate in normal consciousness
though it's separated in normal conscious.

63
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,640
But then what is normal conscious if
not a reflection of your neuro chemical,

64
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,060
brain, state. I mean,

65
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,090
everything you experience is an altered
state because it's filtered into this

66
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:27,300
brain processed by the brain and you know,

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,500
the brain is a biochemical
engine that, you know, as I say,

68
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,210
often we're made out of drug.

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,240
So it seems that our normal consciousness
is the best state to propagate

70
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:43,701
biological life and to keep our s are
whatever we've created in terms of our

71
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,410
community structures and relationships
and friendships and the ability to build

72
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:52,060
structures and houses and
things like that. These,

73
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,180
all these things are done best
when you're here and present,

74
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,170
whereas when you're on a psychedelic
state, I agree with you. Well,

75
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:03,990
the way I've always described it as if
you had a meeting with God and you went

76
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,220
and God gave you all the answers to the
world and you have, you experienced, uh,

77
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,680
undeniable beauty in the most extreme
form possible where you couldn't have

78
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,110
imagined it and then you came back.

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,320
Whether you hallucinate it or not, it's
the exact same experience. Exactly.

80
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,680
I can't put it on a scale.

81
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,660
You can't weigh it like we've stretched
the tape measure around and God is 47

82
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,570
inches across. Like just because,
you know what I'm saying?

83
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:35,320
Just because you can't draw and
measure it with what we term our, our,

84
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:39,480
our, you know, our metrics
for reality. Right.

85
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,120
And that is exactly the,
the thing.

86
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,850
Don't worry about whether it's real
and the way we would define real.

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,250
Is it good information or is it bad
air, is it not? That's the thing.

88
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,820
It doesn't matter where it comes from.
It's such a fits good information.

89
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,370
Then it has its own internal validity.

90
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:03,371
I'm whether it came from some part of
yourself that is normally up security,

91
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:09,470
you or a came from the plant teacher
or the aliens transmitting it through.

92
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,190
It doesn't really matter. But
we, we are obsessed with that.

93
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,480
We are specific reality because we
think we're being fooled a lot. Right?

94
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:17,741
Like the,

95
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:22,741
and this goes back to Terrance's
La Chorrera psychedelic
experience where he had

96
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,290
a Ufo encounter,
you know,

97
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,090
easily dismissing amongst us would go
while he's tripping his balls off on

98
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:33,110
mushrooms. Of course I saw you. Oh, is
there a leprechaun drive in the UFO?

99
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,350
Like all that's nonsense, right?
Right. Easy to dismiss. Yeah.

100
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,140
And in fact,
that is the nature of these phenomena.

101
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,980
That's what's really interesting.
Easy to dismiss that.

102
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,660
That was another aspect of the experiment
of the La Chorrera I left out when I

103
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,950
was talking about my lecture.

104
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:56,951
But there's almost always an element of
absurdity in these experiences and the

105
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:02,840
imperil normal experiences
in Ufo encounters.

106
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,620
It's like little green man.
Are you kidding?

107
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,710
But right the fuck there are little
green man and little blue man.
