1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,090
Right? And then what we have is just
like, uh, I kind of like, uh, um, uh,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,630
I guess you could say what a capitalist
commune or I don't know what you'd call

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:09,701
it.

4
00:00:09,701 --> 00:00:14,460
It's like a group of people communing
together is seeking to like extract money

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:19,440
from the universe, but also like,
you know what comes to mind? Sorry.

6
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,440
Anyone from blizzard is listening. You're
like, it doesn't like your job there.

7
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:26,280
But I got to, I went to on this
tour of blizzard and they fucking,

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,870
every company that makes video games,

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,900
they make the best video games outside
of like the only gay by notch up with it.

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,840
Right now I'm in the God of war.
It's so fucking good,

11
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,500
but it looks pretty bad ass.
It is amazing. It is amazing,

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,150
dude. It's the first triple a game I've
liked and so long. What's a AAA games?

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,740
It's called AAA. Aaa. It's a really
expensive game to make. It's like,

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,450
it's like a hardcore big time. Pull
up a video. So he got a war. God,

15
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,430
it's so graphics are pretty fucking
incredible, dude. Dude. It's beautiful.

16
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,600
Don't get me gift. Fuck that alien
damn bullshit. God. A war is like,

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,440
it's so good man.
And like I'm stuck in here.

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,820
Right, so you put on the HTC vive
today, the new one that we have. Yeah.

19
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,680
You didn't get into a game yet.
There's,

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,840
there's some games in it where you're just
like, Whoa, I see where this is going.

21
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,800
And I saw that from yours, but yours
was when I was over at your place.

22
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:23,340
What was that? Two or three years
ago? Probably two years ago.

23
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,120
Look how good the Freightos.
Oh good. That is you.

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,540
You see like the dirt on his hands.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,720
It's like you're watching an episode
of Vikings. It's really good. And it's,

26
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:34,560
and it's like bitch ass fucking thing
freezing up again. Here it goes.

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,930
So this is actual gameplay. Yeah. See why
is this dude, that's fucking Gameplay,

28
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,590
dude. That's gameplay. That's game plan.
That's amazing. Yeah, it's incredible.

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,010
It's amazing. She's so
hot. It's very hot. I know.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,870
You think you could hang out with a trick.

31
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,460
It was like cut people's
heads off of sorts.

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,270
Absolutely. Look at her.
Look at him, brother.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,750
Her fucking bad dude.

34
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:06,460
What's great about this game is not just
the graphics which are incredible or

35
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,430
the fight mechanics,
which are also incredible,

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,760
but the fucking story is really good and
the acting is really good and like the

37
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,910
relationships between
characters are really intense.

38
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,630
This game will make you like tear up man.
Like it's like fucking shit.

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,350
You see what he just did chop that
dude and half with an ax. Holy Fuck Up.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,950
He's just got smashed by Chad smashed. He
gets smashed a lot, but he's created us.

41
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:37,180
The God of war. He doesn't give
a fuck. Does not give a fuck man.

42
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:40,480
That's incredible. I wouldn't even
show much more of this. It's spoilers.

43
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:43,360
I don't want anybody to see any of the
characters and to know what's happening

44
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:46,960
because it's that good. Like it's
such a good game. Most Games,

45
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:50,050
the way I've played video games is I
try to rush through it for some reason,

46
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:52,990
which is really dumb to be like,
oh, I got to win this thing.

47
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,770
This one you want to hang out,
look around,

48
00:02:56,771 --> 00:03:01,180
like see the landscape.
Like you get really into it.

49
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,860
It's a glorious game.

50
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,510
But you know that to get back to where
we're talking about it, blizzard,

51
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,680
uh,
one of the people working there told me,

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,400
we like building world of Warcraft
because we like playing world of Warcraft.

53
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,910
We've created a dimension we want
to be inside of like we enjoy it,

54
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,870
they love it. Like, and,

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,940
and that's why the game is so good because
it's being made by people who enjoy

56
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:34,390
playing the game. So I don't know
how many hours they work at blizzard.

57
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,630
I imagine it's, it can be a
pretty brutal schedule, but,

58
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,920
and in anything you do, even things
that you love, I know become grueling.

59
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,921
But I think that example of a company
versus a company where you're like either

60
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,650
doing something that you don't even need
to be there to do or oh, no comparison.

61
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,550
No comparison.

62
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,530
Medium might be massive hours a day,

63
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,990
but I bet you're having a great
time a lot of the time and the,

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,330
the actual results and saying,
you know,

65
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:06,080
I was friends with a lot of those guys
from id software back in the quick two

66
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,330
days. Yeah. And played quake three.

67
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,640
I got to play quake three before
it ever came out with you.

68
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,190
That's what's his name was cliff.
Nope, that's, that's cliffy be, he's,

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,020
it's soft. It's softwares doom
and quake. Cliffy B is unreal.

70
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,030
And uh,

71
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,370
no, I was with you and cliffy be gave it
to her. I didn't see the quake tourists.

72
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,210
They're both amazing. But we, yeah,

73
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:32,260
we got to see unreal tournament when
they were putting that together and they

74
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:35,830
were putting together this new engine
that will end up being used in a bunch of

75
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:38,770
different games afterward.
But it was fucking crazy.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
We get to see the graphics like
as they're designing things.

77
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,200
And same thing with a, the quake studios,
but those guys all were crazy gamers.

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,500
They would get land parties and sync
all this. We played at the ID software.

79
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,460
We've got to play death matches
between everybody in the studio.

80
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,980
It was awesome to play quake with the
guys who made quake. Fucking cool.

81
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:02,050
The Fun of Shit ever. Fucking
cool man. And you know, I mean,

82
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,670
what they did was,

83
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,760
if you've never played one of those games
before, the three dimensional games,

84
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,750
when you're running down, you hear things
over here behind you and you like you,

85
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,411
you,
you know,

86
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,370
you could turn around and sneak around
corners and people are chasing around the

87
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,790
map and sometimes you could walk and it
doesn't make any noise or you can run

88
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,930
and you can hear the footsteps.
Fucking cool. Fuck. It's the crazy.

89
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,630
There's so adrenaline packed when you're
playing those games like these guys,

90
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,200
I'm so terrified we're putting a lan
in here in the next couple of weeks.

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,120
Now you are. Oh, we're going to you
and I, we're going to have some fun.

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,810
Well, no or not because you're
going to be me at fucking quake.

93
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:44,520
I suck at shooter's. Dude. Played in
forever please and played it for forever.

94
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:48,180
I'll probably be terrible
for dues the first 16 hours.

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,350
If I like had a shrink ray and shrunk.
You like India,

96
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,980
like a eight year old,
you would still beat me at shooters.

97
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,060
I suck at fucking shooters, man. I'm
not your thing. What do you like?

98
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,110
You like those, uh, role playing.
You don't want to say it dude,

99
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,730
cause you're going to make fun
of me. I won't do it. Come on.

100
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,650
I like Hearthstone man.
Was that what it is?

101
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:13,070
I can fell for it.
He didn't fall for it and being sincere.

102
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,160
I don't know what it is.
Online fantasy card game.

103
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,980
It's like a furry thing like furries.

104
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,960
I love comedians seminar cause it's
like I knew you're going to insult me.

105
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,550
I just didn't know how and
like it's way the way you did.

106
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:33,140
It was way worse than I expected.
Thank you. Pretend to be a Fox, right?

107
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,050
You're like Fox skin.
Are you other than you other kids,

108
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,810
is that what it is to
just get a kick out of it?

109
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,760
Do you ever do in your footie pajamas?
I'm like a little bunny rabbit tail and

110
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,670
I in the woods and I'm a rabbit.
Ah Fuck Man.

111
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,470
I've gotta be clever to get
away from the farm. Right.

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,650
Let me tell you something.
It's a wonderful fucking game with,

113
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:02,000
and it's deep and it's got
a lot of strategy and I, and
I, and I love playing it,

114
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,410
man. I really do. I'm
not good at it anymore.

115
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,930
I went through a period of being good.

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,740
I haven't played it in awhile
because I've been playing God a war,

117
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:13,520
but oh yeah,
this looks like death.

118
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,510
What is happening? What is happening
here? Let's see your cards. Yeah,

119
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,790
they're cards.
You basically like,

120
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm not going to explain the rules of
Hearthstone on your show, dude, but

121
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,770
great games is killing me. It's
a great, it's a great, very fun,

122
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,040
very enjoyable game.
Good game for nine year old girls too.

123
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:40,040
It looks like I get it for my kids.

124
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm just thinking like odd to do is
safe star craft or I could alive,

125
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,430
but I knew I didn't tell you the truth,
but I knew you were addicted to that.

126
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,750
You had a real problem with that.
