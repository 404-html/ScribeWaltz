1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,380
Hello Freak bitches. Anyway, thanks for
coming you guys. Thanks for having us.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,180
It's a weird time.
You know,

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:10,210
I've been extra weirded out over the
last couple of months and I just got back

4
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,700
from Mexico. I was on vacation
and I didn't do shit for a week.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
And in not doing anything for a week,

6
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,370
I really got a chance to sit
down and think about stuff.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,450
And I'm more weirded out by life today
than I think I ever have been before.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,680
So I'm excited to have you on because I
want to hear your story because Sam has

9
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:31,681
been telling me about it and I looked
into it and it's d please explain like

10
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:36,130
what happened to you, like where
you were and what happened to you.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,800
Okay, so it was, uh, you're,

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,510
you're talking about the
panic attack was 2004.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,840
I was on a little show that we do at ABC
news called Good Morning America shots,

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,900
a big show out, a little shell.
It's not a little show. And I was,

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,290
I was doing the job that I was
filling in as the newsreader.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,500
That's the person who comes on at the
top of each hour and read the headlines.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,690
And, uh, I just freaked
out. I just lost it.

18
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,260
So it was a couple of
seconds into it and I,

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,540
I started to get really scared and
it just, uh, if you've ever had,

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,690
have you ever had a panic of no.
So it's like anxiety on steroids,

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,750
so you start to worry, but then your
fight or flight instincts kick in. So, um,

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,680
your lung seize up, your palms
start sweating, your mouth dries up,

23
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:27,680
your heart is racing, your
mind is racing. You just,

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,470
I couldn't breathe and
therefore couldn't speak.

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,090
So a couple seconds into reading what
was supposed to be six stories right off

26
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,800
of the teleprompter,
I just,

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
I lost the capacity to speak and
I had to kind of squeak out. Uh,

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,340
something about, you know,
back to you, back to the main
anchors. Wow. That sucked.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,320
Uncontrollable. No. What,
what caused it? Uh, no, I do.

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,230
Yeah, definitely. No. Um,

31
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,230
it's some dumb behavior in my
personal life is what caused it.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,720
I had spent a lot of time as, as
a war reporter at ABC News. Um,

33
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,250
I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan,
Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, six,

34
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:11,500
six trips to Iraq. And, uh, I had
come home from a long run and I,

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,890
I covered, uh, Kinda the
pre-invasion invasion and then, uh,

36
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,340
insurgency in one's kind of six month run.
And I came home after that and I,

37
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,440
I got depressed and I didn't
actually know I was depressed,

38
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,820
but I was having some obvious
symptoms in hindsight. Uh,

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,300
I was having trouble getting out of bed.

40
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,150
I felt like I'd had a low
grade fever all the time.

41
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,670
And then I did something really smart,

42
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:39,260
which is I started to self medicate
with the cocaine and ecstasy. Uh,

43
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,540
and even though I wasn't
doing it all the time,

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,640
I like to say it wasn't
like that, you know, the,

45
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,640
you ever seen the wolf of Wall Street
where they're popping ludes that that

46
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:50,720
wasn't me. I W and I wasn't getting
high on the air or anything like that,

47
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,860
but you know,
I was getting,

48
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:56,270
I was partying in my spare time
because it made me feel better. Uh,

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,350
so after I had the panic attack,

50
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:00,760
I went to a doctor who's an in panic
and he started asking me a bunch of

51
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,310
questions, try to figure out what,
what, what had caused the panic attack.

52
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,690
And one of the questions was, do
you do drugs? And I was like, yeah,

53
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:12,390
I do drugs. And he leaned back in his
chair and gave me a look that's, uh,

54
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,290
communicated, uh, the following sentiment.
Um, okay, asshole, mystery solved.

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,240
And he just pointed out that,
you know,

56
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,740
you raised the level of adrenaline
in your brain artificially, uh, you,

57
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,600
you make it much more likely to have a
panic attack. And I at at, at baseline,

58
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,130
I'm a jittery little dude,
so it doesn't,

59
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,160
it doesn't take much
to put me in that zone.

60
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,630
We just offered me coffee and I said,
no, because even that will freak me out.

61
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,070
Well, it's weird that ecstasy and cocaine
was the combination because ecstasy is

62
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,070
something that they actually give
to a lot of soldiers that have PTSD.

63
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,560
And there's been quite a few
tests on that. Yeah. I don't,

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,230
I don't actually think ecstasy
was the problem. The coke,

65
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,620
I think it was a coke when it makes sense.
Yeah.

66
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,320
So those are the two drugs I was mostly
doing. How often were you doing it?

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,210
I would say,
you know,

68
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,510
there would be months where I wasn't doing
it at all because I would, I was off,

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,440
I covered the 2004 presidential campaign
and I didn't have a lot of time to be

70
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,630
snorting coke. So, um, but when
I was home and around my friends,

71
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,080
you know, on a good, on a busy week,
you know, two, three times a week. Wow.

72
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,960
That's a lot. Yeah, that'll
do. Yeah. There's a,

73
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,590
there's a comeback right now that,
uh,

74
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:26,920
cocaine is experiencing really ever go
away. Did, I dunno, I've never done it.

75
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,620
Was there some sort of cocaine recession
that it had to bounce back from?

76
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,840
Believe there was really, no, this is
what I'm talking totally. Ignorantly.

77
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,150
I'd been out of the game for a
long time, so, yeah. Yeah. I'm,

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,180
I'm kind of boring now. Um, uh,

79
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,640
but it feels to me like it's kind of a
perennial favorite. Yeah. I don't know.

80
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:47,530
I mean, I feel like it went through a
recession. Maybe it's just my perception.

81
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,420
I had a buddy of mine when I was in high
school and his cousin was a hooked on

82
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:54,670
coke and I watched while
we're in high school,

83
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,410
we start selling it and he withered away,

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,570
lost like 30 pounds or
something like that.

85
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:01,570
And just him and his girlfriend just
hide out in the attic. They lived,

86
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:02,650
they had an attic apartment.

87
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,950
They would just hide out there and watch
TV and do coke and sell coke to people.

88
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,630
And I was like, well, fuck
that drug, whatever that drugs
do. And like these people,

89
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,320
it's like, it was almost
like knowing someone who had
gotten bitten by a vampire.

90
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,110
Right. It becomes something
different. It was very strange.

91
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,970
So my experience is seeing people
do that led me to never do it. Yeah.

92
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:25,100
I mean, it certainly was not like
that for me, but you know, I,

93
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,080
I could see it over the horizon. You can,
it's an incredibly addictive drug. Um,

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,400
so I think you've made the right
call. Yeah. It seems a little,

95
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:37,450
it's got a little too much gravity
attached to it. Yeah. I mean, you, you,

96
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,620
you can get hooked and it will bring you
down. There are other drugs you can do.

97
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:45,880
I'm not recommending drugs, but, uh, the
way my friends, Sam, my half brother,

98
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:50,830
Sam over there,
uh,

99
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,720
there are other drugs, drugs you can do
that have vastly lower addictive, uh,

100
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,500
a character, a character. What's the word
I'm looking for here? So, characteristics.

101
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,040
Yes. Thank you. Um, so
how did you recover?

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,580
I,
so I wasn't actually doing it that long.

103
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,310
I actually never done hard
drugs into my early thirties,

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,880
and when I came home from the war zones
and, um, and that's what started it. Yeah.

105
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,970
Yeah. Just were freaked out by seeing too
much. No, it's actually, it wasn't PTSD.

106
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,320
Uh, it was, I was addicted to the
adrenaline I was having. I was,

107
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,700
it was not that I was traumatized,

108
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,910
it was that I was enjoying it too much
and I would come home in the world would

109
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:33,230
seem gray and boring. Uh, yes. That was,

110
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,390
that was the problem. Did you watch hurt
locker? I'm sure he did it right. Yeah.

111
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,880
Did that resonate with you? It's been
awhile since I watched it, but apps,

112
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,631
absolutely.

113
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:46,160
I want to just be clear
that the experience of a
journalist is so different from

114
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:50,420
the experience, so much more
mild than the experience of, uh,

115
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,700
an enlisted man or a woman.

116
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,220
So I don't want to compare my
experience to the hurt locker. I'm a,

117
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,280
I'm a observer on the side and I,
and,

118
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,330
and I don't even want to compare my
experience to more experienced war

119
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,410
correspondents out there. I'm thinking
of like guys like Richard Angle on NBC.

120
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,770
Absolutely. I just actually sat
down with him the other day for,

121
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,630
he's got a new documentary coming out.
Um,

122
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,770
my experiences are much
more mild than that,

123
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:19,520
but certainly enough to really get
a sense of how thrilling it is.

124
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,211
There's an expression,

125
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:23,930
there's nothing more thrilling than the
bullet that misses you. And in my case,

126
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:28,340
luckily they all missed. That was
not true for some of my friends. Um,

127
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,410
but you, so I had a real sense of
the stakes. But 80 is exciting. Uh,

128
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,870
it's also thrilling on a, um,
on a idealistic level. I mean,

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,600
I believe in the importance of
bearing witness to the what?

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,060
To the tip of the spear,
to what we're doing,

131
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,410
to what our military is doing in our name.
So all of that is a heady mix.

132
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,210
So you knew people over
there, a journalist that got
killed? Oh yeah, absolutely.

133
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,980
A very good friend of mine,

134
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,970
the guy who actually ultimately set
me up with my wife is a guy named Bob

135
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,960
Woodruff, who was the anchor of
world news tonight on ABC News.

136
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,900
He had only been in the chair for about
a month when he was on a trip to Iraq

137
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,900
and he got hit,
literally got his head,

138
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,300
and you're really blown off
when he was in the back,

139
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,300
when he was in the top of an Iraqi tank.
Uh,

140
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,820
almost died is an
absolute miracle is alive.

141
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:20,810
There are pictures of him on the
Internet with basically half ahead. Um,

142
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,160
traumatic brain injury was
brought back to life. Is,

143
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,260
is to this day walking
miracle that he's alive. Uh,

144
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,140
and after he recovered, he then
introduced me to the woman I married.

145
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,960
Uh, so he's a close friend and I, uh,

146
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,900
I saw cases like that and lost friends,

147
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,730
both Iraqi friends and
journalists, friends. Um, my,

148
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,220
the woman I was dating at the time when I,

149
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,390
when I was spending a lot of time in
Iraq, she got hit by a tank shell. Um,

150
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,770
she was in, in the, the hotel
Palestine where all the were staying.

151
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,810
She was on a balcony in, or one of
her colleagues in the balcony below,

152
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:03,330
or he got a direct hit and died. Uh, he,

153
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,020
she carried him to the hospital and she
basically got the reverberations and

154
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,630
couldn't hear. Still can't
hear as far as I know. Hmm.

155
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,643
Ooh.

156
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,830
When you're a journalist and you're
over in Iraq or in Afghanistan,

157
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:17,674
you're in war,

158
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:23,190
and what you're experiencing is so far
removed from the day to day life that

159
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:29,080
most people experience. What, what is
it like trying to relay that to people?

160
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:33,760
How difficult is it trying to cause so
I think so many people have this almost,

161
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,480
um,
dramatic television movie slash view of,

162
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,380
of war where they don't,
they don't ever experience it.

163
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:46,381
Like I would imagine probably 99% of
the people that are in this country will

164
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:48,230
never expect it.

165
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,030
No. And that's good. Um, no, it's,
it's, it's, I don't know that you can,

166
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,690
uh, uh, describe it, uh,

167
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,610
in a way that will really give
the full picture of it's, uh,

168
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,800
absurdities and horrors and long
stretches of boredom punctuated by terror.

169
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,590
Um,

170
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,050
and also this other piece,
which is taboo to talk about,

171
00:10:12,051 --> 00:10:16,220
which is the pleasure and excitement.
Then people get fighting wars. I mean,

172
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:19,080
they go, this is Sebastian
younger thesis as well. I mean,

173
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,840
there's just a camaraderie is the most
intense comradery they ever experienced.

174
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:27,740
And so that, that's something they come
back to civilian life and are missing it.

175
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:30,870
And, and it's part of what's
so difficult about coming back

176
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,570
and that's why you see them a lot of,
uh, risk taking behavior among, uh,

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,890
vets, um, eat,

178
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,120
because I know that you're looking for
another way to get that hit of adrenaline

179
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:46,470
for sure. There was a, uh, there's
a book and I'm blanking on the name,

180
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:50,280
is a great book written by a much more
experienced war corresponded to me.

181
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:55,350
He used the phrase war is a
drug and that to me sums it up,

182
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:56,850
at least in my experience,

183
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,940
I got hooked on the experience of being
in these really elevated situations,

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,960
heightened situations,
cinematic dramatic situations.

185
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:11,370
And I would come home and I just,
I didn't know what to do to replace it.

186
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:16,371
And so this synthetic squirt of adrenaline
that you can get from cocaine seem to

187
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:22,200
do it for me, obviously had
tremendously negative consequences.

188
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,830
And so I wouldn't recommend it,
but I see why people do this.

189
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,190
So how did you,
how did you bounce back?

190
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,133
Oh,

191
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,470
that was actually the question you asked
me before that I somehow neglected to

192
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,560
answer.
So the doctor who pointed out that I was

193
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:38,850
okay,

194
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,810
an idiot and doing drugs and
it caused the panic attack, uh,

195
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,230
I agreed he didn't think I needed
to go to rehab because it was the,

196
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,170
it was pretty short lived. It was, I
was in my early thirties when I started,

197
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:51,480
and it's still in my early
thirties when I had a panic attack.

198
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,490
And so it was only a
couple of, he said, just,

199
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:59,440
I want you to come see me once or
twice a week, forever, a forever.

200
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,290
He said basically indefinitely. Um, so
I still see him, but not, not, yeah,

201
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:10,030
it's a good business model, but not that,
I mean, it's been, well north of, uh,

202
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,090
it's been about 13 years,
so I don't see him that often now,

203
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:17,590
but for a long time I saw him
intensively. Uh, so that, uh, you know,

204
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:22,300
it wasn't easy. It's not easy.
Um, and I wouldn't have, I
wouldn't call what, I mean,

205
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,740
there are people who have
had drug addictions that
are vastly more severe than

206
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:28,820
mine. Right. Um, but it's, uh,

207
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:33,280
it sucks to stop a habit that is
giving you pleasure on, you know,

208
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,780
pretty in pretty, um,
prominent areas of your brain.

209
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:46,900
Yeah.
