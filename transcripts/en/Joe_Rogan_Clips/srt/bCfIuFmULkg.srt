00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,950
Hello Freak bitches.
The thing about the postmodernists,

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:09,000
and I'm going to speak mostly about
Jacques Derrida because I'll consider him

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,440
the central villain. Now. He actually, he,

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,010
he may make a point explain who he is.
Oh, he's a, he's a French philosopher,

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:17,970
French intellectual,

6
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:22,590
who became quite popular in the late
1970s and then was introduced to North

7
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:25,080
America through the Yale Department
of English. And of course,

8
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,380
English literature is one
of the disciplines that has
become entirely corrupt.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,780
And so
Derrida wasn't Marxists to begin with,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,670
but that fell out of favor because it
turned out that Marxist political doctrine

11
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,350
kept producing evil empires.

12
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:45,000
And even radical left French intellectuals
were forced to admit that by the mid

13
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:49,770
1970s, you know, they'd put their head
in the sand for 20 years, 50 years,

14
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,910
really, uh, thoroughly in the sand and
made sure their ears were full too.

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,800
But by the mid 1970s,

16
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:59,670
the evidence that that was the case
was so overwhelming that even a French

17
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:01,500
intellectual couldn't deny it anymore.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,470
And so they started to play sleight
of hand with the Marxist ideas.

19
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:09,471
So instead of trying to
promote the revolution of the
working class against the,

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,000
against the capitalist class,

21
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,390
let's say they started to play
identity politics and said, well,

22
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,450
we can just separate everybody
into oppressed versus so presser,

23
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:22,110
but we don't have to do it on economic
grounds and so weak and we can call it

24
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,750
power instead of economics.
So that was part of it.

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,670
And then the other thing
about the fundamental critique
that Derrida focused on

26
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:34,671
this is this is this is really worth
laying out because the problem that he

27
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,490
discovered,

28
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,640
the postmodernist discovered
was discovered by a variety
of other people at the

29
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,370
same time in other disciplines.
So for example,

30
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,050
among the peep people who were studying
artificial intelligence since the early

31
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,920
1960s it was always supposed that we'd
be able to make machines that could move

32
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:52,320
around in a natural environment
without too much problem.

33
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,430
And the reason we could do that was
because the world in some sense was just

34
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:58,380
made out of simple objects.
There they are.

35
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:01,770
And all you have to do is look at them
and you see them. And that's vision.

36
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:05,520
And then the complex problem is
not how to see or what to see,

37
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,800
but how to act in
reference to what you see.

38
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,640
But it turned out that the AI
people ran into this problem,

39
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,570
essentially sometimes known as the
frame problem. And the frame problem is,

40
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,840
is that there's almost an infinite
number of ways to look at a finite set of

41
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:23,190
objects.
So the fact that that vision,

42
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:27,090
for example, it turns out to be way, way,
way more complicated than anybody ever,

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,760
ever estimated.
In fact,

44
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:33,210
you can't actually solve the vision
problem until you solve the embodiment

45
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,410
problem. So, uh,

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
an artificial intelligence that doesn't
have a body can't really see because

47
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,460
seeing is actually the mapping
of the world on to action.

48
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,260
And so that was figured out more or less
by a robotics engineer called Rodney

49
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,770
Brooks.
But,

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,330
but what's at the bottom of this is the
idea that any set of phenomena can be

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,400
seen a very large number of ways.

52
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,070
So like there's a bunch of pens
in front of me here, you know?

53
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:56,910
And when I look at the,

54
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,450
my brain basically notes that are
grippable object with which I can, right?

55
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,100
So I see the function like, like if
you look at a beanbag, you see a chair,

56
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,130
not because it's got four
legs and a seat in the back,

57
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:12,340
but because you can sit on it and,
and most of what we see in the world,

58
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:16,330
we actually see functionally rather than
see as an object and then interpret the

59
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:20,690
object and then figure out what to do.
So the function of the object constraints,

60
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:24,040
our interpretation, but there's an
endless number of interpretations.

61
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,850
So for example, if I was going
to paint that paint on canvas,

62
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,150
this set of pans and try to do
it in a photo realistic way,

63
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,570
I would be looking at tiny details of
these objects that the multiple shades of

64
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,490
red that are there and the multiple
shades of white and black. And you know,

65
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,120
I would decompose it
in many went many ways.

66
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,510
And so the AI guys ran into this problem,

67
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:50,020
which was that looking at the world
turned out to be exceptionally complex.

68
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,100
And that's still being solved
now. Okay. In in literature,

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,810
the same thing happened.
What,

70
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,650
what the postmodernist realized was
that if you took a complex book,

71
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,710
let's say the Bible for example,
or a Shakespeare play,

72
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,300
there's an endless number of potential
interpretations that you can derive from

73
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:11,950
it because it's so complex and so
sophisticated. So imagine that, well,

74
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,340
you can interpret the word,
you can interpret the phrase,

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,010
you can interpret the sentence,
you can interpret the paragraph,

76
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,190
you can interpret the,
the chapter, let's say.

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,210
You have to interpret that within the
confines of the entire work then of the

78
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,260
entire tradition.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,150
And then within the context of discussion
that you're currently having and all

80
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,640
of those things affect how you're going
to interpret the play. So there's an,

81
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,510
so that their conclusion was,
well,

82
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,970
there's an infinite number
of ways to interpret a text.

83
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,500
And then their conclusion was,
well,

84
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:45,400
there's an infinite number of ways to
interpret the world. And there's a,

85
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:49,780
there's a way in which that's correct.
And so the next conclusion was,

86
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,740
there's no right way to do it
so you could do it any old way.

87
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,110
And then their next conclusion was,
oh,

88
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,080
and this is where the
Marxism creeped up again. Oh,

89
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,550
people interpret the world in a way that
facilitates their acquisition of power.

90
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,020
Now that's where the bloody theory
starts to get corrupt because yes,

91
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,280
a bit but also know, right? Because,
and this is why they're wrong.

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,520
This is why the wrong you see the world
is complicated beyond our ability to

93
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:23,530
comprehend. So there is a
very large number of ways you
can interpret it, but, but

94
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,150
you have to extract out from the world
a way a game from your interpretation

95
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,680
that you can actually play.

96
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,110
So if the lesson that you extract from
hamlet is you should kill your family and

97
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:42,550
yourself, then we might say that that's
not a very functional interpretation,

98
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,570
right? Because first of all, people
are going to object to that, right?

99
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,200
It ends your life. It ends many people's
lives. People are going to object to it.

100
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,560
And it isn't a game that you can play
over and over again in the world.

101
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,440
So when we're,
when we're interacting with the world,

102
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:01,280
you see what we're to do is to extract
out a set of tools that we can use to

103
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,490
function in the world because we're
constrained by the world so that we don't

104
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,540
suffer too much.

105
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,790
And so that the things that we need in
order to continue can be provided and we

106
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:15,380
need to extract those out in a way that
other people will so that other people

107
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,580
will cooperate and compete with us
in a peaceful and maintainable way.

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,260
So then you think,
well,

109
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,900
we have to extract out an interpretation
that allows us to live and thrive over

110
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,020
multiple periods of time in
multiple environments. Well,

111
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,920
we're doing the same thing
with other individuals who
are motivated the same way.

112
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,910
So there's a tremendous number of
constraints on our interpretations and the

113
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:42,380
postmodernists don't care about that at
all. All they do is say, well, no, no.

114
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,200
You can interpret the way the world,
the world anyway you want.

115
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,820
All people are ever doing is playing
power games based on their identity and

116
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:53,420
there's going to be no cross talk
between the power hierarchies.

117
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,640
It's not even allowed.

118
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,330
That's why they don't engage in dialogue
c just to talk to like let's say if

119
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,070
you're a,
if you're a postmodernist,

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,880
just to have a discussion with someone
like you, you know, a heterosexual,

121
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,350
what did they call it? A CIS gendered
male who have power, you know,

122
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,810
and and white to boot.
It's like that's,

123
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,080
that's an evil act in and of itself
because all you're doing by engaging in

124
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:18,740
dialogue with that person is
validating their, their power game.

125
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,450
That's all you see. And this isn't,
this isn't, this is no aberration,

126
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:27,410
that these people don't engage in
dialogue, that it's no aberration.

127
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,750
It's built right into
the philosophical system.

128
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,850
They regard the idea of the idea that
if you're in one power group and I'm in

129
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:38,900
another, the idea that we can step out
of that group, engage in a dialogue,

130
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,940
have our world's meat and produce some
sort of a understanding of it. Yeah. Yeah.

131
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:48,710
Some sort of negotiated understanding.
No, that's part of your,

132
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,960
your oppressive patriarchal
game. That idea, that whole
idea is part of your game.

133
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,460
So if I even engage in the dialogue,
I'm playing your game, you win.

134
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,910
It's a complete as complete.

135
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,220
People don't understand that postmodernism
is a complete assault on two things.

136
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,480
One is it's an assault on the
metaphysical substrate of our culture.

137
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,110
And I would say that the metaphysical
substrate looks something like a religious

138
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,210
substrate.
So it's a direct assault on that.

139
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,810
And the second thing it's an assault on
is everything that's been established

140
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:25,310
since the enlightenment, rationality,
empiricism, science, everything,

141
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:29,570
clarity of mind, dialogue, um,
the idea of the individual,

142
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,080
all of that is,
is not only you'd see,

143
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,090
it's not only that it's up
for grabs, that's not the
thing. It's to be destroyed.

144
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,210
That's the goal to be destroyed. Just
like the Communists wanted, you know, it,

145
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,790
the revolution to destroy the
capitalist system. It's the same thing.

146
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,980
These people now you might say,
well,

147
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,120
does every social justice warrior
activists no. This, it's like, well, no,

148
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:56,190
of course not.
It's not let any more than any,

149
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,880
every Muslim knows the entire Muslim
doctrine or Islamic doctrine or every

150
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,520
Christian knows the entire
Christian doctrine. You know,

151
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,060
it's fragmented among people.
But then when you bring them together,

152
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:09,300
the fragments unite and the
entire philosophy acts itself out.

153
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,570
So you don't think that this is in the
Pfarius plot by a few well planned out

154
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:18,120
individuals that have some sort of an eye,
an agenda,

155
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,810
that they're going to promote
this ideology because they,

156
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,150
and they understand what they're doing.
You,

157
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,390
you feel like it's what you're saying,

158
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:27,480
that there's a bunch
of different factions,

159
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,660
bunch a bunch of different parts to
this and it could be a lot of it is that

160
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:36,950
people feel disenfranchised
socially. Um, they,

161
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,010
they are empowered by their positions
in universities and by these insulated

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,800
environments and groups,

163
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
they're a intoxicated by the power that
they have over young people and shaping

164
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,890
their minds and, and, and,
and imposing their ideologies.

165
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,510
They receive feedback from these kids.
It builds up,

166
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,710
everything's strengthens.

167
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,950
They shore up the walls around
them and they push this forward.

168
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,460
And then when they have something like
this speech that you gave at mcmasters

169
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:09,510
and they get to actually act,
it unites them, unites them.

170
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,310
And this is what you're getting
from this glazed eye, you know cod?

171
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,350
Yeah, yeah. It's, it's as if it's
like Richard Dawkins id of meme.

172
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,450
You know, if you imagine that in
your, in your neuro neural structure,

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,970
whatever ideas that you're manifesting
are represented neuron by neuron.

174
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,460
Let's say it's a web of neurons,

175
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,370
not any one neuron has
the entire idea set.

176
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,980
This is obviously an oversimplification,
but you get the point.

177
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,550
There's a network from which
the idea emerges. Well the me,

178
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:46,551
my idea is is that an idea can rest
upon multiple individuals as if each

179
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,430
individual is a neuron.
And so,

180
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I mean there are people who are more or
less fully informed as to the nature of

181
00:10:56,841 --> 00:11:01,070
postmodern doctrine and they're
pushing it forward consciously and

182
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:04,850
unconsciously. There, there
are consciously pushing it
forward and acting it out.

183
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:09,710
And so there are individuals who are
more representative of the entire set of

184
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,900
ideas and individuals who
are less representative.

185
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,550
But if you get them together in a group,

186
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,630
the thing that animates them and
unites them is the common set of ideas.

187
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,770
And those ideas were produced by the
postmodern French intellectuals in the,

188
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,150
in the mid seventies, roughly speaking
shock, Derrida, Michel Foucault.

189
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,610
Foucault was the person who famously
pronounced that psychiatric diagnostic

190
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:35,840
categories were primarily social
in origin rather than biological.

191
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:38,210
And you know,
I read [inaudible] work,

192
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,710
I think it was madness and civilization
where he advanced that particular

193
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,400
doctrine. You can actually read Fuko
unlike Derrida and [inaudible]. Uh,

194
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,880
but I just found what he
was writing obvious. It's,

195
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,580
I knew from my clinical training that
psychiatric categories have a heavy

196
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:58,300
sociological construction.
Partly because psychiatry is into science.

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,200
Medicine isn't a science,
it's an applied science.

198
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:06,820
Those aren't the same thing at all. And
you know, a pure science is pure science.

199
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,840
It deals with scientific
categories like Adams,

200
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,300
but an applied science.
Well,

201
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,960
it's a compromise between all sorts of
different things and mental illnesses

202
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,420
themselves are shaped by
the social environment.

203
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,520
Even though often they
have a biological route,

204
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:25,330
the way they manifest themselves as
clearly shaped by society and language.

205
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,220
I didn't find his work the
least bit surprising. I thought,

206
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:30,880
well really,

207
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,880
I mean everyone who's a
sophisticated medical professional,

208
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:39,220
psychiatrists, psychologist,
everyone knows that it's like,

209
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,360
I mean there's a book called discovery
of the unconscious by a guy named Henri

210
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,800
[inaudible] that was written
in the believe in the
sixties great book on history

211
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:52,510
of psychoanalysis and like he covers the
shift in diagnostic categories across

212
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:57,430
time. It's self evident. So anyways,
there's all these French postmodernists,

213
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,430
they were all Marxists.

214
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,080
Most of them were student revolutionaries
in France in the late 1960s before

215
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,810
that all fell apart. And
they did two things. They,

216
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,570
they pulled out this a frame problem,
issue,

217
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,150
the issue of multiple
interpretations and said,

218
00:13:10,151 --> 00:13:13,690
well there's nothing that's canonical.
There's no overarching narrative,

219
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:17,170
there's no real interpretation.
And I already said why that's wrong.

220
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,310
And then the other thing they said was
they did the sh this slight of hand.

221
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:24,250
So instead of the working class
against the bourgeoisie, it was,

222
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,600
it was race against race or,
or gender against gender.

223
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,930
Unbelievably divisive.
It's all they believe in his identity.

224
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,990
There's no individual man
that's gone with postmodernism.

225
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,070
This isn't an accident. All of
this stuff, it's not random.

226
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,720
It's driven by these ideas.
Like the ideas are always at war always,

227
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,160
and we're in a war between these ideas.
I mean Marxism,

228
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,060
we already know it was tremendously
powerful doctrine and this is its newest

229
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,500
manifestation.

230
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,890
What is the motivation behind the
individuals that are at the heart of this

231
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:02,260
movement?
Well,

232
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,980
I would say that the
motivations are as complex as,

233
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,470
as human motivations are in general,

234
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,920
but they seem to have solidified
into a movement. Right?

235
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,440
Well I think the dangerous part of
it is that the, it's, it's a kind of,

236
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,960
it's almost like a scape goat mentality.
It's,

237
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,160
it's almost like
psychoanalytic projection.

238
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,380
That's another way of thinking about it.

239
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:26,710
It's like one of the things that I've
come to learn and one of the things I talk

240
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:31,090
about a lot is that the, the battle
between good and evil, so to speak,

241
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,100
isn't between states. And it's
not between individuals precisely.

242
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Although it manifests itself at those
levels. It's an internal battle,

243
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,350
a moral battle that happens inside people.

244
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:46,351
And so people have a broad capacity for
malevolence and for and for benevolence.

245
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,890
And that's a terrible war for people and
it's a terrible thing to understand and

246
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:52,671
realize.
In fact,

247
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,671
often when people realize their capacity
for malevolence if they're not prepared

248
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,070
for it, they developed post
traumatic stress disorder.

249
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:05,210
So that happens to soldiers in
battlefields. So they go out,

250
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,700
they're innocent guys,
you know, naive guys,

251
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,180
young guys and they go out onto a
battlefield and they get put in a really

252
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:13,420
stressful situation and you know,
they,

253
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:18,350
they step outside themselves and they
do something unbelievably vicious and

254
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,060
brutal and then they're broken.

255
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,690
They can't take that manifestation of
themself and put it with like Iowa Corn

256
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,880
Fed,
you know,

257
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,880
nice guy and no wonder because one is
like a flesh eating chimp chimpanzee on a

258
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,860
war rampage. And the other is, you know,

259
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,170
was a relatively well brought up and
polite farm boy from the middle of the

260
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:42,921
United States.

261
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,720
It's like how in the world you're going
to put those two things together. Well,

262
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:49,700
you can't, that's post traumatic
stress disorder. And to treat that,

263
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,090
my experience with post traumatic stress
disorder is that you have to teach

264
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,560
people a philosophy of evil,

265
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,030
of good and evil because otherwise they
can't recover. And I've had, I've had,

266
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,070
by the way,
in the last four months,

267
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,080
I've had two letters from people from
soldiers with PTSD and I met to personally

268
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,910
who said that watching my lectures had,

269
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,400
had brought them back
together because they,

270
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:16,430
they couldn't understand what
they had become before looking,

271
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,050
looking deeply at, at the,
at their malevolence now.

272
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,980
So I would say with regards to this
movement, this postmodern movement,

273
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,670
the malevolent aspect of it, there's
a, there's a couple of them. One,

274
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,280
it's complete,
unbelievably authoritarian.

275
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,220
Can I got a letter today from
a university student in Italy?

276
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:35,270
I don't know what university,

277
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:39,430
but she'd been having kind of a
flame war on Facebook with, uh,

278
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,690
with a social justice warrior.

279
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,690
And at the end she recommended that this
particular social justice warrior seek

280
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:50,930
out a local mental health counseling
unit and put a link to it in the,

281
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,000
in the exchange. And then she got
a letter from the university. I,

282
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,330
I guess the other person
that SJW type turned her in,

283
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,930
but she got a letter from the university
saying that that violated university

284
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:07,010
policy and constituted harassment and
that she should seriously consider

285
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:10,670
retracting it. And um, that,
you know, future employees,

286
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,890
employers might be looking
at what she posted.

287
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:16,820
And it was inappropriate to put that on
a public site. And it's like, I thought,

288
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,560
wow, if you, how could
you be so clueless as a,

289
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,980
as a administrator say to think that
your monitoring of your student's private

290
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,213
audiences,

291
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,850
you're monitoring it at an institutional
level and your intervention and threat

292
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:39,650
at an institutional level is
less dangerous than letting
to students, you know,

293
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,240
troll each other on, on a,
on a public social forum.

294
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,570
It's just, I just, I don't
know what to think about it.

295
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:51,240
It's just unbelievable that happened
and it's happening all over the place,

296
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:55,410
this sort of thing. And so there's
the authoritarian element to it,

297
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,880
which is a hatred of,

298
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,350
I think it's a hatred of
competence because competence
produces hierarchies that

299
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:05,430
aren't based on power.
I think it's a hatred of clear intellect,

300
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,020
um, hatred of clear interlink
Howso. What do you mean by that?

301
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,460
When you say clear intellectual,

302
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:14,310
you have a clear intellect
as far as I'm concerned.

303
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:19,311
I think that's why you're so popular is
because you pay attention and say what

304
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:24,600
you see and you're not too concerned
about doing anything other than that.

305
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,660
I mean, yeah, of course you have an
agenda because everyone has an agenda.

306
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,890
You can't help but have an
agenda if you're alive, but
you can temper the agenda.

307
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Like you can be clued in enough to try
to listen and learn and watch and pay

308
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:42,270
attention to what your own senses are
telling you and try to articulate that and

309
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:45,340
that that's what the logos
is technically speaking.

310
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:50,160
And the reason I'm bringing this up is
because Jacques Derrida described Western

311
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:54,390
culture in a famous phrase.
He described it as fellow fell,

312
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:57,420
logo centric,
p h a l logo,

313
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,400
l o g o centric fell logo centric and
it needs to be brought down while the

314
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:06,930
Fallis part that's mail, the
logo part. That's logos. Now,

315
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:10,410
that's partly logic because the board
logic comes from the word logos,

316
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,780
but logos is a deep may,
much,

317
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:16,080
much older concept that
logic like logos is,

318
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
it's essentially,

319
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,130
it's a theological concept and
that's where things get complicated.

320
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:25,320
But you could describe it as uh,

321
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,750
as the manifestation of truth in speech
and the postmodernist they don't like

322
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,580
any of that.

323
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,780
So foul logo center, San Diego, San, it
would be the ultimate mansplaining. Yes,

324
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:36,830
exactly.
Yes.

325
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,890
Like any man who expresses a or tries
to correct a woman in any way becomes a

326
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,080
man's claiming to correct
anything in any way.

327
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,330
Particularly with you where the uh,
ted Cruz,

328
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:53,720
Sally Yates testimony that's
been going on in America.

329
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,470
Pretty fascinating. Cause
no, I'm not aware of that.

330
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,630
I saw an example of that in Australian,

331
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,950
our congressional debate where a guy was
accused of mansplaining by one of his

332
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,110
colleagues and really like tore a
strip off her quite nicely. Yeah.

333
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,390
So what's happening in the state,

334
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,980
you will,
Yates has just been pretty brilliant.

335
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:14,981
She was fired by the Trump administration
because she re rejected this idea of

336
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,680
what was the, uh, the very specific
thing was about restricting immigration,

337
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,670
about shutting down, uh, different, uh,

338
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,620
people that are trying to come
into the United States. And, um,

339
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,830
she had this debate with Ted
Cruz where she, you know,

340
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:34,970
just brilliantly shut him down with
her knowledge of the constitution and

341
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:39,971
knowledge of what is and what is not legal
or should or should not be allowed to

342
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:45,440
happen. And she was fired for it and
he was grilling her and his, you know,

343
00:20:45,441 --> 00:20:49,020
he's a very smart guy, ted, although
I don't agree with him and I'm,

344
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,400
I agree more with her.
The wait was going down.

345
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:56,401
This debate was described as mansplaining
because it was a man talking to a

346
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,360
woman.
It's just a recent example.

347
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,840
I also read about something like that
with regards to the Supreme Court. Yeah.

348
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,460
Because somebody did an analysis showing
that the female Supreme Court justices

349
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:10,180
spoke less than the male supreme court
justices immediately attributed that to

350
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,470
sexism because you know,

351
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:15,880
how will pressed female
Supreme Court justices are so,

352
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:20,620
um, the, the, the, I still
want to get back to this,

353
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,390
that the hatred or the,
a dislike of clear thinking.

354
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,050
Yup.
Do you think that this comes from people,

355
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,050
I'm not even sure I completely
wrapped my head around this,

356
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,840
but do you think this is
from someone with, uh,

357
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,570
they understand that their logic is muddy.

358
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,900
They understand that they're imposing of
this muddy logic is illogical and some

359
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:47,560
sort of a way they feel it. They feel
it, feel it rather than think it,

360
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,631
I mean that,

361
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:52,060
that's the other thing is that there
isn't a lot of clear thinking on the side

362
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,420
of the social justice types because
a lot of what they're doing is real

363
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,590
emotional base level. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
they're the best personality predictor.

364
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:09,520
Okay.
