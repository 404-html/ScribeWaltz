1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,160
College athletes generate a lot
of revenue fucked. Yeah. Okay.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,760
Athletes are getting pimped out.
Yeah,

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,460
a hundred percent especially in
like football and basketball. Well,

5
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:15,940
you were telling me what I was talking
to Jamie when you went to Pete about the,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,050
how big the game was that you went to see
fucking God. And I was saying, is there,

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,270
what about baseball's
baseball? Like down like, no,

8
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:24,940
nobody gives a fuck about college.
Baseball. Basketball is a little bit,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,870
you said March madness. Definitely. Those
are, those are the big college football.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,670
Get that big time. That's the end. It's
worth billions of dollars. Many billions.

11
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,550
Yeah. Yeah. Which is crazy.
Those kids aren't getting paid.

12
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:39,850
That doesn't make any fucking sense.
Well, I got a free scholarship, Joe.

13
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:44,350
I gotta go to school for free and
oh great. Get $25,000 a years.

14
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:48,970
Where the free education,
fuck you. I tend to agree.

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,510
I said there's a couple of kids,

16
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:52,730
like a interesting story that
came out earlier this year.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
He's on one of the teams that did really
good. UFC or UCF, I'm sorry. Yeah.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,520
You see ups kicker was a Youtuber as
the season started and he got in trouble

19
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,900
because he was making profit
off of his likeness on Youtube.

20
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:07,640
So they took away his ability to do that.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,010
He got kicked off the team
and I think he left the team.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,210
Oh my God, you fucking monsters. What did,

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,020
you don't own people that,
that's what drives me crazy.

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,220
It's like you don't own people.

25
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:21,940
They're providing a service that makes
you an extraordinary amount of money and

26
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:26,800
yet you are keeping all of it like debt
Patino thing, 1.5 million to school.

27
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,110
I give him 10 grand, 10 grand. Is it out
of the money? That's a lot of money. Oh,

28
00:01:32,111 --> 00:01:34,720
that's the argument.
I know.

29
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:38,740
I think that the thing about assholes,
the people who um,

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,770
who really argue the free education thing
and like how that should be of value

31
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:49,150
is because they ain't worth a shit.
That's why they think that's awesome.

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,540
Like your skill level is not impressive
and you don't generate millions and

33
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,343
billions of dollars.
So you go,

34
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,920
it's fucking $100,000 worth of free
education there. It's like, yeah,

35
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,820
but like I'm bringing in 10 million
to the table, bro. That's the thing.

36
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,800
And here's the big thing. How much damage
are they getting in that four years?

37
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,780
How much damage they're doing to
the body and football in high level,

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,330
division one FBS football,

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,670
lot of those dudes are playing and they're
playing basically with, you know, the,

40
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,770
the, the next NFL players.
So yeah, they're, yeah,

41
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,900
they're fucking each other
up fucking each other up.

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,530
And the odds of their body getting
damaged to the point where they can never

43
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,320
compete professionally are
very hot. Oh, definitely. Yeah.

44
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:36,250
So if you think of like there was
a statistic about NBA or excuse me,

45
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:37,240
NFL players,

46
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,220
like how many of them make it into
the fourth year and it's very low,

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,760
but not for long league. Very call
it. Yeah. That what they call,

48
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,100
that's the nickname for the
NFL. Not for long. Yeah.

49
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:52,690
The average NFL career is like three point
some seasons. Right. So think of that.

50
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,480
You're,
you're basically trying to do,

51
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,830
to outrun that through college
and then make it into the, yeah.

52
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,930
That's why you really,
from a business perspective,

53
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,880
you really have to support guys coming
out of college early to the NFL. Oh,

54
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:10,690
100% I mean there's people who are like,
some people I wrote about roads,

55
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,750
garage or the fuck Outta here. I read
a book. Yeah. Well I'm balling page.

56
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,730
I'll go back, go back with my
free time, man. Yeah, go back.

57
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,010
You're still only going to be 25
years old when your career is over.

58
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,790
That's fucking nuts. I know. There's
millions on the table. Millions.

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,120
22 come on.
Hello.

60
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:30,220
Give her think about how
poorly you would handle that.

61
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,390
I think about it now a lot.

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,880
If I had been 22 it's almost like
here's $10 million. I'd be like, wow.

63
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,680
I would definitely not have been like,
yeah, dude. Able to handle that. Well,

64
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,770
yeah, I think about that
hardcore or think about like,

65
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:48,430
what if I won the lottery when
I was 20 like what? Go nuts.

66
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,510
You go nuts. Yeah. I got diamonds
in my jacket, man. Check it out.

67
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,140
Diamonds on my teeth is,

68
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:58,810
my buttons are all done diamonds
on Monday co definitely. Yeah,

69
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,910
I think,
um,

70
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,270
it's like we were talking about earlier
about a guy being rich and having rich

71
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:08,710
children struggles. Fucking
very important for you.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,960
Yeah. It's very good for you. It's very
important for you. It builds character.

73
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:18,640
It builds, resolve, respect
now. Yeah. Yeah. Respect money.

74
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,810
That like how many professional athletes
who wink millions of dollars work out

75
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:25,690
as hard as my friend Cameron
Hanes. Right? Think of that.

76
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,610
That fucking guy's a regular job.

77
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:32,170
Dude works for Department of Water and
power and Oregon. Does he really? Yup.

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,300
Nine to five regular job
during his lunch hour.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,710
He doesn't work nine to five.

80
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,240
He works like seven to four.

81
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,860
And one of the reasons why he's got an
extra hour in there is because you runs

82
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,120
during his lunch break.

83
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,720
So he takes like two hour lunches
and runs for two fucking hours,

84
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,950
runs the hills and then comes back and
finishes out the rest of the eight hours

85
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:00,550
of the day. What that did, it feels
good all day though to savage. Yeah.

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,010
It doesn't feel good. He doesn't
want to feel good. Does it be pain?

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,950
He likes all the time. Yeah.
But he's happy. He's happy
in pain. I don't know, man.

88
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:12,880
I mean not, he gets shipped grimacing
in pain. He's like, this shit hurts.

89
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,893
There's like it.
Yeah.

90
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,350
[inaudible].
