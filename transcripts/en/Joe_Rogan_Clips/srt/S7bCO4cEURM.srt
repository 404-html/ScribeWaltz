1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,640
Well, you went and lived in
like last time I talked to you,

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:06,400
you were living in Japan and you
were doing Kendo over there. Yes. Uh,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,570
well you pitch up. Awesome Day. I'm
going to play for the Yankees joke.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,220
I love just uracil and grapple and
someday I want to get in the middle of the

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:16,200
ring and Joe Rogan's
going to saint my name

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,090
and I'm working my way up through
Ed Parker's American Kampo system.

7
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:29,091
And someday I'm going to Japan to learn
from the guys who invented this stuff.

8
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,690
No, I'm putting on a pork barrel, acts
it to make it entertaining. But it did.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,620
And I started exactly like I did Barham
Boulevard making rock and roll with the

10
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:45,270
Mighty v Mighty van Halen
in the late seventies, uh,

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,050
at the Oakwood garden
apartments in midtown Tokyo.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,370
I did not know a single person.
I didn't know a syllable of Japanese.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,000
I had no idea where I was.
And No,

14
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,530
I can't drive on the left
side of the street. I barely
carry a cell phone. Karen,

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,960
come on. And, uh, uh,

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,670
I suspect that a lifetime of adventure
you do all the traveling come on artists

17
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:11,480
to artists, your home everywhere
now, aren't you? Yeah.

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,940
A lot of ways you are the
comfortable one in the room,

19
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,890
especially if there's conflict,

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,850
which there always is and that's
what's the most unsettling to the,

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,590
to the tourist travelers.

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,110
You're at home when you first start
learning Japanese comes in three stages.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,180
First you watch kids shows on television
because they pronounce everything and

24
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,790
nobody interrupts.
Then you watched the news,

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,670
everybody speaks with a perfect accent,
bigger words, nobody interrupts.

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,870
And then you start going with me to
the movies in the middle of the day on

27
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,710
Tuesday and Tokyo, it Ginza and
you're the only pale face in the room.

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,650
It's all in Japanese and it's the movies.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,670
Everybody's interrupting everybody
shooting, screaming, sirens,

30
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:00,960
airplanes going by. And if you can
begin to decipher even one character,

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,310
then you'll develop yours.
Ma'Am,

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,680
do you know how to write it while
you practice that? Certainly.

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,490
And think of it as cross training.
All right.

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,180
There are a lot of schools,
for example, a Hebrew school,

35
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,960
you always hear about Hebrew school
before you go to bar Mitzvah class.

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,390
It's an ancient way of wait a minute.

37
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,440
You got to develop the side of your brain
by correlating designs with language,

38
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,380
with meaning that may not
actually be an English.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Nobody's walking around speaking Hebrew
after all the only four summers of

40
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:34,431
whack.

41
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:38,820
But you develop that side of your brain
to where you start to have a capacity to

42
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:43,680
learn in an accelerated way. So all your
best musicians speak a couple languages.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,060
We are best politicians. Speak a couple
of all your best artists, architects,

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,920
all your best design folks and
speak a couple of language.

45
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:56,220
It's no secret that you develop
that side of your brain.

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,160
If your kids don't speak Spanish, get
after it. I had to learn a language.

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,690
It's never too late. You'll
see the difference. You don't.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,400
I did every single day. Every time I
called it Roth University in Tokyo,

49
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,880
every morning, two hours,
Japanese class, you know,

50
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,750
speaking the language. I can get things
done for you, but I'm not conversant.

51
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,840
You follow? Uh, the end result
is that it's cross training. Hmm.

52
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,920
Alright.
Longterm memory.

53
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:30,490
My short term memory
is a little too short.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,200
It gets shorter,

55
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,980
but you'll see the difference in your
ability to remember what you read.

56
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,690
They'll start remembering everything.

57
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:41,980
You see some things as dangerous because
of the fact that you learning this new

58
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,890
thing. So you're activating this
part of your brain. Oh yeah.

59
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,700
You'll start it off with little
kids in art class for example,

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,430
where you take a pencil and you got this,
just a pencil.

61
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,370
What else could it be? Well, in this
environment is a stick shift, blah.

62
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,790
No, it's not. It's a Kubo
time. He's got Joe's rested

63
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,560
now I'm a little girls go,
it's a bow dad. Me, I'm a hero.

64
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,880
I'll say of the day.

65
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,000
And you get start to think in those
terms using actual language movement.

66
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:20,740
Same thing. At this point in your
career with Jujitsu and grappling,

67
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,680
you have a vocabulary
that starts to expand,

68
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:28,330
expand by having to learn and
challenge and challenge people.

69
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,250
Marvel at Anthony Bordain gun blessing.
Uh,

70
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,870
one is biggest talent was
to be at home everywhere.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,070
No matter what somebody might
say or a posture or present,

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,990
he was able to let it go by when later,
or no,

73
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,920
we'll Duke it out right here.

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,600
And he had the capacity to stay
cool in the middle of all of it.

75
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,690
So maybe it's stay cool
school when you think, well,

76
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,430
he just had a fascinating mind
for travel and food and culture,

77
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,520
and he just wanted to know everything
about how these people thought about the

78
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:03,850
world and saw things differently.
And if I feel,

79
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:06,190
I kind of feel bad now for
people that don't travel,

80
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,470
I really do feel like you're missing
so much of what a human being is.
