1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,290
It says, belt are rigged it to protect
their investment. Ah, Paul daily.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:07,410
You're a monster. When he's,
when he's on, he's a monster.

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:09,630
There's no man on the planet who,
I mean,

4
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:11,820
think about what he did to Lorens Larkin,
right?

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:14,910
Lorens Larkin is a really
tactical striker and Paul,

6
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:18,790
daily time he lands that fucking left hand
on you. You, you forget your childhood.

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,730
It's been fighting. He,
he's been disappointed.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,140
He says MMA politics and Beltour
protecting their investment, uh,

9
00:00:24,141 --> 00:00:28,530
fell one three rounds to, to my opinion,
I've beat that full, really close fight.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,420
I can see how he thinks he went
three rounds. So like if they,

11
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:35,520
you have to daily Mikaila, fine. We
all lost the fans loss. But if you,

12
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:38,490
how he says three, I'm like, all
right, that's fine. I don't know. It's,

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,710
it was a bullshit fight
all the way around. It was,

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,090
it wasn't the best fight wasn't a
lot going on. Well, I've nothing,

15
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,380
nothing wasn't a bit cautious is,

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,780
and two blue belts grapple daily,
kept trying to gala daily,

17
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,471
took him down.

18
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,800
Then he lost position once an MVP
got on top of him and beat his ass,

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,720
got his back. I thought he was gonna
choke him out to the rear naked there for,

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,623
yeah.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,830
I was amazed that Paul Daley was
able to take them down though,

22
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,200
and we really made some big
improvements in his wrestling. I mean,

23
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:10,110
I guess maybe felt like after the John
Fitch fight, if you can't beat them,

24
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:14,380
join them. What a great did. This
was a great fight, man. Yeah. Wow.
