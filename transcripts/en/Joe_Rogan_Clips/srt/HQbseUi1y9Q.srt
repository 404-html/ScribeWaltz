1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,620
Four three, two, one. Kelly Slater,

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,150
we've been talking about
doing this for how long?

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,180
Couple of years while makes for having me.
Thanks for being here.

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm glad we finally got a chance to do it.
What are you in California for?

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,490
I know you broke your foot, right? I broke
my foot real bad. I had to do that. My,

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,730
well my girlfriend's phone, San Clemente
and her family lives there and uh,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,880
so we kind of live here when
we're not moving around too much.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,960
So I'm just going to here right now.
I'm not competing. I broke my foot.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,260
I was surfing in South Africa about,
um,

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,340
15 months ago and I was just on a wave
that I wouldn't consider a very big wave.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,780
Nobody would really consider dangerous
and it all kind of closed out, which is,

12
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,920
you know,
when it all breaks at once,

13
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:44,550
I just pulled into thing cause I was going
to sort of wash in on the rocks right

14
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:48,240
where that was and change boards and uh,
I was practicing,

15
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,250
I had to compete in about
two hours from then.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,560
So I was just testing
out different boards.

17
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:55,890
For some reason I wasn't riding the board.
I was planning on riding competition.

18
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,400
So I was going to come in and change
and switch to my norm board and I just

19
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,700
pulling this wave and just,

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,770
I kind of hesitated like usually you
either ride those out and stay on your

21
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,670
board or you jump off.

22
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:09,600
And I was kind of a between the two and
I kind of lifted my front foot off my

23
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,150
back foot. My leg was straight
cause I was kind of going to,

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,830
I would think I was going to jump off
and as my foot got my leg got locked back

25
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:17,664
straight.

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,470
The board flipped in oh against the toes
and it just broke the top of my foot

27
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,550
and a half. Oh like immediate
like there was my God, yeah.

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,330
We're looking at a photograph of the
extra right now and it's like every bone

29
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,810
it's snapped. Well what you
can't see. So the, do you know,

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,510
are you aware of the Lis franc joint?
Which is like,

31
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,820
that's where the first big
metatarsal comes together.

32
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:41,130
So that first big joint
on top of the foot there.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,260
Why is it called the Liz Frank joint list?

34
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:47,430
Frank was a doctor I think is what I am.
I could,

35
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,330
we could look this up. I think that was
the person that did the original surgery.

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,020
When you used to break your foot in
a stirrup back a hundred years ago,

37
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,160
they said cut your foot off.
Oh God damn ass.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,680
So that was what, what it, uh,

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,980
that was kind of how this
sort of joint got famous.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,060
But normally what happens is those toes,
those two bones right there,

41
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,800
the first and second metatarsal can
either spread or converge one way or the

42
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,260
other. And that's usually
what a Liz frank fracture is.

43
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,680
I had the best of the three,
which is, I had a crack.

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,320
You can just see on the right side of,
yeah,

45
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:24,930
if you go down with a cursor right there,
just a little lower,

46
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:28,860
there's a little crack right there,
uh, right there on that corner.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,210
And then the next one broke across.
You can just see right there,

48
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,840
it's cracked across. And so it kind of
went in to line up and across the foot.

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,430
And then the other two are just a straw.
Yeah.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,050
The third one displaced the fourth
one shattered into about eight pieces.

51
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:46,270
The doctor said he lost count and putting
them back together. And then you know,

52
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:49,800
you, you would know from injuries. The
problem with when the shatters of bone,

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,420
they're not getting the blood flow.

54
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,330
So it's not like a four
or five week repair job.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,930
It's like that was like nine months before
that thing was back together properly.

56
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,770
So when they do that, how do they piece
that shattered one back together again,

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,550
a delicately and they
put like a mesh over.

58
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,840
So I've got to kind of like
figure out how to, well I had,

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,400
I had a plate on the list,
frank and then it had a plane play,

60
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,770
a kind of a bridge across
the third and fourth.

61
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,710
And so they kind of meshed it
all together. And then, uh,

62
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,320
I think I had 16 screws
combined in all that.

63
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,500
God Damn it, it was, it was brutal.

64
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,040
The problem with it was I did it in
South Africa where I wasn't going to get

65
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,930
surgery.
Um,

66
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,990
so I had to wait for the swelling to go
down for about six days before I could

67
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,490
fly.
Oh God.

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,610
Cause they thought the was going to swell
too much cause it was already swollen

69
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:46,100
from the event. So I used to shit
on my foot for like, you know,

70
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,240
five days and sat there and watched.
Unfortunately the waves were perfect,

71
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,240
so I was sitting on the beach is watching
perfect waves, you know, it's like,

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,970
that's like as painful as the
injury to a surfer, you know,

73
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,740
it's like watching a bunch of elk walked
by in front of you and not scary to you.

74
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,400
Right, right. And uh, um, so I,

75
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,510
I sat there because the whole time prior
to me being injured while was there for

76
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:09,280
like two weeks,
the ways weren't very good.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,580
So I broke my foot in the way he's
got great. Oh. So I did watch it,

78
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,560
so that's painful for us. But, uh,

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,690
so then wait for the swelling
to go down and then I,

80
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,310
it's too red eyes to get back there.

81
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,870
No way you could get it fixed in
South Africa. I maybe could have,

82
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,330
but then I was probably looking at staying
in Africa for a month or more. And,

83
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,750
and also I didn't know that the quality
sort of level of quality of doctor I was

84
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,320
going to get there.
And I,

85
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,100
I got a doctor I work with here and I
called him straight away. I said, look,

86
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,180
it's my fourth broken foot,
but I've never broken it like this.

87
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:43,540
Usually it's like let it heal for four
weeks and you're surfing and it's all

88
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,960
from surfing. Yeah. And in
the same way I'll really,

89
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,660
really pretty much the board going
back against the foot fuck. Um,

90
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,910
cause and usually it happens when I'm,
you know,

91
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,450
I don't know how well
versed you are in surfing,

92
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,840
but when I'm tube riding and
usually with my back to the wave,

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,350
which has happened two or three times,
so I'm in the wave,

94
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,680
the lip pitches over and lands.
But when that lands,

95
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,460
it sends a shock back into the way,
like,

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,230
you know when the lip
hits flatwater that lip,

97
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,490
some of the energy goes down and some
disperses out and up and some comes back

98
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,220
into the tube. So if does that
and you're in the wrong spot,

99
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:22,610
the board will flip into your feet. But
oh wow. Normally what we do is we're,

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,670
we're,
when your backside barrel ride,

101
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,730
a lot of times you're grabbing the rail
so you kind of have both your feet and

102
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,100
your hand on it so you
can handle that shock.

103
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,410
But if you're just going no hand backside,

104
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,050
it's usually a pretty big intense barrel.

105
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,180
And so that lip has a lot of energy and
it shoots a ton of force back towards

106
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,040
you. And if, if the hit
your board just wrong,

107
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,300
it can flip in your foot and break it.

108
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,120
Do you know anybody else who's broken
their foot? Like you, like that?

109
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,180
Not this bad. Um, one guy
on tour broke his foot.

110
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,040
Pretty bad knee requiring surgery this
year, that looking at, I'm horrible man.

111
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,010
How long was it before you can walk?
You're walking. Totally normal now.

112
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,360
How long has it been since
the surgery? Yeah, so,

113
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,470
so I had surgery in end of July
last year and then walking normal.

114
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:10,580
It wasn't til maybe December, January.

115
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,630
Wow. Well December I competed again,
but I probably shouldn't have.

116
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,850
But we were, we were at
pipeline in Hawaii, which is,
you're not doing maneuvers.

117
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:22,520
It's not a small wave kind of comp.
If the waves are small,

118
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:24,290
I wouldn't have served.
Since it's bigger,

119
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,690
it's a little easier cause you take
off and kind of trim a straight line.

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,440
So you're kind of going
straight, you know, even though
you're riding the barrel,

121
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,490
you're kind of going straight.

122
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,650
But are you conscious of your foot being
compromised? Yeah. Wow. I don't know.

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,890
I just, that's my favorite event in the
world, so I just didn't want to miss it.

124
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,330
But fuck if you broke your foot
again. Yeah. But then, you know,

125
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,310
the bones were pretty
good back together then.

126
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,100
And I could walk somewhat without pain.

127
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,850
And if I put myself in a real vulnerable,
vulnerable,

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,570
vulnerable position on a wave, I would
kind of maybe jump off. You know,

129
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,260
I wouldn't really push it. It's not
worth winning a contest foot again,

130
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:04,960
but I'm sure to be able to surf pipeline
with no one else is kind of worth the

131
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,120
little risk now.
