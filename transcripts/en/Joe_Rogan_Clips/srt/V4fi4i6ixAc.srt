1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,390
It's so crazy when they introduce animals
to an island and it winds up fucking

2
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,800
everything up like the Galapagos islands,
you know,

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,680
and I'm sure you're familiar with the,
um, Judas, Judas goats, Judas goats.

4
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:14,020
Are those the ones in the Galapagos?
Do you know how they do that?

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,860
I don't advocate goats.
It's really interesting. Not
from the helicopters. Yeah.

6
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,890
Well this is how they do it. They cast
goats like to hang out together. Right.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,880
But sometimes hard to locate them.
So they put a radio collar on one goat.

8
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:28,720
They castrate it and then they let it
loose and they gunned down all the goats

9
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,930
around it and let that go. Go
find the rest of the goats. No.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,320
And he goes and finds the rest of it goes.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,580
Then they gunned down those goats
because they have the radio collar. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:40,830
So these, what does this Jamie picture
of a Judas Code? I guess he's just,

13
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,620
hey, maybe there's a couple
other pictures. How sad is that?

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,610
Single goat's life. He's like new
friends. What the fuck? Yeah. Helicopters.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,360
So I'm actually heading there on
a Monday. They call it goes. Yeah.

16
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,750
They make you take your shoes off,
right.

17
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:59,450
And scrubbed to make sure that you don't
have weird seeds and the bottom of your

18
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:03,190
shoe. I have to stop eating seeds,
quarantine for 48 hours when we arrived.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,030
I'm eating seeds. So you don't
shut it out. Exactly. Yup.

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,350
Quarantine for 48 hours. Yup. Wow. Why,

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,170
why is there so much concern
about this one area? Uh,

22
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,300
I mean it's the dawn of evolution.
You know,

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,660
it's where Darwin came up with a theory
of evolution and due to the finches,

24
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:24,340
it's, it has been destroyed in
some aspects and it's been a,

25
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,620
the habitat has been
fixed in a lot of places.

26
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:30,370
There's been great conservation efforts
and personally I love what they're doing

27
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:32,340
because they're trying to
keep it pristine. You know,

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,300
I think it's fantastic
that there's a quarantine.

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,060
I think it's great that I'm not supposed
to eat seeds for two weeks before going

30
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,990
there. Um, and it's, it's to
keep it as perfect as it is now.

31
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,610
The island that I'm going to with,

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,240
with my small team has like
nobody ever stepped foot on it.

33
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:50,260
It's an active volcano erupts every year.
It's this crazy harsh environment.

34
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:53,440
We have to have a new pair of boots every
day cause the melts melts and shreds

35
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,370
your boots. Just walking on it. It's
been described as hell on earth.

36
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,780
So I'm stoked.
Wow.

37
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,780
And what kind of protective gear do
you have to wear other than your boots?

38
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,180
Just long sleeved clothing.
I mean, is it yet,

39
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,780
it's so the guy was telling me it's
like 45 degrees Celsius. So that's,

40
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,400
it's well over a hundred. Um,
and yeah, and that's, you know,

41
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,130
we've got to be careful about
water and hiking and there's just,

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,680
there's a lot of elements. But that's
the thing is I'm looking for an animal.

43
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:20,980
Nobody's seen oh very long amount of time.
So you've got to go to these places.

44
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,090
Nobody's going. Wow, that's
incredible. You know, it's,

45
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,350
it's interesting the idea of
invasive species too, right?

46
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,580
Because like Hawaii's a good example.
Hawaii,

47
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,990
there's been talk of getting rid of
pigs. Yup. And a lot of the natives,

48
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:40,310
they're like, well, slow down.
Because if they're w we hunt
them, we eat them. Right.

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,110
If they're invasive than what
are we, right. Totally is.

50
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,920
The pigs were here right around the same
time that people were there and they've,

51
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,900
we've existed together. They need
each other and its culture. You know,

52
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,040
at that point it's,

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,030
it's Polynesian culture to eat a
fire roasted pig and hunt your pig.

54
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:59,030
And so it's a delicate balance.
Like Hawaii is a perfect,

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,750
there's Mongie so we're introduced
that destroyed the birds. And uh,

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,820
there's turtles,
there's frogs,

57
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,620
there's all kinds of things
that have been brought in there.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,490
But none of those are culturally
significant. Whereas the pig is,

59
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,270
you're saying is a huge cultural
significance. So where is the balance?

60
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,140
Well one of the best examples
of that would be like Lanai.

61
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,430
Cause Lanai has this insane population
have access to here and we go and bow

62
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,730
hunt them there every year.
They're delicious and they're plentiful.

63
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,550
And it's one of the most really ethical
hunts cause you have to hunt them, right?

64
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,430
I mean they are so overpopulated as 20,000
of them on an island with 3000 people.

65
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,410
Yep. And uh, have you ever been till the
night? I have. Yeah, I was diving there,

66
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,800
spear fishing there. Do you see all
the stacks everywhere. Everyone ran us.

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,870
It is great. And they're so
beautiful with their spots and yeah,

68
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,090
they're amazing Adam. And
you know, I'm all for it.

69
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,350
Like hunting as a tool for
conservation. Absolutely. Yeah.

70
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,850
But it's just bizarre that they did that.

71
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,690
They did decide to let dear loose on
an island with nothing to eat the deer,

72
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,240
but people. Right. And
then when this was done,

73
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,000
it was like King Kamehameha with just,
what year was that?

74
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,790
I couldn't say a long time ago. Yeah,
long time ago. So back then they, I mean,

75
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,090
I don't even know if they had guns.
I mean,

76
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,380
how were they hunting these things
back then? Bose and spirits. Right.

77
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,610
And they brought him over from Asia,
right? Yup, Yup. They're from Asia.

78
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,580
Same thing with New Zealand, right?
There's an axis steer, there's goats,

79
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,980
there's all kinds of things
are not access, but red deer,

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,770
there's all kinds of things
down there and same thing.

81
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,830
They're all brought in for sport.
Yeah. New Zealand's a weird one. Right?

82
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:29,950
So as Australia, they brought a lot
of stuff over there from, from Europe,

83
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,750
but New Zealand specifically,

84
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,990
they were trying to make it
like a hunter's paradise. Right.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,640
And I think it is right. Tell me if
I'm wrong. No, it is, but it's a,

86
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:40,390
it's a weird one because it's mostly
high fence. You're going to love this.

87
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:44,710
So under my extinct animal thing,
they've took moose in the New Zealand.

88
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,580
They took like 10 of them.
Small population believe
that they've been hunted out.

89
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,060
You know, they shot the last one,
blah, blah, blah blah. There's one guy,

90
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,000
crazy looking dude, long hair,
long beard, like nuts looking guy.

91
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,860
And he's been on the hunt, not hunt, hunt,

92
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,620
but like trying to prove that the
New Zealand Moose is still there.

93
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,500
He's found antler sheds,
he's found betting sites.

94
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,350
Some guy even got a picture of one
standing on a rock and you know,

95
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,840
Moose to me it's 100% and Moose.

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,720
And so they're in theory somewhere
down in the South Island.

97
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,190
There's one or two or three of these
super elusive Mousse that have been in New

98
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,950
Zealand for like 50 years. Whoa. Wow.

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,370
Well New Zealand is so fucking
rugged. Yeah, there's a,

100
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,050
a friend of mine has been there. My
friend Adam Green tree, he's been there,

101
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:30,110
he lives in Australia and he goes there
to hunt tar and you know they live in

102
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,030
the on the steep steep,

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,031
it's crankiest shale where the rock's
real slippery and it's just like cold as

104
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:41,990
shit. Really high altitude. And you've
seen them before, right? Yeah. Yeah.

105
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:45,540
I had it look like a science fiction
animal there as, as me and my friend,

106
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,250
me and the guys I work with like
to say stranger than fiction.

107
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,530
You look at it and you're like,
that's not a real creature.

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,190
Like some kid drew that.
Yeah.

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,410
Like a big old shaggy weird looking
thing where they think they are in New

110
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,420
Zealand.
Yeah.

111
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,980
Did you see that picture of the one
on the rock sticking out right there?

112
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:08,330
Yeah, that's the last one that
was taped. Last picture taken.

113
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,730
There's a recent one though.

114
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,580
There's one from like two or three
years ago and I looked at it, I'm like,

115
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,850
that's a moose. Like, I don't know who's
saying it's not, but it's a mousse. Wow.

116
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,610
Yeah. From 1952 yeah.
That's 100% a moose. Right.

117
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,080
Again,

118
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,140
how weird is it that there's animals
that you know are there and then there's

119
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,320
animals?
Like we must find that.

120
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,260
So they spend incredible amounts of time
and all of these resources. Is that it?

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,930
That's the one, yeah. That's 100% of
the fricking moves. No doubt about it.

122
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,390
That's what I'm saying.
Goddammit people. Yeah.

123
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:43,700
That doesn't even make sense that
anybody would argue that. Right.

124
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,630
That's a pretty clear picture.

125
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,300
But that's not proof cause they need
genetic material. They need for,

126
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,250
they need something. What do
they think that is? A cloud.
Exactly. Oh, rubber Moose.

127
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,460
That someone's stuck their it to goof
on people are they like arguing that

128
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:59,010
somebody could have computer generated it
to fool people and all those, you know,

129
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,220
all those. And I appreciate
it. Right. As a scientist,

130
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,480
I appreciate the fact that
you have to have proof. Right.

131
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,310
But it does get to the point
of ridiculousness. Yeah.

132
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:10,430
Well it's certainly possible. It's
certainly possible that they've, I mean,

133
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,880
especially when you're looking at
that insanely dense terrain right.
