1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,060
Maybe you did like a boron character
where you're, can you do German accent?

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:07,790
Not Arnold Schwarzenegger. Uh,
that's Austrian. Oh, okay. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,720
Um, no, I don't think I
could probably do one,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,650
but Arnold so easy.
It's so like I can only do sir.

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,460
I can't do Trump, man. You can't
do trout. No, I can't do it at all.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,270
My voice doesn't make those.
Sounds like I'm not a good impressionist.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,010
I'm just good at the ones that I can do.
What does Arnold think? A Trump busy.

8
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:32,850
We've had this conversation before is
not a bad guy. He's just a guy. Oh,

9
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:36,810
that's right. He's, he's listening.

10
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,760
He's doing what everybody
wants is making billions.

11
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,190
These fucking porn stars
and you're mad at him.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,650
This is the fucking American team
who looks like for real though,

13
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:49,170
who looks like him and fucks like he does.
I,

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,610
I'm a little bit more impressed
with Donald after all the
scandals. It backfired.

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,470
You guys. He's not, he's not
terminal Clinton on this guy.

16
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,650
He's not trying to fuck kids so that,
hey, you know, here's the thing about it,

17
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:03,400
like Roseanne Barr, they were
saying that Roseanne Barr was, uh,

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,160
theories that have been disproven.
This is what some thing,

19
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,980
cause she was talking about Trump,
break it up, child sex rings.

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,550
But he really did spend a lot of time
concentrating on that and having people go

21
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,630
out and try to break up these
sex rings and sex trafficking.

22
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,420
Like this is not something
that is a conspiracy theory.

23
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:27,090
This is something that
he's discussed many times.

24
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,930
It's also not a conspiracy
that there's sex trafficking.

25
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,270
So as much as you want to discount Trump,

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,090
here's a problem that I have with
people that are on the left right now.

27
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,160
They do not looking at everything,

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,300
throwing and looking at what they want
to look at. He's bad for the environment.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,930
He's always lying. He cheats on his
wife, he does this, he does that.

30
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:49,170
They say all these things that he
does bad. But when something comes up,

31
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,970
like Roseanne says,
ah,

32
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:54,720
I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt
because he's going after sex trafficking.

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,780
And then it turns out all these other
people. So that's conspiracy theory.

34
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:01,710
That's a bullshit online. No, he
said it. He's put effort into it.

35
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:04,920
Like you got to give the guy credit
because if you don't give them credit for

36
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,480
things that he does that are important,

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,560
nobody's going to listen to
you when you're criticizing
them either because you,

38
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,900
all you're trying to do is when you're
not trying to look at the thing for what

39
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:16,260
it really is. Yeah. He's this
guy and he's not perfect person,

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,560
but he did make note on many
times about wanting to break up.

41
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,070
Seth just sex trafficking rings.
Do you know that you're, uh,

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
your kid is 20,000 times more likely
to get kidnapped them to get shot or to

43
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:34,470
school. Does that make sense?
Yeah. At 20,000 it's conservative.

44
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,710
It's probably really like 70,000
because if you go by the numbers,

45
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,010
800,000 to a million kids go missing
every year in the United States.

46
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,260
And I looked that up though. That doesn't,
I've never found a source for that.

47
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,740
You said that before and that it
wasn't nearly as I read it online,

48
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:53,160
so it could be wrong cause a problem
with these things, like when we say them,

49
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,941
especially if you say it,

50
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,190
I'm like right now 2 million people
are going to listen to us or whatever.

51
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:59,540
The fucking knows.
Even if it's 100,000 or

52
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,940
a hundred kids, that's more than
school shirts. That's my point.

53
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:06,970
It's more than school shootings.
Like what would you rather have your,

54
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,070
you know what's worse?
I don't know what's worse.

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,470
Get having your kid get shot at
school. Any, right. We'll get this.

56
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,410
According to the National Center
for missing exploited children,

57
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,880
citing US Department of Justice report,

58
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,030
nearly 800,000 children are
reported missing each year.

59
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,480
That's more than 2000 a day.
The end.

60
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:27,130
See Mec says 203,000 children are
kidnapped each year by family members.

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,990
Oh, family. Okay. Now take us a
little bit at least 600,000 yeah,

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,980
that'd be 600,000 so what's worse?
How does grace having your kid.
