1
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:07,260
Yeah, I feel like I heard
we're not supposed to eat a
chick flick in the that you

2
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:12,180
can't eat anymore. I was somewhere the
other the other day and I was like, oh,

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,610
let's go to this restaurant. They like, we
can't. That's a Mario Batali restaurant.

4
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:14,821
I was like,

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:19,010
I'll and can everyone stop raping people
so I can eat my favorite pasta problem?

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,470
Monique telling everybody to
boycott Netflix. Crazy hard,

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,860
fucking insane. We getting a half
a million dollars for an hour,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,380
but it's like the Mo for most people
that's still like good at saying fucking

9
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,510
amount. I mean that's an insane
amount of money. It's insane.

10
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,090
As her comparing herself to Chris Rock,
not relatable.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,330
She's not as famous.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,660
Stuff is tricky because if you get
paid based on the value that you bring.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,120
Kathy Griffin,
Kathy Griffin was saying

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,760
she would be willing
to do a special bunch,

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,980
wants to make sure she gets equal pay
equal pay for women and she was making it

16
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,120
a part of that.

17
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,480
There's so many places.
Here's the thing,

18
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:17,481
they pay you what they think it's worth
based on how popular you are based on

19
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,790
how popular your stand up,
based on what they think they can get out.

20
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,870
That's why Dave Chappelle gets the most,
that's why Amy Schumer got a lot

21
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,260
not doing that. So for her to
compare herself to those two people,

22
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,094
it's fucking crazy.

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,640
Tickets like are their box office for
movies that she was in like, Whoa, Whoa,

24
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,310
whoa. It's like you're not
just getting paid that amount.

25
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,440
You're getting paid when the special
areas that tickets are going to sell

26
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:47,010
because that's special.
Crazy.

27
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,600
When they start boycott

28
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,410
Netflix
openly,

29
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,180
we're in trouble though
with the Kevin Spacey thing.

30
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:07,460
They had to do something about that and
they did a lot of money on it. Yeah,

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,850
they lost 39 million bucks.

32
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,740
That was where Gore Vidal.

33
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,260
We're not going to hire these people
because it has to be like a bottom line

34
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,690
issue. I'm not going to hire a
rapist because it's too expensive.

35
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,670
Have you ever seen the
Gore Vidal William F.

36
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,500
Buckley documentary where a
details no, no. The opposite.

37
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,334
They hated each other.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,480
British conservative guy who
was very popular during the day.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,520
This is from the 1960s on television
and they were debating back and forth,

40
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,570
Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley,
liberal versus conservative,

41
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:59,571
but on national television it was like
these really contentious charged debates

42
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,900
and it kind of sunk William f Buckley's
career cause at one time Gore Vidal

43
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:08,200
called him a Nazi.
You call them a neo Nazi or something,

44
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,410
something along those lines
and then go William F.

45
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,780
Buckley said something called
him a fucking queer and I'll,

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,220
I'll punch your face up a sock you in
your nose and you'll stay plastered.

47
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,600
Like lost his cool on television called
him a queer on television and it was

48
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,550
like this whoa moment.

49
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,050
And William F Buckley's
career does that shit.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,600
You got to see who really
is you pressured like,

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,980
and I love thinking about what in 30 years
or when you look back and be like, Yo,

52
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,380
I can't believe we used to just
fucking say that. You know like retard.

53
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,260
We used to just say retard.
I still say,

54
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,560
but only the retards but not

55
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,121
just a human.

56
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:53,121
Who Does the word is not the word is
retarded means like to slow the growth of

57
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:58,500
something. Retarded ideas,
you know like or like, yeah,

58
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,360
like okay, like denying someone birth
control. That is retarded. Retarded.

59
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,160
It's like socially retarded.
Retarded. It's slowing progress. Yes.

60
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,650
I don't think that's a bad word.
Yeah.

61
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,100
What I think is a bad thing is to
mock someone who has a disability,

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,220
but I don't think that you're always
talking about that when you're saying that

63
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,550
word. I think we have a real
problem with language policing.

64
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,060
I think we have a real problem with
denying the use of sounds there.

65
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,220
This would have word supposed to be.

66
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,650
It's like you make a noise so I
understand what you're saying.

67
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,850
I understand like there's, there has to
be context. Like I understand I have to,

68
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,720
it's supposed to be a sound that you make
so I can understand what you're trying

69
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,490
to convey and that's, you say
that's retarded and I go, you mean,

70
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,330
you know that's missing a
chromosome. You know, like it's like,

71
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,390
well that would be me saying that's
down syndrome though. Oh that's true.

72
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,660
You know what I'm saying? I think it's
figuring out what the ideology is.

73
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,020
The word I did not know this happened
recently. Someone said in a writer's room,

74
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,610
um, she's uppity. I did not
know that that was a slave term.

75
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,550
We all learned very quickly
that that was a term. Yes.

76
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,570
The ideology of it was to describe a
slave that was acting out and we learn,

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,110
oh wow.

78
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,250
I always thought up but he was someone
who is like a high Falutin like uh,

79
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,400
you know, some rich person. I thought
it was just someone who is um,

80
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,450
for council Trent and would
not participate or who is
resisting but it actually

81
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,850
has origins and same
with like patty wagon.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,650
It's like offensive to Irish people cause
it used to describe drunk Irish people.

83
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:27,740
Like people don't care.

84
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,810
Trust me in one quarter of course it's
like non Irish people are the ones that

85
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:35,710
are offensive and funny. That one quarter
Irish, I can't really say I'm Irish,

86
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,400
but if I was one quarter black I'd be,
you would be forever fucking Afro.

87
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,900
That would be a part of the community.
And then what's the other one?

88
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,290
There was another one under your thumb.
If you have someone under your thumb.

89
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,330
It's a rolling stones song,
but it was,

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,630
it used to be that was the thickness of
a switch that you could hit your wife

91
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:56,600
with. It had to be, it couldn't be thicker
than your thumb. Yeah. Like there's the,

92
00:05:56,601 --> 00:06:01,130
like a, is it ediology or edamame
at homology of, um, those words,

93
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:05,960
which I just didn't know. Um, do you know
the term faggot where that came from?

94
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,820
Uh, cigarettes. No dicks.
Oh, that's right. Right.

95
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,390
And do you know why did it
turn into gay slur? This is,

96
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,640
this was a piss me off on Louis C K show.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They use this urban myth that what it
meant was that a bundle of sticks was a

98
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,470
faggot.

99
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,130
And so I'm a gay man was a faggot cause
they were a bundle of sticks and you

100
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,820
would burn them in a fire.
That's not true at all.

101
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,140
Did he know that we can hire, I don't
know. It's convenient to ignore. Oh,

102
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,820
you to do is research.
It's not hard.

103
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,620
What a bundle of sticks was referred
to was a burden. Some woman,

104
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,350
they would call a burdensome woman,
a Faggot,

105
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,410
because she was like a bundle of sticks.
Very difficult to carry around.

106
00:06:49,411 --> 00:06:50,450
It'd be cocky.

107
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,470
So a man who act like
a woman was a faggot.

108
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,150
Whoa. That's what the term meant. That's
where it came from. That's the whole idea.

109
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,180
That's the absolute origins of that term.

110
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,360
So when people say there was a gay guy
and Louis CK show that was saying then I

111
00:07:07,611 --> 00:07:08,000
was,

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,720
it was him and Nick Depalo and Louie were
all playing cards together and someone

113
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:15,530
said some faggot. And you realize why
that's so offensive is because, you know,

114
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,090
they used to burn people.

115
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:20,480
There's no fucking history of gay
people being burned like witches. Yeah.

116
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,420
By the way, even the Salem witch
trials, they didn't burn witches.

117
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,283
They drowned them.

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,513
Yeah.

119
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,250
Yeah.
