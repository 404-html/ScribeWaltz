1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,190
I think that's so bizarre to me is that
we're sitting here and we're talking

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,540
about the age like the wise,

3
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:07,200
if guns were just created like
you know when in reality, right,

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:09,960
but something's wrong. But what's
wrong is it the, it's not the guns.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,650
I'm asking you, what do you think
is wrong? Mental Health, right?

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,790
So I say I agree with you,

7
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,860
but I think it should the two
ration of culture altogether.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,130
Like they used to be taught the Bible
in school. Like you know what people,

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,450
people make fun of that now.

10
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,940
Like now we've got this culture
where you're making fun of kids.

11
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,490
Like religion is like,
we're so far away from religion.

12
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,520
Like that's like weird to us. Like you
know like teaching religion is like, it's,

13
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:32,170
you've got like an oak scarlet letter.
If you come in as like a crow,

14
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:35,490
a holy Christian kid in like a
normal public public education thing,

15
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:38,370
you've got the family structure where
it's like these kids are running the

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,300
houses these days.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,900
Like I look on like Facebook and it's
like supposed to be funny when like a four

18
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,120
year old is acting like Cardi B.
I'm like okay.

19
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,660
Yes it's funny cause she's four but it's
also like not funny cause she's four,

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,980
right? Like how do you feel about Little
Tang? Who's a little tay? I Love Cardi B.

21
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,860
I know a little tay is,
it was time.

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,990
He's kind of out of the news now
because they found that it's a hustle.

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,840
She's a nine year old
Asian girl from what?

24
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:05,190
Vancouver and she talks mad shit,
throws money around,

25
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,280
calls everybody bitches and haters yet.
But that's my point.

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,980
Like this is considered like funny. It's
like entertaining, like the fact that,

27
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,270
and we're okay with that.

28
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:15,240
And so parents are pushing their kids to
be more outrageous cause there's a way

29
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,390
that they can make it. So to me it's
like hanging out with Rick Ruben.

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,520
She looks like she's, she like, how
old is she? She looks like she's,

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,140
Oh those are hooks at the horns up and
she's got a g wagon in front of this.

32
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:33,570
It's just like the cash me outside girl.
Right.

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,340
So we don't talk about any of that.

34
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,860
We don't talk about the fact that
that we no longer focus on family.

35
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:40,020
We know it's no longer just focused
on religion. Doesn't need to be,

36
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:42,410
does it mean to be that
everyone needs to be religious,

37
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:45,360
but their structure and religion
right there structure in, in me,

38
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,480
when I grew up in and my grandpa used to
make us read the Bible around the table,

39
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,870
there was some structure to that
and lessons and prayers that,

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,030
and then there's this mass, the, the
Facebook, the snap, the snapping, the,

41
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,470
the Instagram or Twitter.

42
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:02,640
It's like we've changed the world and
expected children to say in stay the same

43
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:05,520
of it and nobody talks about it. So he
said, they say it's the gun's fault.

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,400
We need to,
we need stricter gun gun legislation,

45
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,790
but the entire world has shifted.
We're not talking about those changes.

46
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,900
The dynamic of the world that has shifted.
So I, I just hold a different position.

47
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,290
I, you know, I think it starts with
family. It starts with structure.

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,300
I think we need,
we need religion back.

49
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,330
I think that that needs to stop being
such a dirty word and to stop being mocked

50
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:28,460
roundly by the media. Like it shouldn't
be funny. You know, when joy bay, um,

51
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,360
you know, says something about Jesus
and the whole audience giggles.

52
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,194
That's weird.

53
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,030
Mike pence because he talks to Jesus
did give a how weird that is, right?

54
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:43,260
Like how weird that the stuff that we
used to would be normal. Like you know,

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,280
praying,
talking with you.

56
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,170
You just like when I grew up that
was like my grandparents' generation.

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,690
That was everyone was religious and now
we're so far away from that, right. That,

58
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:52,950
that,
that seems like,

59
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,210
like it's okay to mock and we roundly
mocked it all the time. So these are the,

60
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,520
the structure in the home is,
in my opinion,

61
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,140
the most important thing
that needs to change.

62
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,210
The fact that some people are growing
up without fathers in the home is

63
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,200
something that needs to change.

64
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,490
Letting your kid have a Facebook account
when they're seven, right? Like it just,

65
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,560
there's just too much.
It's the information age,

66
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,350
but what information are they downloading?
Well,

67
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,150
I definitely think that
people need structure.

68
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,970
I definitely think that people need
family and community and all those good

69
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,880
things, but when it comes to religion,
it's like, which one is right as a hobby,

70
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,730
right? It's not about being right.
Yeah. It doesn't sound like there's not,

71
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,300
I know I'm going to be honest. I know
nothing about Scientology, so I'm not,

72
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,920
I know that people hate Scientology.

73
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,730
That's all that all I know
about it created by a science
fiction writer and it's

74
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:39,500
all nonsense. Right? That's all
you need to know. Okay. Yeah.

75
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,990
So it's one of the dumbest religions of
all time. If you read like what they are,

76
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,270
Leah Remini who was in it for years,
I didn't watch her series.

77
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,680
She been on my podcast and she explained
her journey into it and what happened

78
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:57,510
with it and when she started to question
it. And there's a whole thing there.

79
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,200
There's a, um, what is the fucking
Hbo Documentary? It's also the book,

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,770
the HBO on Scientology.

81
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:09,300
The Lawrence Wright going
clear. Going clear. Yeah.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,510
I read the book and I watched
the documentary. So crazy boy,

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,730
I know nothing about it besides like
Tom Cruise, I'm going to be like,

84
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm going to be honest with totally
ignorant. It's, you know, for some people,

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,020
here's the thing, for some people
its structure and its helpful, right?

86
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,120
Ideologies are helpful sometimes
because they give you like a,

87
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,650
like a format to live your life by
or scaffolding to keep your, your,

88
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,020
your moral beliefs inside
of these boundaries.

89
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:37,930
And it helps you get ahead and you
have purpose in decision making.

90
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,550
But at the end of the day it's a cult,
you know, and there's a lot of them.

91
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,630
So a lot of different ones.

92
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:48,040
So like how do you decide that
there's something that comes from,

93
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,350
I think just learning certain lessons.
It doesn't need to be too,

94
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,660
I'm not saying that we owe
something like structure structure.

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,870
Like the Bible used to be
taught in school objectively,

96
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,750
they would be taught by people that, you
know, we're not practicing Christians.

97
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,763
Right.
Um,

98
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,470
used to be taught in school objectively
because there's still lessons that are

99
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:05,620
timeless in these Bible stories. It's
something to do with whether or not your,

100
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,820
you don't need to then say,
oh,

101
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,220
and then we go to church and then we
pray in school and all that stuff.

102
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:13,150
You can almost extract that and try to
teach these lessons objectively. But,

103
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,900
but kids are learning now is like how
to be an anarchist. Like you know,

104
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,980
feminism one o one and every,
it's,

105
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,140
you're like actually fostering an angry
culture by telling them at every turn if

106
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,660
they should be outraged. We are
in outrage culture. And then your,

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,870
your surprise when somebody does
something outrageous. Right?

108
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,580
It's a little bizarre to me. It's like,
oh, everything should piss you off.

109
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,490
Everything should make you angry.
Everything should make you upset.

110
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,190
Everything is up. Just as
unjust. Everything is oppressed.

111
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,930
And I don't know why this kid just show
up at school. I see. So angry or weird.

112
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,260
It's like we're weirdly fake. I
know whatsapp, the conversation,

113
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,880
the shooting happens and
everyone's talking about the NRA.

114
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,560
And then David Hogg is back on the news.

115
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,510
Jordan Peterson has some interesting
ideas about religion and the fundamental

116
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,220
beliefs and um,
the lessons

117
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,220
that are learned from things like the
Bible and how they apply to human life and

118
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,020
that our,
our own belief systems without them,

119
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,740
without the sort of structures and
belief systems is one of the things that

120
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,120
leads civilization astray and that it's
done that before and things go awry.

121
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,090
Well I actually had this debate
with Charlie and I did a panel,

122
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,210
I'm down in DC and we were talking
about whether like, you know,

123
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,060
the reintroduction of,
of God and teaching them to school.

124
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,060
And I said like at some point
there seems to be the struggle.

125
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:32,000
I have this idea that like
human beings in a certain way,

126
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:35,360
we're doomed to just keep
repeating history. I'm
obsessed with Greek mythology.

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,940
I'll obsessed with like Egyptian history
hieroglyphic like anything that like w

128
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,000
where they tell stories,

129
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,870
especially Greek mythology because the
lessons are there and we just keep doing

130
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,590
it. Right? Greed, lust, like the things
that human beings fall for. Right.

131
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,070
So I had this idea when we were talking,
cause Charlie is,

132
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,660
is an evangelical Christian.
I'm not right. I believe in, I,

133
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,590
I the super smart guys and
Evangelical Christians.

134
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,550
Does he believe like Jesus came back to
life? Yes. Really? Yes. He's an Mhl group

135
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,390
believes that someone died.
Yeah. And then three years,

136
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,980
three days later they came back to
life and that they walked on water and

137
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,310
yeah,
I mean you have to,

138
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,020
I haven't really gotten into
with him because I'm not like,

139
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm not the person that should ever be
like debating or talking about religion.

140
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:19,760
It's not my shtick I guess. Um,
but so what, what I said to him,

141
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,620
cause me and him both
believe that in many ways,

142
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,480
the reason that the government has,
uh,

143
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,240
the media has started roundly
dissing Dodd, right? Like in dissing,

144
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,260
he says Christ is because the
government wants to be God. Right.

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,400
So if people don't know,

146
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,000
do you think the media is responding
to the government suggestion?

147
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,850
Is that what you think
the reason why people

148
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,390
religion is because the media is
responding to some sort of orders from the

149
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:46,170
government orders. That's, that's wrong.
So it's, it's, it's directive. No, no,

150
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,100
but you know,
Andrew,

151
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:51,690
Andrew Breitbart said that politics
is downstream from culture, right? So,

152
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:55,080
and you can argue that they feed into
each other, whatever it is, but there's,

153
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:59,130
there's definitely something, um, between
culture and politics that is linked,

154
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:02,730
inextricably linked. Um,
so, uh, when, you know,

155
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,290
when everyone's on the same page, like,
so if the government wants to get bigger,

156
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,890
which it has been doing right, and wants
people to look to them for answers,

157
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,890
which it has been doing,
you have to understand,

158
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:17,250
they have to sort of destroy everything
else that they would potentially be

159
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:18,900
looking to for answers.
Right?

160
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:23,040
So instead of when you're down and out
and people would just go to church and

161
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,460
pray, right? Or believing in your
family or the family structure,

162
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,120
they need to know that no matter what
you think the government is the answer.

163
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,800
That is what a leftist,
at the end of the day,

164
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,420
the glut believes the government can
fix all of their problems. And, uh,

165
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,700
and I find, especially when
I speak lot, I love us.

166
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,970
They do not believe in religion. Like,
and there's just a thing. It's a trend.

167
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:44,670
I've noticed that, you know, I'm not
religious, I'm not saying that, you know,

168
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:48,040
there's something wrong with it,
but leftists tend to be, you know,

169
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,880
really apart from religion.
So you could make,

170
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:55,290
the argument could definitely be made that
the destruction of believing in Bible,

171
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,560
of stop teaching the Bible is because you
want to make it so that every time you

172
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:00,480
have a problem that cause
you're still going to our soul.

173
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,680
We still need to believe in something.

174
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,530
We're naturally beings that we need to
believe that something can fix something.

175
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,940
I really believe that that is the reason
why we go get our palms red, right?

176
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,300
Like we just like there's,
there's something else.

177
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:13,320
Somebody has the answer and people are
starting to believe it's government in

178
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:15,060
America and it freaks me out.

179
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,690
I agree with you that
people like structure,

180
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,680
and I agree with you that people without
religion try to find that structure and

181
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,760
those rules and other things.

182
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,990
But I don't believe that this is like
some calculated government by nature.

183
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,720
I think it's human nature shifts.
