1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,700
Quietly and praying there
was goodness to it. Yeah.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,230
And they went out and fed the homeless.
There was good stuff that came from it.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,790
And she wants that. I get that. And now
you're sitting in an institution though,

4
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:15,780
then you know the backstory
of what's going on. It's,

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,680
you know, how do you sit
there? How do you sit there?

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,200
So I said to her last name,

7
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:27,201
I wish just go to yoga will
satisfy your spiritual side.

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:31,050
But, but you know, wacky
too, man. I mean, no, look,

9
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,150
I go to a Bikram Yoga,
I go to hot yoga. Yeah.

10
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,930
90 minute hot yoga.
And that guy,

11
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:40,200
I don't think he's allowed to come
in in this country. No, he's not.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,820
The guy who made big room
now, now that guy, he's, he,

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,730
he,
he got a little rapey.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,810
Well he definitely got a little,

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,980
he took advantage of his privilege,

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,330
his position, our, well, yeah,
I guess you could say power,

17
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:04,610
but the reverence that people had towards
him, they felt like he was a guru.

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,920
And so he would get these girls alone
and he would make them suck his deck or

19
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,300
whatever. Right. But I think,

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,430
see now this I'm getting,
this is very dangerous waters,

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,350
but I was having a conversation
with a woman who is a,

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,770
she's an actually an instructor,
and she said, listen,

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,820
that guy is definitely creepy,
but let me tell you something.

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,080
A lot of those girls not
only knew what he was about,

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,730
but they wanted to be with him.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,720
They wanted to be with him because of
his power and because he represented

27
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,950
something special to them.

28
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,300
And then when he just shot a load in their
mouth and then kicked him to the curb,

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,360
then they became angry and
decided that they were molested.

30
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,710
They went into it willingly. I do not
know if she's accurate or inaccurate.

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,740
I was not there and I'm not a woman,
but I do know that people have like, uh,

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,980
like I remember women throwing,

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,180
not throwing themselves,
but making it very clear that they were,

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,500
they had deep admiration for my
martial arts instructor when I was,

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,120
when I was a young kid and I
was a practicing taekwondo.
I remember these women,

36
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:17,121
they were so in awe of my martial arts
instructor because he represented the

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,640
master of something that they
were deeply enamored by it.

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,560
And I think that's also what happens with
these yoga people. Yeah, it's seductive.

39
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,420
Yes. You know, it's seductive.
You know, there's an,

40
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,820
and also with something like that, it's
very physical and mental and spiritual.

41
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:36,760
It's sexual. Sexual Yoga is, I don't,

42
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,460
I've never had any sex with
anybody in my yoga class, but,

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,980
but I'm telling you when everybody's
in there sweating and everyone's almost

44
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,670
naked,

45
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm wearing these little fucking shorts
and then the girls are wearing these

46
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,310
little shorts and, and the teacher
goes around and she like calls you out.

47
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,690
It's like, oh, she likes me.

48
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,780
Understand how some of those people get
intimate with each other after this is

49
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:01,450
all over because they're so close to naked
and sweating together. Right. You know,

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,240
and your friend is right in that there,

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,480
there were some women I'm sure
who wanted to be with him. Yes.

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,210
But he's not dismissing
any rap shit either.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,330
But it's his responsibility because
he has the power and knows what he's

54
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,730
wielding like in a
workplace kind of thing.

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,490
It's up to you to be the one
who puts the brakes on it.

56
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,250
That's where it gets interesting.
Yes.

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,120
He does not seem to think that he does
have any responsibility at all for the

58
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,690
people that are working for him teaching
these classes and cha like he was,

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,710
he did this HBO documentary. It
was fucking, they did this HBO,

60
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,700
a interview about him. It
was so ridiculous. This is
the Bikram guy. Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,510
He goes,

62
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,220
did a woman that would pay $1
million for one drop of my sperm.

63
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,630
He says this CV can find the video,
so he's fully aware.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,160
I'm saying he's fucking crazy. He's
fully aware of his power. Crazy.

65
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,573
He was.

66
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,690
He was dismissing the idea that he
would ever sexually assaulted anyone.

67
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,651
He's like,

68
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:04,651
why would I do that when these women that
will pay $1 million for one drop of my

69
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:09,190
spam? Well, it wasn't about why it wasn't.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,540
Yeah,
it wasn't Bryant Gumbel wasn't there.

71
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,160
I think they're discussing it. Right.
They're discussing this. Correct. Comment,

72
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,590
you gone to see the guy
because he looks like a cause.

73
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:25,240
He said the comment to a woman and
she was like this. She was like,

74
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,610
what in the fuck did you say?
You know,

75
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:33,611
like Hbo Shows Very Andrea Kramer breaks
down million dollar sperm interview

76
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,190
some shit that you said.

77
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,570
There's some shit that you say when
people go, wait, what the fuck?

78
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,700
Holy Shit. Yeah. There's some
things that are what's causing that.

79
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:56,410
You would call beyond the Pale. Yeah.
Well, I love, I love just seeing pictures.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,820
You hear these stories, then you see him,
he's like, you're like grandpa. He's like,

81
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,990
oh, loose skinned. And he's
balding. But that's the thing.

82
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,200
It's like when you're in a power
of a powerful position like that,

83
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,380
he's very spiritual and
people will pay $1 million.

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,290
What does it say from being
circumspect and real sport? Uh,

85
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,690
the seven year old went off on a rant
claiming 5,000 women a day want to sleep

86
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,430
with him for,

87
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:29,431
have committed suicide over his charms
and people would pay $1 million for a

88
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:34,510
drop of his sperm.
See now if you lived in that world,

89
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,240
I would just shoot loads every
day and then retire. If you,

90
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,670
if you just drank eight,
a lot of zinc.

91
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,370
A lot of zinc and like what makes
loads. Oysters, celery. Yeah.

92
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,780
Is that Vegan nonsense now began,
does that person, those people are,

93
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:54,520
he adds to the pop. Who tells
you that? The salary people.

94
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,100
That's like, that's like some fucking
salary lobby. No, it's true. Celery does.

95
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,600
How do you know? I remember
I read something. Porn
people, right? Salary. Yes.

96
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,930
Salary. If you know
what's Jamie Gadea. Oh,

97
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,050
the most beautiful, famous,
rich women in the world.

98
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,090
If have to sleep with women
and have to sleep. No,

99
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,530
by thousand garland every day she cried.
Thousand women a day.

100
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,670
Want to sleep with you?
Two. Sorry. Four of them.

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,460
You're just saying that for
different women, for different women,

102
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,440
each killed themselves because you
wouldn't have sex all night. Why?

103
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,241
I am the head.

104
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:38,700
I sit women people's been
$1 million per one drum.

105
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:43,220
Pop my sperm million dollar day.

106
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Every drop that idiot or dumb to believe
those trash to women at the trash.

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,880
Yeah,
I big them palm trash and give them life.

108
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,650
Oh my God. 70 years old. He looks
pretty good for a 70 year old.

109
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,220
That's what I'm selling. All that
loads. Uh Oh my God. It's so good.

110
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,870
Don't last very long. They got to get it
dry up real quick. Yeah, they get gross.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,900
Do you know what man? Oh Man. Yeah. So
that spiritual thing, like the goals,

112
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,640
but that's, yeah. Yeah.

113
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,860
It's like the problem with it is
you're still an animal, right?

114
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,410
So if the animal, it's like
we were talking about before
where the wolves gone,

115
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,020
these surplus kills and they kill all
these elk and they don't eat them. Yeah.

116
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,710
I'll get in Wyoming,
there was a recent issue,

117
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:38,330
there was 18 elk that were
killed by wolves and these
surplus killings is a real

118
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:42,110
tragedy. Yeah. These walls can't help
themselves. It's just their instincts.

119
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,880
So his instincts as a man, he has
instincts to procreate, right.

120
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,020
His instincts to respond to women
that are sexually attracted to him.

121
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,220
And he teaches these classes in front
of hundreds and thousands of people and

122
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:59,090
everybody loves and adores him. So
when he is fucked up, twisted brain,

123
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,920
everything that he said there made sense.

124
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,660
My favorite part of it was that woman
Andrea, when she, when she clarified. Yes.

125
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:10,100
So you're saying, you're saying that
for women have committed to it like,

126
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,630
I want this motherfucker has to be clear
as nonsense. I like she's there is,

127
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,650
she doesn't even change her expression.
She's just like, so you're saying? Yeah.

128
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:20,360
I mean,
look at that girl right now.

129
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,410
He's standing on top of a woman's
hips as she's bent over backwards.

130
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,850
That girl is like, he wants
me, he standing over me.

131
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,460
This is way I've taken a
lot of yoga classes. Nobody
ever sitting on my hips now,

132
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,973
hey bro.

133
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,740
But I do like it when you're doing yoga
and they come over and they like push

134
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:40,130
your legs down and you're like, yeah, a
little, it's a little stretching. Oh Shit.

135
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:40,710
I just spelled.
