1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
The majority of fire, the majority
of fighters they have fought me.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,500
They've always been me like
almost all my career, you know?

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:12,501
So I always say I'd rather be the park
then looked apart because I've been in

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,130
many situations where I've seen guys
looking apart, but then when it's,

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,910
when they get to the nitty
gritty, they are not depart. Well,

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:23,540
you look the part too,
don't get it twisted right.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,480
Giant Tommy Hearns. Yeah. You know when
Tommy was in his prime, it's just uh,

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,740
it's what,

9
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:32,800
what makes sense though is that you
keep that power and the 12th round,

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,540
where's those bigger,
heavier guys?

11
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,060
Maybe because the blood's got to push
through all that extra muscle and all that

12
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:39,970
extra body tissue.
Maybe they can't keep that power that way.

13
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:43,180
You can because in the 12th round,
first of all,

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,750
I don't know how the fuck he got up.
I do not understand.

15
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:50,080
I remember watching it on TV. I'm like,
wow, he knocked him out in the 12th round.

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,300
That is crazy. Right? It's crazy.

17
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,360
And then of course you played
that thing on your Instagram,

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,610
which basically shows that
you did knock him out.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,460
Oh, definitely knocked him out. He
definitely didn't get up in time. Right.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,460
He definitely didn't,
you know,

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,750
but it was his job to just get up at 10
it's not his job to know exactly when 10

22
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:12,190
seconds is correct. Correct.
No, jet Reese, Stephanie
had delays on the account,

23
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:16,420
on the scene, the fight like six times.
And then definitely when he got to eight,

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,950
you know,
eight was a very long delay.

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,370
Eight then you said no,
you know,

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,960
um, yeah, like I said, 99 out of 10 judges
would have waved at all, you know, easily.

27
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:30,160
Especially when you've seen the guy,

28
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:34,720
our role in the back of his head and he
and him hitting the canvas and his, his,

29
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,220
his, his whole head meat penetrated
like it started getting tight.

30
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:41,680
The muscles in the head is
getting tight in the back and

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,430
you know, but it's,
it's so much with that.

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,810
I know how he got, I didn't understand
how he got up either. God is a good God.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,110
Well, he believed that that's
what he believed. He believed it.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,800
Yeah. I mean, look, he got
up man, and he got up and he
boxed. Well, he recovered you.

35
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:04,370
You mean you came after him and you hit
them with some more big shots and he

36
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,620
kept moving, but then he started
getting his legs back under them.

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,560
You started Landen.
There's also other things as well too.

38
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,960
You know he's still a gypsy
though. Yeah. You know,

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,060
you know they believe in a lot of things.
You know that, right. So you never know.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,840
You know, phenomenal
fight though. It was epic.

41
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:25,130
It was absolutely amazing to watch.
Most definitely watched it by myself,

42
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,370
but my family was gone. They went out
for the day. I was like, this is great.

43
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:32,000
Just meet. Did you watch it on
mute now? See what I'm saying?

44
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,630
The commentators, man, they
was horrible. It was horrible.

45
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,020
I felt that was very biased.
It was a lot of things.

46
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:41,690
They was pulling out what we're doing,
but a lot,

47
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,790
a lot of things what I was doing,
it just,

48
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,630
even when I knocked down in the knife
round, they had all this to say,

49
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,430
but when I'm not done the ninth round,

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
it was so quiet and it wasn't
even a devastating knockout.

51
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,160
I was getting hit behind the head,

52
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:58,340
but they wanted to call out
me hitting him behind the ear.

53
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,200
But how many times I got hit
behind the head never was revealed.

54
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,970
It was like even just this, just a
whole, you know, bill up to it. You know,

55
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,600
he sold his story, he sold his
store over to America and you know,

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,310
any combat sport it did with
emotional emotions, you know,

57
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,160
people got emotionally tied to it.
People,

58
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,440
a lot of people could relate to his story,
you know,

59
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:23,850
certain things I could relate to. And
then, you know, when, when you, you,

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,520
when you capture, you know, the
world and you capture people that,

61
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,880
that um, they get emotional involved.
They want you to win. Right. You know,

62
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,810
just because of the stuff I have worn
them and wearing and stuff like that.

63
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:38,240
And um, um, the commentators, you know,

64
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,780
especially Paulie's specialty, uh, and uh,

65
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,940
it got very emotional with it, a lot of
other other, other casts as well too.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,670
Just going back, listening to them,
I saw the fight six times, you know,

67
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,300
um, I definitely had, you can see
a very, a better look on the fight,

68
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,920
muting the TV,
you know,

69
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,090
well, I listened to the
commentary, but you know,

70
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:02,900
I do commentary myself or UFC.
So a lot of times,

71
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:05,210
even if I'm listening and I'm not
really listening to that much,

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,170
I'm just watching you
watching what's happening.

73
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,750
It's like I'm having a conversation in
a room with a bunch of people, right?

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,070
I was watching what was happening,
but it was interesting to me was a,

75
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:17,480
you made adjustments, you know, and one
thing that you made a big adjustment is,

76
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,230
um, when you landed in the 12th
round, you shorten everything up.

77
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,170
You shorten that right hand up.
It wasn't a winging punch at all.

78
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:25,310
It came straight down the pipe.

79
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:28,790
And then that left hand behind him in
the fucking timing cause he was already

80
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,640
going down. You already hit
him clean. He's going down.

81
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:36,360
Then that fucking left
hook man. Whoa. What was,

82
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,320
what was really crazy
that he got up from the,

83
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,310
snapped him around like the extra cyst.

84
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,270
It was when he went flying and
then flat line in and laid back.

85
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:44,991
I was like it's over.

86
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:48,380
I can't believe he knocked him out in
the 12 fucking round cause all fight.

87
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,360
I was saying all this
guy needs is one punch.

88
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:53,780
Like you got that scary
creepy power and then boom.

89
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,920
Well you could say that all day long
but if it never lands it doesn't mean

90
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:01,970
anything. Right, right. And it landed and
the way it lands, it was like Holy Shit.

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,270
I told her, I said you're going to
have to be perfect for all 12 wells.

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,670
I only have to be perfect
for a couple of seconds.

93
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,520
That's one thing that I did
hear the commentators say.

94
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,280
They said that he's proven that he doesn't
have to be perfect cause he got hit,

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,930
but it was like he, but he didn't
get hit clean. You got hit one time,

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,890
like pretty solid behind the year,
but the big one was in the 12th.

97
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,120
I'm so impressed with both things with
you being able to land like that with him,

98
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:26,954
but able to get up.

99
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,380
That was probably one of
the best heavyweight fights
by fucking ever seen it was

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,380
show me that night. You don't.
Sure. The heavyweight division has,

101
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,590
has been there for for a long time.

102
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:42,190
And then we started with last year or
something to just started religious

103
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,010
progressing in and people
started talking about it. Um,

104
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,930
especially been dead in
America. I remember one time
when no one knew who was,

105
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,420
who was the heavyweight champion
of the World War, you know,

106
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,400
it was a European guys
and stuff like that.

107
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:58,730
So I always made it my business like I
want to bring it back, I want to do it.

108
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:03,290
Like I led it. And a lot of the other
former champions did it where people knew,

109
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:03,541
well,

110
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:07,510
understand the sport of boxing then who
was the champion and stuff like that.

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,320
I always felt I had that, that duty to
fulfill even when I was in the Olympics,

112
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,070
because a lot of people don't even know
I was in the Olympics, you know? Um,

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,630
I was the only American tomato
in 2008 Olympics as well.

114
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,310
And just from that point, it felt like
I had to be the one to bring it back.
