1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,080
Now people that are journalists
and writers often like stimulants,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,310
they often like Adderall. Adderall
is a big issue for, uh, for,

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,630
for journalists. How much experience do
you have with Adderall? I'm at East it,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,040
it's supposed to be amazing.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,880
I've never tried to use it precisely
because I know I would love it, right.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,250
Like I would,
I,

7
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:23,090
I've got a young relative
whose prescribed it and um,

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,460
during the times when I've
been telling you he's a, yeah,

9
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:31,461
he's often tried to know spike me but
like to join him and this is for you,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,480
I'd role opens up a whole other thing.
Right.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,370
Which is this what you're talking about
again, which is I'm not against people,

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,130
obviously not against people using
drugs in order to enhance their lives.

13
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,560
And I have,
before I came here,

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:49,440
I drank enough caffeine to kill a
whole fucking field of cows. Right.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,030
I assume viewers can probably tell I'm,

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,190
I personally limit my
stimulant use because um,

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,210
because I know I can teach. Yeah.
And I can tell that I could easily,

18
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,370
a bit like we had to be the
modafinil when I start using that.

19
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,010
We definitely got that sense. I just
used it everyday for three months. Right.

20
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:12,810
Which was ludicrous thing to do.
But um,

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,320
I think in terms of stimulants, there's
a whole debate that needs to be had. Now,

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm going to write about this
at some point, but one in 10,

23
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:26,730
13 year old boys in this country
is being given a stimulant drug,

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,900
right? In any given year, right?
For add or Adhd or, I mean,

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,900
that is horrifying. It's crazy, right?

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,740
30% of children in foster
care in the United States,

27
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:39,540
I've been given at least
one psychiatric drug.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,990
These are not children in
the main who are, you know,

29
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,550
have some biological insanity.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,430
These are kids who've been fucking
abused and treated abysmally.

31
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:49,570
And what do we do? We drug them
to shut them up, right? Well,

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,700
it's also children have a lot of energy
and it's not easy to control them.

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,120
And so they decide that these children
have something wrong with them.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,860
Do you know, I went to this Amish village
Veloce connections, but when things,

35
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,703
it's really interesting,

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,120
there are these people who argued that
needs to be more research on this.

37
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:05,680
But Amish children don't get Adhd,
right?

38
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,500
And this is big debate what's going
on there. And so there's one argument,

39
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,150
which is obviously not exposed
to digital media, which may, uh,

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,770
and there's some evidence of just
speaking to professor Steven Lee here,

41
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:20,070
but people were getting a lot loads of
ADHD when I was in school and they're,

42
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:23,910
exactly, exactly. So that's just
because I spoke to a guy at Ucla,

43
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,010
professor Stephen Nation,
there's some effect to digital media,

44
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,860
but it's not massive. Right? Right. Um,

45
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,940
I think what's happening from the
very small amount of research you,

46
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:33,720
you're talking to the Amish
is, you know, I'd say to them,

47
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,600
do you have kids who don't want
to sit still? And they go, yeah,

48
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,370
we'll let and golf and go fishing.
Right?

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,370
The Amish don't want to make you sit
still for eight hours a day. Right.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,100
There's nothing in their society
that I'm not an idealized image.

51
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,070
She has problems with getting a child
to sit still for eight hours a day,

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,210
just like trying to get a puppy to
sit still for eight hours a day.

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,520
And that's exactly the right analogy.
What we do to our children.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
We tried to deaden them and discipline
them to cope and thrive in a dead end and

55
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:02,850
disciplines in inverted commerce economy.
