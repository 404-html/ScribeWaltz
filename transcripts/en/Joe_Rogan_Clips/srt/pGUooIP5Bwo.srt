1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,770
You know, I think people like overall a
pretty nice on the highway even in la,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,580
but sometimes they're not. Do you think
the neuro link will help that client?

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,830
Probably everybody would
be locked in together.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,780
This hive mind tunnels will help it. We're
gonna have traffic that'll help a lot.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,670
Yeah.
How many of those can you put in there?

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,820
Cause I was thinking about travel buddy.

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,060
That's the thing about tunnels as you
can go three d so you can go many levels,

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,080
right? So until you hit
hell yeah, but you could go,

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,440
you could have a hundred levels of
tunnel then bombs. Jesus Christ,

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,880
I don't want to be on 99 and that'll
be the 99th negative 99 floors.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,230
Cool.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,660
This is one of the fundamental things
people don't appreciate about tunnels is

13
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:42,800
that there's not like roads.

14
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:46,850
The fundamental issue with roads is that
do you have a tutee transport system

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,270
and a three d living and
workspace environment.

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,540
So you've got all these tall buildings
or concentrated work environments and,

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,740
and then then you want to go into
this like two of the transport system,

18
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:05,030
which is pretty low density because
cars is per spaced out pretty far.

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,780
Um, and, and so that obviously
is not going to work.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,880
You're going to have traffic guaranteed.

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,820
But if you can go three D
on your transport system,

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,600
then you can solve all traffic and you
can either go 3-d up with a flying car or

23
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,870
can go through ed down with tunnels and
you can have as many tunnel levels as

24
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:28,730
you want and you can arbitrarily
relieve any amount of traffic.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,600
You can go further down with tunnels.
Then you can go up with buildings.

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,810
You're 10,000 feet down if you want.
I wouldn't recommend it.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,220
But what was that movie with?
What's his face? Bradley Cooper.

28
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:47,170
Not Bradley Cooper. Uh, Christian. Now
what the fuck's his name? Who is Batman?

29
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,150
Christian Bale, where they fought
dragons. Him and Matthew mcconaughey.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,940
They went down deep into the
earth. How high? How deep
can we go, man? Yeah, it was,

31
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,790
it was that man fought dragons.
Batman.

32
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,700
But Reyna Reyna fire never saw that.

33
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,690
No Terrell but good.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,430
I wouldn't recommend saying
bring super far down. Right.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,050
Multan yeah.

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,470
Earth is a drawing ball of lava
with a thin crust on the top,

37
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,890
which we think of as like the surface,

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,390
this crust and it's mostly
just a big ball of lava.

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,503
Yeah,

40
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,960
that's earth. But 10,000
feet, it's not a big deal.

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,260
Have you given any consideration
whatsoever to the flat earth movement?

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,890
I think that's a trawl
situation. Oh it's not. No,

43
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:46,820
it's not. You would like to think
that because you're a super genius,

44
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,390
but I as a normal normal person,

45
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,080
I know there's people way
dumber than me and they really,

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,000
really believe they watch you two videos
which go on uninterrupted and spew out

47
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,580
bunch of fucking fake facts very
eloquently and articulately.

48
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,580
And they really believe these
people really believe. I
mean if it works for them,

49
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,520
I'm sure.
Fine.

50
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,570
It's weird that right.

51
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,910
That in this age where you know it was
ludicrous mode and your car goes 1.9

52
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:20,540
seconds.

53
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,540
Zero to 62.2 2.2 which
one's 1.9 the roaster.

54
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,200
The next generation roadster.
Okay. Standard edition. Yeah.
I'm on top of this shit.

55
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,020
That's just it.
That's just what the standard edition.

56
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,010
So it though about the form of
package Wa wide performance package.

57
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,050
What the fuck do you need a put
rocket thrusters on it for real?

58
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,130
What are they going to burn?
Hot Ultra high pressure.

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,790
Compressed air. Whoa. Just
cold, cold gas thrusters.

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,370
Did you have to have an air tanks? Are
they sucking the air out? Okay. Yeah.

61
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,030
I just have an electric pump.
Whoa.

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,000
Pump it up to like 10,000 PSI
and how fast are we talking?

63
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,560
Zero to 60 how fast you want to go?
I'm wanting to go. Could make it fly.

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,100
I want to go back in time can make
it fly. You make it fly. Sure.

65
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,310
Do you anticipate that as being I when
you were talking about the tunnels and

66
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,440
then flying cars, do you really
think that's going to be real,

67
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,850
too noisy and this too much airflow so
that the fundamental issue with flying

68
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:21,410
cars, I mean if you get work
one of those like toy drones,

69
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,000
I think of how much, how loud those
are and how much air that they,

70
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,240
how much air they blow. Now imagine if
that's like a thousand times heavier. Hmm.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,900
This is not going to be
make her neighbors happy.

72
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,360
Your neighbors are not going to be happy.

73
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,210
If you land a flying car in your backyard,

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,270
it would be very helicopters like that
or on your roof that are just really

75
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,270
going to be like,
what the hell that it was annoying.

76
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,220
You can't even look if
you want a flying car,

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,530
just put some wheels on a helicopter.
Is there a way around that?

78
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:55,580
Like what if they figure out some sort
of magnetic technology, like all those,

79
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Bob was our type characters were thinking
that was a part of the UFO technology.

80
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:04,100
They were doing an area 51 member.
It, didn't. They have some,

81
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,230
some thoughts about magnetics?
Nope. No bullshit. Yes. Really?

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,830
Yeah. It was a fundamental momentum
exchange with the air. So you must,

83
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,530
you must accelerate.
There's this, like this,

84
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,460
there's a sudden you have a mass and have
gravity, gravitational acceleration, um,

85
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,770
and mass mass times your
mass times gravity must equal
the massive airflow times

86
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,530
acceleration of that airflow
to have a neutral force.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
So it's impossible and
then you won't move.

88
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,130
But if if mg is greater than MMA,
you will go down.

89
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,050
And if mas greater than mg, you
will go up. That's how it works.

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,110
There's just no way around that.
There is definitely no way around it.

91
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,770
There's no way to create some sort of
a magnetic something or another that

92
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:55,370
allows you to technically, yes,

93
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,590
you could have a strong enough magnet,

94
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,370
but that magnet,

95
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,600
it would be so strong that you
would create a lot of trouble.

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,640
We just suck cars up in new your car,

97
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:17,170
his pickup mean mean and she'd have to
repel off of either a material on the

98
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:23,921
ground or in a really nasty situation
off of Earth's gravitational field and

99
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,510
somehow make that incredibly light.

100
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,690
But that magnet would
cause so much destruction.

101
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,660
You'd be better off with a helicopter.

102
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,110
So if there was some sort of magnet road,

103
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,230
like you have two magnets
and they repel each other.

104
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,100
If you had some sort of a magnet road
that was below you and you could travel on

105
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,610
that magnet road, that would work. Oh

106
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,320
yes. Yes. You could have a magnet road, a
magnet road. Cause that's ridiculous. No,

107
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,800
it's work. I do that too,
right? I would not recommend it.

108
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,140
There's a lot of things I don't
recommend or not recommend that not good.

109
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,240
Not Wise, I think no roads, no, no that.

110
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,590
No, definitely not. Definitely not. It
was good. I would cause a lot of trouble.

111
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,040
So you've put some time and consideration
into this other than, you know,

112
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,240
instead of like my
foolishly rendered thoughts.

113
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,600
So you think the tunnels are the way
to do it? Oh, it'll work for sure.

114
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,430
That'll work. Yes. And your, these,

115
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,350
these tunnels that you're
building right now,

116
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:36,680
these are basically just
like test versions of this
ultimate idea that you have.

117
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,090
You know, it's just a
hole in the ground, right?

118
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,540
We played videos of it where you just,

119
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,040
the guys that you're going to
drop that hole in the ground,

120
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,680
there's a sled on it and the sled,
he goes very fast.

121
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,190
Like a hundred miles an hour plus. Yeah,
you can go real fast, fast as you want.

122
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:56,630
And then if you want to go long distances
you can just grow the air out of the

123
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,520
tunnel.
Make sure it's real straight.

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,590
Draw the air at the tunnel is head
of vacuum tunnel. Um, cause the,

125
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,410
and then depending on how fast you want
to go to any of these wheels or you

126
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:13,910
could use air bearings depending upon
the ambient pressure in the tunnel or you

127
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,890
could a maglev it if you
want to go super fast. Um,

128
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,210
so magnet road, yes, but
underground magnet roads,

129
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,420
underground manga otherwise you're going
to really create a lot of trouble with

130
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,620
because those metal things, so magnet
roads, the way to go just underground.

131
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,580
If you want to go really fast
underground you would be in a,

132
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,710
you would be maglev in a vacuum
tunnel mag in a vacuum tunnel.

133
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,480
Magnetic levitation in the back of
tunnel one with rocket launchers.

134
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,830
No, I would not recommend putting
any exhaust gas in the tunnel.

135
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,460
Oh okay. I see what you're saying.
Cause then you got to pump it on, right?

136
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:55,380
You have to pump it out and you probably
have limited amount of air in the first

137
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,520
place.
Like how much can you breathe?

138
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,230
Do you have to pump oxygen into
these cubicles to pressurize part?

139
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,330
It'd be like a,
like a little tiny underground space ship.

140
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:07,160
Basically like a airplane.
Cause you have a or an airplane.

141
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:11,880
It's not getting new Aaron. It is, it is,
yes. You have like a little hole. Yeah,

142
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:15,210
they have a pump. Really? Yeah. It
gets it from the outside. Yes. Wow.

143
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:15,990
I didn't know that was like,

144
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,990
it's the era airplanes have have it
easy because essentially you can,

145
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,010
they're pretty leaky. Uh, but
she's, yeah, so long as they,

146
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,350
as long as the air pump is working at
a decent speed, they have backup pumps,

147
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,360
still have like, you know, three pumps
are four pumps or something. And uh,

148
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,640
and then that, then
there's like, there's an x,

149
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,760
it exhausts through the outflow valve and,

150
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,470
and through whatever seals
are not sealing quite right.

151
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,870
Usually the door doesn't
feel quite right on a plane.

152
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,510
This was a bit of leakage
around the door and uh,

153
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,890
but the pumps,
uh,

154
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,010
exceed the outflow rate and then that
sets the pressure in the, in the cabin.

155
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,270
Now have you ever looked at
Torrance and gone, I could fix this,

156
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,410
but I just don't have the time.
As you make a better design for a plane,

157
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,460
you do a better design.
I mean,

158
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,240
probably, I think it is. Yeah. Oh,
who have you talked to about this?

159
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,790
And I've talked to
friends, friends, friends,

160
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,220
and your friend girlfriends
and you can tell me,

161
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,040
what do you got? What's
going on? Well, I mean,

162
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,880
the exciting thing to do would be some
sort of electric vertical takeoff and

163
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,660
landing supersonic jet of some kind
of vertical takeoff and landing me,

164
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,420
no need for a run might just
shoot up straight in the air.

165
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,840
Oh,
okay.

166
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,203
How would you do that?

167
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,050
Yeah,

168
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,840
when they do that and some
military Aircrafts, correct. Yes.

169
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,980
The trick is that you have, you have
to transition to level flight. Um,

170
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,840
and then you, the, the,

171
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,260
the thing that you'd use for vertical
Tafe will take off and landing is not

172
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,500
suitable for high speed flight.
So you have two different systems,

173
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,800
vary quite a lot of thought
about this quite a lot. Um, I,

174
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,220
the interesting thing about an electric
plane is that you want to go as high as

175
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:16,054
possible,

176
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,630
but you need a certain energy density
in the battery pack because you have to

177
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,030
have a calm gravitational
potential energy.

178
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:25,060
Once you've outcome gravitational
potential energy and you're at, at, at,

179
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,350
at a high altitude,

180
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,980
the energy use Incruse is very low and
then you can recapture a large part of

181
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:36,040
your, the gravitational potential
energy on the way down. Um,

182
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,460
so you really don't need any kind
of reserve fuel, if you will,

183
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:43,900
because you have the, the, the energy of
height, gravitational potential energy.

184
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,480
This is a lot of energy. So, so
once you can get hot at the high,

185
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,790
you
like,

186
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:55,930
the way to think about a plane is a
force balance to the force balance.

187
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,390
So a plane that is not
accelerating, um, is a,

188
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,260
is a neutral force balance.
Yeah, the force of gravity.

189
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,300
If the lift force of the wings,
then you've got the force of the,

190
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,070
one of a thrusting device or the,

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,080
the propeller or turbine or whatever it
is and you've got the resistance force

192
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:23,150
of the air. Now the higher you go,
the lower the air assistance. Yes,

193
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,870
air density drops exponentially,

194
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,430
but drag increases with the square
and exponential beats of square.

195
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,790
The higher you go, the faster you
will go for the same amount of energy

196
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,550
and at a certain altitude you will,

197
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,310
you can go supersonic
with less energy per mile,

198
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,660
quite a lot less energy per mile.

199
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,050
Then an aircraft at 35,000 feet
because it's just a force balance.

200
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:57,030
I'm just doing it for this conversation.
It makes sense though.
