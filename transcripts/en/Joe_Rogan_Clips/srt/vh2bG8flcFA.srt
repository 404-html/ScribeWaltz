1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,910
Now, let me ask you
this, cause this is the,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,020
we're in the biggest crisis
in terms of immigration,

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,460
in terms of national discussion.

4
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:11,880
The biggest discussion of it than I can
ever remember right now with this wall

5
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,690
shit where the government is completely
shut down and no one's budging on either

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:18,180
side and all these government workers
are not getting paid and psalm because

7
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:22,530
Trump wants $5 billion for this wall.
I'm not,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,610
let's just,
in an ideal world,

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,630
it would be ideal if the way the world
worked was the way America works,

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,200
where you can just go every you want.
That'd be the ideal world.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,420
If the whole world was America in the,
in the sense of you can go to New Mexico,

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,500
you didn't have to get paperwork signed.
You don't have to know.

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,040
It has to tell you whether or not you're
allowed to go visit or not go visit.

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,670
He just drive there. That's,
that's a nice thing about America.

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,570
It's almost like Europe, but you don't
need a passport. Not In, it's like Europe.

16
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:56,520
I know you guys have been around
longer and all that good stuff.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,460
That's not what I mean. I mean in terms
of there's a bunch of different fields.

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,350
It's all speaking one language,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,580
but there's a big difference between
visiting Montana and visiting Miami.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,380
You know,
if you go to billings,

21
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,040
Montana and hang out with the local
folk at a coffee shop and then you go to

22
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:15,990
some fucking crazy after I already after
hours party in Miami on Miami beach at

23
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:19,860
four in the morning and p did, he
shows up and fucking, you know,

24
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:23,400
and as all these celebrities and people
are doing coke on the floor and like

25
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,730
what the fuck is this?
This is a different world.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,920
It's a different world and it's a
bunch of these different worlds.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,860
New York City's a different world.
You know, La is a different world.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,720
You're allowed to go there.

29
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,730
Wouldn't it be great if the
whole world was like that?

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,270
You can just kind of go wherever you
wanted to go and it would all sort itself

31
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:43,140
out. The idea is you can't
because it would fuck up our
quality of life and would

32
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:46,560
make us less safe.
And I get the argument.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,260
Certainly you don't want to
bring in criminals and murderers.

34
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,410
You don't want drug dealers making their
way into this country and starting gang

35
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:55,860
violence and all that stuff. Yes, you're
absolutely right. And to deny that,

36
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,300
I think it's pretty fucking foolish.

37
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,370
Yeah. I think it's a matter of like
there's a lot to it. It's a fluid.

38
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,460
The border is always going to be fluid
and it needs to be fluid. You know,

39
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:10,020
we need the immigrant spirit of coming
in and a lot of them do start small

40
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:13,600
businesses when you know, and again,
when they're brought in legally. Um,

41
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,290
and so how do you, how do you create
a flow of people that is good for us?

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,010
Cause they say most of the immigrants
that come here are the smartest,

43
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,460
sharpest people,
most driven and wherever they're from.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,210
So we're actually drawing a really good,
you know,

45
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,780
they talk so much about the criminals,

46
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:35,130
but the truth is most of them that
are coming over here are the ones that

47
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,200
probably have the most to
offer to this country. Well.

48
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:41,130
Exactly like our parents' generation.
Like our grandparents,

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,130
like my grandparents. Like when did
your, your grandparents come over here,

50
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:47,630
it was it your grandparents
or 1910 my grandparents. Yeah,

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,960
mine as well that your grandfather was
one of 13 and 12 of them came over here

52
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,660
and they lived in a two
room fucking mud hut.

53
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,840
Somehow they kept finding the money
to send one kid over at a time.

54
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,500
Like usually when they were about 15

55
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,260
horse. Crazy shit. Yeah.

56
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,970
See that kind of shit is what I'm
talking about. Like those kind of people,

57
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,030
shouldn't they be allowed to come here?
That's how this thing got started. The,

58
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,750
the real problem is that their
spots that suck as the real problem.

59
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,310
It's like we were talking
about like white privilege.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,560
White privilege is not the problem.
The problem is racism.

61
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,030
Racism doesn't exist in everyone's exactly
the same and then we're okay and then

62
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,260
we don't need to worry
about white privilege.

63
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,450
What the real problem
that you're not getting,

64
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,800
you're not getting racist things thrown
at you the way black people are. Yeah,

65
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,540
for sure.
But that's not the problem.

66
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,880
The problem is racist things
being thrown at black people.

67
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,570
It's not that I don't get it right.

68
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,030
It's say you get it right and it's like
it took to highlight the fact that it's

69
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:47,740
not happening to me. I get what
you're saying. But the real pro,

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,430
I think it's a distraction that the
real problem is the racism itself.

71
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,330
The real problem is the,

72
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,830
when you see actual Nazis in 2018,

73
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:00,520
2019 actual ones,
real ones like not,

74
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,180
not just dressing up cause they
think it's a hoot. We, oh mom, rebel.

75
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm fucking hell. The road, I've got a
piece of tape under my nose. The same,

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,490
there's a fucking people
that aren't really Nazis, but
they're dumb. Yeah. Right.

77
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,280
But then you see real Nazi
in 2019 you're like, okay,

78
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:17,950
that's real racism.
Yeah.

79
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,570
Now when they go into,
uh,

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,480
I was in Portland and they said there's
regular clashes like once a month

81
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:29,440
there's a demonstration and it's either
the alt right having a demonstration and

82
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,640
then the a,
what do they call them?

83
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:35,641
The something far Antifa Antifa show up
and they have regular fights and it's

84
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,160
fucking Nazis.
God Damn.

85
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,230
Oregon's a fucked up state
because it was originally,

86
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,980
there were no black people allowed in
Oregon. That's the, that's the, you know,

87
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,940
cause now Portland is, is
very progressive, super
progressive, super veracity,

88
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,060
but there's no black people there.
So it seems there are, it's,

89
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,210
he feels a little hollow that
when you're there rubbing shit.

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,900
I just did New Year's Eve shows there and
they were, they were, it was all white.

91
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,090
It was all white. It was weird. That
is weird. There. Dot. If I was black,

92
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,690
I would go to Portland and a second,
you'd have so many friends instantly.

93
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,470
Everybody wants to high five.
You have you over for dinner.
