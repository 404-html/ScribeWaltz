1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,560
So then you don't have to do the
leg work of the arguments. It's,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,960
it's a lot harder to take a position that
says you should be who you are and you

3
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:09,510
have to fit that into
society rather than saying,

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,280
this is what the moral imperative is,
this is why we need those laws.

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,620
And if you deviate from that,
you're the bad guy.

6
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:21,600
So unfortunately they've just embraced
that, I think too much. So it's like,

7
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:24,210
it's like one of those things like when
I go to these colleges and I'm usually

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,480
invited by libertarians and
it's like the returns point,

9
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,330
low taxes and limited government and
live how you want to live, right?

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,210
That's the basics of it. But
they'll often say, you know,

11
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,510
I talk about low taxes in a college
class and people say I'm racist.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,940
And it's like,
well how does race get into that?

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,900
But what they will say is that what
they'll say is, well, wait a minute.

14
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,920
If you want low taxes,

15
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:47,640
that means you don't want money
going to people who need it more.

16
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:52,320
And often it is people of color who need
it more. So you inherently are racist.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,370
You have to think on how to make
the counter argument to that. The,

18
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,770
I think there's a very valid
counter argument that I buy into,

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,250
but you have to think it's very easy
to just take somebody who thinks the

20
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:06,060
reverse of you and go, you're
racist, you're racist. Such a thing.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,440
Such a lazy way to approach an
idea. Yeah. Yeah. It's so lazy.

22
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,360
The only thing I have a problem with,

23
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:16,380
what Jordan has been saying lately is
this idea of enforced monogamy being the

24
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,090
solution to insoles, these involuntary
celibates that's not going to help.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,700
So what do you think I become men?
Well,

26
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,920
what do you think his definition
of enforcement argument is?

27
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,120
Just to be clear with the force.
Monogamy were people, you know, the,

28
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:34,980
the culture encourages and supports
the idea of monogamy. Yeah.

29
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,280
In effect he's talking about Matt,
he's just talking about marriage and that,

30
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,040
but that's not going to clear the way
to people that no one wants to fuck.

31
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,330
It's just not going to.

32
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,940
The idea is that there's a bunch of men
out there that are taking up all the

33
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,490
viable females because no one's
getting married and it just,

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,350
there's no room for these insoles.
No,

35
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,010
they are not attractive to women,

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,870
whether they're not physically attractive.

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,830
You tell me Harvey Weinstein
was physically attractive.
Fucking disgusting pig.

38
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,640
Forget about what he did to those women
are the rapes or the sexual assaults.

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,850
He had a gorgeous wife.
His wife was gorgeous.

40
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:09,570
That was a voluntary relationship.
Okay, so how did that happen?

41
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,800
It happened through success.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,310
It happened through success and confidence
and whatever the fuck else he's got,

43
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,880
Eh, you know, intellect. I don't
know what his mind's like. These,

44
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,930
these insoles, they have
to become men. Okay.

45
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,110
And there's the Jordans all about that.
I mean, his whole message is that,

46
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,230
I just don't think that enforced monogamy
has any factor whatsoever in this.

47
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,910
So he, I think he would say
this, but I'm not as lawyer,

48
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:37,020
but I think he used the phrase,
all he meant was marriage.

49
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,860
That generally societies that more
people are married and let's just remain

50
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,600
married. Right? So I think I can help.

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,330
I think perhaps if he was being
interviewed again by, by her,

52
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,360
he would use a different phrase. Even
if they, if even if he says marriage,

53
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,900
marriage is not going to help in cells,
these guys that are involuntary celibate,

54
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,600
they have to become attractive
so they have to become men.

55
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,700
Well the rest of his messages about that,
but they have to do difficult things.

56
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,440
That's what they have to do. They have
to, they have to build your confidence,

57
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,580
get your shit together.

58
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,730
And martial arts I think is one
of the best ways to do that.

59
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,220
I've seen so many men that were like sick,

60
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,250
insecure and Dorky and w they become
fucking nerd assassins through martial

61
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,210
arts.
And it's,

62
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,210
I think it's a great way
to build confidence and I
think there's an extreme lack

63
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,550
of adversity, physical adversity
and a lot of people's lives.

64
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,420
And overcoming physical adversity is
what leads to a lot of confidence in men.

65
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,920
And I just think that there's a lot of
men that are just have no idea whether

66
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,230
they can or can't do anything difficult.

67
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,120
And they have massive
insecurity because of it.

68
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,980
I think he would agree with every word.

69
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,410
I think he went to everywhere
that you just said there. Yeah.

70
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,530
I just think that marriage is not fixing
it. You know, culturally enforcement,

71
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,551
it's not going to fix it.

72
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:50,551
They have to become men and they had the
woman has to have a reason to want to

73
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,600
have sex with you.
Yeah.

74
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,340
Yeah.
So I think he would agree with that.

75
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,620
I think he would say that
once you accomplish that,

76
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:59,250
that that's when you will find
more women and that the next step,

77
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:03,030
the next natural progression in life is
that you will find someone that you want

78
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:07,420
to be partnered with and that that
then has the best value for society. I,

79
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,770
but I don't want to completely state his
case. Hmm. It's an interesting case. Yeah.

80
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,780
But,
but he completely,

81
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,740
I mean look why is it that for the
little bit that these articles get right

82
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:20,910
about him. It's that he's
helping men. He is, yes, he is
also helping women, but yes,

83
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,060
he is helping men to,
men need their shit together.

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,250
Need Framework for sure.
I mean people need this,

85
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,820
this thing about discipline and you
know, are you, are you, are you aware of,

86
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:35,070
you know, you're aware of Jocko, Jocko
Willink. Discipline equals freedom.

87
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:38,530
It's like one of the best catchphrases.
It's so accurate. It's empowering.

88
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,740
It's so empowering.
Get your shit together and then you,

89
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,910
the time that you have for recreation,
you'll appreciate it so much more.

90
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,210
You don't appreciate rest when
you're fucking off all day.

91
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,550
You're appreciate rest.
When you've worked hard,

92
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,610
that's when it means something to you.
When you've accomplished goals,

93
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,940
that's when this celebration is,
is something that

94
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,690
you,
you get a good feeling from it.

95
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,820
Do you have a part in your
life that you feel like

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,330
is lacking in that department?

97
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,290
In what department and just
like getting your shit together.

98
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,960
Like not slacking on snow.

99
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,760
Yeah, that's what I do. Yeah.
I mean I do a lot of shit.

100
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,700
The only way I could ever do as
many different things as I do,

101
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:18,810
as if I just get after it. Yeah. I
get after it pretty fucking good.

102
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,980
Yeah. I'm not, I'm not an
insecure in that. I mean,

103
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:27,330
whether it's through martial arts
or any kind of exercise or work,

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,630
I just, I take pride in getting things
done. I take pride in working. Yeah.

105
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,180
You know, especially working towards
things that are important to me,

106
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:39,140
whether it's working on my sat,
working on my stand up,

107
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,920
whether it's working on a podcast,

108
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:45,630
whether it's working on my martial
arts or my fitness or yoga or whatever.

109
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,760
I get after it. Man, did
you got to, and for me,

110
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,300
it's not a matter of whether or not it's
an option. It's like brushing my teeth.

111
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,900
I don't decide one day own
want to brush my teeth today.

112
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,760
I just fucking brush my teeth.

113
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,830
And when there's days where I'm doing
fasted cardio, when that alarm goes off,

114
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,060
it's not a matter of whether or not a
shut the alarm off. That's not an option.

115
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,940
You Get up,
you put your fucking shoes on,

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,700
you get the dog and you go running
because that's what you do.

117
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,750
And if you just decide that's what you do,
then you get things done.

118
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,370
And then a month later you're
like, oh, we did this all month,

119
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,480
and then six months later it's
like, oh, I did this half a year.

120
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,500
And then if you're doing Jujitsu, you're
like, oh shit, look, I got a blue belt.

121
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,700
Oh Shit. Now I'm a purple belt. And that's
how you become a black belt. He just,

122
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,241
you know,

123
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:39,440
and I got the good type of progressive
cause it gets progressively easier too.

124
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,230
I told you I'm doing that. It doesn't
though. It doesn't get easy. You know,

125
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:45,470
think so fucking hard every time
that alarm goes off like fuck,

126
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,390
but you don't get it for you now then
right when you started, I don't know, man.

127
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,990
Do you know the reward of it? You know
that that reward is some enforcement.

128
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,340
There's some enforcement in
the success that I've had in,

129
00:06:56,341 --> 00:07:00,910
in completing these tasks, but every
fucking time I go to yoga class, I'm like,

130
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,760
oh Jesus,

131
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,050
90 minutes in 104 degree temperature
with these all these women that are going

132
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,540
to humiliate me, they can definitely
do things that you can't do well.

133
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,140
This is their tough man.

134
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,480
There's a lot of these older ladies
that are fucking tough, you know,

135
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,780
they just gut it out.
I was just one lady that goes there.

136
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,710
She's like 60 years old,

137
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:22,670
she doesn't even bring water and this
lady's in there for 90 fucking minutes,

138
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:26,140
sweat it out. She's there every time I
go, I'm like, she's not bringing water.

139
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,080
You sure?
She's 60 she could be like 20 and just,

140
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,360
Oh she's gray hair and tough as shit.

141
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,600
She drinks water before she drinks it
after. But when she's in that class,

142
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,490
he's just tough. It's just, you know,
it's never easy to do. You know,

143
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,860
it gets a little bit easier
when you get better at it,

144
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,110
but then you just try harder
and it makes it more difficult.

145
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,790
If you're always giving 100% effort, it's
always going to be hard. You know, you,

146
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:53,240
you take some pride in the fact that
now I can go two miles through the hills

147
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:53,931
and you know,

148
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,020
and reach the point of exhaustion
where before it was one or whatever,

149
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,290
whatever your little little
progress markers are,

150
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,860
you get some satisfaction in that.
But it's always difficult to get going.

151
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,161
The the,

152
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:08,750
the hardest step is the first step is
not the 30th staff or the hundredth step.

153
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:12,260
It's the fucking first one. It's
getting on the trail, getting going.

154
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:13,280
It's the hardest thing.

155
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,150
The hardest weight to lift is the first
one because once you get going like,

156
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,710
okay,
I'm a half hour into my workout,

157
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,380
I'm writing things down and I'm supposed
to be doing now I got, you know,

158
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,760
20 Chin ups and then the burpees and
then all these days you have to do it.

159
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,030
You just have to do it. And so many
people have a hard time doing it.

160
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,370
If you would have ever been moving.
