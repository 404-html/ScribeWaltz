1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,650
Felt like one day where I did,

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:06,651
I got 935 points in one workout and
then another hundred points afterwards.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm like, one day like that was
separate me from the pack. Just one day.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,400
Just put fear in their home.

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:18,900
He just asks you something just to be fair
that everybody here. What about stuff?

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,900
Some of the stuff doesn't that kind
of, you mean like testosterone? Yeah,

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,780
100% helps. I told them, I told them,

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,170
this is a fucking shoot.
Shit. All those mills shut.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,040
I gave them my doctor's information.
I told them what they should do,

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,600
but I'm also at least eight
years older than all. Right.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,850
How old are you? 41 41 I'm 51 now.

12
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,150
I'm older than all. Yeah,
but the testosterone.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,720
Oh yeah, you should. I'm
failing all those tasks. Yeah.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,510
Testosterone replacement therapy,
hormone replacement therapy.

15
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:02,511
I started doing all that when
I was 40 so that's their age.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,610
Yeah, it makes a big difference.
Makes a big difference.
Fuck yeah. It look, listen,

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,470
everybody,
everybody listen to this.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,540
There's a stigma attached to that
in a lot of people like you know,

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,670
where do you get your testosterone
from or get it from my balls.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,200
All that matters is that
you have it in your system.

21
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,380
If you don't have it in your system,
you're not going to feel as good.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,480
It's real simple. If you're fine with
not feeling as good, good, go ahead.

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,870
Stick with that,
but if you're not fine with it.

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,140
This is 2018 hormone replacement therapy
exists for a reason and that reason is

25
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,990
it makes you feel way better.
It makes your body work way better.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,170
You can avoid a host of ailments and
conditions that are related to your body

27
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,250
breaking down due to age with
hormone replacement therapy.

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,860
The key to doing it though
is to do it correctly.

29
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,980
He's supposed to go to a doctor that's
going to test your blood levels,

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,250
test your nutrient levels,
and adjust your diet first.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,750
The first thing that happens is they,

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,040
they want to find out how much you're
sleeping, how s how stressed out you are,

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,320
what are you eating?
How much water are you drinking?

34
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,150
Are you getting the proper amount of
protein and vegetables eating correctly?

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,690
Let's get you off of this sugar.
Let's get you off the booze,

36
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,960
let's get you off cigarettes or whatever
the else is before they do anything.

37
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,360
So they put you that.
This is a many,

38
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,090
many month process that
I went through with a,

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,600
they get you off all these different
things and you make these adjustments and

40
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,270
then they start adding a little stuff,
add a little bit of growth hormone,

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,800
add a little bit of testosterone.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,620
First it was cream and
then it became injections.

43
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,550
It takes a little bit of time to figure
out what works best and then you get to

44
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:45,570
a point where you're, you have the
hormone levels of a healthy young man.

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,030
You don't want to elevate.
You don't want to be higher than that.

46
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,770
That's when you run into problems.
You don't want to be in like some crazy.

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,620
Vito Belfort, when he got
popped from, you know,

48
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:59,590
Nevada and he was like some
superhuman levels that was 80 over,

49
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,360
but my mother Sunday night against,

50
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,220
he was supposed to fight rumble Johnson
once the African done the Christian nice

51
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,080
guy named Mark Mark.
Mark.

52
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:12,720
Quite levels are really high in
Pittsburgh that night. That's right. Yeah.

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,610
He was in danger. He was like it was
there is dangerous to his health,

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,920
the levels, but he says that was his
doctor, his doctor fuck them. The the,

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,290
the whole idea. Well this is a
difference between, first of all,

56
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,020
there's a big difference when someone
who's competing in mixed martial arts.

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,400
Obviously you have to worry about your
opponent getting hurt because of the fact

58
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:37,030
that your enhanced,
and these are young guys are doing this.

59
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,760
When Nate was doing this, he
was like 30 years old. Right.

60
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,020
When you are talking about just
general health and wellness,

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,800
testosterone replacement therapy,
hormone replacement therapy,

62
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:51,370
there's a reason why a lot of older guys,
especially guys who can afford it,

63
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,760
they have money. They're doing it. It
makes me feel better. It just does.

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,500
And if you don't want to do it,
that's fine.

65
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,230
There's ways of elevating
your testosterone natural.

66
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,430
They just don't work as well with whether
it's dead lifts are running hills,

67
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,680
doing sprints.
They work a little bit better.

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,750
It works a little bit better than nothing,
but it does lots of very good. Yeah,

69
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,670
they release but not enough
for what you're saying. No,

70
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,960
there's going to be a difference. I just
get a raise him through acupuncture.

71
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,850
I know that she's discussed raising,
but it was at this tasco acupuncture.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
I would like to see studies on that.

73
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,820
The problem is it's really painful at
some just painful for that. Really Nice.

74
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,240
It sits in your feet. Yeah, I
like to see studies on that.

75
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,560
I don't know if that's really been proven.

76
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:37,270
If that was really proven like there's,
there's ways to raise it. You know,

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,070
the chick I was with for years told me
different case studies that she had been

78
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,540
involved in.
Yeah.

79
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,380
She told me a guy came in once
then found the younger girlfriend.

80
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,650
His wife passed and they found that he
had a girlfriend and he couldn't keep up

81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,090
and he couldn't keep up.

82
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,810
So he came into the CEO and she did
a bunch of stuff and put them on a t.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,200
He came back a week later and said,
turn that shit off.

84
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:04,240
Dick will not shut down like,
but she told me, she goes,

85
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,280
I could raise your testosterone levels,

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,510
but it has to be neatly into your feet
and you got to find that a little bit

87
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,870
uncomfortable. And I was
like, leave it alone then.

88
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,440
I don't want to fucking walk around all
this stuff that we're talking about. Um,

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,920
whether it's hormone replacement therapy
or squats or dead lifts or all these,

90
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,120
all these things will help.
