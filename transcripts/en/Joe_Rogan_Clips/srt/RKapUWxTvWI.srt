1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,880
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,750
What about the idea is that the universe
is in a constant state of contraction

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,190
and expansion? Well, no.
It's up and abandoned.

4
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:12,570
Some physicist to argue that it's,

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:17,490
there's a cycle because it looks nice and
they are. I think most of most people,

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,990
I mean there's some people
who were arguing for that.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,320
I don't find that pictures well,

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,080
I think they're trying to
type their ignorance and
something that isn't any more

9
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,230
plausible in that picture. That expands
forever and as far as we can tell,

10
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:32,670
the most likely possibilities that are
universal expand forever fought to make

11
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:37,490
you a little bit happier.
It's quite possible. The best
pictures that we have of,

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,490
of, of, of the early universe is that
we actually, our universe isn't unique,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,440
isn't alone.
That there are many universes,

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,710
we call it a multiverse and that at any
instant in time and kind of a cosmic

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,853
super time,

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,090
there's always universe being born
so that that multi-verse might be,

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,560
might be infinite and eternal.
Where are they outside of our universe?

18
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,870
How's that even possible? How of course
it's possible. I understand. Okay.

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,070
Well, first of all, the
simplest possibility is that
they're outside the region.

20
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,640
We can see right for, for, for example,

21
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,200
the edge is our visible universe.

22
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:17,760
Space is expanding faster away from
us than light because you know,

23
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,920
we taught you in school and nothing
can travel faster than light.

24
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:23,730
You may remember that from
school. We lied. Okay, well no,

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,770
you have to parse it more carefully.
Like a lawyer.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,500
Nothing could travel through
space faster than light,

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,150
but space can do whatever the hell it
wants. So locally, as I told you though,

28
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,790
radio host is,
is at rest they're not moving.

29
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,910
And and the other end of the galaxy at
the other end of the visible universe and

30
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:42,810
we're rest, but the space between
us is expanding. So that galaxy,

31
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,950
like a surfer is being carried away from
us faster than light relative to the

32
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:51,300
water, the surfers and moving.
Right. But relative to the shore,

33
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,710
the surfer is right, right. Okay. So this,

34
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,800
this galaxy is not moving relative
to its local surroundings,

35
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,240
but it's moving away from us faster than
light. And like a surfer in an undertow,

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,280
they can swim really fast in the water,

37
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:07,050
but if the water's moving
away from the shore,

38
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:10,710
they'll never make it back to the
shore. Right. And so that galaxy,

39
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,010
the light from that galaxy is traveling
through space at the speed of light.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,190
But it's the space in between us and
the galaxies moving faster than light.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,970
Then the poor light can ever make
it to us. We call that a horizon.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,130
Wow.

43
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,130
So the space is traveling too far
for the light to reach us so fast.

44
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,900
The triple spaces too fast.

45
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,980
So this light can't catch up
with the expansion of space
and it never gets to us.

46
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,110
And that that galaxy disappears
from our causal horizon.

47
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:42,540
We call it will never be able to see it.

48
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,130
We'll never be able to interact with it
will never be okay. And it could be that,

49
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,950
that there are different
regions so far away from us.

50
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,160
We're space is expanding
faster than light, which,

51
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,070
which have a very different
history than our own.

52
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,980
So there could be space,
could be infinite,

53
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,880
just our simple unit space that we know
of and love could be infinite in extent

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,530
and different regions of that space had
different histories and some of those

55
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,610
regions, everything we can see we
know emerged from a single point.

56
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,410
Okay.
We can tell that.

57
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,740
We can tell that by measuring big bang
expansion of everything we see and

58
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,470
working backwards and the university,

59
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,630
our visible universe was once
smaller and smaller and smaller.

60
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,463
If you go back in time,

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,680
we can actually follow the laws of physics
back to the earliest moments of the

62
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,770
big bang until those laws break down
and we can make predictions about the

63
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,111
university.

64
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:33,520
It looked like all his predictions agree
exactly what the observations we make,

65
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,030
which tell us that that picture works,
but another region if you wish,

66
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,440
could have come from a different big bang,

67
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,800
but is that another universe or
is it a part of the university?

68
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,780
Here's how we've changed and this is
semantics, but nontrivial semantics,

69
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:51,160
namely when I was a kid, universe
meant every everything, right?

70
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,260
But we say that's pretty
stupid definition.

71
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,630
A better definition is an operational one.

72
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,270
Universe means that region of space
with which at one time we could have

73
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:05,440
communicated or one time in the future,
even if the future is infinite,

74
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,620
we might communicate with cause that
describes the region of space where cause

75
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:14,350
and effect works some measurable distance.
Yes.

76
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,930
And so that are we think of a universe
is that region which could throughout

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,780
which everything could affect everything
else ultimately in an infinitely long

78
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,960
time.
And in that picture,

79
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,630
universities can be restricted in size
and then other regions which could never

80
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:35,050
have affected us and which will
never affect us in the future.

81
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,730
We call other universes.
Uh, and when, and,

82
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,230
and now there are many different
versions of a multiverse,

83
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,330
but that's the simplest version. And
this picture we call inflation, which,

84
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:50,260
uh, you know, I talk, I just did two
little clips associated with the new book,

85
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,700
one force for a publisher and one
was for big. Think one is, uh,

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,190
the universe in under two minutes.
So you can look up online,

87
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:57,941
look for Lawrence Krauss,

88
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:00,670
explains the universe in under two
minutes where I talk about this cosmic

89
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,450
expansion and how it might mean there's
a multiverse. But the other is, um,

90
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,260
I explained the universe in terms of this
beer bottle that I talked about to you

91
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:11,800
earlier. So you can, that's a
video, you can watch that. But it,

92
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:15,820
this theory of inflation, which
actually says are universal. The qual,

93
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,540
the qualities that we see of our universe
can best be explained if some early

94
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,710
time in the history of the universe when
it was a billionth of a billionth of a

95
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:26,020
billionth of a billionth of a second old.

96
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,360
It had a huge expansion
suddenly and increased in
size by 30 orders of magnitude

97
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:35,110
in size, in a billionth of a billionth of
a billionth of a billionth of a second.

98
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,360
Which is by the way, particle physics
suggests is highly plausible even though,

99
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,220
okay. And then, and then,

100
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,610
and then it would produce a universe
that looks more or less like we look like

101
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,110
you look like and and uh,
and it,

102
00:05:48,111 --> 00:05:51,790
and it's right now the only explanation
of what of how that would cause the

103
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,290
universe to look like,
what it looks like.

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,350
But the neat thing about
inflation is it's eternal.

105
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,860
So inflation that puffing up and in
our universe and then boom, a hot,

106
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,320
big bang followed it. Okay.
So the region, universe,

107
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,100
universe puffed up by huge amount than
all of that energy which was stored in

108
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:10,640
empty space, got released like in
the beer bottle and we got a hot,

109
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,470
Big Bang and the rest is history,
but that's locally.

110
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,240
But somewhere else between us in their
space is still expanding exponentially

111
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,860
and faster and faster and faster and
only maybe somewhere else today. Boom.

112
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:26,960
Like an ice crystal forming boom,

113
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,060
that that region of space is suddenly
left inflation and maybe a guilt a

114
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,511
gazillion years in the future,

115
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,600
there'll be another region of space
that's expanding away from a summit much

116
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,910
faster than light. So we'll never
know about it. We're suddenly,

117
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,810
that region needs inflation and
boom, another hot, big bang happens.

118
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,190
And it turns out in each of those hot,
big bangs, after the inflation ends,

119
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,450
depending upon how it ends,

120
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,060
the laws of physics could be
different in that universe.

121
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,320
And that's how we tend to think.
It's quite likely that there are many,

122
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,070
many separate regions of space.
And in fact, it's eternal.

123
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,080
So such regions are forming eternally
for all time and, and, and there are hot,

124
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,890
big bangs happening in many regions and
the properties of each of those regions,

125
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,350
whether they're conducive to forming
galaxies and stars and planets and people

126
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,680
may be different.
So we could say logically in that picture,

127
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,270
that the reason the universe looks like
the way it does is because we're here to

128
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:24,890
measure it.
Oh my God,

129
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,350
we should leave it at that.
Okay. We should close with that.

130
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:29,360
That is the mind blower of one blowers.

131
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,630
Good.
