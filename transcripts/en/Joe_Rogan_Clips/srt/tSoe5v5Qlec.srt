1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,660
Yeah,
I mean,

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,660
I guess that's like what it must be to
just be in the Amazon itself as well.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,140
Right.
And you're sharing the jungle,

4
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,840
not just the rivers and the
lakes or whatever's out there,

5
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:14,310
but the actual jungle itself, it's,
it was incredible. The jungle there.

6
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,730
So we were in Columbia and Amazon and
like talk about untouched by people.

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:21,060
There has been this kind of ongoing
going conflict in Columbia for many,

8
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:24,990
many years. So we were the first
westerners to go there and over 60 years.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,110
So the village we flew into, they
literally never seen white people before.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
And then we went 200 kilometers from that.

11
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:32,970
So like middle of nowhere they
want to touch you tell yeah,

12
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,250
hair because their hair was very
dark and very different and like,

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm not particularly fair,

14
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,990
but just to touch like the hair
and see the blue eyes and stuff.

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,210
They were just a lot of friendly,
super friendly.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,250
Like the culture was very stoic. Like
there wasn't a lot of smiling or crying,

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,770
you know, there wasn't like
a lot of emotional exchange,

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,120
but straight away they came and greeted
us like shook hands, you know, said hello.

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,380
Um, it was really cool. Wow.
That's gotta be, you know,

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,980
how do you set something like that up?

21
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:02,730
Do you have like a liaison that
does like acts as a go between,

22
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,800
between you and the tribes? Um, yeah,

23
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:09,660
so we did in this case have one guy who
communicated, I speak Spanish, Spanglish,

24
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:13,140
I guess. Um, and they all speak
Spanish from back in the day.

25
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,810
So we set it all up. It's part of
the wildlife stuff that I do. We,

26
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,780
we literally flew a DC three,

27
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,740
a World War II cargo plane into this
cocaine dealers airstrip. And then God,

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,250
that's how we got there. I mean like
mind blowing stuff, cocaine dealer,

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,170
a former former former, yeah. Well,
you know, too CBD, it's still Columbia.

30
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:35,460
Right? Exactly. Um, so yeah, I was, that
one was really cool. It really remote.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,600
How crazy is that?

32
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,370
They learned Spanish from people who
came over on boats from Spain and it just

33
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:45,690
stuck. Isn't that nuts and took
over the whole like regions. Yeah.

34
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,620
The whole world and,

35
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:50,430
and series this tribe in the middle of
the Amazon that has this language from

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,720
another continent and Brazil,
right from Portugal. Right.

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,390
It's really incredible when you stop
and think about it. I mean it's,

38
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,090
it's incredible, but it's also
part of, it's a little sad,

39
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:04,080
like why wouldn't you have loved to have
heard what their original language was?

40
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,720
Oh, I was literally what it
sounded like. Well, they did.

41
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,720
So it's funny because when they didn't
want us to understand what they were

42
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,210
talking about, they would switch
to their native Indian language.

43
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,790
So they still had,
they were bilingual,

44
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,860
a community of 25 people that have
never left, and they're bilingual. Wow.

45
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:23,280
It's amazing. Now their native
language is what, what does it,

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,940
it's an Amazonian Indian dialect.
I, I honestly don't even,

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,710
they might have said the name,
but I don't recall it.

48
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,700
What is the name of their tribe?
Uh, also not even sure they're,

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,180
they're so isolated. They're unaware
of what country they live in.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
They don't even know that
they are in Columbia. Really,
really, they're just like,

51
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:43,910
to them, they're Amazonian, they're not
Colombian. Ecuadorian Brazilian there.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,240
They're Amazonian, whoa. Yeah.
You know, they just stay,

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,930
they stay.
And the village we were in is literally,

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,030
I think it's all over 200 kilometers
from the next next village of 15 or so

55
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:00,220
people and they don't have fuel. They
don't have, you know, they'd just

56
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,960
in this pocket and they just
substance live and they're
all barefoot, right? Yeah.

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,140
Do they have those crazy splayed out
feet? Big Feet? You know, they're,

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,220
they're not very big people.
They're like small Indian people,

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,220
but really big kind of useful
feet and the way that, you know,

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,080
they could run up and down trees and
climb stuff. I mean it was unbelievable.

61
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,590
Like so much more athletic than you
could imagine. What imagine right there.

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,900
They've been doing that their whole life,
their whole lives.

63
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,190
Now when like when I say splayed out feet
when I'm talking about is that people

64
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:33,760
that walk barefoot in the jungle for long
periods of time with their whole life,

65
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,500
their toes spread out and their feet
almost looked like a hand. Oh, no way.

66
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,520
I did not pay enough attention.
That might've been the case,

67
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,700
but I didn't know this at their feet.
Exactly. Yeah. It's kind of weird thing.

68
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:49,480
Stare at Dude's feet. Yeah, for
sure. But um, yeah, Steve Rinella,

69
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,460
who's a good friend of
mine told me about that.

70
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:55,930
He was in Guyana and is the same thing
and they actually got some pictures and

71
00:03:55,931 --> 00:04:00,010
videos of these people's feet. But look
at these guys up there. Hello? Oh No,

72
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:04,870
I didn't notice anything like that.
Yeah, this is the, uh, that's uh, oh.

73
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,640
How do you say that? Horror. Not Horani.

74
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,610
Horani Horani sounds right.
Or Ani,

75
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,410
you think where Ani Horani Indian
splayed feet. So it's very strange.

76
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:21,010
Like it's the kind of the opposite of
what happens to women when they jam their

77
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,930
feet into those little pointy
shoes, whether they get the, the,

78
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:28,000
the toes kind of smoosh onto each
of the La fee. Yeah. It's horrible.

79
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,280
Instead of that,
they're all like crazy spread out.

80
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:34,060
What in the fuck is going
on there? Because I talked
to his hands, I think would,

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,480
yeah, the tops hands. But the bottom
is like would feet, but that's,

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,620
that's gotta be like what?
Our feet are supposed to be
probably right, right. Yeah.

83
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,970
Fic Ass toes that actually have muscles
in them that move that you can use like

84
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,590
a tool like your hand.
Yeah.

85
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,730
So when these guys just can climb up
trees with them so they grip the side of

86
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:55,210
the tree with their feet like a
hand. Oh, I mean I didn't notice,

87
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,360
like I say the feet just like that
specifically, but the way they could,

88
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,880
like everything's covered in mud
down there. Right. It's all wet.

89
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,850
It rains every day. And they could
run up and down these tree trunks,

90
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,080
like to get up and down the village.

91
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,550
And here's me and my crew with our
awkward cameras and stuff and where it's

92
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:11,800
slipping and sliding and falling over
and like they're, they're literally like,

93
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,720
what's wrong with these people?
Why can't they walk?

94
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,600
We must have looked like infants to that.
Right.

95
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:21,601
And you guys probably have like boots
on and Shit fucked up and oh totally.

96
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:25,510
Yeah. We're wearing, you know, muck
boots and my one buddies got waiters on.

97
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:25,781
And you know,

98
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,480
we think we're all hard and cool because
we got all this gear and they're just

99
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:30,190
like running around in shorts barefoot.

100
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,750
It is so fascinating when you see
people that don't have contact with the

101
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,240
outside world. Like, um,

102
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,060
I'm sure you're aware of that recent
story of the missionary was killed by the

103
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,100
people in north central island.
Absolutely.

104
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,180
Which is one of the weirdest places
cause they've branched off from Africa at

105
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:50,470
60,000 years ago or something like that.
Right. When you're around these people,

106
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,410
like what,
what do they do if they get injured?

107
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,920
So funny you asked that because we,
we kind had that same

108
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,060
question. Right. And they don't
leave. They stay in the village.

109
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,930
They have a shaman at the village who
blessed us with a crazy green powder and

110
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:09,890
that's a whole nother story. But they
have a showman and he is their doctor.

111
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,860
However,
he has no access to any Western medicine.

112
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:17,861
So it's only his learning knowledge handed
down through generations plus jungle

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,890
powders and whatnot. And um,
and that's it. So we actually,

114
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:26,420
we spend today because we had a medic
with us doing like kind of village help if

115
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,610
you will. Everybody had ringworm,
everybody had respiratory infections. Uh,

116
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,430
there were a lot of lady problems in the
village that our medic had to deal with.

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,820
I mean there was a lot of health
issues and you don't even realize it.

118
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,200
Write something down before I forget.
I'm sore as totally unrelated. No good.

119
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,280
There's a doctor named Peter Hotez that's
coming on the podcast and I have to

120
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,300
follow up on him. He, when you start
talking about the people in the jungle,

121
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:54,320
he was, he's a actual, a doctor who is a,

122
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:58,880
he specializes in infectious diseases
and jungle and tropical climates and he's

123
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:01,330
like, everyone's infected with
something. Everyone, everyone,

124
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,930
he'd have a heyday down there. I'm sure
it's probably been, yeah. But um, the,

125
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,850
so when these people have ringworm
and all these different infections,

126
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:15,230
do they treat it? Do they have like
some natural pathic cure or some shit?

127
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,270
I think it's kind of a 50,
50,

128
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,240
like a lot of it they don't treat
because it's just part of everyday life.

129
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,270
Like when I say everybody had ringworm,
I meant everybody had it.

130
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,490
So I don't think there was
any kind of treatment or cure.

131
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:29,740
It was just kind of part of
it, part of them, but other
things, you know, the, the,

132
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,520
the witch doctor or the Shaman was trying
to treat and then we kind of went in

133
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,440
and we had like medication for ringworm,

134
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:40,940
so we'd dewormed everybody and with the
Shamans blessing and he was like super

135
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:43,970
excited to have western medicine
in the village. And what'd you use?

136
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:48,110
Like Lamisil or something like that? I
couldn't tell you. Um, I think it was not,

137
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:48,921
it wasn't topical.

138
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:51,890
I think it was like a Wehrmacht like
a pill that you take that kills the,

139
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,040
kills the worms.
The weird thing about that is like,

140
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,960
don't you, you leave and then
they're going to get it again. Right?

141
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,570
I mean there's only so much you
can do, right? Yeah, totally.

142
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,880
That we were having the same
dilemma and it was like,

143
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:09,290
do we interfere because we're from the
outside world? Do we help? And, uh,

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,530
we talked to the sham and through our
translator and he said, please help,

145
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:17,000
please help. So we gave, including him,
everybody just dewormer but you know,

146
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,760
they'll just come back.
Yeah.

147
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:22,250
And also they probably don't understand
the consequences of taking some

148
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,630
antibiotic that's going to do some weird
shit to your whole biome. Right, right,

149
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,810
right. And these are all that stuff
too. It's such a moral dilemma.

150
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:34,340
You're there and you're like,
I want to help. Do I, is it
helpful? Is it hindering?

151
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,690
Our medic was like, it's undeniably
going to help, you know, they need this.

152
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,320
And so we got, we went for it and
it was, you know, it seemed to help,

153
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,470
everybody felt fine, but we
were only there a couple of
more days before we left.

154
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:49,750
So who knows? Wow. When
you're talking about ringworm,

155
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,210
like these guys covered in it, they have
big patches of it. Like what's it like?

156
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,890
Feet and legs had big
patches of it. Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,360
And this, if you don't know that's the
same shit that's athlete's foot. Oh,

158
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,050
I didn't know that. A ringworm and
athlete's foot of the same kind of funk.

159
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,580
Oh yeah. That's why, uh, they people
tell you to pee on your feet. Oh,

160
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,930
I thought that was just for fun cause
it depends on what you're in. But uh,

161
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:15,690
I think that's a, the idea
behind it is that you're, um,

162
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,000
somehow or another you're killing
the bad bacteria. You, uh,

163
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
you're pissing on your feet
and you have athletes, what,

164
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,610
that might be horseshit maybe. Yeah.
With me, you always have to check.

165
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,240
Um, yeah, definitely give
that a little see. But, um,

166
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,200
it's a real common thing with Jujitsu.
Gotcha. So guys, all the maths,

167
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,610
that's real common.

168
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:40,611
So just it guys get it and there's people
really fuck up or they like put bleach

169
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,640
on it and a bunch of different things
to try to kill it and winds up getting

170
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:49,040
worse. And also it fucks up all
the natural skin flora, jock, itch,

171
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,170
athlete's foot and ringworm or all
types of fungal skin infections known

172
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,780
collectively as Tinea, Tinea, tinea.

173
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,170
They're caused by fungi called Derma
trow fights that live on the skin,

174
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,980
hair and nails and thrive in
warm, moist areas. The jungle.

175
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,960
So it seems like they're
just going to get it

176
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,850
it. That's just what it sounds like,
you know? But what do they do for it?

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,090
I didn't see them treating that at all
and when we pointed it out they're like,

178
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,470
yeah, yeah, we know about it. You know,

179
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,700
they were more concerned with
things that were like dire,

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,380
like there was an infant and maybe not
even maybe three years old and he was

181
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:26,160
hacking up a lung and he was
asthmatic according to our medic.

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,960
So my, our medic gave them like an asthma
medication and he just said, you know,

183
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,770
if he has an attack where you kind of
breathe, give him this and like you know,

184
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,500
to be super real with you.
When we walked away our medic was like,

185
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,210
I doubt he'll live to see adulthood.

186
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,820
Oh Man. Yeah. And will you given
them inhalers? Did you give him,

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,220
I'm not sure to be honest.
What it was that he left with him.

188
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,100
And what about like injuries? What if
they break a leg or something like that?

189
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:53,320
What do they do? I don't
think anything was any,

190
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,590
I mean you got to think these
people are climate trees

191
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,100
constantly fall, get bitten by stuff.
There's tons of venomous snakes out there.

192
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,990
It's wet, it's muddy, it's slippery.

193
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:06,310
They're building stuff out of very
rudimentary tools. I mean it's, it's nuts.

194
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,270
They have to get injured.

195
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,680
It's so interesting that we have this
understanding of medicine and doctors and

196
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:17,250
hospitals,
but that's probably pretty fucking recent.

197
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,230
Oh, of course. Yeah. I'll,
I'll tell you a story. Joe.

198
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:23,380
I was in a Myin Mar early,

199
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,260
late last year and we're down there
filming this thing and this kid,

200
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:30,650
like 22 year old crab fisherman
gets bitten by a crocodile crop,

201
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:31,461
grabs him by the arm,

202
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:34,990
grabs him by the thigh death roles so
it breaks the arm and like, I dunno,

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,200
15 places, compound fracture, the real
deal. I could show you pictures out,

204
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:43,130
it'll blow your mind and we hear about
this and we're minutes away. We just,

205
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,830
it's kind of one of the similar situations
where the first westerners to be

206
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,760
there in a long time.

207
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:51,830
We go bombing over at high speed and
we get there and the mom is like off

208
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,810
mourning the death of her child, but
her child is sitting there still alive,

209
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,080
like they have thrown
him off and it's mom.

210
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:01,370
His mom is literally mourning
the death of her child and he's,

211
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:04,960
he's lying there conscious.
But like in total shock,

212
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,500
fortunately just because of the situation
we had a speedboat, everything else,

213
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,880
we bandaged him up. You know, ted tried
to keep his arm stable and his leg stable,

214
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,970
put them in our speedboat and it was
six hours by speedboat to a village that

215
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:20,650
had a or two to a hospital really. And
so he got there and his life was saved.

216
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,000
But I asked, we asked the people in the
village what were were you going to do?

217
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,080
And they're like, there's
nothing we can do. Wow.

218
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,820
So he was just going to bleed out or
go septic. And that was the end of it.

219
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,860
Ooh. What a fucking
rough way to go. Right.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,620
How did he get away from the crocodile?

221
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,840
Uh, I don't know. I think he was
just hitting it or hammering on it.

222
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:43,140
He was crab fishing in the water
and it came up and grabbed him,

223
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:47,220
rolled a few times and at some point he
escaped how we even got back in the boat

224
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:49,800
and made it back to the village. I have
no idea because his leg was shattered,

225
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,740
his arm was shattered. It was
brutal. And it was a canoe, you know,

226
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:56,190
it wasn't like he had a little motor
or a wheel to drive canoed back.

227
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,930
One of the most disturbing
stories I ever read was, um,

228
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,040
these guys were kayaking in an African
river and the guy in front of them got

229
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:07,660
grabbed by a crocodile and that
it went under and the like,

230
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,160
it like plunge like a bobber as the
crocodile pulled him out of the bottom of

231
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,070
the Kayak. Yeah. I'm
like, fuck, that's awful.

232
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,890
Imagine being the guy
behind him and washing them.

233
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,640
Yeah. And knowing that
you're pretty much helpless.

234
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,570
Did you see any jaguars or anything?
Uh, I've never seen a Jaguar.

235
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,390
I've seen a lot of la. I'm from Africa.
I don't know if you knew that, but,

236
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,040
so I've seen a lot of lions growing
up. My family did safaris. Um,

237
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,690
and then I've seen, you know, mountain
lions here in California, leopards,

238
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,080
stuff like that. I've never seen
a wild Jaguar. Really? Yeah.

239
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,140
When you were in the Amazon,
I think they're really elusive.

240
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,240
I know there's areas
that are our hotspots.

241
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:47,040
All of the locals were very nervous and
kind of knew about them. Like, you know,

242
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,260
I went out for Bush walks at
night and stuff and I'd just go,

243
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,710
me and one guy with a camera and
a, they were like, oh, be careful.

244
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:55,690
Like pedigree also in a very
dangerous, don't do it. Um,

245
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,740
but Predator Grosso means very dangerous
belly grow, so like danger. Yeah.

246
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,840
And I'm so we just go and,
you know,

247
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,150
I'm not trying to act like we were
tougher than them or anything.

248
00:14:06,151 --> 00:14:09,030
We would love to have seen one,
but they were very aware of them.

249
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,580
So they were there. We just didn't
happen to run into one sort of

250
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,540
mountain lions. Exactly. Yeah. Like
they say that mountain lines are like,

251
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,370
if you live in a place that has them,
you know,

252
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:21,490
Wyoming or Colorado or
something like that, they know
where you are. Right, right.

253
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,540
They might be around you all the time
and you might rarely see them. Exactly.

254
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,130
Be Driving home and see one
skittering into the, into the,

255
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,430
gosh, there was a nuts video, I
think it was from the La area.

256
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:34,850
Did you ever see it where the security
cams picked up this mountain lion that

257
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:37,940
was walking through this
like very residential
neighborhood and you'd see like

258
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,840
people would walk by and then 30 seconds
later he'd like dip out of the shadows

259
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:44,480
and then dip back in and then the next
set of people would walk by and nobody

260
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,550
had any clue he was
there. Yeah. It's crazy.

261
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,020
Was a giant Predator can move around like
that. Right? Yeah. So when you're there,

262
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,260
what,

263
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,210
what would you have done if someone got
bit by a venomous snake or a spider or

264
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,580
something like that?
Did you guys have any antivenom?

265
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:01,700
Were you prepared for something like
that? I mean, that's my department, right?

266
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,040
Like, as the wildlife guy
that's, that's Kinda my,

267
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,380
my department is make
sure nobody gets bitten,

268
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,700
make sure nothing like that happens.
And we handled very,

269
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,030
very many venomous snakes and caught
anacondas and all kinds of great stuff.

270
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,840
We did have like my main camera,
Guy's name's Mitch,

271
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,740
he got absolutely lit up by these
wasps one night and we all were,

272
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:23,570
we got like 12,
14 stinks each.

273
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,260
But I look back in the canoe at one point
and his eyes are just super swollen.

274
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,970
He's bright red, he's sweating. I'm
like Mitchie okay. He's like, uh,

275
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,000
his throat started to close up.

276
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:35,870
He was having an allergic reaction so we
had to hit him with anti histamines and

277
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,500
I, I'm not actually sure if the medic
administered the Epi pen or not, but uh,

278
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,480
he was like,
we're in the middle of the jungle.

279
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,290
We're six hours from a village that's
then a full day's travel by a charter

280
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,890
plane from a hospital. I mean
middle of fucking nowhere. And uh,

281
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:52,430
and his throat's closing up and think
that's why we take a medic with us.

282
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,080
Thankfully we had this emergency medic,

283
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,150
he administered the Anti
Histamines and Mitch was okay,

284
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,650
but these things do happen to ever like
while you were on these crazy adventures,

285
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:05,420
do you ever out there going,
this is the last one? No, no,
no. Whatever. No Way, man.

286
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,190
I love it. I live for it. Wow.
