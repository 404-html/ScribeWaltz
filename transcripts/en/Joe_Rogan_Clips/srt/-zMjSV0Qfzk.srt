00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,630
It was like a look of like, uh,
like a made you sad. Did it for him.

24
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:34,800
He did it make you feel like it may
Joseph? Yeah. Yeah. How'd you feel?

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,950
I didn't feel sad. It's weird that I
look sad. Maybe I, maybe I'm hiding that.

26
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:43,450
I'm sad to myself.
May Be hiding it from myself,

27
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,240
but this guy really needs it and he
really puts it out there. Try it out.

28
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,700
When I'm pissed off,
I'm going to white trash dump.

So it started a flurry of
animated try it out guys.

32

Well, try it. You, what do

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,240
It could be anything. Oh my now, Oh
man, let me see another language.

51
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,330
Whole men yet we were like working
for the government and we're trying to

52
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,530
decipher like a tape.

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,030
Like we have to find out
where the kidnappers being
held home and now they have

54
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,390
to like strip the audio. I hear
a train in the distance, right.

55
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,720
We'd be audio experts in a room somewhere.
We've got it.

56
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,640
We've got it whole man out.
Whole man out whole man.

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,070
Oh Man. Oh Man. Out Prostitute.

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,340
It could be or it could be.
I'm home.

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm home here now because he gives
out his address. He goes, no,

60
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:14,200
one more time at 2195 and we cut it out,
cut it out.

61
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,520
Beat me home. You know,
it could be anything.

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,240
I'm home man homie on now.
Anyway,

63
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,140
huge debate in the mom's
house community. Um, mid.

64
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,530
There's no final answer on that.
You'd have to talk to him.

65
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,610
Have you reached out to him? We've
tried. Yeah, there is. There's a few.

66
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,390
Your mom's house stars I believe in.
Oh my gosh.

67
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:42,010
Maybe on the east coast
somewhere. I forgot. I'm
sorry. I don't sleep very much.

68
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:46,780
Yeah, we've reached out to him.
Yeah. Three months deep in the game,

69
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:50,920
Bro. Crazy Hammond. I can't
ask. Her burn won't respond.

70
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,460
And we've reached out with offers of
money and really not. They won't do it.

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,650
And it's so weird.
It's always the ones we want the most.

72
00:04:56,651 --> 00:05:00,330
That never quite the king asked record
would be just farting in your room. No.

73
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,530
Oh yeah.
Would you want that?

74
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,360
I'd like to talk to him in the
room. That's what it does, right?

75
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:11,560
It just farts all the time. Yeah. But
I'm curious, what's the drive like?

76
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,820
He's clearly not driven by sex because
that's really repellent to women or,

77
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,650
yeah.
But maybe,

78
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,260
maybe like for him it's a turnoff to fart.

79
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,420
Like even though it's like
probably disgusting to women,

80
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,280
maybe for him it's a turn on to be
disgusting. Ah, the repulsion thing.

81
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,850
So she's like, oh my God,
you're so nasty. And then she's.
