1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,950
Let's, let's be clear, the Anti Vaccine
Lobby owns the Internet right now.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,530
What does that mean?
What that means is they've got,

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:12,120
they've put out now by some estimates,
500 anti-vaccine websites.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,470
So that every time you put the
word vaccine into a search engine,

5
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:20,610
whether it's Yahoo or Google, you're
going to get anti-vaccine misinformation.

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,540
That's number one. Second, we
know now it's amplified, um,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,570
social media like Facebook or
other forms of social media.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,740
So a third, um, you know, look
at the Amazon site. I mean, it's,

9
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:39,030
it's incredible. So my book, this
book, the good news is, it's,

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,050
I think it's, right now it's the highest
rate of pro vaccine book on Amazon.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,780
The bad news is overall
it's ranked about 20,

12
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:50,280
because there's 19 other phony baloney
anti-vaccine books. So that's the,

13
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:54,240
Amazon is the biggest purveyor now
of anti-vaccine books. And wait,

14
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:58,850
it gets even worse. Then you also
have, now they've become politicized.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,880
They have political action committees
and multiple states lobbying state

16
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:06,270
legislators about, uh, um,

17
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,370
fault with plying them with false
information about what vacs vaccines do.

18
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,360
So,
and,

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,810
and the problem is we don't have a
robust system of pro vaccine advocacy to

20
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,724
counter it.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,230
So we don't really hear as much as we
need to from the federal government,

22
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:29,280
from the CDC, from the surgeon general.
So unfortunately in this country,

23
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:33,720
that defensive vaccines false to a
handful of academics like myself,

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,540
you know, I'm an academic,
I wrote a book. What,

25
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:41,460
what chance do I stand against
this major, uh, media empire.

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,870
Why do you think that exists?

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,680
Why do you think there is this major
media empire that's against vaccines?

28
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,190
That's a great question. What's the
motive? What's the motivation, number one,

29
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,470
and number two, where's the
money coming from? Right, right.

30
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,530
There's real money behind this is
millions of dollars behind this to put out

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,770
phony documentaries and phony books.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,990
What's a good phone he
documentary to point to? Well,

33
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:05,070
I'm a little reluctant to do it.
Say it because they're so litigious and,

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,720
and uh,
and you know,

35
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,380
I don't have the means to defend
a lawsuit and things like that. So

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,950
these documentaries,
I usually don't mean specific aims are,

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,070
I understand these documentaries.
What do you think their motivation is?

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,660
Do you think they earnestly believe that
vaccines do cause harm or vaccines do

39
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,470
cards? I autism. I don't know.

40
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:32,910
I mean is there some kind of
other agenda that they have?

41
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,750
I mean we do know in some cases that um,

42
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,330
the some elements of the anti vaccine
lobby or promoting phony autism therapies,

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,840
right? They're doing terrible
things like this thing called MMS,

44
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,390
which are bleach and amongst
whites. Yeah. Bleach,

45
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:51,930
giving bleach enemas to catch you
couldn't to children the children bleach,

46
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,770
bleach because they're
cleansing the immune system.

47
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,440
A cleansing them of toxin
though it's really awful stuff.

48
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,800
And they're doing culation therapy,
which is very dangerous. What is that?

49
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,850
That's where they, they claim, you know,
kids are overdosed with toxic metals,

50
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,660
so they give a chemical that actually can
collate the metal, but it can kill it,

51
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:14,050
your calcium and then put you
into a fatal Arrhythmia as well.

52
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,700
They're also who is doing this
culation therapy. You can Google it.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,880
It's a or whatever search engine
or these doctors like suns,

54
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,190
some cases there are doctors unfortunately
or other health professionals.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,220
And what is, I mean, I'm sure you've
studied evidence late. It gets worse.

56
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,640
There's no evidence. And then, and
then they're doing hyperbaric therapy,

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,780
which is really bad. So insomnia,
hyperbaric therapy is bad. Well for,

58
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,440
it doesn't do anything for
autism, that's for sure. But it's,

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,370
it's good for recovering from injuries
and yeah, there's certain selected sir.

60
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:48,060
But who knows what, who knows what it's
doing to a young kid, right? I mean, so,

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,240
so you shouldn't be doing that. Um,
the then the other then that's one.

62
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,730
So how much of this is being driven by,
um,

63
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,970
financial motivation peddling these
phony autism therapies? I can't say.

64
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:04,180
My sense is that's not
the big piece of this.

65
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,890
There's also some reports now Russian
bots and trolls that are amplifying this

66
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:13,270
and sewing political instability
in the country. But again,

67
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:17,660
you add that all up the phony autism
therapies, the Russian bots and trolls,

68
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:18,494
to my mind,

69
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,690
that really doesn't get our arms
around the big driver of this thing.

70
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,590
So I think we really need
some good investigative
journalist to look into this.

71
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,680
Well do you think that there's something
sort of a concerted effort or do you

72
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:34,940
think that it's just a bunch of people
that really believe that vaccines do

73
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,760
cause autism?

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,750
They don't truly understand the science
and they haven't talked to someone like

75
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:43,070
you and maybe they have this idea that
cemented in their mind and they're not

76
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:48,071
willing to look at it objectively and
look at the full spectrum of possibilities

77
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,330
and look at the science behind
what you guys are saying.

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,750
Because in their head they've
been saying vaccines cause autism.

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,010
They've been saying it for so long
that once someone gets that and they're

80
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,610
connected to that, it's very
difficult for them to shift gears.

81
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:05,620
V People have a really hard time
not being married to an idea. Yeah,

82
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,340
no I agree that and um,
you know,

83
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:11,570
when I talk and I spend a lot of time
going around the country giving, uh,

84
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:15,170
what are called grand rounds lectures
to hospitals and medical schools,

85
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,490
pediatric grand rounds.

86
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,300
So I've had the chance to talk to a lot
of pediatricians and nurses and nurse

87
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:23,660
practitioner even and more
and more than a few parents.

88
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,960
My impression is most of
the parents are who are,

89
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,380
who are called to be so called vaccine
hesitant as the word of the day are not

90
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,360
really deeply dug in. I mean, you can,

91
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,920
you can have a conversation with them
and explained to them like we're talking

92
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:43,310
now in a very, you know,
nontechnical way, you know,

93
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:47,240
the evidence showing vaccines don't
cause autism and the lack of plausibility

94
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,800
given, uh, that it,

95
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,280
that it begins in pregnancy and
they'll vaccinate their kids.

96
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,940
There is another percentage,
and I don't know what the percentage is,

97
00:05:55,941 --> 00:06:00,941
whether it's 10 15 that are deeply
dug in and are wholly invested in this

98
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,810
conspiracy theory that the,

99
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,040
that the government is in cahoots with
the pharmaceutical companies and Blahdy,

100
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,740
blahdy Blah. And then if you
try to talk them out of it,

101
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,120
they just think you're part
of the conspiracy. So it's,

102
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:16,340
it's sort of a no win approach
there, but, but most parents,

103
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,540
you can have a good conversation
with most parents. Um,

104
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,930
it's not necessarily even most
parents, right? I mean, what,

105
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:26,360
what you're dealing with is these people
that maybe they're into a bunch of

106
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,540
different alternate therapies,
a bunch of different kinds of cleansing.

107
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:33,680
And you know, there's a lot
of that nonsense that you
find online where, I mean,

108
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:38,420
look, there's legitimate, but I, but I
guess, but I guess my point, I'm sorry.

109
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,380
That's okay. Please go ahead
now. But I guess my point is, um,

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,970
parents don't get the chance because
they're so inundated with phony

111
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:51,650
anti-vaccine information that they do
a Google search or whatever, you know,

112
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,740
whatever search they do.
So what do you think should be done?

113
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,330
Should there be a pro vaccine documentary?
That makes sense.

114
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,100
I think,
thanks for that question.

115
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,340
I think there's three things that
need to be done. I think first of all,

116
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:08,390
some of this anti-vaccine media empire
needs to be dismantled, dismantled,

117
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:13,070
dismantled, and that, again,
whether they're wrong or
right, like shouldn't, I mean,

118
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,140
it seems like there should be
some sort of a debate, right?

119
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,010
Like if there's someone who's saying
that there's some evidence of vaccines

120
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:22,930
caused debates, you're saying there's no
evidence of vaccines caused debate. Uh,

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,010
excuse me,
that vaccines cause autism.

122
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,890
And you're saying there's no
evidence that vaccines cause autism.

123
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:32,660
There should be a debate where there
some sort of a like some sort of a

124
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:37,661
monitored conversation where you can have
you versus someone else and break this

125
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:43,340
down. Yeah. But that, that has, that's
a two edge sword too because you know,

126
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:47,690
then it gives some false legitimacy
to the anti anti-vaccine side.

127
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,130
It's like debating the smoking caused
cancer. Yeah. But doesn't that,

128
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,140
isn't there already a problem?
I mean it seems like if there's this many,

129
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,160
if you do Google search and
you're just overwhelmed with anti,

130
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,600
it seems like the fight has already been
lost. If that's the case. That's right.

131
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,350
So giving them legitimacy looks like
it's not necessarily giving them a

132
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,740
legitimacy.
It's giving them,

133
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,750
you give you rather a forum to
dismiss their legitimacy. Yeah.

134
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:15,390
I mean, I think, you know, part of it,
what has to be done is, I mean, and,

135
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,130
and this gets into all sorts of First
Amendment issues and I'm not a lawyer,

136
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,780
but you know,
the,

137
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,950
the idea that Amazon now is putting
out all of these phony books and,

138
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,580
and phony documentaries or
they're just a distributor, right?

139
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,070
They don't have to go over every book
that they sell with a fine tooth,

140
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,430
but maybe they should, I
mean, not fine tooth comb,

141
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,960
but maybe there should be some screening.

142
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,910
Maybe Amazon may be Facebook should all
be hiring chief scientific officers to,

143
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,900
you know, putting some stops
on the dissemination of,

144
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,970
of information because it's
harming children. Right? I mean,

145
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,540
this is the reason I get
passionate about it. Um,

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,320
the reason I actually wrote the book
because it's kind of interesting,

147
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:58,140
I it actually before all of these big
measles outbreaks that we've been having.

148
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,190
Yeah, I noticed that in
Texas there was, where I,

149
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,970
my laboratory is at Texas Children's
Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine,

150
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:09,810
we noticed that there was a steep increase
in the number of kids whose parents

151
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,980
are opting them out of getting vaccinated
to the point where in Texas we have

152
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,600
over 60 almost 60,000 kids not getting
their vaccines in the state of Texas.

153
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,010
And those are the ones we know about.

154
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,980
We don't know anything about
the 325,000 homeschooled kids.

155
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:26,670
So we probably have over a hundred
thousand kids not getting vaccinated,

156
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,660
all because of this
misinformation campaign.

157
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,660
And I was really troubled by the fact
that there was no response to it and that

158
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,330
drove me to write the book.

159
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:42,000
So the point is now Texas is very
vulnerable to measles outbreaks.

160
00:09:42,001 --> 00:09:45,840
And I say measles more than the others
because that's the most highly contagious

161
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:49,170
disease. What are the danger
of a child getting measles?

162
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,410
So is there any benefit to a child
getting measles in terms of their immune

163
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:53,820
system? No, there's no benefit.

164
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:57,180
And that's one of the phony books they
put out called Melanie's marvelous

165
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,530
measles. I mean it's, it's awful. So,
um, uh, what did they say in that book?

166
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:06,050
They say build your immune system. It
does not. It does not. It's remember, um,

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,730
after,
so let's go back a little bit.

168
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:13,260
Smallpox was eradicated in the late
1970s through vaccination. One,

169
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,700
smallpox was eradicated.

170
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,650
Radica measles was arguably the single
leading killer of children globally.

171
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,000
2.6 million children died every year.
And measles because it causes measles,

172
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:28,860
pneumonia, measles and cephalitis talk
about permanent neurologic injury.

173
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,520
That's a bad actor. Measles,
uh, and then deafness at all.

174
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,460
And then through global
vaccination campaigns,

175
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:39,690
we brought it down by the year 2000
to about half a million kids dying.

176
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,020
And then the gates foundation put up $750
million to create the Gavi alliance to

177
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:50,130
global lines for vaccines and
immunization. We've brought
it down now to 100,000,

178
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,610
but now measles is coming back.
Europe's a disaster right now.

179
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,440
We've got 80,000 measles cases in 2018
in Europe and now it's coming back to the

180
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:03,441
u s and so my worry is this meet the
anti-vaccine media empire isn't it started

181
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:08,520
out as a fringe group, but now it's
really effecting public health,

182
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,950
allowing a deadly disease
like measles to come back.

183
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,060
Do you think if there's some sort of
definitive evidence that shows to the

184
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:16,350
general public like you could,

185
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,260
you could show it to them like
this is what causes autism.

186
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,240
We've narrowed it down to these genes and
it, it has nothing to do with vaccines.

187
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:26,910
If you give these vaccines to
people without these genes,

188
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,380
there is no way they're
going to get autism.

189
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:32,250
They get autism specifically because
of these variations in their change.

190
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,620
You just,
you just summarize the book,

191
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,240
but I mean we need more than a book,
right?

192
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,030
It does disturb me when I hear about
all these kids getting measles and,

193
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:46,830
and not just measles, but it means in
some places polio has made a resurgence,

194
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,640
you know? Well, polio in know
we're down to about three,

195
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,420
three countries that still
have transmission, a wild
type polio. It's Nigeria,

196
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:59,080
Pakistan, Afghanistan, so hopefully
we're getting our arms around polio.

197
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:02,530
But measles is now come back,
roaring back with a vengeance.

198
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,010
Having people contracted
polio outside of those areas.

199
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,160
I mean those are the areas where it's calm
every now and then. Some cases pop up.

200
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,370
We had some in wherever and this could
get it onto a whole nother topic.

201
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,710
Wherever there's collapse
in health systems,

202
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:18,730
infrastructure such as during two
from war, political instability,

203
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,520
these diseases can come back,
they can come back.

204
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:24,670
And the people that are vulnerable,
the children that are not immunized.

205
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,970
That's right. And when you're immunized,
you're not vulnerable. That's right. Yeah.

206
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,133
This is,

207
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:34,140
it's a really confusing thing for people
because on the outside they w people

208
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,990
always want to think that big Pharma,
but I've,

209
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,210
I've said some terrible things about
big Pharma and the reason being is

210
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,300
painkillers because painkillers and
antidepressants and there's the Ssri is

211
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,670
which are over prescribed and the
painkiller one kills me because I have no

212
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:53,110
people directly that have been addicted
to these goddamn things and the doctors

213
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:57,370
are passing them out like candy. So
people look at big Pharma as being, oh,

214
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,840
these are the monsters that push this.

215
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,600
They're also the people that give
you things that save people's lives.

216
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,180
There's a lot going on there.
I'm, I'm no big defender of, uh,

217
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,380
of the big pharmaceutical companies.
I mean,

218
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:12,820
one of the things that the anti vaccs
the insults at anti-vaxxers hurled at me

219
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:14,590
as they say,
I'm a shill for industry.

220
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,040
They say I'm a secretly taking money
from Merck and Glaxo Smith Kline.

221
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:23,860
It's all crap. I don't take a
penny from them. And I, and I,

222
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,560
and it's not even how do you get paid
just by the, from the university,

223
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,020
they get paid by the university.
And some of that, uh,

224
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,060
some of my salary's offset by not
grants from nonprofit foundations.

225
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,740
Um, then, uh, this is like the
national tropical diseases, right?

226
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,881
And then they say,

227
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:43,510
I'm secretly making millions of dollars
for our vaccines for hookworm and

228
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:47,440
schistosomiasis and chagas disease with
all that money. Because my wife says,

229
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:50,560
if only that were the case, right? These
are diseases of the poorest of the poor.

230
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,890
I'll never make a penny on these
disease. And in fact, you know,

231
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:58,100
one of the frustrations I have with the
big pharmaceutical companies is we've

232
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,120
gotten a lot,
made a lot of progress of their vaccines.

233
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:04,780
We've gone all the way from discovery
through early phase process development

234
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,250
and manufacturing an I and d filing
with the FDA investigational new drug

235
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:11,890
applications. But we're in and
kind of stuck at phase one,

236
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,790
phase two clinical trials because we
don't have the big Pharma money to take us

237
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,810
all the way to licensure.

238
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:20,590
So I've had a lot of meetings with the
big pharmaceutical companies to see if

239
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,380
they can partner with us.
And so far that hasn't happened.

240
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,890
So is has there ever been any discussion
or any interest in creating some sort

241
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,711
of a,

242
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:34,711
a compelling documentary that's pro
vaccination that can counter all of these

243
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,740
things?
Cause there's,

244
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,970
there's quite a few health related
documentaries that I know are horse shit

245
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,650
because I've talked to
actual real scientists and
clinical researchers that say

246
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:48,520
like all these things they're saying are
wrong and this is why they're wrong in

247
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,530
this. You could show this the
wrong. And then when someone, Hey,

248
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:55,190
I saw this documentary, it says it, all
you should eat is toast. They could say,

249
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:58,760
listen man, you've got to go here and
watch this, and it'll show you why.

250
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,900
That's nonsense.
Right.

251
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,860
Is there anything like that right now or
was there any discussion? Not right now.

252
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,540
There are some discussions,

253
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,660
but we're a long way off from that
and the problem is the anti-vaccine

254
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,060
documentaries are being distributed,
widely distributed, widely sold,

255
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:17,390
and and those people that are talking
about it. Here's the other problem.

256
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,500
Whenever I talk to someone about it was
I've been doing this a lot lately where

257
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,520
I've talked to some of the
about something. They're
passionate about it. I go,

258
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:27,410
what books have you read on it? And it's
like, wow, I saw this documentary. Well,

259
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,400
very, and there are, in
fact, there's 19 I bullshit,

260
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,500
19 ahead of mine write books that
are written by actual researchers,

261
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,180
people that have spent decades in
labs understanding what's going on.

262
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,980
You don't really,
you know,

263
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,870
you don't get a lot of that from the
people that are anti anything. Right.

264
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,700
Well, that's, that's what
I wrote, the new book.

265
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,850
It's a very confusing thing for parents
because you're scared. You know,

266
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:56,030
you have this little tiny baby that you
love more than anything in this world.

267
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,590
And then the doctor say,
Hey,

268
00:15:57,591 --> 00:16:00,800
we've got this round of vaccines common
and you're just terrified that you're

269
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:04,640
going to do something to your child is
going to turn your child into a someone

270
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,120
who's compromised. Yeah.
And, and the point is, um,

271
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,350
problem is these diseases
her back now and so they're,

272
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,380
the urgency to vaccinate is now more
than ever. I mean remember right now,

273
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:17,120
look what's going on in Vancouver,

274
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:21,210
Washington right now where the measles
outbreak is underway. The ones who,

275
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,460
who are at greatest risk,
our infants under the age of 12 months,

276
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,290
not yet old enough to get their vaccine.

277
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,010
So that if you're a parent right
now living in Vancouver, Washington,

278
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,241
you're terrified.

279
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,960
You're terrified about taking your baby
out the Walmart or cause they break that

280
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,560
vaccine cause they're,
that we'll never get the right.

281
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,740
So now the disease is coming back because
the older kids are catching it and the

282
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:47,690
entity and the anti vaccine lobby uses
terms like personal liberties and medical

283
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:48,111
freedom.

284
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:52,070
Well where the personal liberties of this
parent now who's terrified to take her

285
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:55,040
in when you say his or her
infant anti vaccine lobby? No,

286
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:59,030
I know that Robert Kennedy Jr
is a, he's a, he's a big one.

287
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,090
He's a big one and he seems
like a very intelligent guy.

288
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,530
How could he not be aware of the science
behind this and what is he getting

289
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:10,640
wrong? What he's getting wrong is
just about everything. Um, you know,

290
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:15,641
he's formed an organization called
children's health defense and um,

291
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,470
and it start, he had a press conference
about it, I think it was September,

292
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,890
October of last year.

293
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,670
It is probably one of the best organized
anti-vaccine groups out there now he's

294
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,440
doing other things other than vaccines.

295
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,680
He's doing a lot of things about
environmental health and things like that.

296
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,860
I don't know any part of that business.
I've only followed what the,

297
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:37,190
what he does with vaccines. But
it's all, it's all nonsense.

298
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,550
Why is he doing this about vaccine?
It's don't know what's his book? I mean,

299
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,250
you have to ask him what,
what's his motivation?

300
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,080
He be a guy that you would want to have
a debate with or have a discussion with.

301
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,650
But again, I mean, I'm uncomfortable with
the idea of a debate because it's like,

302
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,410
it's like debating,
I dunno,

303
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:55,500
it's like debating our Holocaust denier
whether the Holocaust exists. I mean,

304
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,640
not that this rise, I understand what
you're saying, but if you're, again,

305
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,590
I want to bring this up. If
you're, you're complaining,

306
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,770
there's 19 books ahead of yours
that are anti vaccine books.

307
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,690
You've already lost the battle.

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,550
Like it's time to regroup
and maybe regrouping would
be confronting someone with

309
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,640
actual scientific information
mean you are a real doctor.

310
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,730
You're a guy who actually studies this
and you're a man who understands the

311
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:20,220
science. You're legitimate
academic. You could,

312
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:24,990
you could actually put a dent in
this with a real conversation. Yeah,

313
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,320
potentially. Potentially. Yeah. I
mean, what would he be able to say?

314
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:31,320
Like what is his take on
it? Well, remember he's a,

315
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,710
he's an attorney and he's
a, he's very clever. Right?

316
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:38,910
And now he knows how to presumably
knows how to do arguments in court.

317
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,740
And what am I am a scientist.

318
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,310
Do you think that he wants to deceive
people or do you think that maybe he's

319
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:48,360
just incorrect his accumulation of data?
Yeah.

320
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:52,440
I can't say what his motivation
is, but, um, his, uh, his,

321
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,990
his information is, is
highly misleading. Hmm.

322
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,110
Now, what else is he,
when you say the lobby,

323
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,550
is this an organized thing?
Good question. Again,

324
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:09,840
we need somebody who really wants to do
a deep dive in this and kind of dissect

325
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:14,580
out the pieces to
understand. Um, but it's,

326
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:17,970
it's impressive what you've got out there
in terms of the hundreds of websites

327
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:21,420
and the amplification on social
media and everything else. Is it,

328
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,070
are there just one or two or three groups
behind it or is it a random collection

329
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:29,490
of organizations that that
needs to be looked at.
