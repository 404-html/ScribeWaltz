1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,240
Underlying cycle twenties let's think
about you referred to the opioid crisis,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:04,230
for example.
It's the cause.

3
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:08,640
I think even a lot of really good people
are profoundly misunderstanding what's

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,830
happening with the opioid crisis.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,430
Where is the opiod crisis happening
right into a lot of the epicenters of it,

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,910
places like Monadnock in New Hampshire.
Why is,

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,830
why are things so disastrous there?

8
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,831
Why is there much higher opioid addiction
in West Virginia than on the Faculty

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,850
of Harvard?
Right?

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,640
People in the Faculty of Harvard have
much better access to opioids, right?

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,110
Everyone there has good health insurance.
They have much better access.

12
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,410
What's going on that that
some amazing economists,

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,370
Angus Deaton and Ann Case did a massive
study of this and they said that we need

14
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,270
to understand the opioid deaths mainly
is what they call deaths of despair,

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,440
right? It's not a coincidence that the
places were opioid addiction is highest,

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,580
are also the places where suicide
not with opioids is highest.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,610
We're antidepressant prescriptions
or highest, there's a whole,

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,700
these things are clustering
together for a reason, right,

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,580
and you don't have to spend much time
in those places to see people through.

20
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,600
No fault of their own.

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,740
Have I liked the rats in that first cage
right there had been deprived of the

22
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,790
things that make life meaningful.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,880
It doesn't mean chemical hooks don't
play some role. They do play a role.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,850
But I've been to the places that have
solved this and it wasn't by thinking

25
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,880
primarily about that. So just talk
about the reality, chemical hooks,

26
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:18,391
if that's the right thing.

27
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,880
It's very important to understand
in relation to opioids.

28
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,480
So it's a very strong agreement among
scientists that the most powerful chemical

29
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,490
hook we know is nicotine,
right?

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,430
You smoked cigarettes like my mother
smokes seventies cigarettes a day.

31
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,420
He smoked cigarettes. The thing you feel
a physical craving for when you stop,

32
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:37,830
which my mother would never do, is, um, is
nicotine, right? That's the chemical hook.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,590
Um, and so in the late eighties,
when nicotine patches were invented,

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,310
there's this huge wave of optimism
among scientists because they're like,

35
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,630
I write cigarette smoking is an
addiction to the chemical hook. Nicotine.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,800
Now we can give people all the chemical
hook they're addicted to without any of

37
00:01:55,801 --> 00:02:00,460
this shitty cancer causing smoke. People
are gonna Start Smoking, right? Um,

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,460
so nicotine patches are introduced in
the US surgeon general's report a couple

39
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,300
of days later,
fines,

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,840
highly motivated people
using nicotine patches. Um,

41
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,950
17% of them will stop smoking right now.

42
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:17,520
It's important to say that is not nothing,
right?

43
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,490
That means if you meet the Chemical
Hook for people who are addicted to

44
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:24,510
cigarettes, 17% of them will stop
entirely. That's a big deal, right?

45
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,580
That's saved a huge
number of people's lives.

46
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,770
But obviously 17% is not
100% that leaves 83%.

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,810
The got to be explained
by the other things.

48
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,540
And that's really the factors that I
talked about in, in Las connections.

49
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,630
So I mean there's a whole range of them,
but you know, if you are acutely lonely,

50
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,210
we are the loneliest society
there's ever been, right?

51
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,600
You are much more likely to be vulnerable
to despair, depression, addiction.

52
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,210
If you are controlled
or humiliated at work,

53
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,190
which most people now are to some degree,

54
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,140
you're much more
vulnerable to these things.

55
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,990
There's a whole range of go through nine
of these, these factors in the book.

56
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:58,440
But to me, the most important thing in
thinking about the opioid crisis, and I'm,

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,080
I find it really frustrating that this is
never discussed in the American debate,

58
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,060
is I've been to the place that solves
an opioid crisis that had a disastrous

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,230
opioid crisis and ended it, right? And
they did something that's very different.

60
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,700
So Americans are being urged to do

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,960
so I'm a Swiss citizen because my dad's
from there. So I Switzerland. Well,

62
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,690
and by the time you get to the year 2000,

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,600
Switzerland is having like an
opioid nightmare, right? Um,

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,290
people can look up videos from the time,
but you know,

65
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:30,970
people like Swiss people are obsessed
with order is not a coincidence.

66
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,690
They invented clocks that all that
shit. Right? Like in their public parks,

67
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,080
people like injecting in the neck
like nightmare scenes, right?

68
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,770
That'd be bad anywhere. But to Swiss
people, this is like the worst nightmare,

69
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,280
right? And they try all sorts of
things. They tried the American way,

70
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:47,020
arresting people,
punishing people,

71
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,380
shaming people and it just
keeps getting worse and worse.

72
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,910
And then one day they get this incredible
woman called Ruth Dreifuss who I got

73
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:58,330
to know later who becomes a minister
of health and then the president,

74
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:03,250
the first ever female
president of Switzerland. Um,
and she explains to people,

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,240
I think the solution is to
legalize heroin. And she said,

76
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,750
I know that sounds really shocking cause
when you hear the word legalization,

77
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,260
what you picture is anarchy and chaos.
She said,

78
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,160
what we have now is anarchy and chaos,
right?

79
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,490
We have unknown criminals selling unknown
chemicals to unknown drug users all in

80
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:28,510
the dark or filled with violence,
disease and chaos legalization.

81
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,690
She explained as the way we restore
order to this madness, right?

82
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,120
So the way it works isn't,
uh,

83
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,980
I spent a lot of time in
these places and obviously no,

84
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:38,140
or maybe there's some really
hardcore libertarians,

85
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:41,800
but almost no one believes
we should legalize heroin
the way alcohol or cannabis

86
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:44,950
illegal, right? No one thinks there
should be a heroine, Ireland's CBS.

87
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,940
That's not the plan.
Right.

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,190
What do you mean Switzerland
is if you had a heroin problem,

89
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,430
you were assigned to a clinic. I went,
spent a lot of time in the one in Geneva,

90
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,910
the former president,
Ruth dreifuss lives opposite this clinic.

91
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,110
I think that tells you
something, um, lives across
the street, across the street.

92
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,090
What, what, what? It's the way
it works is she should move well,

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,160
but if you see the clinic
that day, why? Right?

94
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,090
So the way it works is you have to go
to the clinic at seven o'clock in the

95
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,030
morning because Swiss people believe
in doing things really fucking early.

96
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:16,870
It's constant disagree. What? Between
me and my dad, you turn up, you go in,

97
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,810
they give you your hair in there,
they give you medically pure heroin.

98
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,590
You can't take it out with you.

99
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,890
You've got to use it there partly because
they don't want you to sell it on.

100
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,710
But mainly because they want to monitor
you to make sure you know you don't

101
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,590
overdose.
Um,

102
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,590
you use it there and then you leave to
go to your job because you're given a

103
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,361
load to support,

104
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:39,361
to get housing work and therapy to figure
out why you can't bear to be present

105
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,300
in your life. Right? So it's
really important. They give
two things. There's puts,

106
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,310
bear in mind these two things because
the opposite of what we're doing at the

107
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,144
moment here,

108
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,770
give them the safest possible version of
the drug and give them massive amounts

109
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:53,970
of help to deal with the reasons
why they need that drug. You,

110
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,620
they're giving them a drug,
are they injecting it in
them? Yeah, they know they,

111
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,440
the individual injects himself or herself.
So if you, if you were the patient,

112
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,650
I'm the nurse, I give you the heroin
and I give you a clean syringe.

113
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,690
And one of the things
that really surprise me,

114
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,760
I at first I found really weird is they
will give you any dose of heroin that

115
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,320
you want apart from
one that will kill you.

116
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,130
And there is never any
pressure to cut back. And yeah,

117
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,180
I went there when it was 13 years after
this at first started and there was

118
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,410
almost nobody on the program.
Um,

119
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,130
from the start there were like three
people who've been there the whole time.

120
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,100
Almost everyone does cut
back and stop over time.

121
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:32,850
And I remember saying to a Rita, Maggie,
who's the chief psychiatrist there, well,

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,710
how can that be? Cause we're told
the chemical hooks take you over.

123
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:39,650
You need more and more.
If you had an unlimited supply,

124
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,440
you would just carry on forever.
What, how could, how could,

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,670
how do you explain this? And she looked
at me like I was dumb and she said,

126
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,500
well, we help them in their lives get
better. And as your life gets better,

127
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,390
you don't want to be anesthetized so much,

128
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,550
which ones that's explained to
you is so obvious. Right? But,

129
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,690
and it's worth just explaining the results
of the Swiss program in the Phillies

130
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,970
15 years.
Now in the 15 years since this began,

131
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,030
according to the best scientific
evidence be like Professor Ambrose,

132
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,830
Austin Haagen have shown
that had been zero deaths,

133
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,280
overdose deaths on legal heroin,
not one person.

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,540
There's been a massive fall in overdose
deaths outside the legal program cause

135
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,990
people transfer in because why would you
carry on using expensive shitty street

136
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:28,400
drugs when you could be getting, you know,
help and given the drug for free. Um,

137
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,630
and once it was fascinating about this
is Swiss people are really conservative,

138
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:35,390
right? My Swiss relatives make
Donald Trump look like Oprah.

139
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,010
And yet Swiss people after this had
been in practice for five years,

140
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,930
had a referendum on
whether to get rid of it.

141
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,310
And 70% of Swiss people
voted to keep her in legal.

142
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,500
Not Cause they're so compassionate.
To be honest. That's not, they're not,

143
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,070
they're really not a, it was
cause crime fell so much. Right?

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,180
It's much cheaper to give some crime fall.
I've got the statistics in the book.

145
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,410
It's fear since I wrote it,
but there was,

146
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,410
I think something like a 50%
fall in street street, crime,

147
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,870
street prostitution literally ended,
right?

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,780
There was no street prostitution
after that. Turns out women, you know,

149
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,650
don't want to be on the street being
fucked by random strangers, but about a,

150
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,960
if they've got like an
alternative, who knew? But the, um,

151
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,480
so it was an enormous fallen
crime across the board.

152
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,470
And the police confirmed that.

153
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,560
Everyone agrees with that in Switzerland
and all the kind of anarchy in the

154
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,860
streets just, just stopped. Right. But,

155
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:24,470
but what the reason I think is really
relevant to the opioid crisis is what

156
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,900
we're doing is the exact opposite,
right?

157
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,990
So they give them the
safe version of the drug,

158
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,150
give them help to figure out why.

159
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:35,870
Practical support to change
their environment to get
out of the isolet occasion

160
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,490
into a life that's more like rat park.

161
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,640
What do we do if you're
a doctor in this country,

162
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,520
finds out that you are
using say Percocet or Oxy,

163
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,580
not because you've got back pain,
but because you've got an addiction.

164
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,060
Your doctor by law has to cut
you off, right? They don't.

165
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,170
They can be busted as a dealer.

166
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,290
It's happened to lots of doctors
and so they have to cut you off.

167
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,610
So instead of giving you the drug,
we stopped you getting the drug.

168
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,140
Most people then,
or not most,

169
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,320
a very large number then transfer to
much more dangerous street drugs like

170
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,950
heroin. Secondly, far from giving
you how to turn your life around.

171
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,210
We give you a criminal record.
We shame you, we stigmatize you.

172
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,760
We put barriers between
you and reconnecting.

173
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,430
The opposite of addiction is connection.
But what do we do?

174
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,950
We put barriers between
people and reconnecting.

175
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,150
This is why that's one part of it, right?
So there's the drug policy part of it,

176
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,180
uh,

177
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,470
where we're doing exactly the opposite
of the country that succeeded in ending

178
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,890
it's opiod epidemic. But
there's something, I think
there's even deeper than that,

179
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,370
which you really see in places
like West Virginia, Monadnock,

180
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,120
the kind of hearts of the opioid crisis,

181
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:41,121
which is we're also creating a society
that's becoming harder and harder for

182
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:44,640
people to be present in, especially
in those, in those places.

183
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,990
There's an analogy I keep thinking of
in the, in the 18th century in Britain,

184
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,840
loads of people were driven out of the
countryside into these disgusting urban

185
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:59,841
slums in like a London and Manchester
and something happened that has been well

186
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:06,120
documented. There was sun called the
gin craze, right? Where basically shit,

187
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:09,300
loads of people just became alcoholics
drank again until they died. Right?

188
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,290
There's a famous painting from the time
called Gin Lane of a mother down in like

189
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,620
a bottle of vodka while a baby
like falls out the window. Right.

190
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,420
And things like that
really were happening.

191
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,950
If you look at what
people said at the time,

192
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,970
very similar to what they're saying now,
they said, look at this evil drug gin.

193
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,890
Look what it's fucking done to us.

194
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,730
If only we could get rid of this evil drug
gin, this problem would go away. Right?

195
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,190
We know now when we look
back at the gin craze,

196
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,670
it can have been Jenn that caused it
because anyone in Britain who's over the

197
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,590
age of 18 can go and buy gin.
Right?

198
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,680
And while we still have some alcoholics
to be sure we don't have massive

199
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:44,190
epidemics of our college and we don't
have babies falling out of windows,

200
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,190
what changed wasn't the
amount of availability.

201
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,510
It wasn't the availability of the drug.

202
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,820
The drug is more available
now than it was then.

203
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,330
What changed was the amount of pain
and distress in the society, right?

204
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,690
We don't have a study we've brought
as profoundly disorientated.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,300
I mean it's going up because we're
creating more disorientation.

206
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,570
So if you create a society where peoples
basic psychological needs are not met

207
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,290
right, where they have shrinking number
of friends and social connections,

208
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,210
where they're taught that life is about
money and buying shit and displaying it

209
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,280
on Instagram,
excuse me,

210
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,870
where they spend most of their time
at jobs, they find unfulfilling,

211
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,180
controlling and humiliating. You can, uh,

212
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:27,960
create growing pools of people
who can't. And you, by the way,

213
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:30,240
that if you're constantly insecure,
financially insecure,

214
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,000
half of all Americans through
no fault of their own,

215
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,150
have been able to set aside $500
for if an emergency comes along,

216
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,970
she credits pervasive
insecurity in the society.

217
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,170
You're going to create very large numbers
of people who are going to want to

218
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,330
fill a need to anesthetize themselves.
Now, that's not a good solution.

219
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,310
Obviously I don't think heroin opioids,

220
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:53,740
these are not good solutions
to these problems, but,

221
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,210
but it's not a crazy solution either.
There's a line I think of all the time.

222
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,860
I don't quite hit very often cause people
can really react against this insight.

223
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,110
But I think it's actually important.
You know Marianne Faithfull,

224
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,690
the great like sixties British singer.
She went out with Mick Jagger. Annoyingly,

225
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,550
that's why people remember. She's much
better than Mick Jagger. In her memoir,

226
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,070
she shot heroin addiction in 60
she was homeless for a while.

227
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,950
She has this very challenging
line that I think about a lot.

228
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:21,160
I'm going to phrase it slightly
wrong, but she said, um,

229
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,550
heroin saved my life because
if it wasn't the heroin,

230
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:28,270
I would have killed myself at that point.
Right now Marianne Faithfull,

231
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,180
if not saying heroin was a
good solution to homelessness,

232
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,070
but we'd got to understand this drug
use is happening because it performs a

233
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,210
function,
right?

234
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,580
One of the most important things I'll
done for both of my books for chasing

235
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:44,530
scream and lost connection is that
these forms of despair, depression,

236
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,980
anxiety, addiction, they are
meaningful signals, right?

237
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,540
They are telling us something.

238
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,210
The fact that they had been
rising year after year after year,

239
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,960
that we're now at the point where average
white male life expectancy has fallen

240
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:59,920
in this country for the first time in
the entire piece time history of the

241
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:03,010
United States. That is a signal
that is telling us something.

242
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,340
And that's because of drug addiction
and overwhelming cause of drug addiction

243
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:08,020
and suicide is,
it's risen to that point.

244
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,120
Are there other factors
going on like obesity,

245
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:15,121
but that the main drivers are
a overdose and suicide and pat,

246
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:18,370
he's telling us something of what we've
been doing up to now is we've been

247
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,660
insulting that signal.
We've either been saying depressed people,

248
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,620
addicted people are just weak
or we've been saying, oh,

249
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,970
it's just a problem in their brain that
there are real things going on in their

250
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:32,260
brains of course. Um, or we've been
saying, you know, it's just craziness.

251
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,530
But in fact it is largely a
response to the way we're living in.

252
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,730
Of course there are other things going
on as well and we can talk about them.

253
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,800
And once you understand that, you realize
there's gotta be a deeper response.

254
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,150
And I went to places that had done
it, not just Switzerland, Switzerland.

255
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,690
What is the overall population?
Five and a half million.

256
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,050
So it's a small comparatively
small country. Yeah.

257
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,380
How much money do they have to
spend to keep this program going?

258
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,420
And what is the time constraints
in terms of like how long has a,

259
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:05,430
a person who's got an addiction
problem allowed to stay there and,

260
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,530
and receive treatment?
There's no time constraint.

261
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,660
You can stay on your
entire life if you want to.

262
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:13,930
In practice that doesn't happen very,
they stay in the facility. No, no.

263
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:16,380
They live in apartments
and they just visit.

264
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,790
They just go every day or
whenever they want to. I mean,

265
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,030
I think you can go twice a day and it's
free. It's free. It doesn't cost anything.

266
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,100
I mean, some people, once they have jobs,

267
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,320
then pay health insurance and
the health insurance pays for it.

268
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,530
But if you don't have money
than they pay for it. Um,

269
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,930
and one things that was fascinating as
they found it, it wasn't, and Joanne set,

270
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,370
uh,

271
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,160
did good research on or sites could
research on this for she to researched the

272
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,260
open society foundation.

273
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,560
It's actually cheaper than the
police constantly harassing people,

274
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,570
putting them in prison,
putting them on trial.

275
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:48,310
Those are really expensive things to do.

276
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:50,470
Heroin is unbelievably cheap
if you buy it legally. Right.

277
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,450
Why would they do the amount of money
they would save just in street crime being

278
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,420
radically reduced. Exactly. It makes it,

279
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,100
makes the life of the person
with addiction better.

280
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,810
It makes the lives of ordinary of other
citizens who would not addictive better.

281
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,430
Um, and it saves money. Right. Which
is why Swiss people are very pragmatic.

282
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,260
They're not, you know, the
most compassionate people,

283
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:13,790
but they are very pragmatic people.
That's why it was so popular system.

284
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,120
Let's think about another place that
adopted really different drug policies.

285
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:20,360
Right? Um, cause I think it's something
we can learn from there as well.

286
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,010
So Portugal around the time Switzerland's
having it's horrific heroin crisis,

287
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,640
Portugal is having a fucking
nightmare. Right? By the year, 2000,

288
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,510
1% of the population was addicted to
heroin, which is incredible. Right?

289
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,400
And every year they would like Swiss,
then they were trying the American way,

290
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:41,300
shame, punishment, stigma and things just
kept getting worse and worse and worse.

291
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,450
And then one day the prime minister
and the leader of the opposition got

292
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,700
together. And the louder, we can't go
on like this. What are we going to,

293
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,600
what are we going to do? And they
decided to do something really radical,

294
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,750
something no one had done since the
drug war began in this country 70 years

295
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:57,950
before. They said, should
we like awesome scientists,

296
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,180
what the best thing to do would be.

297
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,660
So they set up a panel of scientists
and doctors led by an amazing man.

298
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,770
I got to know him, Portugal,
Dr. Wow. Pulau it could
totally extraordinary person.

299
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,970
Um, and uh, who'd run the first of
a drug treatment center in Portugal,

300
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,110
founded after the dictatorship. And they
said to them, you guys just go away,

301
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,770
look all the evidence and figure
out what the hell we can do.

302
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,100
So they go away for two years.
They, they learn about rat park,

303
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:25,520
they learned loads of things and
they come back and they say, okay,

304
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,190
solution is we want to decriminalize
all drugs from cannabis to crack.

305
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,900
But,
and this is the crucial next step.

306
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,590
Take all the money we currently spend
on fucking people up, arresting them,

307
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,030
shaming them,
imprisoning them,

308
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,570
and spend all that money instead
on turning their lives around.

309
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,951
And interestingly,

310
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,920
it's not really what we think of as drug
treatment here in the United States,

311
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,400
right? So they do some residential
rehab that has some value.

312
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,510
Main thing they did was a big program of
job creation for people with addiction

313
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:57,230
problems saying he used to be a mechanic,
they go to a garage and they said,

314
00:16:57,231 --> 00:17:01,520
if you employ this guy for a year,
we'll pay half his wages again,

315
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,750
much cheaper than sending
him to prison. Right? Uh,

316
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:05,630
they set up a big program of small loans,

317
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,390
so people with addiction problems
could set up and run businesses.

318
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,310
The things that they thought
were important at the time.

319
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:13,460
People like this is crazy. They're just
going to spend it all on drugs. Lunacy.

320
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,550
Right? By the time I went
to Portugal, it was again,

321
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,580
a 13 years since is gone and the results
were in addiction was down by 50% over.

322
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,470
This is by the biggest from the
British journal of Criminology.

323
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:28,700
The best scientific study of this
overdose deaths were massively down.

324
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:30,200
HIV was massively down.

325
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,450
Every single indicator on problems related
to drug use had fallen like a cliff.

326
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,030
Right? It wasn't perfect. There's
still got problems of course,

327
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,800
but there was a massive improvement.

328
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:42,860
And one of the reasons you know it works
so well is that virtually no one in

329
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,641
Portugal wants to go.

330
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:47,660
But I went and interviewed a
great guy called Cryo for Guerra,

331
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,450
who at the time of the decriminalization
was the top drug cop in the whole

332
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:54,330
country.
And he said,

333
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,300
what I'm sure Lozier your listeners
are thinking right at the time,

334
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:59,850
which was like,
if we decriminalize all drugs,

335
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,040
we can have an explosion in drug use.
We can have lots of kids,

336
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:06,040
these interesting nightmare. We can't
do this. When I went to see him, uh,

337
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,490
the audios on the Tyson's screen
website, he said, uh, sang,

338
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,790
like everything I said would happen,
didn't happen,

339
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,280
and everything the other
side said would happen. Did.

340
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,330
And he talks about how he felt really
ashamed that it's been so many years prior

341
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,540
to the decriminalization screwing
people's lives up when it could have been

342
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,630
helping them turn their lives around.
And,

343
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,670
and this is something that I
saw all over the world, right?

344
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,460
The places that have drug
policies based on shame.

345
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,460
And stigma and the fantasy that
you can get rid of drug use,

346
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,500
which you can never do.
Um,

347
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,130
they have mass really
terrible and rising problems.

348
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,020
The places that have policies based on,
okay,

349
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:45,021
let's restore order to the market and
let's give love liberty to drug users and

350
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:49,200
love and compassion and practical help
for people with addiction problems have

351
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:52,530
declining drug problems,
right? Again, not perfect,

352
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,310
but it was such a significant improvement
that support in Portugal. I mean,

353
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,370
they've got five main political parties
and none of them want to go back, right?

354
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,690
That tells you something, right? Yeah.

355
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,100
Now when they did this in Switzerland,

356
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,780
what was the primary cause for this drug
addiction and how did they deal with

357
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,530
that? So if they dealt with it in
Portugal with these loans and, and, and,

358
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,460
and helping our businesses by paying
for half the salary and all those things

359
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:19,620
like that seemed like wonderful ideas.

360
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,680
What do they do in Switzerland to
sort of mitigate what are the issues,

361
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,530
whatever the issues were that were
causing people to be drug addicts in the

362
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,990
first place. So it's a combination.
They gave people lots of therapy.

363
00:19:27,991 --> 00:19:31,050
So I remember one of the people I spent
some time within that clinic had been,

364
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,190
um,

365
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,190
terribly sexually abused as a lot of
evidence that giving survivors of sexual

366
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:40,440
abuse safe places in which they can
release their shame about that leads to a

367
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,480
big fall in depression,
addiction and other problems.

368
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,260
It's a lot of evidence that
that, that kind of abuse is, is,

369
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,240
is a big driver of a lot of addiction
for a lot of people that clearly not

370
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:51,150
everyone. Um, some of it was just,

371
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:54,990
there were people who had never been
given a chance in life or I had never had

372
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,990
stable lives. Uh, it was
kind of a mixture of things.

373
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:02,220
And one of the things that's really good
about this system is it wasn't saying

374
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,720
in this kind of cookie cutter way,

375
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:06,240
the up and half often happens in drug
treatment in the United States are there,

376
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:10,020
there's plenty of good examples as well.
You know, you don't arrive and they say,

377
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,340
this is your problem.

378
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,280
We're here to tell you your problem
and how to solve your problem.

379
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,060
It's very much guided by actually
the person themselves, right?

380
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,590
People who are in deep pain. The, the,

381
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,530
the core of it is you have
to listen to them, right?

382
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,290
If we think about this addiction,
depression in the way that I'm arguing,

383
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,960
that we should see them as signals
that are telling us something,

384
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,640
most important thing is to listen to
the signal, right? I remember saying,

385
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,550
I thought about a lot,

386
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,210
this weird experience that I
kept thinking about all the time.

387
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,100
I was writing my book,
lost connections about depression.

388
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,630
And I started quite late,

389
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,570
late in the day that I realized why
I kept thinking about it so much.

390
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:48,010
I was in Vietnam about five years
ago now, maybe a little bit less. Um,

391
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,600
and I did this really
stupid thing. I was, uh,

392
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,390
I was in Hanoi and I was really tired.

393
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:56,770
I was do research for different book
that haven't finished yet. And uh,

394
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,090
by the side of the road,

395
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,020
I saw this big red apple or women
selling it and I'm shit haggling.

396
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:05,320
So I paid like $5 for this
apple or something out and
I took it back to my hotel.

397
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,580
I was so tired. I lay on the bed and I
start eating it and it was just gross.

398
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:12,040
Right? There were some
really, it's chemical taste.

399
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,910
It was like how I imagined a food would
taste after a nuclear war when I used to

400
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:19,420
watch these films in the 80s
right. Um, but I was so tired,

401
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,350
even though I knew it was wrong,

402
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:25,351
I ate like half of it and threw it in
the garbage and next like four days I was

403
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,200
just like violently sick right there.

404
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,480
Like just in like something
from the exorcist.

405
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,110
It's online there in front of CNN and
occasionally projectile vomiting and it

406
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,240
gets like bought it.
I'd had food poisoning before.

407
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:40,450
I basically lived on fried chicken in my
twenties so I was not new to this Rodeo

408
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,010
and after about four days,
I said to Hawaiian, my,

409
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:46,620
a fixer and translator who was a ranger.

410
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,450
I was there to interview survivors of
the war, the Vietnam War for something.

411
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,260
I'm like, look, I'm only here for
another three days, or whatever it was.

412
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:54,200
I've got to go and meet these people.

413
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:55,900
Otherwise this whole trip would
have been a waste of time.

414
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:00,070
So he drives me like six or seven hours
into the countryside and we get there

415
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,300
and he's lined up these people for me to
interview and I'm like, oh, thank God,

416
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,170
I don't feel so bad. Actually I
was sitting in this hot word, this,

417
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:08,800
this woman who's an 86 year old woman
who was the only person from her village

418
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:09,970
that survived the Vietnam War.

419
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,040
So I'm talking to her and now she's
speaking that the room starts to,

420
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,410
I've never had this feeling before,
and I've had a thing when you were drunk,

421
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,310
when you fill the rooms,
move it.

422
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,890
It literally felt like the room
was moving around me, like,

423
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,370
like I didn't feel like
I was disorientated. And
then while she's talking,

424
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:28,870
I just like explode all over
her heart from both ads,

425
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:33,440
like fucking horror show. Right?
And so I say to her, I'm just,

426
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,450
just take me back, put me in the
car, take me back to Hanoi. Right?

427
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,200
And he's this old woman's like sang, sang
to him and I'm just like, line there.

428
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,320
And he says, she says, you've got to go
to the hospital. We were really sick.

429
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,310
And I'm like, no, no, I just need to go
back to the hotel. And he said, Yo man,

430
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,380
this is the only woman who survived
the Vietnam War in this village.

431
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:53,890
I'm going to listen to her health advice
over yours. We're going to the hospital.

432
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,200
So we go to this hospital were,

433
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:56,950
I'm pretty sure I was there in the
European and I've been treated,

434
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,930
they take me in and cranks
like completely lying,

435
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,980
going like this is an
important western eye.

436
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,310
It will disgrace Vietnam if he dies there.
Right.

437
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,740
And so I'm lying there and they're like
jabbing me with everything and I'm like,

438
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:09,574
what's going on?

439
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,740
And they're asking me lots of questions
and I felt the most nauseas I've ever

440
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:18,370
felt right. And I kept saying to them,
give me something for the nausea,

441
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:22,000
three quant, because they didn't speak
English. And the doctor said to me,

442
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,560
you need your nausea. It will tell
us what's wrong with you right now.

443
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,450
Even line there were thinking,
it was kind of interesting.

444
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,890
I was where we think
of there and thinking,

445
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,850
they figured out it was the apple and I'm
having such a ridiculous thought where

446
00:23:33,851 --> 00:23:37,630
I thought, I come about to die,
right? I've been killed by an apple.

447
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,830
I'm like eve or like snow white or
like Alan Turing. And then I was like,

448
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,620
you're about to die in your last thought
is that you're basically pretentious

449
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:48,380
con [inaudible] that horrified by myself.
Anyway,

450
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,750
they gave me this treatment and
a few days later when I leave,

451
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,700
I'm talking to the doctor and
just discussing various things with him.

452
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,190
And I said to him, what would
have happened if I'd, um,

453
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,100
if I had gone back to Hanoi,
if it shouldn't be about
10 away. And he said, oh,

454
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,710
well what happened is my kidneys has
stopped working because I hadn't kept any

455
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,940
water in for four days.

456
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,410
So it was like I had been in the desert
for four days and the doctor said, Oh,

457
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,800
you would have died on the
journey when it made it.

458
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,800
And so can think about this experience,

459
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:15,260
which really didn't actually affect
my life. Well, viewer and a thing.

460
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,420
It's the closest I've ever had
to a near death experience.

461
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,280
But all through research in my book
about depression, lost connections,

462
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,940
I kept thinking about this thing,
right? You need your nausea,

463
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:24,350
it will tell us what's wrong with you.

464
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
And I realized all the time I had been
depressed for think about my relatives

465
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,600
and people I love who'd
had addiction problems.

466
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,270
I had seen that my depression,
their addiction as a bit like that.

467
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:40,860
Nausea, right? As like a
kind of malfunction, right?

468
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:42,320
It's saying that you should get rid of.

469
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,310
And actually what we need
to do is hear it right?

470
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,010
Cause it will tell us
what's wrong with us. Right?

471
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,480
It doesn't mean it's a good
feeling. It's awful. Right?

472
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,200
Depression is worse than I've ever felt.
Uh,

473
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,610
addiction is a terrible state to be in.
It's not saying just in some kind of way,

474
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,090
oh we need to put up with it.
It's that if we hear the signal,

475
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,540
we can begin to find solutions
and all the places I went,

476
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,330
the places that have solved depression
crisis that I went to Veloce connections,

477
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,190
places that have solved addiction crises,

478
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,300
that w that I went to for
chasing the screen are places
that have said, actually,

479
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,450
this means something, right?
Your pain makes sense.

480
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,740
You feel these ways for reasons,
and we need to get down into these,

481
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,850
these deeper reasons,

482
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,330
which is really not what we've done in
the United States is the drug war began,

483
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,670
you know, uh, a century ago.
