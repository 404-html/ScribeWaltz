1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
Breakfast with their own spinning
shit. Now, Hamas, Nick Diaz,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,180
EOD said, man, he said, I want to
hurt nobody. I want a party has done.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,060
Really? Yeah. For him, man. He is.
Is done. Yeah, because a Anderson,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,560
someone was talking about Anderson
versus nick and Connor said,

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:20,740
I'll fight Nate on the same card. And then
Nick said, yeah, I'm not fighting any,

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:23,820
but I don't want hurt nobody.
He goes, I just want to
party. That's cool, man. Yeah.

7
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,540
He was for him. Fucking amazing career.
You've got to remember Nick Diaz fought.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,660
He was one of the youngest
guys to ever fight in the UFC.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,980
I believe he beat Robbie Lawler
when he was 20 dude, he's beats you.

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,740
Look at his resume. It's
impressive. The guy said he's flat.

11
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:41,290
He's been doing for a hot second. He's
deserved. Yeah. Turning to survive.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,000
Hopefully financially he's good too.
What do you think of that?
