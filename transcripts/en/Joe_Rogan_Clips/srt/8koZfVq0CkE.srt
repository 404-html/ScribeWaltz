1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
I wish that with Trump. Sam Harris
has been on a, he was at least,

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,960
I think he's abandoned it,
but he was,

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:09,961
it was on a quest to get jack to try to
hold up his terms of service agreement

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,030
and, and kick Trump off of Twitter.
He's like glued, he's doing,

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,850
he's threatening nuclear war.
Like,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,170
do you understand that this is
the craziest use of Twitter ever?

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,860
And I think Jack's
position was that it is,

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,180
it's more beneficial to
have him on and it's really,

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:32,190
we are getting to see his personality in
a way we've never seen any president's

10
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:33,360
personal.
Absolutely.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,420
I mean the most ridiculous petty shit
that he does like attacking Michelle Wolf

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,590
of because of her White
House correspondence, calling
people losers, you know,

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,420
making fun of, uh, the girl
on Joe Scarborough, the
girl he married. Yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,580
Saying that she had
fucked up plastic surgery.

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,110
Bleeding makes shit up. I
mean, do you think she really,

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,130
really thinks she showed up at maralago
bleeding fucking plastic surgeries cause

17
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:04,080
he's a fucking maniac. But he
really is a meanwhile that it, it,

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,390
it's good for us to see because it
educates us to who he is as a real person.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,910
There's a lot of who you are just gets
exposed in those tweets we little bit,

20
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:18,720
you can't know everything about a person
from their Twitter, but you can get,

21
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:21,990
you can parse out little chunks
where you get a good taste.

22
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:26,450
And for him it's very, very
revealing. Yeah, it is a weird thing.

23
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:31,451
This is what I think this will be looked
back on as a very pivotal moment in

24
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:37,301
American history and in politics where
that kind of crossroad happened because

25
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:42,020
we were, we were pretty
satisfied with, uh,

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,170
that political speech thing that,

27
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:50,171
and we need to bring up the lower middle
class to the door and they just go on

28
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:51,650
and on and drone on.

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,270
It's this weird speech that no
real human being ever speaks.

30
00:01:56,271 --> 00:02:00,260
Like Hillary was hilarious.
And Wayne, Hey ted. Hey,

31
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:04,820
it's the guy was fake. It comes off as
fake and phony. Trump comes rolling in.

32
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,140
It's absolutely batshit insane.
Like the stuffy says,

33
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:10,980
like you were saying the other day,
he's,

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,000
he's giving a speech and he
said that when he was younger,

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,500
people said he looked like Elvis
because he was doing some kind of a

36
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:22,100
commemorative thing for
Elvis. Um, uh, down in, um,

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,520
it was it Tennessee or
somewhere and he says, uh,

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,480
he looked like Elvis and we're
laughing our asses off me and Keith,

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,650
because no one ever told him he looked
like Elvis. No one ever told him that.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,120
And, and there's so many
things and I'm a Trump guy.

41
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:42,110
I voted for the guy because I wanted that
monkey wrench thrown into the machine.

42
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,410
I felt we had gotten screwed too many
decades and it was time to let Washington

43
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,250
know, like, look,

44
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:53,630
we'd rather elect this
nut than any of you guys.

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,810
So I think it proved a point.
Uh,

46
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,680
there are enough checks and
balances in place. You know,

47
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:03,880
the likes of any one president really
isn't going to do that much damage.

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,340
I think he's pulled the
cover off a lot of stuff.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,430
I think people are trying to
compete with him on Twitter.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,240
Politicians are trying to play his
game and it's kind of fun to watch.

51
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,580
As a comic entertainer, it's gold
to see what Tulsi Gavin said to him,

52
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,210
what? She's a congresswoman
from Hawaii. She said, uh,

53
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,400
being Saudi Arabia's bitch isn't
making America first like that's a

54
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:31,090
congresswoman.
Say they're all kind of taking that.

55
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,730
They never used to do that.
No they didn't.

56
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:38,731
And it's odd that a 70 year old guy was
the one that was like bringing Twitter

57
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:44,140
to social media into this
a forum it is on and yeah,

58
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,540
you would think it would be some
young guy get in there and do it,

59
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,120
but I would never do it
the way he's doing it. No,

60
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:54,070
that's just like a reckless maniac. It's
and, and that's because he can, the guy,

61
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,380
you'll never see a chain of events like
what happened to elect Donald Trump.

62
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,510
The rich guy is a billionaire and
billion of whatever you want to call him.

63
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,410
He's got a lot of money from his dad,
from his, his dad. And then, you know,

64
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:11,590
I remember him in New
York when I was a kid.

65
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,450
Trump was always in the news developer.

66
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,600
He was always banging
heads with politicians,

67
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:20,080
trying to get some kind of zoning
thing going or build some other tower

68
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,880
somewhere. And, uh,

69
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,810
so we were all familiar with them and we
knew he was like this piece of shit guy.

70
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,340
You know, like everyone was surprised,
like, Oh God, he grabbed by the pussy.

71
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:34,240
He's like, we saw in the Daily
News in New York Post every week.

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,420
Trump was with some other hula
and said,

73
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:42,360
so it wasn't a surprise to, to us. Uh,

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,090
but he got out there and it was the
perfect timing. Like we come off the, uh,

75
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:51,420
the heels of eight years of
a Democratic president, uh,

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,850
and it just was, people were ready
for a maniac to be in the White House.

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,170
People were,
some people were exact.

78
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:04,171
My favorite image of the election was
that lady with the sock hat on their knees

79
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,190
with the glasses,
screaming

80
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,660
like that to me,
ushered in this era of outrage and chaos.

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah. Yeah. It just,

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,530
that was like the primal scream that
set off the dominoes and they're all in

83
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:24,910
motion right now. It wasn't supposed to
happen. It wasn't supposed to happen.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,830
Hillary was supposed to be president.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,530
That's what everybody thought
it was going to go down in.

86
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:34,240
History is just one of those
wacky elections and then
business as usual. But uh,

87
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,400
you know, when, when Trump won,

88
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,260
it turned everything upside down
and rip the cover off of I think,

89
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,500
not only politics in Washington,
but uh, Hollywood, uh, uh,

90
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,180
the mainstream media,
the news media,

91
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,800
everything had the covers ripped off
and everyone's now got a peek inside and

92
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:57,470
realize how fucked up everything is.
You know,

93
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,660
you used to assume Washington,

94
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:02,930
at least the people had some
kind of control like they were,

95
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,860
they were adults doing the job that needed
to be, and then you realize, oh my God,

96
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,830
everyone's just a piece of shit.
Do you remember,

97
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,810
here's a story that
disappeared from years ago.

98
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,940
Do you remember the Washington
Madam that suicide herself? Oh yeah.

99
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,120
Book filled with politicians
that we're getting there.

100
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,820
We're banging all these prostitutes and
she was going to release everything and

101
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,160
she was doing press conferences
and then she committed suicide,

102
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:28,400
committed suicide. But it's like welp
case closed, you know, no big deal. Oh,

103
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:32,100
well lost her books. Yeah.
Yeah. Never would. Whatever.
And then it disappeared. Yeah.

104
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,240
It disappeared. Thinks
like that happen. Oh, flag.

105
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,380
Do politicians kill people?
Oh yeah. Uh, there's,

106
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:43,250
there's secret backroom deals
that happen and it's crazy.

107
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,850
House of cards is way closer to reality
than people would like to believe. Yeah.

108
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,950
Yeah. Way Closer. We, uh,

109
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,020
over the course of the decades upon
decades, uh, every year that goes by,

110
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:58,940
we seem to get a little more knowledge
and a little less confident in the

111
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,720
government. I mean, I watched some
shit from the fifties you know,

112
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,980
there's plenty of things on youtube
and even even industrial films,

113
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,260
just this thing of how a family,

114
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,130
how to raise your family [inaudible] they
had to be a good wife, all that stuff.

115
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,300
And it was all this weird
propaganda of what America was.

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,130
And then as years go by, you
realize, oh, it was all bullshit.

117
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,610
Like politicians were always getting
rich and no one seems to know how we're,

118
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:32,030
why and these deals that are made
aren't always in our best interest.

119
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,470
They're not civil servants there
to represent and help you. And,

120
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,110
and as the years go by,
we see more and more of this.

121
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,410
And the past two years with Trump has
just been a man quite a crash course.

122
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,730
It really has. Yeah. It's crazy. Um,
I'm fascinated to see where it goes. Um,

123
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,490
I'm fascinated to see if he seems,
you know,

124
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:54,950
I mean they always called Gotti,
the Teflon Don,

125
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,690
but it seems like Trump is the
Teflon Donald. Yeah. He seems,

126
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,190
it seems like all these
things keep happening and,

127
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,910
and even because like I
remember Justin Martin Dale,

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,740
a comedian friend of mine
is hilarious. He goes, uh,

129
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,180
he was talking about stormy Daniels.
He was like, she's our Monica Lewinsky.

130
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,750
She's going to take them down. Oh my
God, the fuck that's not happening. No,

131
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:22,060
you don't get it. He doesn't care
that they know he fucked her. Yeah.

132
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:26,690
He doesn't care to understand.
It's not you have to care for it to work.

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,410
Right. And that's just it.
People don't really care. It's a,

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,790
well some people don't care.
I,

135
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:37,791
I follow like Rosario Donald's account
on Twitter and Rob Reiner is another one

136
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,340
and for two years, over two years, uh,

137
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,470
they have just been like counting
down and the day that it's like,

138
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:50,570
oh impeachments right around the corner.
Oh he's out.

139
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,520
Oh they're going to put him in prison.

140
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,280
I hope you and your son get a
cell to each other. And it's like,

141
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,400
how long are you going to do this?
Eight years.

142
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,130
Is it going to be eight years
of you going well any day now.

143
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,800
How about Keith Miller is going to,
yeah.

144
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,640
Do you remember when he was doing that
wacky show in a basement somewhere?

145
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Gq like a mental patient like legitimately
wick a mental patient resistance

146
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,340
screaming and he was like,
he was doing like,

147
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,670
it was almost like burlesque or something.
I know what I'm saying.

148
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,990
Like you know how it was like the,

149
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,140
the radio version of burlesque ask is
like when you see a girl doing burlesque,

150
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,800
it's like an a throwback to an
old timey way of doing things.

151
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,610
Like the guy of the handlebar mustache
with a bowler capital introducer.

152
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,650
She's body, she is bought day shares,
please welcome Madam Blah Blah Blah.

153
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,180
And she comes out to music that nobody
listens to any more and she's dancing

154
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:48,930
around. It's very we and they're there.
They're always kind of big girls.

155
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:52,710
They're not skinny and like little
strippers, there are girls who eat.

156
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,120
So it's like it's a throwback to
a different time of of rowdiness.

157
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,130
And when he was in front of that screen,

158
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,110
like doing this thing with his suit
on and his tie and everything was like

159
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:08,820
really well written and rice
precise points and I don't
understand like what the

160
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:11,490
red blue and the background was either.
It's just,

161
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,730
it was so it seemed like something that
someone had set up like not as good as

162
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:21,540
your compound. The basement live
from the compound. It wasn't,

163
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:25,500
it wasn't as good as that. It's like
that's the background. This is for Gq.

164
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,840
Gq was like, okay, we have $30

165
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,660
$80 I think a, I think a,
Charlie's got a camera,

166
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,900
he could bring it in $30
good. Okay. We have a table,

167
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,500
the Ikea table that's $12 $18 left.

168
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,420
We got some construction paper for
the background. What the fuck is this?

169
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I got some big ass blue
and blue and red pate.

170
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,820
Yeah, posters. What? What is that?

171
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,090
And then he would just
pontificate there and,

172
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,230
and he Glen and his last thing was like,
because the end is eminent, there's no,

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,740
no reason for me to go on right up
is finished. Yeah. What is this?

174
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:09,110
My work here is done play. Some of
this. Trump is finished 17 year.

175
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,120
One year ago. This week.
Exactly. One year ago. Wow.

176
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,760
Remember 11 2017 it was when he quit.

177
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,340
Get a pardon from Trump or that
molar as I have also reported here,

178
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,820
has succeeded in finding
a way around trumps.

179
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:28,620
Pardon power and either of these near
certainties spelled Trump's doom.

180
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,620
So that's the most obvious of the seven
ways for Trump to go. Now we're really,

181
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,670
we'll get him on Russia.

182
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,470
It will be ugly and it will
tear this country nearly apart,

183
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,810
but it will be necessary.

184
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,740
The second way is as I've also
repeatedly suggested here,

185
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,780
that Muller doesn't really need to
prove anything about Trump and Russian

186
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,020
sabotage of the electric.

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,200
There seems to be so much obstruction
of justice or the of James Comey

188
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,980
to the lies about Trump jr's
meetings with the Russians,

189
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,780
that it's hard to pick out a key player
in the Trump inner circle who could not

190
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:03,310
be guilty of it.

191
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,620
It's so funny. [inaudible] year ago and
it's like, it's still going. Still going.

192
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,040
Still going and it's fake news.
Yeah, end it now. Fake News.

193
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,910
It's a hoax,
but it is interesting like Mueller to me,

194
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:23,680
it's fascinating because he seems
like a ruthless motherfucker.

195
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,510
Takes his time. He's like a guy says,
hey, look at me. I'm going to kill you.

196
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,560
It's not going to be today. Okay,
that's all you need to know.

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,720
It's not going to be today,
but I'm going to fucking kill you.

198
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,250
And like every day he's
plotting on killing you.

199
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,880
You see him drive by your house
and wait, and you're like, when is,

200
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,550
when is the hammer fall? And you
look out your window of your office.

201
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,260
He's out drinking coffee. Oh, he
has seen some shit. Oh, I mean,

202
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,970
this guy, he's, yeah, I mean, he's
a cold blooded intelligence agent.

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,880
Yeah.
Those guys have seen everything.

204
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,570
He knows the inner workings of the machine
and he knows how you bring a guy like

205
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:02,770
that down and how you fuck it
up and he's doing everything.

206
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:07,510
That leads me to believe that he's not
fucking it up. This is a slow play.

207
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,520
And if there is,
if there is anything to the Russian thing,

208
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,970
I, you would think something would
have leaked out by now. Well, it has.

209
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:16,511
I mean it was a,

210
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:20,680
there was a video the other day of Donald
that they just played on CNN of Donald

211
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,940
talking about how many times he's actually
been the rush Donald Jr and you know,

212
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:26,200
he had said that he hadn't been,

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,350
and then there's another video of
him from years ago saying, yeah,

214
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:33,580
I've been there many times. Dan, five,
six, seven, eight talking about business.

215
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,980
The problem with,
uh,

216
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,590
the people that are going after Trump
that they don't seem to understand.

217
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,040
The Guy Right up until he became
president of the United States was just a

218
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,750
private citizen businessman.

219
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,170
So he had a lot of dealings around the
world with his real estate and buildings

220
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:53,080
and,

221
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,080
and a golf course is all this shit
happened when he was just a citizen doing

222
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:02,200
business. Now, whether it
was ethical or not, um,

223
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,330
that that could definitely be brought
into question, whether it's legal or not.

224
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,380
Uh, I'm sure that's what they're
looking into also. But he wasn't,

225
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,610
he wasn't beholden to the
people as a public servant.

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,470
There wasn't a conflict of interest
because he was a lifelong politician and

227
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:24,250
using the power of his
office to make deals. So,

228
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,420
and that also goes hand in hand
with him just fucking around. Like,

229
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,570
like if he went from a,

230
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:34,030
a selectman in his hometown and then
years and years go by and then you're the

231
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:39,031
president and you built that career up
any at any point in there they could call

232
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,490
you out on being a horrible human
being because he fucked girls.

233
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,770
Or your this or your dad
of shady business dealings,

234
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,730
but were up until two years ago,
he was just Donald fucking Trump.

235
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,300
So it's hard to call them out on even
dealing with Russia because there's plenty

236
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,130
of businessmen and deal
with Russia and China.

237
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:59,630
I think the question is whether or
not he colluded with Russia to get

238
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,760
information about Hillary and also to,
to,

239
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,550
to put out all that propaganda against
Hillary and also saying that they're

240
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,820
going to make a deal to do
the Trump tower in Moscow.

241
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,020
This was all while he was running for
president, not being honest about it.

242
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,990
I think that's, that's where
it gets again. I don't know,

243
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,860
almost there's anything illegal there. I
don't know if there's anything, uh, that,

244
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:26,420
that he did that is illegal because
I believe when you're campaigning,

245
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,410
say whatever the fuck you want to anybody,
I don't think you're really running,

246
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,840
I mean you're, you're, you're running,
but you're not really running anything.

247
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:36,500
And it really running the country.
If he lost the presidency,

248
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,600
he would still have to have some ducks
in a row to continue his business. So,

249
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,150
you know,
and his son took over that part of,

250
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,890
of what he was doing so he could campaign.

251
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:50,490
So whether Donny Jr went over to
Russia or not, I don't really see.

252
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,950
You might think it's unethical and you
might go, well, did he say, if we win,

253
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:58,400
we'll do this and help you out.
So who knows about that part of it,

254
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,090
but I don't see in and of itself him
going over there being that big a problem.
