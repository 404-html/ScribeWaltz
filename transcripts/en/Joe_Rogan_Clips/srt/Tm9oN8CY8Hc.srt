1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,970
Nice. Let's start reward though. We
should have a reward. I got to, I got

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,323
out of this month.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,520
We're going to present you with the belt
is we're going to get that done while

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,940
they're on the stack of weed.
I would like to say

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,850
hope fiction bottom my Instagram
for more details. Okay. Okay.

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,680
Actually let's present the the pulp fit.

7
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:23,400
It's more like creep show werewolf
that lives under the stairs.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,300
Creep shows they perfect.
That is the perfect no goddamn crate.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,770
That's the creative creep show. There's
more nightmares. I felt so bad. Okay.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,080
I would like ladies and gentlemen,
we people to present this belt.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,430
Thank you very much. Ultimately
make you crazy. By the way.

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,010
The fact that we actually
did this was nuts.

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,910
Nuts and I would like
to say on behalf of me,

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,670
one of the three non winners,

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,740
I won't say losers of the sober October
of fitness challenge. Joe Rogan,

16
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,130
much like Jesus before him where there
was nothing and then there was winning

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,390
Joe Rogan.

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,750
You have achieved the champion of
sober October physical challenge.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,210
I ours your fair presents you Joe Rogan.

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,010
This belt saying,

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,310
you are the champion of sober October.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,500
I just want to stay for the record.

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:27,050
I was most impressed by you and then
if you had been exercising as long as I

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,060
probably would have died trying to
defeat you, great job drug like Thompson.

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,740
Yes sir. I was not impressed. Come
on over the belt. It's already on.

26
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:42,120
I'll just say this. I was a Joe. You
showed us definitely what time it was.

27
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,170
It was all about second place
and you definitely got that.

28
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,940
So congratulations to you Ari.
But Joe, uh, your in better I,

29
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,630
here's a huge shocker. You're in
better shape than the three of us.

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,190
I think that had a factor.
There was certainly a part of it.

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,950
How much energy could put out.
We all put in though, man,

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,920
we all worked our ass off.
But it's ultimately it's about TRT.

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,150
Is that tight enough or not even

34
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,940
like an advertisement? Trt. Fuck.
At some point we're like, hey,

35
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,450
really does go to show you that steroids
can help it. Athletic Challenges.

36
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,300
This is why it's illegal.
