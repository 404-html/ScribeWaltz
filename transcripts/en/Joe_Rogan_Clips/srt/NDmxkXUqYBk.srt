1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,030
What about CRISPR and what do you think,
uh,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,370
is going to come out of that in terms
of like real world application for an

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,400
adult? I mean, what if people
don't know what Crispr has?

4
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:14,940
Please explain it in
layman's terms. A, yeah,

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:19,230
so CRISPR is a term actually was
invented in, in my department, poly.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,530
So I know it pretty well.
It's a back bacteria,

7
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:26,380
have an immune system that cuts
invaders, cut their DNA. Uh,

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,410
and what we've done now as scientists,
we've now utilize that a system,

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,270
take it out of the back to you and we
use it to create designer mutations,

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,500
designer gene changes in
animals and also in humans.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,530
So it's a bacterial immune system that
corrects genes and we use it all the

12
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,770
time. Now. It's, um, it's,

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,280
it's actually what's interesting about
us being able to mutate genes for many

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,950
years.
But this is dial up a gene mutation.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,210
You can choose exactly where
you want to make it. And, uh,

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,780
so I think many of you listeners will
know that recently, uh, late last year,

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,310
Chinese researcher in our field came
out and said he's engineered a couple of

18
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:10,140
twin girls with CRISPR to be
resistant to HIV AIDS virus.

19
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,240
Wow.
Um,

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,200
if they're telling you that you got to
think they're doing some stuff and not

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,710
telling you about right, well yet have
some kids with giant heads and well,

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,740
it's coming through walls realigned. Well,
yeah. If you start to see people, uh,

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,230
that are 90 and uh, and they
still as young as 20, you
know, something's going on.

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,180
Yeah. That's the weird one,
right? If you can, you, you'd
go, Hey, what are you doing?

25
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,540
Nothing to Seton healthy looking
good. Take care of bots. Right?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,170
They're not going to tell you. Yeah,
yeah. Well, so consider this, that, that,

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,750
so the chance of getting HIV
in China is one in a thousand.

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,340
So that doctor was seemingly,
he thought he was ethical,

29
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:53,880
protecting the babies from something.
That's, I would say really rare.

30
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,830
Whereas if he really wanted
to do something helpful to
those kids and we agreed

31
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,330
it was,
it was something you should do,

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,770
why not make them resistant to heart
disease or the cancer? We can do that.

33
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,970
It was weird that he chose
HIV as the first test. Why
do you think they did that?

34
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,280
Um, I think because it was a very
well understood mutation that would,

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,220
if you've just destroyed the gene,
it would work.

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,130
Whereas with these other diseases,
you have to be much more precise.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,750
But the reason that we scientists got
really upset was that he did it in secrecy

38
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,640
and then just low launched it on the
world and that kind of thing because the,

39
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:30,780
it's a fine line and ethics,

40
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:34,640
you want to be doing that with
total transparency running,

41
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,010
I think he was hoping to become win a
Nobel prize or be a star and it backfired

42
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:43,770
on him because he,
he just did it in secrecy.

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,480
It backfired in the scientific
communities. Absolutely.
In the, in the real world.

44
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,990
In the media, I was shocked.
Help little discussion there was,

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,370
if this news came out in the two
thousands during the Bush era, it would,

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,400
there would have been panels,

47
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:59,830
investigations that would have been
in the news for months, but it wasn't,

48
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,664
people went,
Ahhh,

49
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,720
what's next on Twitter do you think is
just because the news cycles. So insane.

50
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,820
I do. Yeah. Um,

51
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,940
when you have a scientific
experiment of that nature,

52
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,370
what's the standard
protocol for a scientist?

53
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:19,540
Whether it is or is it the same in China
and in Russia and the United States as

54
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:24,541
a scientific community almost
operate under different,

55
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,000
like a different set of
rules and anything else?

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,230
You mean between countries?
Yes. I mean, you know,

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,120
like obviously technology is not shared.

58
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,750
Like China is doing
something technologically.

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,650
The United States is, we have to
speculate, we have to figure it out.

60
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,660
But when it comes to medical science,

61
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,850
is it sort of an open book because
everybody's sharing information? Uh, no,

62
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,110
or at least,
uh,

63
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,190
alerting everyone to what they're working
on or I know where you're going with

64
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,530
this. Um, at least I think
I do. Okay. Uh, yeah.

65
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,200
So I advised governments around the world
about what's going on under the radar

66
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,690
as best I know.
And there all countries,

67
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:08,710
I'm not going to name them that are
doing research under the radar and are

68
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,210
preventing people like myself from
entering those buildings to have a look

69
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,120
what's going on. Yeah. So I'm sure that

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,790
what's going on in there is actually a,

71
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,110
a little bit broader
than what we hear about,

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,770
but I don't know how long is it
before and I'll say Russia, no,

73
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,230
I didn't say Russia. I didn't
say anything. Uh, no country.

74
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,040
I want to be able to
travel freely. Russia. Uh,

75
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,370
but oh, I said it. But in,
in, in countries where there
are different standards,

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,270
what's stopping a mothers who wants
to prevent the child from having heart

77
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,150
disease, which could kill
their child, you know,

78
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,070
40% chance versus one in a thousand and
eventually you could make a child that

79
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,630
could live 200 years. Once we know how
to do it, that could be the future.

80
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,040
Um,

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,040
there's always a concern that someone
is doing something that is beneficial in

82
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,720
one way,
but negative in another way.

83
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,010
And if everyone doesn't get
to examine the research, um,

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,390
it's very difficult.

85
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:14,470
Like if we wanted to in the United States
wanted to do something similar to what

86
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,220
they're doing over there, we would want
to have access to what they've learned.

87
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,170
Right? Uh, we would, and so generally
scientists share information,

88
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,150
but there are companies that
are government owned that
are very secret. Right? Um,

89
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,610
and or even private organizations.

90
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,580
And that's where it's a little
tricky and that's why we,

91
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,180
we scientists get really upset when
companies or organizations don't share

92
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,014
information,

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,270
especially in something this critical
and what's not really stated. But it's,

94
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,660
my belief is that one of the reasons it
was such a backlash against this CRISPR

95
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,400
design, a baby experiment, and
it really wasn't experiment. Um,

96
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,670
it's not just that it was potentially
dangerous and you could end up with kids

97
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,720
that have deformities,
but also that unless we do this in a,

98
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,190
in a measured manner under supervision,
there's,

99
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,500
there could be a backlash like there
was against stem cell research, uh,

100
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,980
in the two thousands. We
don't want that. Again,

101
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,770
we want to be able to do this
the right way this time. Right.

102
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,770
Is it particularly if something
goes wrong with those children,

103
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,480
one person can ruin it for millions of
patients. The jump the gun and, yeah.

104
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,280
So this we're, we're on the second
generation of Crispr. Is that correct? Uh,

105
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,930
terms of, uh, the editing tools, they've
become more, they have that there's,

106
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,940
there's surprisingly that there's lot
of different bacteria that have the,

107
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,970
these systems.
So we're getting new ones all the time.

108
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:41,780
Some that are more accurate because
you don't want what we call off target

109
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,051
effect.

110
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:45,590
You don't want to accidentally me tight
some Jane that's required for head

111
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,760
development. Um, and so yeah, we're,

112
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,670
I think in my department we were on
fourth generation, fourth generation. Wow.

113
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,810
Yeah. See I'm just going by a
radio lab. Podcasts. Yeah. So my,

114
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,840
my department's a fun,
fun department today.

115
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,500
And imagine they are in painting
all sorts of stuff. What he,

116
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,970
did you ever see the documentary Icarus?
Oh yeah,

117
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:11,630
it rings a bell. It's a Brian
Fogle's documentary on, uh,

118
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,910
the Russian doping program,

119
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:18,911
state sponsored doping program and a
Sochi the Sochi Olympics and how they have

120
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:25,460
this incredibly complicated system of
stealing the urine and putting it through

121
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:28,250
a hole in the wall and putting fake
year and back through it was really,

122
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:33,230
really amazing, amazing, amazing
documentary. But uh, details,

123
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,650
this incredibly complicated
state sponsored doping system.

124
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
I would imagine that with something
like CRISPR or some various new forms of

125
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:47,900
genetic editing,

126
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,050
that that's one of the things that
they're going to be looking into,

127
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,490
that they're going to be looking into
things that are going to enhance athletic

128
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,080
performance. Yeah. I mean,

129
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,680
you might need to have a DNA test to see
if you've put one of these viruses in

130
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,670
your mind, why you 50 and now you're
running like a 20 year old, right.

131
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,650
So that's all possible, you know?
[inaudible] I also write reports for,

132
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,210
for governments and one of the things
that I predicted 15 within the next 15

133
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:18,650
years was CRISPR being used to engineer
the human genome and make a baby.

134
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,620
I didn't realize it was going
to happen within one year. Wow.

135
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,390
A lot of these technologies that I'm
trying to predict happened way faster than

136
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,070
even I think it can happen.

137
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,850
Do you think it's possibly happened in
other circumstances that they're not

138
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,820
going public with? Um, it's,
it's always possible. Um,

139
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,610
there may be some human clones running
around right now that we don't know about.

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,580
Do you think so? It's certainly
doable. Scientifically.

141
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,870
There might be some rogue nation who's
doing it, but Barbara Streisand's togs,

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,200
we're uh, we're pretty easy to clown.
Yeah. The, she had her dogs cloned, right?

143
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,330
Yeah. Yeah. Sammy, the 14 year old
dog is now, there's two of them. Um,

144
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,420
Jesus Christ, it is so weird.
That'd be like, I'd be so scared.

145
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:04,530
I go to sleep and wake up that thing.
It'd be hovering over my face was red.

146
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:09,420
Glowing eyes. Yeah. Wait till you have
design it cemetery. A friend of mine,

147
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,560
Carlos Bustamante at Stanford.

148
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,390
We're entertaining the idea of making
dogs live longer, uh, genetically.

149
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,350
So why would you want your family
member to only live 12 years?

150
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,850
I think about that man. My dog is only
two and he's such a sweetie. You know,

151
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:28,770
I'm sad that one day. I mean I had to
put my other dog down recently and uh,

152
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,230
who's 13 and he's just really,

153
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,560
there was a massive two and he was
struggling and I just think, man,

154
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,470
this two year old, one day he's going
to be in that same sort of situation.

155
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,090
Well it isn't.
And so we have three dogs.

156
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:42,450
My wife runs a therapy dog and
[inaudible] had her beloved dog.

157
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:47,310
Samantha cloned that crazy bitch.
Look at her two copies of it. One Dog,

158
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,470
Jesus Christ. That's so strange. How
about just get a new dog? You fucking nut.

159
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,240
Ah, well so we might be nuts
in my household because we're,

160
00:09:57,241 --> 00:10:01,740
we're giving our dogs and amen. Oh,
and how's it doing? How old is the dog?

161
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,630
What? The oldest dog is nine and he's
still doing fine. Does he look different?

162
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,870
My wife says, so these are anecdotes.
I'm not going to publish them, but uh,

163
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,060
so Alice has a therapy dog and he has
to go to hospitals and nursing homes.

164
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,980
And if he has any men,
according to my wife, uh,

165
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,000
he can't be a therapy dog because
he's too excited. He's running around,

166
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:25,460
jumping around really? So
that, that's anecdotal, but
that seems to fit with what,

167
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:30,000
uh, others have
experienced too. Wow. Yeah.

168
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:34,410
So what we're hoping to
have some treatments for
some pets are shortly one of

169
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:38,250
the companies that I'm working
with treatments for pets. Yeah.

170
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,080
Well you gotta thank, Hey man, dogs aren't
going to live 13 years anyway, you know?

171
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:43,831
Well,
yeah.

172
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:47,850
And also we have a dog that has a kidney
defect and the vets is only going to

173
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:51,990
live five years, so she's three now.
So that's the one, your experiment,

174
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,900
what we experiment on,
on, on all of them. But,

175
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,210
but what's the downside that's gotta
be so uncomfortable for some people

176
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:03,690
listening to this right now. Like, oh, I
don't know how to feel about that. Right.

177
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,620
What is the downside?

178
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,770
If your dog has got a kidney defect and
it's only going to probably live to be

179
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:11,730
nine, meanwhile the dog's going to
live to be a thousand years old. Well,

180
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:14,970
we'll say, I'll come back and I'll,
you know, in the Lotus position,

181
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:18,900
meditating a hundred years from now, what
do you do if it starts talking to you?

182
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,350
That'd be great. Yeah. What?

183
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:27,351
What do you do if you turn a dog into
some new kind of thing that lives 30 or 40

184
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:31,800
years? What do you do? You
tell people, like if your dog,

185
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,440
like right now you're talking about on
the podcast and a bunch of people are

186
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:37,350
probably going to remember it,
but a lot of people for yet,

187
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,840
but if like 1520 years from now,

188
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:43,560
your dog's still chasing balls and
people are going to come over your house.

189
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:47,610
Hey Dave, what the fuck's going on with
your dog man? Right. Dot. That's Charlie.

190
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,770
Yeah. How come Charlie doesn't
have gray hair anymore? Man.
