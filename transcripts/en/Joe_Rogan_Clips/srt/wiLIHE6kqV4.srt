1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,420
One of the problems with climate change
is that human beings like to react to

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:06,190
things that are immediate
and right in front of them.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,820
And I think for us it's very
difficult to see the future,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,670
especially if it's inconvenient as,

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:16,671
especially if it does
something to inconvenience or
get in the way of our day to

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,920
day routine. And that seems to be
what happened, what's happening here.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,170
And that seems to me,
excuse me,

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,850
it seems to me to be why people
are so willing to dismiss it.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,060
Uh, so flippantly because
in front of them right now,

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,810
it's not an issue in front of them
right now. This very second is very day.

11
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:38,050
I'm going to go to Starbucks. It's right
there. It's open. Look, I'm outside.

12
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,200
It's 65 degrees out. Global
warming's not a problem. Yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,130
No, I think that's, I mean, totally true.
And I feel it in my own life. Like I,

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,890
I mean I've been living, I've been
working in this material so long,

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,030
I know it so deeply and yet when I
look out the window I'm like, you know,

16
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:56,080
things are fine. Yeah. And I think that
has a really powerful anchoring effect.

17
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,350
Like we expect the world of the future
to look like the world as it does today.

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,060
But all the science says that's totally
naive and we're going to have at least

19
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,280
twice as much warming as
we've had to this point.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,430
And I think we need to think about the
future of the world in those terms.

21
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:11,740
Like what, it will be a two degrees
or three degrees at four degrees.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,260
But it's not just like the immediacy.
I think we have so many biases that may,

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,650
like we want to be optimistic about
the future. We have a status quo bias.

24
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:24,640
We don't want to change things. We think
that will be complicated and expensive.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,910
We have a hard time holding big
ideas in our head like that.

26
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:31,610
The entire planet is like
subject to these forces. Um,

27
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,960
I mean the list goes on and on in the
book I have a little riff where I say,

28
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:39,330
you know, there's this new not
so new now, 30, 40 year, um,

29
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,520
discipline in economics,
behavioral economics,

30
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:45,280
which is about all of our cognitive
biases. How we can't really see the world.

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,000
Every single one makes it harder
to see climate. There's this, um,

32
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,220
he's actually an English professor
named Timothy Morton who wrote,

33
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:55,870
who wrote a book about, um, climate
and he calls it a hyper object,

34
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:56,704
which is like,
it's a,

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,870
it's a phenomenon that's so big that we
can't actually hold it in our heads at

36
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,460
once.
We can only see it.

37
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,760
It's like if you imagine seeing a four
dimensional object in three dimensional

38
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,594
space,

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,260
it's that kind of thing where you can
only see it at an angle only partially

40
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,460
climate changes.

41
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,460
So all encompassing that we
can't comprehend it properly.

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,740
Um,
but I think that's all,

43
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:25,030
all of those things are reasons that we
need to be listening to the scientists

44
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,680
and what they're projecting.

45
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,130
Not to say that everything they're saying
is going to come true will come true.

46
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:33,730
Exactly as they predict it.
Obviously that's not how science works.

47
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:36,370
It gets revised. Some things are
alarmist and things are extreme,

48
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,090
something's just wrong.
But you know,

49
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,850
I've been really working on this stuff
for a couple of years and the number of

50
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:47,851
papers I've read that show that make me
have a more optimistic idea about the

51
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,560
future of climate.
I could count on two hands,

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,890
the number of papers I've read that make
me have a bleaker view of the future.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,000
It's in the thousands.
And when you look at the totality of that,

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,160
whether the six climate driven natural

55
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,150
disasters prediction is going to pan out
exactly as those authors say, who knows?

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,360
But when you see, you know, so many,

57
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,610
so many terrifying studies
that you could fill.

58
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,740
Like I did a 300 page book with them.

59
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,580
You realize that like there's a huge
margin for error and it would like,

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,840
we would still be really in bad
shape. You know, is there a,

61
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:20,891
I mean,

62
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,891
I'm sure there have been some studies
that made mistakes in terms of like past

63
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:30,690
studies have projected that by now
we'd all be dead. Um, are those,

64
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,910
those seem to be a problem with this
whole concept we have of wrapping our head

65
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,310
around it and if we find anything
that we could point to that say,

66
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,000
oh way back in the 80s, they said we
all be dead by now and we're fine,

67
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,660
we're going to be fine. That kind of
thing is that that is an issue. Correct?

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,010
Totally. Yeah. There was, um,

69
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,230
there was a really famous book in the
Middle Of the 20th century called the

70
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,200
population bomb. So this is a
guy named Paul Ehrlich Ehrlich,

71
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,140
who he was like,
you know,

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,500
the world just cannot
support this many people.

73
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,830
Like if we get to 8 billion people,
there just won't be enough food.

74
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,320
There won't be, you know, the,
the planet can sustain that.

75
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,970
And he's often pointed to as this sort
of like profit of dooms day that and his

76
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,120
prophecy totally didn't work out because
we had this thing that's called the

77
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,840
green revolution. Basically we figured
out ways to make crops way, way,

78
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,770
way more productive
and that's encouraging.

79
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,900
Human civilization does that a lot.

80
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,030
We figure our way out of
Fox holes all the time.

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,710
But that revolution was
literally like one dude,

82
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Norman Borlaug who figured out how to
grow crops differently and one guy,

83
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,740
one set of innovations and he completely
transformed the whole fate of the

84
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,830
planet. What did he do?
He just basically did, um,

85
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,600
like genetically modified crops before,
like the, you know, before the name,

86
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,370
it was like, um, he could golden
rice guy. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah.

87
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,930
And um,
and you know,

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,100
the whole developing world benefited
enormously and you're still seeing that

89
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:00,550
today. Like we see all these charts
that, you know, so much less poverty,

90
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,370
so much less infant mortality and
developing world and that's great.

91
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,940
That's like incredible progress.
But a lot of that has,

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,700
was powered by the industrialization
of those countries,

93
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,720
so that bill is going to
come do going forward. Um,

94
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,920
and you know, I think like when
you look at climate change,

95
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,980
you know,
if there was just one threat,

96
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,760
like let's take agriculture since we're
talking about agriculture estimates,

97
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,790
say that, um, if we continue on the path
we're on, by the end of the century,

98
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,630
grain yields would be half as
productive as they are today just by the

99
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,880
temperature effect.
So we'd have just as much land,

100
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,960
just as much grain crops as we have now,
but the food we get from it,

101
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,990
we'd only get half as much as we
get today. What's the cross of that?

102
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,370
It's just the temperature effects
plus the temperature alone. Wow.

103
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,730
I mean there are other impacts
to on food. Um, like insects,

104
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,780
there's hotter temperatures means more
insects, which is bad for crops. Um,

105
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,430
carbon has a complicated
to to crop growth,

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,430
like in some plants grow bread
or better with more carbon,

107
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,090
but actually they're like the weeds and
the ones that we like to eat don't grow

108
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:08,690
better with more carbon. Um, and
you know, by the end of the century,

109
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:11,990
so we could have half as much grain and
we could have 50% more people than we

110
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,930
have right now. Um, now there's
a way you could imagine, oh,

111
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
well maybe there'll be
another Norman Borlaug,

112
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,840
maybe he'll figure out a way through that.
But when you look across the spectrum,

113
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,790
it's like agriculture. It's, you know,
conflict for every half degree of warming,

114
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,400
you need to get between
10 and 20% more war.

115
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,840
So if we get to the end of the century,

116
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,940
we're going to have more than
twice as much wars. We have to,

117
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,200
and this is projected because of battles
over resources, mainly that famines,

118
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,810
droughts, um, whether,
you know, weather impacts,

119
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,610
basically everything about
unstable societies get
stressed by temperature eyes.

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,300
The Syrian civil war was,
you know,

121
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:48,050
it wasn't single leak caused
by climate change, but it was,

122
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,680
that's one of the causes.
There was a drought and that produced it.

123
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,470
And that conflict,

124
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,250
it's not just at the level of
nation states or even civil war,

125
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,770
it's also at the level of individual.
So if you look at crime statistics,

126
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,870
when temperatures go up, there's
more murder, there's more rape.

127
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,920
People get admitted to mental hospitals
more when there's, when it's warmer out.

128
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,030
Um, babies develop less well in
the womb when it's hotter out.

129
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,090
If there's for every day over 90
degrees that have babies in the womb,

130
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,380
you can see those days in that baby's
lifetime earnings and we're living,

131
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,410
we're going to be living on a
planet that's considerably warmer,

132
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,060
that's going to have real dramatic
effects on everything. Um, air pollution,

133
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,170
there's a big study that I write about
in the book that's totally alarming and

134
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,004
eye opening,

135
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,420
just between 1.5 degrees and two degrees
of warming just through the effects of

136
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:40,190
air pollution would cause at one
half degree of warming would cause an

137
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:43,220
additional hundred 53 million deaths,

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,590
which is 25 holocausts.
That's just air pollution,

139
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,390
just between 1.5 and two degrees.

140
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,910
And two degrees for me is
our best case scenario.

141
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:57,560
So our best case scenario is 25 holocausts
worth of death from air pollution.

142
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,520
And that sounds terrifying. People
when I say that to them, they're like,

143
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,300
Holy Shit, how could we
possibly that's unconscionable.

144
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,080
But already 9 million people are dying
every year from air pollution and we

145
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:15,710
don't pay attention to it.
So I think the likeliest outcome,

146
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,480
even as we enter into this
like climate health scape,

147
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,550
is that we find ways to turn away and
not look at like the real pain of people,

148
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,090
especially in the developing world. But
to answer your earlier question, you know,

149
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:28,460
like you can imagine
agriculture getting figured out,

150
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,560
but when you see just how many impacts
there are, it's like it's everywhere.

151
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,120
Everything will be changed.

152
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,900
And it just makes the challenge that
much bigger and more complicated because

153
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,840
how he, you know, how are you going
to solve the conflict problem?

154
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,470
How are you going to solve the problem
of having 30% less economic growth?

155
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,701
You know,
like I said,

156
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,340
that's an impact that's twice as big
as the great depression and it would be

157
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:53,190
permanent, um, $600 trillion in,

158
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,210
in climate damage as twice as much
wealth as exist in the world today. Um,

159
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,500
and that's just, you know,
then you deal with it, right?
Refugees, food. I mean it's,

160
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,850
it's, it's so all
encompassing. And I think, um,

161
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,220
that's another reason why we don't
want to look at it closely because

162
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,310
terrifying.
Well there,

163
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:14,270
there's also a matter of how it's being
projected to the public, right? Like in,

164
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:19,140
in certain circles, particularly
right wing circles. Uh,

165
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,631
there,

166
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:24,631
there are people that are trying to
paint this with rose colored glasses,

167
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,391
right?

168
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:30,391
They're trying to maximize short term
profits and sort of dismiss the risks of

169
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,270
climate change and dismiss the risks of,

170
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,080
or rather the impact of our,
uh,

171
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,870
what we've done in terms of raising
the carbon in the atmosphere.

172
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,260
There's some people that point to that
like this, this is nonsense science.

173
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:48,250
This has been disproven.
There's a few people like
that, but it's an overwhelming,

174
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:52,630
the overwhelming consensus of scientists
who study this are terrified of it.

175
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah. I would say there was some recent
report that said now past the standard of

176
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:02,160
physics that like climate science
is now more reliable than physics.

177
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,850
Um, bus hilarious. But
you know, the, um, to the,

178
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,190
to the deniers, you say
things like, you know,

179
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,150
the planet was hotter than this before.
That's true. Yeah. Dinosaurs lived here.

180
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,230
Humans, we're not here. I mean, if we're
four degrees warmer for the last time,

181
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:23,870
the plan was four degrees warmer, there
were palm trees in the Arctic. Um, what's,

182
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,170
yeah,
really,

183
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:30,171
we've already exited the entire window
of temperature that enclose all of human

184
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:31,410
history.

185
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,280
So the planet is now warmer than it
ever has been when humans were around to

186
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,750
walk on it.
Which means to me,

187
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,390
it's an open question whether humans would
have ever evolved in the first place.

188
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:43,950
And this is all from the industrial
revolution from then on. Yeah. And uh,

189
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,980
yeah, and like, and to that question,

190
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,620
it's like there are people who say
there's some natural warming going on.

191
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,860
I don't think that's true. I think
most scientists would say it isn't.

192
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,250
But I also think if what we're
seeing is natural warming,

193
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:59,490
that should terrify us even more because
it would mean that it's outside of our

194
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,324
control.

195
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,090
And if we're really heading down the path
that we're heading down and we have no

196
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:05,310
control over it,
that's even more scary.

197
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,210
It should be a comfort that we're doing
it because it means we can stop doing it

198
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:09,550
right.
