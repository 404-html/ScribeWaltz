1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
Maybe help other people being more
okay with yourself? Like what,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,910
what bothers you about yourself? Uh, I
just wish I just felt more comfortable.

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,490
Moen scan a lot of times, you
know, cause I feel like, um,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,670
I would be able to be more effective
as a person if I could just,

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,450
they kind of get, oh, not
toil in some of my own,

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,270
you know, the small self worth issues
or like lack of confidence at times.

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,030
You know, I wish I could trust
my instincts and I'm wasting,

8
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:29,580
my instincts were like better
calibrated so that I knew when I was,

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,590
what if I was doing like, okay in good
stuff. Then my insides like told me,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,170
you're, you're being okay. You
don't have to worry. You know,

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,500
there's a lot of things going
on there, right? One of them,

12
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,120
the big one is almost always
from your childhood. All,

13
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,150
most feelings of lack of worth and self
worth come from that feeling as you're

14
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,980
developing as you growing up.
Yeah.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
You feel like you're not loved or
you're not appreciated or you're,

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,410
you criticize too much. You feel like
you're a loser and really be concise,

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,850
psychologically can be very hard to shake.
And even as people get older,

18
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,130
sometimes they still, they still
claim to this thought that they're,

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,950
they're a piece of shit because there are
a piece of shit in someone's eyes when

20
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:18,060
they were eight and there were 10.
That's a real problem with people, man.

21
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,740
And that's one of the reasons why when
someone gets bullied when they're young,

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,940
it can be so devastating because it's
happening when you're in high school or

23
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,870
junior high school and it becomes
a defining moment for you. Yeah.

24
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,880
Yeah. It's to do that. I was scared. This
one kid really also bad. This one kid,

25
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,750
one of the reasons why I got
into wrestling this kid, uh,

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,400
like we had this confrontation in a locker
room and I didn't think were going to

27
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:49,290
fight. Like I was just totally bluffing.
I Dunno what, what I said or what he said.

28
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,720
I don't remember. But I do remember
him getting me in a headlock,

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,010
throwing me on the ground and then
leaning like he was gonna Punch me in the

30
00:01:56,011 --> 00:02:00,540
face. But deciding not to and I
didn't know what to do. I had no,

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,830
no martial arts skills,
no nothing. I haven't,

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,500
I'd never wrestled anybody before.
I didn't know anything.

33
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,500
So there's nothing in you
that like any reaction?

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,190
I panicked and no idea what to do
and I think and I've thought shit,

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,430
I didn't think he was going to do that.
And now here I am on my back.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,310
I'm traveling, God dammit, I
got to learn how to wrestle.

37
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,780
I got to learn some
martial arts or something.

38
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,230
So then I started taking karate and then
I started taking wrestling like right

39
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,730
after that. But I, I avoided
that kid every time I saw him.

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,770
I see him on the other side of school.

41
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:34,920
It looks even through the breezeway and
I've always knew where he was round.

42
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,754
I got to go around,

43
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,210
I want to see that guy that threw me on
the ground and could have punched me in

44
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:41,760
the face. It was almost like
more humiliating that he did,

45
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,320
could have punched me in
the face but he didn't.

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,430
But that bullying and that guy doing that.
To me,

47
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,310
that fear of like being um,

48
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,570
just helpless made me get into
martial arts. I was like, fuck this.

49
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,050
Like I got to figure out how to fight.
I don't want this to happen to me anymore.

50
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,490
Do you see as the benefit?
It was a lucky situation to like,

51
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,750
he didn't beat me up. It could've been
way worse. It was not that big a deal.

52
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,300
It was an easy school to go to.
Like my school wasn't hard,

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,490
even though there was some
criminals that were in that school,

54
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,170
like some kids get shipped into,

55
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,990
there was some bad kids and one
of them got charged with murder.

56
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,780
Like right after graduating. We
were like, whoa. Our friend Kevin,

57
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,320
we knew this dude and he killed
somebody and we're like, whoa. Oh yeah.

58
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,510
Everybody was like, whoa.
That guy killed somebody.

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,690
I think he was one year older than me.
Yeah.

60
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:32,140
He murdered somebody like right
after high school. Yeah. This kid,

61
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,680
we knew he was on the football
team. We like knew him. And then,

62
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:39,040
do you ever think he would murder
somebody? He was a tough guy.

63
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,300
He's a scary guy for sure. Like a
powerhouse of a person, like a tank.

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,390
Um, I didn't know him well though,
but I, you know, I'd say hi to him.

65
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,560
But it's one of those things where when
something like that happens to you and

66
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,540
for me, again, it was very minor,

67
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,560
just I was just scared of this guy and
he didn't do anything to me. Horrible.

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,710
Just threw me on the ground. So when don't
want you to beat your brains, I mean,

69
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,210
if somebody could hold you down like that,
I could do,

70
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,180
could a beat my face and I wouldn't have
been able to do shit. Are you grateful?

71
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,900
In a weird way that he didn't, they're
not grateful looking back for sure,

72
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,040
but it was enough. He just let me know. I
was, you know, I don't know what I said.

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,120
I made a,
said something stupid.

74
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,180
He might've said something stupid and
wanted me to back down and I didn't.

75
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,480
So he just grabbed me and threw me
on the ground. But the fact that he,

76
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,840
that he did it and could do it led me to
make one of the biggest decisions of my

77
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,160
whole life is getting
involved in martial arts.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,080
It's didn't want that feeling anymore.

79
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,680
Like if someone gives me a hard time,

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,990
I want to be the one who can
decide whether or not this
gets violent or who gets

81
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,530
hurt. I don't want to leave
that into some stranger's hands.

82
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,930
It might be a fucking psychopath. If
it's in my hands, no one's getting hurt.

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,110
We're going to be fine. Like there's
a video of Matt Serra from yesterday.

84
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,520
Matt Serra,
uh,

85
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,730
there was a drunk and altercation with
some fucking dude in a food court.

86
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,810
Matt Serra,
who is a Brazilian jujitsu black belt,

87
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,490
like at one point in time when he was
competing, he was one of the best,

88
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,280
presented it to artists in the world.
Then on top of that,

89
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,260
fun MMA knocked out George Saint Pierre
won the welterweight title and he's got

90
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:09,310
some dude on the ground and
he's just saying, calm down.

91
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,340
Calm down to guys, look, I'm gonna
fuck you up. I'm going to fuck.

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,820
But it's hilarious to watch like,
look at this look good, play good,

93
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:16,654
and play the volume.

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,120
He's like, I'm going to break your
fucking face. He's holding his wrist.

95
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,690
I love how he has a shirt on the guy's
face. He's like, calm down, calm down.

96
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,530
It's like he's putting a crying baby to
sleep and so the security guard comes

97
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,220
over and says, let him go. He goes,
okay, you're going to control them.

98
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,210
You got to control them reasonably.
You're going to control you.

99
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,980
Are you ready to control him like he's
not? He's standing up and he's fat

100
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,240
and let me tell you something mad.

101
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Sarah's one of the nicest
fucking guys on the planet earth.

102
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,500
If he has to do this to you
in a restaurant and he's
a restaurant and he's got

103
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:13,780
full mount on you, you fucked
up. You fucked up dude, but see,

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,520
you're way better off with
Matt Serra in that position.

105
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,460
Then that drunk dude on some guy
who doesn't know how to fight.

106
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,600
It could be that too.

107
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,810
That drunk dude could just be a real
mean violent person who wants a beat

108
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,100
someone up if he gets him down.

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,890
So if there's guys like you know
who aren't into that kind of,

110
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,220
so you've found getting into martial arts
are really kind of led you in like a a

111
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,420
way where you felt more calm,

112
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,870
confident in case things got into a
uncomfortable situation that you would be

113
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,120
okay. Yeah. Well look, you're always,

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,300
you're always going to be nervous
in life when something's important,

115
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,820
whether it's going on stage or
something difficult life. Do you know?

116
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,150
Difficult things make you nervous.
It's like there is an anticipation.

117
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:51,530
There's an understanding of the difficulty
of something you're about to pursue

118
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,930
and whether or not you're going to fall
short or whether or not you're going to

119
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,090
succeed.
That shit makes people nervous.

120
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,030
But the physical confrontation
nervousness is a bad one. That's a,

121
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,280
that's a like that is a paralyzing fear.

122
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,880
Fear of being bullied or feel are being
hurt and you can't do anything about it.

123
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,490
That devastates people, that puts
them in a deep, deep depression.

124
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,880
So it's really important to learn.
I think,

125
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,090
I think every young man
should learn how to fight.

126
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:19,550
I think there would be way
less fights because of it.

127
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,850
And I don't think you have to be a
mean person to learn martial arts.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,450
I think it's a skill and I think you
learn it and then once you start getting

129
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:29,180
good at it, it started actually
starts to actually becoming fun.

130
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,500
And the people who practice it with you,
you become close with you don't,

131
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,040
you don't hate the people that
you're practicing fighting with.

132
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,540
They become some of your closest friends.
Yeah. And I think it's a, just a big,

133
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,680
it's a giant confidence boost to know
that you can do something difficult and

134
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:48,680
get better at it. That's,
I think, just that alone,

135
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,730
it has massive benefits for people.
Yeah. You know, I can sense that.

136
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,590
And I remember watching a video
a couple of years ago actually,

137
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:56,840
if you like getting a belt or something,
they gave you a,

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,060
as some Dojo or I'm not sure what the
correct terminology as it might've been a

139
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,340
BGA probably watching when I got my
black belt. Yeah. Maybe that was it.

140
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:07,610
But anyway, it, yeah, like all the guys,
there was a lot of guys around it just,

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,210
and I know that cocoa does it. Joey does
it. Oh, he loves it and you love it.

142
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,040
Why don't you do it?
You're a strapping man.

143
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,750
You talked to Eddie Bravo about going to
do it one day. So he said, uh, he said,

144
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,050
yeah, he said, come down one day and
he'll, you know, get me into like,

145
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,960
one of the beginners classes I think
I need to do it would fuck yeah.

146
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,050
Giving made me feel a little bit
more, um, you know, like you said,

147
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,130
some of them are just,
uh, I don't know. Some,

148
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,000
and especially like if people get
bullied and then they don't have like a

149
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,510
brother or they don't have a friend or
they don't even have somebody to go like

150
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:39,110

And then their blooded, he'd
be like, oh, that's okay.

151
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,840
You know, like, that's, that's,
that can make, you know,

152
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:45,620
then that person gets stuck inside
themselves just feeling like, you know,

153
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,000
like they're not going to
be okay. You know, Tara.
