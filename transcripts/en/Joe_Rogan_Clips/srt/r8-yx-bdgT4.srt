1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,240
That's the biggest star ball.
And they have an idea who that person is.

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,590
Like Kevin Lee's a perfect example, right?
He bought this great guy, super smart,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,510
super tuned in, super ambitious fucking
amazing fighter and young shit. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,200
Massive, massive potential. But
people saw him on the podcast,

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:19,500
got to hear him talk for three hours
and he's super honest about everything

6
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:24,360
about and articulate, articulate, smart
and great control of his ego. He's not,

7
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,140
he's not a maniac. He's a like a
really? Yeah. Cause you get sound bytes,

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,910
you get such a different
impression of certain things,

9
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,210
especially in those interviews, man.
Those interviews, the guys like Tomi,

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,270
what going to do to your opponent?
I'm gonna fuck him.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,870
I'll be talking about why when I
rubbed off the scale and I'm like,

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,720
the energizer is like, what are you
gonna do to him? You're all aggressive,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,770
you know, playing a care, you know,

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,570
who would grow even bigger as a superstar
if they did a pocket. Your podcast.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,160
Who? Conor McGregor. Oh, you have
sat down with her while I'm just, no,

16
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:54,180
I think you would get less hate biopsy.
He has all the accolades in the world,

17
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:56,970
but, and there's the the stool
or the Dolly, all that shit,

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,640
but as a person and he sat
down and you talked to him,

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,020
you just didn't get all that Hoopla over
here and he sat down and talked to him.

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,380
Oh, I think he'd be, even when
he retires, don't get that. Why?

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,620
We almost did it before.
There was some,

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,140
some trying to figure out times
like before he became gigantic,

23
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:16,680
before the Diaz fight, before he won
the title. There was some talk about it.

24
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,190
It just, you know what man?
For better or for worse,

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,940
I don't chase anybody and I
would definitely say no, no, no.

26
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,070
I'm not saying you aren't. Oh No, but I'm
saying, I know there's some great guests.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,550
Like I know, I know there's some people
that I would really like to get on,

28
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,170
but if it doesn't happen,
it doesn't happen.

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,910
I like having you guys on as much as I
like some scientists who flies in from

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,780
France. I really do. I just like, I
like talking to people that are fun.

31
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,500
Whether it's talking to you guys are
talking to share whoever the fuck it is.

32
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,940
I would like to get Obama on one day.

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,250
I would like to talk to him
like you're getting huge.

34
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:50,160
Maybe I would like to talk to a lot of
people. And you like to get Trump on.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,750
I would talk to him. Yeah, why? Why not?
Are you going to get real answers though?

36
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,390
That's a finding as he's the president,
you know,

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,400
you'll find out if you get real cause
did you talk to mayor? Have you,

38
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:02,400
have you talked to me about when you
had Obama on not to submit a list of

39
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:06,060
questions that the, okay. The questions
and even, you know, he goes, listen,

40
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,410
it was great and I'm glad
to give him the time,

41
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,210
but that's not like a real podcast,
right?

42
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,500
There can be an agenda and I can't
know what I'm going to ask you next.

43
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,170
I come home like when we come on here,
fight campaigns,

44
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,090
there are podcasts that I have no agenda.

45
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,460
I have no idea where we're going
to talk about. They have to be,

46
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,910
they have to be concerned that you're
gonna set them up and make them look bad.

47
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,550
You know what I mean? There's so
much on the line for everything.

48
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,220
And when Obama was doing this,
Obama was a sitting president,

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,070
he was about to leave office,
you know,

50
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:35,030
and they probably had very
strict rules in terms of what,

51
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,030
what they would allow and not
allow in terms of interviews.

52
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,860
And this isn't the platform for it.
I did.

53
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,010
He think Trump doesn't
give a fuck about all that.

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,840
I guarantee you he would be more confident
and more open to just being able to

55
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,780
figure his way through it because
he wouldn't worry about, he shoots,

56
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,010
he doesn't prepare for
style. So I wouldn't worry
about me outmaneuvering him.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,600
Like he's not, he's not gonna to do. But
also, have you ever heard Trump before?

58
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,340
He was present on Stern. Yeah. There's
some of the greatest interviews.

59
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,870
He's hilarious. He was great. And,
but even, but he's also older,

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,381
you know,

61
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,650
and then also the pressure that Gig and
then the pressure of everybody hating

62
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:10,730
them. Yeah. You know,
the whole thing is fine.

63
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,320
And I'm not saying this that he's
the greatest guy in the world,

64
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,900
but I'm saying the whole thing is insane.

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,840
Nobody should be president
fucking thankless job.

66
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,290
Nobody should have that
kind of power and to,

67
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,010
it's such a dumb move to take
that Gig at 70 it seems to me,

68
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,730
it's like decision you make. You piss off
50% of the people and you make 50% cat.

69
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,220
How much time are you going to win?
How much time do you have left?

70
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,440
What do you have 20 years left?

71
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:38,860
If everyone cherry on the Sunday for a
guy like that was accomplished with his

72
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,800
ego, but also to say, hey, you have
four years to accomplish all this.

73
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,490
I foc 40 this year.
