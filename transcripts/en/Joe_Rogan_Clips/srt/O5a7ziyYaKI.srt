1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,720
But again, you know, this
isn't because the drug is bad,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:05,880
it's because people use it irresponsibly.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,880
And this is something that people
have so much difficulty understanding.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,000
We're so eager to blame drugs
for all of our problems.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,770
Drugs have never heard anyone.

6
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:18,300
They're just inanimate constellations
of carbon and hydrogen,

7
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:19,350
nitrogen and oxygen.

8
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:24,351
They don't jump out of their bags and
vials and attack your serotonin receptors

9
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,400
are dopamine transport
or anything like that.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,640
So this is just a weird pattern that
we've done repeatedly over time.

11
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:34,290
And I don't know if you read
the new Michael Pollan Book.

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:39,030
I know he was on the podcast right now.
Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it is great.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,900
But um,

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,520
one thing that I thought was interesting
about it is that he put a lot of the

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,700
emphasis on the prohibition
of psychedelics on leary
and leary almost certainly

16
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:51,900
played a role,

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,490
but I think it's slightly ironic that
he's a journalist and didn't really go

18
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,340
that deep into the role that
journalists played in all of this,

19
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,750
which was humongous.
You know,

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,900
journalists are sculptors of public
opinion and it became the standard way of

21
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,850
reporting on any of these
things to say that they're bad,

22
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:13,020
to sensationalize it and to not have any
consideration for what that would do.

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,660
Because anytime a journalist
writes him scare story,

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,550
they can really mess with
drug policy in a serious way.

25
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,990
It might seem like nothing like,
oh,

26
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:26,610
there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn
and they overdosed on some obscure

27
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:31,110
synthetic cannabinoid amb food Banika who
cares about and beef Herbenick I know.

28
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:35,010
Big Deal say that it turns people into
zombies and if it gets thrown into

29
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,560
schedule one, who cares?
Not a big deal. Well,

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,400
that's a very short sighted way of
thinking about all of this because that's

31
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,200
exactly what happened with psychedelics.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,520
And then we're not learning from the
mistakes of the past that just because

33
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:47,881
something,

34
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:52,470
it's fun to sensationalize and talk
about how dangerous it is at this moment

35
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,590
doesn't mean that 10 years from now we're
going to recognize that it has serious

36
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:59,100
therapeutic potential and we
made a big mistake outlawing it.

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,930
And I think a lot of that also comes from
this sort of us versus them mentality

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,130
that people have where it's cannabis is
good, synthetic cannabinoids are bad.

39
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,060
Well, synthetic cannabinoids don't
have to be bad for cannabis to be good.

40
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,830
Cannabis can be good without something
else being bad to counter balance it.

41
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:18,750
You don't need to hate something
to justify your love of cannabis.

42
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,430
And this whole hatred of
synthetic cannabinoids I
think is totally misdirected

43
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:27,570
because these are products of prohibition
that most people wouldn't even want to

44
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,330
use in the first place.
And when they do use them,

45
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,090
they don't know what they're taking. They
don't know what dose they're consuming.

46
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,060
And so of course they're having bad
experiences that would happen with almost

47
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,601
any drug.

48
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:41,520
Caffeine included if people just consumed
enormous unmeasured doses without

49
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,290
having any idea what
they were getting into.

50
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,760
And so they're thrown into schedule one.
What happens if 30 years from now,

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,140
once the therapeutic potential of
cannabinoids is being really seriously

52
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:52,974
explored,

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,400
we find out that that amb food Banika
that everyone was saying turned homeless

54
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:00,430
people in his zombies in Brooklyn in
2017 turns out to activate a certain

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,780
subtype of the CB one receptor that's
especially useful for Parkinson's disease

56
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,050
or something like that. Then we're
going to regret having done that.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,000
So I think people have to be very careful.

58
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,790
Anytime you say anything negative
about a drug, you have to be very,

59
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,520
very careful because the
implications can be enormous.

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,640
I think that the best stance and all
of this is to not speak ill of drugs,

61
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,680
drug the drugs have
breakthrough drug enthusiasm,

62
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,040
but it's not a problem.
Also with just what journalism is,

63
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,190
it's like asking a comedian to talk
about something but not make fun of it.

64
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,630
That's what their job in a certain sense
is to get people excited about things.

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,080
And I don't know whether you'd say the
lazy way out or the common approach is to

66
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,950
say something that scares people.
I mean that's,

67
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,900
that's what clickbait is mostly about.
Either outrage or fear. That's true,

68
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,770
but there's a lot of richness in
truth. I agree, but it's hard to sell.

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,370
It's hard to sell that rich and hard
to sell. I think the people are lazy.

70
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,130
You know, there's this idea that a
lot of people have that you know,

71
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,180
journalism is organized by some malevolent
Rupert Murdoch type puppeteer who's

72
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,720
telling everyone to.

73
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,190
You go off and you say that
cannabis causes car accidents
and you go off and you

74
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,850
say this evil thing about this
and say the alcohol is good.

75
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,510
Did you see when a Alex Jones was
on my podcast and got high with me,

76
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,510
I'm drunk and I, and when it came
up in his trial for is a divorce.

77
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,440
He said that George Soros puts a,

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,530
He tests marijuana every year to see
how much George Soros is influencing the

79
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,150
levels of THC.

80
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,810
That was his excuse.
But people love these ideas.

81
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,100
They love the ideas of the puppeteer and
malevolent puppeteer because it denies

82
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,290
individual agency.
But the reality,

83
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,230
and I say this as a journalist who's
worked at many different publications,

84
00:04:53,231 --> 00:04:56,800
not just device, and this is a
difficult reality to swallow,

85
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:00,580
is that people are free to say
whatever they want most of the times.

86
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,020
And the journalists choose to report
on things this way. That is true,

87
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,210
but it's also true that they,

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,840
like I've been a part of stories that
I've talked to the author of it and they

89
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,910
said, well, this was
manipulated by the editor,

90
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,570
the editor of manipulated the title
the chain. That's a great excuse.

91
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,670
But to the right,
and it's true,

92
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,600
like the rolling stone did an article
about me and they called me as psychedelic

93
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,870
warrior and I said to the guy who
wrote down, what the fuck is that?

94
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,840
I was laughing and he goes,
dude, I did not write that. Yeah.

95
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,200
And an editor gets a hold of it,
tries to make it more salacious.

96
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,380
It becomes something that's more,

97
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,980
it's more likely for people
to buy or click. Right.

98
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,590
Especially with headlines
that that is true.

99
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,860
And the real problem is that this sort
of outrage culture and comment culture

100
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,890
that has emerged provides
no incentive for truth.

101
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,750
Because suppose someone were to write
an article about this conversation we're

102
00:05:55,751 --> 00:06:00,170
having right now, and it
could say, Hamilton Morris
says Katam should be illegal,

103
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,160
or something like that.

104
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,250
Then that will get so much more engagement
because then you'll have all these

105
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:09,170
people saying, fuck Hamilton, he's a,
he's a trader. How dare he say that?

106
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,720
It should be illegal
that it didn't watch it,

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,700
and then you'll have other people
arguing with those people saying, well,

108
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,880
listen to the interview.
Hey,

109
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,690
he actually never said anything about
that and listen carefully to what he was

110
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,000
saying.
And then you create this whole engagement,

111
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,280
a bigger engagement for
doing the wrong thing.
