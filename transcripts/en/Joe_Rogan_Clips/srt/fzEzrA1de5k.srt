1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,820
Did do days.
If you had a beef with somebody,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,750
you didn't go on fucking social
media and talk a bunch of bullshit.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,020
You fucking walked up to the
person and you said, hey,

4
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,280
here I am and what the fuck, let's let's
deal with this. Let's talk about it,

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,450
talk it out. But now you got people
buying followers and do another.

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,330
It's just that it's,
you know,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,250
it's just the most toxic environment in
a lot of ways and it's a shame because

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:30,660
it could be used and that's
why I never post negative shit.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,360
I tried to use the platform, you know,
make lighter shit and not have a stickup.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,370
You asked this too many people that do
even the plant based Vegan thing and

11
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,870
everything's so fucking serious.
I'm like,

12
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,140
you might reach more people if you
lightened up, you know, like stripes.

13
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:49,430
Lighten up Francis, you
know? Yeah, I think so.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,560
If you say you eat me,
how

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,770
well you did write a book
called meat is for pussies.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,130
Tell you how that came about
and actually I got attacked.

17
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,740
I'm going to tell you something else you
want to talk about destroying people.

18
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,370
I got attack more by the
Vegan feminists for that book.

19
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,190
Fucking tried to destroy me.
They will everybody,

20
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:11,230
cause I wrote posts now first
of all. And then she, uh,

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
she went on a blog and call
me a massage and I said, yeah,

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,940
like massages the but you know,

23
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:21,730
call me and misogynistic scumbag and
in fucking piece of shit and all this.

24
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:26,580
So I just had, I just wrote, Hey, any of
you ladies that bought this book for the,

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,210
for the fellows and it helped them please
fucking Holler at this fucking woman

26
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,280
and tell some they shut
her fucking blog down.

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,650
And then she called me a maniac
and I said, let's call Germania.

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,880
She sent people on her the way she
sent people in. Yeah. But dig this.

29
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,900
And then I said,
we have,

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,280
we have a saying on the streets in New
York back in the day, don't start nothing.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,770
There won't be none. I said,
you know, but the thing was,

32
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:50,070
I'm going to tell you how to book title
came back cause it was a woman, actually,

33
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:54,060
Karen Renaldi from a Harper Collins wave.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,050
And what happened was, uh, I was
trained in at crunch, Aaron, uh, uh,

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Dragos Winooski is my trainer and he's
gotten me through all my fucking Iron

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,440
Mans, everything else, fucking
broken up, person injuries, all this.

37
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,680
So I'm where I was working at
crunch and training with him.

38
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,060
And then another person,

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,090
a friend of mine or the five
points guys used to be there,

40
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,460
you would see them all.
They had a ring on the second floor.

41
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,110
So this guy was doing pad work and I'm
telling him, Hey, you know, listen man,

42
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:25,470
you got a fight coming up man. Get on
the chlorophyll, get on the wheat grass,

43
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:26,400
get on,
you know,

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,300
eat as much recovery foods as you can
that's going to fight inflammation.

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,300
So some fucking Momma Luke with
fucking 1980s tiger striped pants,

46
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,200
fucking fucking, you know, he, he,

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,930
he just took everything out of
context and then he's like, yeah,

48
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,490
fucking people that don't we me a
full sees, you know, I'm like, Yo,

49
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:51,410
you got like 50 pounds on me,
but if you want to put some head gear and,

50
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:56,370
and get in the ring, I'll oblige you. He's
like, what? I said, I don't eat meat bro.

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,030
And then the funny shit with the whole
book title was it was going to be called

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,840
the grow green road to health,
fitness and longevity.

53
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,490
And my business partner, Todd
Erwin goes, mother Fucker,

54
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:13,600
who are you doctor eyes? Nobody wants
to hear that book from you, your job,

55
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:18,160
blood clot, Joseph singer from the Cro
mags, they want, and then I post it,

56
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:22,870
they will. And then I said, yeah. I
said, yeah, this motherfucker was like,

57
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,351
you know,

58
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:26,630
same fucking people that don't eat me
to push these on like motherfucker,

59
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,890
that dude ain't probably ain't seen
his dick and fucking 10 years he was

60
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,820
overweight and all this shit like that.
Motherfuckers to pussy. And he's like, Yo,

61
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:37,620
you know what? Throw it back in his face.
And I was like, I don't know man. That's,

62
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,920
you know, that's, you know, pretty
fuckable statement. He said, do it, do it.

63
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,921
So we released so right away to fucking
emails and the text of the city of the

64
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:51,950
vegans, Yo, that's how we
started. And then we, uh,

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,650
our agent Dan,
we got hooked up with this guy,

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,630
Dan from ICM. He's like, Ma, my business
partner in the Hamptons. He's like,

67
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,590
Yo, that book is fucking dope man. I think
we could get a deal. We did in a week.

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,380
He have four offers. So
you wrote it first. Yeah,

69
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,940
I wrote it first and we put it out.

70
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,150
So it was the thought process behind
widen that you just had a lot of shit in

71
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,500
your head just wanting to get out.
Yeah.

72
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:18,550
Well I studied writing under Robert McKee,
so I wrote my memoir first.

73
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,110
Interesting. Yeah. Story. I fucking that
guys like my guru for writing. I took,

74
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:27,250
I took the story seminar twice. He's
fucking amazing. I mean, Brian Cox,

75
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,410
his portrayal of him in,
in fucking,

76
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,970
in a adaptation fucking brilliant spot on.
So,

77
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,260
and you know, I, I actually became
friends with Robert. Mr. McKay. I would,

78
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,840
he smoked like crazy realize. Yeah. He
smoked cigarettes like a fucking Cim.

79
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,930
Not a writers do, man. Yeah,
but not during the class.
So when he had the breaks,

80
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:49,330
he would fucking do like two or
three cigarettes. I said, you know,

81
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:54,331
my friend has an organic green tea extract
company and the Polyphenols in that

82
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,630
is going to counteract all your
fucking smoking shit that you're doing.

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,710
So I gave him five bottles and
then every time he would come,

84
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,180
he would have his people call Yo,

85
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:07,630
you know that guy fucking Macau and get
them to bring me some more of that green

86
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:11,230
tea shit. Did he quit smoking? I
don't know. Have you seen him in,

87
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:14,140
the problem is it gives them
a charge. Some uh, you know,

88
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:18,790
a nootropic charge fires up your brain.
Yeah, it's a smoke a cigarette man.

89
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,410
I smoked like crazy. I used to smoke
Kools in lock up and shit like, you know,

90
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,640
cause that's what they give you in
Spofford. And uh, and when I went upstate,

91
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,440
it was cools,
quit.

92
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,330
I quit cause I started boxing in lockup
and they would have us run this fucking

93
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:38,590
hill called suicide hill and I would
be fucking puking. And I was like,

94
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:41,730
I gotta quit fucking smoking.
So I quit smoking. Be,

95
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,940
they used to do smoker fights in lockup.
So if you had a beef with somebody,

96
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,420
you went into this rec room was
explained smokers to people,

97
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:51,460
they don't know what
that smoker fights means.

98
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,720
You just have a beef with somebody and
you could just throw on the gloves and,

99
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:56,590
and go at it.

100
00:05:56,591 --> 00:06:01,340
And as long as it's like reasonably within
20 pounds of weight difference, like,

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,220
yeah.
You know,

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,770
although in lockup I saw
people much bigger people,

103
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,130
a fighting much smaller people in
some of them guys. I mean I would,

104
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,010
I was not good.
I got,

105
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,130
I would fight the black dudes and they
would just beat the shit out of me,

106
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:20,150
but that would just keep coming back.
You know, I'm Irish, I don't quit man.

107
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:21,920
I was and, and then, you know,

108
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:25,280
I learned more of the
sweet science and you know,

109
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,510
went into the navy and so you quit
smoking just for boxes? Yeah, I quit.

110
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,440
I quit smoking. Uh, yeah for that, for
that reason. But when I was locked up,

111
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,650
I didn't quit almost to the end because
towards the end of your sentence,

112
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:43,400
they allow you to go home because they
want to reintegrate you back with your

113
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,640
family or whatever. And I never grew up
with my mom, so they would send us home.

114
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,200
So we would take the carton in the
cigarettes and open it up very carefully,

115
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,280
open up the cellophane,

116
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:57,281
carefully slide the cellophane down and
put joints inside the cigarette pack,

117
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,290
slide it back up, glue it closed
the cart and the cigarettes.

118
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,380
And as how we would get to
weed back from the visits.

119
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,030
Cause I wasn't smoking weed coming back
out and nobody's asked. That was no,

120
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm like, no, thank
you. So that, you know,

121
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:16,190
so that was the process. And um, you
know, so that's why, that's why I quit.

122
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,600
But that's the book came,
I had a lot of shit,

123
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,910
a lot of demons inside of
me from what happened to me,
me and my two brothers, uh,

124
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,930
was,
you know,

125
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,520
pretty severely abused in all kinds of
ways in his foster home, physically,

126
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:35,300
mentally, sexually abused by
the older kids. In the home,

127
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,450
it was fucked up and I never told anybody,

128
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,000
but that was always something.

129
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,920
No matter how much I lived as a monk for
two years, or Hari Krishna Monk, nothing,

130
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,340
uh,

131
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,080
cure that fucking anger that was inside
of me that I had toward these people for

132
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:55,690
what they did to me. And the secret of
like, Yo, it's fucked up to say like, Yo,

133
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,690
you're just do from the streets.
You had knife fights were Puerto Ricans.

134
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,950
I got shot with a 22 and forest parks
on angel. Does that get us there?

135
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,150
And then to try to say, Yo, this
motherfucker Molesta me is WWE.

136
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,140
It took a lot out of me too.

137
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,770
And nobody knew it because
they never talked about it.

138
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,870
And I took my keys class and that was the
turning point because I went up to him

139
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,050
and I was writing a script at the time
based on what happened to me in the

140
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:25,740
foster home, the kids, uh, in
the screenplay we based, uh,

141
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,650
what, what happened to me, uh, in,
in my younger, uh, period of my life.

142
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,970
And, um, I never told anybody what
happened. I would just avoid that.

143
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:35,900
But then when I wrote,

144
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,030
I started writing the book and I
was taking his class and between,

145
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,600
uh, you know, parts of his
thing, when you went on a break,

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,190
you could walk up to Robert Mckean,
see, ask them questions. So I said,

147
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:54,191
Mr Makia as far as a protagonist who was
abused as a kid and he stopped me right

148
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:58,080
there and he said, listen,
stop. Right Day send McGowan.

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,120
Everybody uses it. It's a cliche,
you know, abusive children,

150
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,050
uh,

151
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,370
to develop empathy for characters we
could otherwise not give a fuck about.

152
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,600
It's not what happens to somebody,
it's what they do as a result of it.

153
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,110
And that's the fucking light came on.
And I mean,

154
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:19,500
for years I would sit there and it took
me seven years to write the evolution of

155
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:24,501
a cro magnon and I would get to that
part of the story and I will lose my shit

156
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:30,201
and break down crying like
fucking uncontrollably
because of what happened to me

157
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:31,284
and my brothers.

158
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,300
So I just skipped over that part
and I would never address it.

159
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,250
But then,
you know,

160
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:42,970
he gave me the strength in a lot of ways
to be able to say, hey man, you got it.

161
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,670
He wrote in my book so I have his
book and he wrote to me, he goes,

162
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,220
John always write the truth.

163
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,960
And that's when I knew that that needed
to come out in the book to cleanse

164
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:59,730
myself. I've been two
years on crack, uh, 88,

165
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,620
88 to 90 crack pills, you know, uh,

166
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,180
doing whatever getting shot at
with fucking Ar 15 is Robin deals.

167
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:13,560
I had a tos or now it was chaos
at a time kill on site. I was,

168
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,310
I was a fucking maniac
because I just didn't care.

169
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:21,600
I actually kind of wish subconsciously
to somebody would put a fucking bullet in

170
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:25,980
me when doing crack. A lot
of people get molested. Yeah.

171
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:30,000
They almost act out to the point where
they want someone else to do it for them

172
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:32,930
cause they don't want to. Here I was
definitely in a lot of ways that's,

173
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,750
that's what I was doing.
But when I took his,

174
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,950
when that seminar helped me so much,
cause it's really like,

175
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:45,450
he's really like a fucking a guru in
a teacher. Man. The man is amazing.

176
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:50,010
If you ever get a chance to take the
Robert McKee story seminar to three day

177
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:53,670
seminar, I took it twice, then he
does workshops, but the story seminar,

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,570
I just walked out of there after the third
day is 10 hours a day and you're just

179
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:00,210
like, you're fucking,
you're, you're like speeches.

180
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:04,280
Like what the fuck did I just
experience? It's incredible. And,

181
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,420
and that gave me, uh, the power to,

182
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:12,421
to go and tell my story the right way
and the amount of emails of people that I

183
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,810
received that will like, Yo,
that shit was done to me.

184
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,760
Thank you for having the courage to
tell the story. And um, you know,

185
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:24,760
I just kept writing after that. So
even the meat is for pussies. Uh,

186
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,530
book was, you know, if you read it,
it's tongue in cheek. I'm not calling.

187
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,800
There's a lot of dudes that eat meat
that could kick the shit out of me.

188
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,634
I'm not saying,

189
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,380
what I'm saying is if you continue to
lead a sanitary lifestyle and you eat this

190
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,930
fucked up food that's out there,
that they're putting out there,

191
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,980
that they're knowingly putting out there
to fucking poison you because they're

192
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:47,400
tied in with the pharmaceutical companies.
It's a racket. It's it. It's not,

193
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:50,590
a conspiracy has been proven
that this is what they're doing.

194
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,610
You will become a pussy dependent
on the pharmaceutical companies.
