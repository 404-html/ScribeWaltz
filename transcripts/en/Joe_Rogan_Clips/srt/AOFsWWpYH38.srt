1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,990
That's an expert over there I have to
do with it. Loves it. He gets crazy.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,460
He'll come back and tell you who's dating,

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:10,290
who they run the Twitter and all
the means of it all comes from,

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,940
they run Twitter.

5
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:15,210
Why do you like 25% of Twitter memes
and everything is coming out of black

6
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:19,530
Twitter, 25% did you do the
math? It's known fact Bro.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,180
Like Bro, I didn't pluck it out of my
ass. Okay. Um, speaking of social media,

8
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:25,620
have you seen all these purges recently?

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,980
There's a new round of it that
just happened. No. Who got purge,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,040
800 or 800 or more accounts were purged
from Facebook and Twitter and they're

11
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,980
all almost all alternative media accounts.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,960
So some of the sites are snowflakes was
one I think on Facebook there's another

13
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:46,530
one called anti media that was purged.
They're an antiwar media thing.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,000
Free thought project is another one
this and there was cop watch police.

15
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,370
The police was one of them
that was called. So basically,

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,640
and what they're saying is it's such
a bullshit argument. They said, oh,

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,630
the reason we pulled this is
because it's inauthentic behavior.

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,660
We're pulling these accounts because
there's inauthentic behavior on those

19
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:05,910
accounts. What does that mean?
I don't know. That's the point.

20
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,930
And they never clarified. So what I think
it means is, hey, these are, you know,

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,950
these are alternative media outlets
and we want to get rid of them,

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,750
so we're just gonna get rid of him.
Because Facebook,

23
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:19,080
I know met with the Israeli government
and Israel told them, hey, listen,

24
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:20,700
if you're going to be in our country,

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,260
you're going to get rid
of certain accounts.

26
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,190
And Facebook went right along and said,
sure, we'll do that. China with Google.

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,790
Right? But now I think they're doing
that in the u s now, I think there, yes.

28
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,130
I think they're working in
cahoots with the u s government.

29
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,740
And so you have all these alternative
media counselors specifically, you know,

30
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,530
antiwar, what have you anticorruption
some of these are okay,

31
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,610
and they're getting purged. No. The
argument was inauthentic behavior. Yes.

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,250
That was one of the reasons they
cited as to why they got rid of them.

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,300
Inauthentic behavior.

34
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:49,920
Does that mean that they're talking about
instances that they're misrepresenting?

35
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,330
No, I think it means more like
bots. That's how I interpreted
it. Like, Oh, you know,

36
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:58,710
you're posting it and you're directing
people to your own, you know, stuff and,

37
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,900
but I just, everybody does
that on Facebook and Twitter.

38
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,460
Is it possible that that's what
was going on? I don't know.

39
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:10,050
I'm just asking is it possible they were
using bots and perhaps directing them

40
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,300
towards revenue creating sites,

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,670
but my whole thing is why
shouldn't that be allowed? Well,

42
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm not saying that it
shouldn't be allowed,

43
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:21,600
but is it possible that they were using
stories that were taking place in the

44
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:21,961
news,

45
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,620
distorting those stories to get people
to click it on things that would have

46
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,560
links to ways that these
people can make money.

47
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:33,561
So instead of it being some sort of
political activism website that really was

48
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:39,261
just a revenue generating bullshit site
that was trying to drum up artificial

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,930
outrage. I think for some of them it's
certainly possible, but certainly not.

50
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,240
Certainly not for the free
thought project. What does
it free thought project?

51
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,420
It's,
it's another one of these,

52
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:51,930
I think they described themselves as like
an antiestablishment or anticorruption

53
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,020
um, you know thing where they cover
all these stories related to government

54
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,500
corruption,

55
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,050
kind of like a wiki leaks type thing
except they don't do the Wiki leaks,

56
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:01,060
does more of the original reporting
stuff and they'll just cover it after the

57
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:05,260
fact. And how many people Facebook deleted
them? Facebook, I think I read them.

58
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,810
I think there was an article
in the Guardian, Jamie,

59
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:12,110
if you're interested in pulling it up,
it's um, Facebook and Twitter purge. Uh,

60
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,850
you know it was 800 sites.
So when you mix it was like,

61
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,540
I think it was mostly on Facebook,

62
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,350
like 600 or so on Facebook and the
200 or so on Twitter that they did.

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,790
And a lot of them were like one of the
accounts had over 3 million people who

64
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:29,680
liked it. Now the free
thought project that, what has
their response been to this?

65
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,960
I don't know. I don't know cause
I only saw the original article.

66
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,760
I haven't seen anything after it.
You know,

67
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,100
this is a discussion that I was
having with already the other day.

68
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,190
We were taught here it is.
First they came for Alex Jones.

69
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,050
We told you you are next. We're,
oh, we were next. We were,

70
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,080
this is on their website.
Um,

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,690
but they did cover it in the Guardian
and some other outlets in case anybody is

72
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:53,490
thinking that this is bs. Yeah. Good.

73
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,040
It is a scary time because you see
that this can impact, you know,

74
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,420
really anybody who's not toeing the line,
if you will, like a police. The police.

75
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,900
Are we really gonna like do we really
think that they pulled that down?

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,430
Not for the obvious reason,

77
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:10,120
which is that you're sowing discord and
the police don't like it as part of its

78
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,690
purge. Facebook has removed the pages
of several police accountability,

79
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,880
watchdog critic groups,
including Copblock,

80
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,970
the free thought project
and police the police.

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,370
They've also apparently
severely restricted.

82
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,940
The activity for the
photography is not a crime page.

83
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,000
Huh. So you think they're getting
pressure from law enforcement?

84
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,140
I don't,
I don't know.

85
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,400
But I never usually believe in a
smoke filled backroom conspiracies,

86
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,700
but they're starting to get hard to
avoid because there's so many of these

87
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:43,270
things, man. Um, scroll down
please. Here's what we need.

88
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,060
Look at this and how does this poem,

89
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,910
and again says first they
came for Alex Jones and fours,

90
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,030
but I wasn't race baiting transfer
Spirasi cultists to claims for murdered

91
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,780
children.
Newtown.

92
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,770
Where are hoaxes and admitted in court
that I'm just an entertainer who makes

93
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,330
shit up? So I said nothing. Yeah,

94
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,490
they're just trying to be flipping
about how Alex Jones was pulled.

95
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:04,600
The problem was once you bought into the
principle of Alex Jones being polled,

96
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,400
well then what you're saying is people
who are executives at these companies can

97
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,770
willy nilly decide whoever
they want to pull down.

98
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,370
Now my answer to that has always been
we should take Twitter, Facebook,

99
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:18,610
these giant social media pages.
They can still be private companies,

100
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,430
but we should regulate them like
their public utilities. Yeah.

101
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,590
That's the argument that our Arya
and I were discussing a hundred per,

102
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,700
that's the only answer because you
need to default to free speech. Now,

103
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,730
I'm not saying if somebody is doxing
somebody or if somebody is directly

104
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,110
threatening somebody and stuff like that,

105
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,110
there should be a process set up where
you can ameliorate that and do it quickly.

106
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,010
But having said that, like
people forget man, the Acl,

107
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,890
you used to defend the KKK in clause,
so would already brought up. Yes,

108
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,420
and they said, hey, in
Skokie they said, hey listen,

109
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,490
we know we don't agree with these people.
We think they're heinous.

110
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,110
We think they're terrible,
we think they're dead wrong,

111
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,510
but they have a right to say what they're
saying because once you get rid of it

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,344
for them,

113
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,410
what people don't realize though is
that these things will always come back

114
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,290
against people who are
powerless and marginalized.
It's not like when you censor,

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,860
everybody gets together and we all go,
okay, so it's just the Nazis, right? Yes.

116
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,500
It's just the Nazis. No, first
of all, who's running these?

117
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,210
You know these organizations,

118
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:11,810
obviously they have their own opinions
and their own vested interests and their

119
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,470
own power dynamic issues and they're
going to take down whoever threatens their

120
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:15,880
power

121
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,440
now is are all these
organizations is still up on
youtube and Twitter and Google?

122
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,950
I don't know it.
To my knowledge,

123
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,620
the only one that totally got pulled
down everywhere I think was Alex Jones.

124
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,310
He still has it

125
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,143
website here.

126
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,940
It says all but proving the case that
this was a coordinated attack by the tech

127
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:34,040
giant community. Shortly after the purge
on Facebook, Twitter followers out,

128
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,740
wiping out our profiles on there as well.

129
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,350
They gave absolutely no
reason for the suspension.

130
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,880
Said we had close to the
Freethought umbrella, had
close to 6 million followers.

131
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,570
Wow. Isn't that crazy? And
they just decided overnight.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,930
What's crazy is I didn't even hear
about things. Well, that's why I'm here.

133
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,720
I appreciate it. Yeah. I mean I had
heard that it was 800 different pages,

134
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,390
but the way I had read it and I had,

135
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,170
unfortunately I don't have a lot of time
and I was flipping through something.

136
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,190
I had read that it was a lot of um,
anti-police pages.

137
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,580
Some of them were anti police, but
I think um, a lot of them were not.

138
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,910
A lot of them were antiestablishment anti
corruption like they've always had it

139
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:17,290
out for wikileaks. For
example, Wiki leaks as well.

140
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,090
I mean you've had Mike pump pale one of
the top Trump administration officials

141
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,070
because it says they're like a non
state terrorist actor. Think about that.

142
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,880
That's nuts.

143
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,590
That is because basically what they do
is what registered reporters should say,

144
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,060
hey,
here's what the bad guy,

145
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,250
here's what the people in the government
are doing and this is the stuff that

146
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,010
they're keeping secret that they shouldn't
keep secret and our government goes,

147
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,030
oh,
that's terrorism.

148
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,970
Now when Twitter or one of these people,
one of these organizations, bands,

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,650
something like the free thought project,

150
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,550
do they make any statements
or they just remove them all?

151
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,030
I saw what was on the Guardian article
and on the Guardian they said it was

152
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,180
inauthentic behavior was the reason why
they were pulling them and maybe one or

153
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,950
two other things that I'm
forgetting at the moment.

154
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,970
That is a fucking weird statement.
I know. Authentic behavior. Yeah.

155
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,670
Yeah. It's fucked up man. Cause they could
just do it to anybody. That's the point.

156
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,450
And that's what's so scary. Well that is
what's scary, right, is that there are,

157
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,140
they are private companies and these
people are allowed to post on them until

158
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:18,050
they decide they're not allowed to post
on it because they violate their terms

159
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:18,830
of service.

160
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,830
But when your terms of service are
that open ended inauthentic behavior,

161
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,600
like what the fuck does that even mean?

162
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,510
So they just,

163
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,560
they leave the terms of
service purposefully vague
so that they can get away

164
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,260
with knocking off wherever
they want to knock on.

165
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,290
It's just weird that they all agreed
that Facebook agreed and Twitter agreed.

166
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,290
Like what would be the incentive
of Twitter to follow suit?

167
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,620
Will it be the incentive
space back room I but what,

168
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,600
what do you think is given to,
if he had a speculate. Okay.

169
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,800
What do you think would be given to them
that would give them the incentive to

170
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:52,060
want to pull a site?

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,010
That's what I like that Jack Dorsey
guys seems pretty progressive.

172
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,000
I think they are meeting
just like what we said,

173
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:02,460
we know they did this with Israel where
they pulled down pro Palestinian human

174
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:05,820
rights pages to allow Facebook
to function in their country.

175
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,970
They said you have to do x, y, and Z.
I think that there are meetings with,

176
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,630
I don't know exactly who
it is. Our intelligence
agencies, law enforcement, FBI,

177
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,290
I don't know.
Somebody like that.

178
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,300
Maybe Ceos of various corporations
where they say, hey man, listen,

179
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,520
the these people are problem.
These people are problem.

180
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:23,250
These people are a problem.
Let's do the right thing here.

181
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,790
I would like to hear a contrary argument.
Well, I would like to know Emilia,

182
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,860
I would like to know like what is the,
what is the contrary argument?

183
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,290
Is there anything that we're missing?
If we want,

184
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,250
we could try to find the guardian article
and read what they said, what Twitter,

185
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,620
what Twitter and Facebook says,
see if you could find that.

186
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,080
You know the Guardian article. It's not
coming up. Pulled it off the Internet.

187
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:48,270
Guardian. What did, what was the headline?

188
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:51,720
I searched it and went on news and like
there was no articles from the Guardian.

189
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,020
By the way, the only two,
the only two things I found,

190
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,770
the only two things I founded on our
t and the Guardian and nothing else.

191
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:01,650
Which is why you didn't hear about it
because mainstream media didn't talk about

192
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,240
it. Because guess what? These outlets,

193
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:08,160
oftentimes our competition in
mainstream media, what the fuck man

194
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,723
that is.

195
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,850
So the Alex Jones thing is really like
a test run almost pretty much searching

196
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,470
on their website,
on the Guardian website.

197
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,690
We thought project it's
using Google to do it.

198
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,720
And the top article is something of for
for about food and 2013 well when we get

199
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,870
off here, I'll do a search and we could
see if we could find the statement. Yeah.

200
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,930
But when we get on fairs not helping
all those people that use us right now,

201
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,270
they saw from the free thought project,
I'll find it.

202
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,760
They saw the article from the free
thought project and that says the same

203
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:39,181
information.

204
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,820
We just don't have the exact statement
from Twitter and Facebook on it.

205
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,780
That's the only thing I see.

206
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:47,080
If you can just Google statement
from Twitter readout was involved.

207
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,510
The free thought that
wasn't in the article,

208
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,190
they just threw it in the
middle of the article.

209
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,270
It said it was like Facebook and
Twitter purges, uh, accounts for,

210
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,430
I don't know if it's at an
authentic behavior in the title,

211
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:57,510
but it was in the article somewhere.

212
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,920
So you really think that there's some
sort of smokey back room deals where they

213
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,980
say, listen to you, you guys
are making tons of money.

214
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,350
We've got a bit of an issue here.
Let's work through this.

215
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,530
This is what we want removed. These
people are causing us a bunch of problems.

216
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,760
I don't know, but I, I do
know they did that in Israel.

217
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:18,060
I do know they do that in all these
countries where the governments say, hey,

218
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,640
in order to function here, you
have to do x, y, and Z. Right.

219
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,750
So why wouldn't they do that in the u
s hmm. That's what I would say to that.

220
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
But what groups would want
the free thought project or
police the police removed?

221
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,300
Well, you got to remember a lot of these.
So the police accountability groups,

222
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,720
I mean it's pretty easy. Law Enforcement
Wa would want them removed, right?

223
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,790
But do you think law enforcement has to
kind of pull to go to Twitter and snap,

224
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,090
hey, not like the, you know, whatever
the police department in Toledo,

225
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,920
but if the FBI may be sure,

226
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,040
or the CIA or you know, whoever major
law enforcement, general law enforcement,

227
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,830
the thing that people kept going to with
Alex Jones was Sandy Hook, Sandy Hook.

228
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,160
He said

229
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,270
children didn't get killed.

230
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,750
You don't have to defend Alex Jones on
the merits of that point because he's

231
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,890
dead wrong.
On that point,

232
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:03,430
when you're descending is the principle
of letting somebody speak. I understand.

233
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,750
Yeah.
That's not what I'm saying.

234
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,890
What I'm saying is there's no thing
that they're going to on this.

235
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,880
So it's like there's already
been a precedent set that
could just remove people.

236
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,140
So they remove him and they got this
really clear here. It got sloppier. Yeah.

237
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,640
Well it got more clan to
Stein because there's no,

238
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,860
there's no big smoking gun,
there's no nothing.

239
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:28,630
It's just all of a sudden they're
yanked. Yup, that's right. And again,

240
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,780
no major mainstream media outlet
in the U S reported on it.

241
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,620
Our T is Russia today. Jamie's
guts on the exact article. Okay.

242
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,800
This is of all media by Facebook is
pushing back just to beginning censorship

243
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,820
insight. They may cite the Guardian
article in this article. I was looking,

244
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:50,140
I'm like, okay. They didn't worry about,
because I saw this article that came out.

245
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,940
It's US pushing back today from
today. This is from today. Today.

246
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,390
Okay.

247
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,270
I saw a different our tea article on
the same it down and make that a little

248
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,104
bigger please.

249
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,480
Hmm.

250
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,020
So that it's so people are starting
to catch on to it. Scroll left.

251
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,770
So we could see, there we go. Um,

252
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,420
the latest and appearance of an apparent
sense of ship of political speech

253
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,710
online us based tech giants this month
shutdown hundreds of user accounts,

254
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,100
some belonged to wells to abas
alternative media outlets with hundreds of

255
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,090
thousands of followers like
the free thought project
or anti media senior fellow

256
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,590
at German Marshall Fund,

257
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,160
a leading think tank advocating you as
global supremacy seems to have at least

258
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:33,400
partially taking credit for
this. It says in quotes, Russia,

259
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:37,750
China and other foreign states take
advantage of our open political system,

260
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,250
Jamie fly set.

261
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,080
They can invent stories that got repeated
and spread through different sites.

262
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,010
So we are just starting to
push back just this last week,

263
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:51,760
Facebook be can't began
starting to take down sites.

264
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,670
So this is just the beginning.
Okay.

265
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:59,671
So what they're saying is that these
websites have been infiltrated by people

266
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,120
from China and Russia, is that what
they're saying? But scroll back up again,

267
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:06,700
please
stop.

268
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,600
It said China and other foreign states
take advantage of our open political

269
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,210
system, Russia, China and
other forums. And so that is,

270
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,930
that is somebody from the German
Marshall Fund a leading think tank,

271
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,810
advocating US interests
saying that because we're so
scared of Russia, Russian,

272
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,550
Chinese, Russian and Chinese infiltration.
That's why we got to pull down.

273
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,570
So in other words, they're saying, hey,

274
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:28,090
maybe these accounts like the free
thought project are run by people who are

275
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:29,440
trying to destroy America.

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,520
So we have to pull them down exactly
beyond a preposterous argument.

277
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:36,100
This is what they're saying.
They're saying they can invent stories,

278
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,570
they get repeated in spread
through different sites.

279
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,440
So we're just starting to
push back just this last week,

280
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:44,650
Facebook again started take down to
this just the beginning. So they're,

281
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:49,651
they're blaming the influence of Russia
and China and that they're saying that

282
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:54,050
this is their excuse for taking down
these pages because these pages are being

283
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:58,220
compromised by foreign agents. It's the
oldest trick in the book to say, Oh,

284
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:01,400
these foreign entities or sowing
discord in the United States.

285
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,460
So therefore we're not going to allow
this dialogue to happen. In fact,

286
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:08,780
I remember they blamed Russia for black
lives matter Facebook pages during the

287
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:09,740
2016 election.

288
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,890
But what's fucked up about this is
there's not even any smoking gun.

289
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,610
There's not only is there no evidence,
they just say it, right? They're not,

290
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,360
but they're not even pointing to a
specific example. Yeah, that's right.

291
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,970
Any example, yes, you're correct.

292
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,830
Scroll down and see if there's
anything in this that makes any sense.

293
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,050
According to the account fly complained
that any person with an email could set

294
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,650
up an account on social media and
potentially reach a wide audience.

295
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,990
He predicted a long global
struggle to fix the situation.

296
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,080
Jesus Christ. Oh, great.

297
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,190
He started his career as a u s political
circles as an advisor to George W.

298
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,670
Bush administration also always
trust those people. Right.

299
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Also a foreign policy and national
security consultant for the Senator Marco

300
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,650
Rubio. Yeah. These are the geniuses who
should regulate the Internet. Right?

301
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,850
These guys who've been wrong
about everything reliably.
Well, this is the thing.

302
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:08,570
If you could just say, oh, the
Russians have influenced this.

303
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,470
The Russians are a part of this.
The Chinese. Okay, pull it.

304
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,610
It's hacky and it's partisan and it
actually works on for on the left and the

305
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:16,791
right.

306
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:21,020
Sometimes it works on Corporate Democrats
and people who want to blame Hillary's

307
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,540
election loss on the Russians and
it works on you. That play that.

308
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:28,420
Let's hear him talk because
here we are, a little bit of it.

309
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,720
Can I jump? Go to the bathroom
real quick. I'll be right back.

310
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,161
Principles,

311
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,540
values as one of our greatest strengths
and therefore one of the best ways to

312
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,560
weaken us.

313
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,430
So I think that that's one of the key
things to understand here is Putin is

314
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:47,350
acting actually out of weakness.

315
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,630
And why have we Jamie
not come to understand,

316
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:54,580
or at least the consciousness in this
country does not necessarily view Putin

317
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,540
aligned with other strong men figures.

318
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,210
This has been a long running
problem in American foreign policy.

319
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:04,570
This is not just a problem that
started with President Donald Trump.

320
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,110
I served in the Bush administration.
President George W.

321
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,910
Bush tried to form a relationship with
Vladimir Putin to get certain things to

322
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,190
advance US national security. President
Obama tried the same thing with his,

323
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:20,020
his reset of Russian,
uh, US Russian relations.

324
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,490
So it's not unusual that you have
in administration that maybe doesn't

325
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,770
necessarily view Russia as the
threat that it is. Um, I think the,

326
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,420
the politics of this,
the public opinion right now,

327
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:35,230
it's very interesting because
you've actually seen a
shift over the last several

328
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,590
years. More Democrats
now actually I think, uh,

329
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,810
actually view Russia and
Putin as a threat, uh,

330
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,790
compared to where they were still here.
But

331
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,100
boy, this gives you, it just
leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

332
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:53,670
Is it idea that these people are just
deciding to remove pages and there

333
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,300
going on television giving
these interviews saying
that it's because of Russia

334
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,980
and Putin without any evidence.

335
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,930
Okay.

336
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,720
Oh, that's so creepy. They
didn't share the evidence.

337
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,700
Why you got to say something
man? I mean, if you want,

338
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,230
if you believe in a free society and
you believe in freedom of speech and

339
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:17,580
freedom of expression and you
censorship censor people or shit bro,

340
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:21,420
what's going on here? I'll fix it. I would
only go with that and maybe that, um,

341
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,470
what happened? Nothing. So
they don't have a fix for the,

342
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,770
for the way that it's happening. So
if you show the evidence, then you're,

343
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,390
you're literally like
showing the criminals how to,

344
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,540
how to do this and it could just run,

345
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,740
run more rampant and they
got to plug more holes. Well,

346
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:38,040
that would be the devil's
advocate position, but you,

347
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,560
in order to take people down,

348
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,760
the thing is if they're doing
it and no one's pushing back,

349
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,650
you're just going to be able to do it
with anybody that disagrees with you or

350
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:52,010
anybody that is going to be an impediment
to your political campaign or anyone's

351
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:56,300
getting the way of anything you're
trying to push through. And this is,

352
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,780
this is a giant issue with people
that have that kind of power that can

353
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:04,070
influence Facebook or Twitter. And if
that's the case, and look, we don't know,

354
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,370
we haven't talked to Zuckerberg,
we haven't talked to Jack Dorsey.

355
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:08,210
We don't know who's,

356
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,720
who's pulling strings or who's asking
them to do things or what evidence they

357
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:15,590
presented to them. But that's just very
uncomfortable. It's very uncomfortable.

358
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:19,880
See that guy talking and bringing up
Russia and Putin because people bring them

359
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:21,590
up like they're the boogie man,
you know,

360
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,700
this is what's sort of the
Russian Putin. They're, they're,

361
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,460
they're interfering with our democracy,

362
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:28,210
interfering with our issues
here in America and they want,

363
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,030
they want to ruin democracy and it
bring our country down from the inside.

364
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,760
Yeah. It was like, um,

365
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,620
the Internet went through a phase of
like it just totally free and open wild,

366
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:39,720
wild west type thing.
And uh,

367
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,410
now it looks like they're trying
to reel it back in and it's like,

368
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,320
that's the viewed as the public square.

369
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,340
It's supposed to be that
these social media outlets,

370
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:51,120
which are so gigantic and so powerful
that this is now the public square.

371
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:53,700
So to be able to censor people in these,

372
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,620
in these forums should be considered
unconstitutional, coordinated,

373
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,920
inauthentic behavior. Oh, you found
it, you found the article and spamming.

374
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,963
Hmm.

375
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,340
But again, the like the websites
that they actually pulled down,

376
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,580
that totally destroys their argument.

377
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:13,470
Even if you buy into the
premise that these are,

378
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,100
this is a good reason to pull somebody
down. I mean some of the people that the,

379
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,890
the pages they pulled down were so well
established and there are of course not

380
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,090
inauthentic in any way.

381
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,880
It's people who are running these pages
that really deeply care about these

382
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,830
issues and want to get
this news out to people.

383
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,983
Fuck,

384
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,510
this is a good quote here.

385
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:38,430
Drawing the line between
real and inauthentic views
as a difficult enterprise

386
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:42,330
that could put everything from impartial
political parody did genuine but

387
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:44,220
outlandish views on the chopping block

388
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,310
and by the way through, there are
politicians in the u s this happened

389
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:53,110
during the debate between Ted Cruz and
Beta O'rourke all at the exact same time

390
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,420
with the exact same hashtags.

391
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,510
There were pro ted Cruz
things tweeted out at once.

392
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,110
So at that is there are bots that they
bought to help Ted Cruz win the election.

393
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,460
That's election interference.

394
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,820
That's inauthentic behavior and nobody
is talking about pulling down those

395
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:10,240
accounts. Look at it says here in a
statement post to online newsroom.

396
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,170
Facebook says it,

397
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:15,160
purge those pages because they're
owners were using fake accounts,

398
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,930
sharing the same content between multiple
pages and linking to add supported

399
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,270
websites.
It calls ad farms.

400
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,500
So what that doesn't even,
is that even a controversial,

401
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,270
but this is where it
gets interesting it says,

402
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,570
but what the social network calls spam
the owners of these pages call standard

403
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:38,680
procedures for operating on
Facebook. Yeah. That was like,

404
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,360
I don't even think if the argument from
Facebook is correct that that really is

405
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,430
a reason to pull them down.
We could, it says here,

406
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:49,750
nearly all the page owners contacted by
the Guardian say they use backup or fake

407
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,720
accounts. Hmm. Along with their real ones.

408
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,200
They do it in part to protect themselves
from being targeted by political

409
00:21:56,201 --> 00:22:00,850
opponents and having their real
accounts end up in Facebook jail,

410
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,900
reverb, press, a left leaning news site
whose Facebook page disappear yesterday.

411
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,490
So this is on the left and the right.

412
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,950
They're censoring people because
you've got snowflakes on the right.

413
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,680
There's another one right wing news that
was pulled down. Stop scrolling please.

414
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,270
But, but look at this. This
is really interesting there.

415
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,400
So they're admitting to
disingenuous behavior though
they're using fake accounts

416
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,050
to protect themselves from being targeted
by political opponents. Well it's so,

417
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,690
but that's if that's the case,

418
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,620
they are violating Facebook policy.
So I've seen this on Twitter.

419
00:22:32,621 --> 00:22:35,170
I know people who have gotten
their accounts banned on Twitter,

420
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,900
but they create a new account and they
stay on Twitter and that's technically a

421
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,100
violation of terms of service.

422
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,940
But it also is something that I don't
think is egregious at all. Right.

423
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:45,700
But there's a big difference between
someone getting banned and then starting a

424
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:48,430
fake a second account.
This is not that they're,

425
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:52,990
they're using multiple accounts at the
same time in, some of them are fake. Look,

426
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:55,540
I'm not,
I'm not justifying their being banned,

427
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,260
but I am saying that they violated
certain procedures and they did.

428
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:04,261
So in order to public publicize their
ideas and they did it to try to make their

429
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:10,600
ideas more, just more project
them more have, have more,

430
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,520
more bandwidth.
But according to Facebook,

431
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:15,550
should you not be allowed to have like
three or four accounts where you tweet

432
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:19,000
the same stuff or post the same stuff?
Because it seems likes book said though,

433
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,370
what Facebook said.
If just scroll back up to the beginning,

434
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,630
scroll back up at the beginning please.
At the top, the top, the top, top,

435
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,710
see what it says. A coordinated,
inauthentic behavior and spamming.

436
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:34,120
So they were spamming. And that does sound
like coordinated inauthentic behavior.

437
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:39,121
If they have a bunch of alternative fake
sites and fake pages that they're using

438
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:44,590
to spread their stuff. Look,
I'm not saying that they
should have been. This is,

439
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,740
I think better would be to
say, hey, you can't do that.

440
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,770
You've got to remove these fake pages
that are publicizing your ideas and just

441
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:58,660
have your real authentic page. But what
they're saying is that they're, they're,

442
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:03,670
they're leaking to add farms and that
they use this to publicize their pages and

443
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:10,220
that everybody does it. Everybody
does it. You're not supposed to do it.

444
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,020
So why wouldn't they pulled out?

445
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,660
So let's say the free thought project
have three or four other things where they

446
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,400
were posting the same stuff
under a different name.

447
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,960
Why would you not pull down the three
or four other things and leave up to fit

448
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,731
the free thought project?

449
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:23,090
I think they're saying cause
the Freethought project
violated their terms of

450
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,910
service. You're not supposed to do that.
And they don't want them to do that.

451
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,650
I don't know. See, here's the thing.

452
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,280
Would they have pulled the free thought
project down if they hadn't engaged in

453
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,560
any of these forbidden behaviors?
Uh,

454
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,660
my opinion is I think yes, maybe
that's what I think. Maybe,

455
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,690
but that is gross. You're not supposed
to do that. And I'm not saying that they,

456
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,010
they should be polled,
they shouldn't be pulled,

457
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,360
but maybe they thought this is what
they have to do to get the word out.

458
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,200
And maybe Facebook is like, hey, you
fucked, you're spamming and you're,

459
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,260
you're linking to these ad farms and
these ad farms have been known to,

460
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,650
you know, be influenced by Russia and
China and all these other organizations.

461
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,900
You're doing it just
to promote your sites.

462
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,990
But we're saying that we can't
allow that kind of behavior.

463
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,830
It just strikes me as very strange that
when you have examples like the one I

464
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:16,250
just gave where maturing in the
Ted Cruz Beta O'rourke debate,

465
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,830
they all tweeted the same
thing at the same time.

466
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:21,140
It was obviously paid for by
some right wing think tank.

467
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,480
You never hear the story
of something like that.

468
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,050
If it's benefiting us
politician or something like
when Mitt Romney bought like

469
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,450
a million fake followers on
Twitter and a 2012 election,

470
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,900
you never hear about like, okay, we
targeted that. It's always like, oh,

471
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:35,630
it just happens to be these independent
alternative media outlets that are

472
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:38,990
spreading information that the government
doesn't want people to know. Well,

473
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:43,070
it could be that these people are
saying, hey look, everybody does this.

474
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,000
We're going to do this, and
they're saying, we don't like
them there. Oh, and look,

475
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,770
we caught them doing something we, we
don't allow. Yeah, let's sweep them.

476
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,090
But that's possible.

477
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,290
But is it possible that they wouldn't
have been removed if they hadn't done this

478
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:00,800
shit than not supposed to do? It's
possible, but I don't think it's likely.

479
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,040
I don't know them because
here's the thing. Look,

480
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:08,180
if it's only people who've engaged
in these forbidden behaviors

481
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,560
that get removed,
then Facebook has a very good argument.

482
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,210
But if Facebook is saying this,

483
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:18,650
but then people removed who are straight
above board doing everything the right

484
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:22,520
way, just have their own
page posted information on
their own page and they were

485
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:26,210
never removed. But these are all
political and alternative media,

486
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,480
which is interesting. So
there were targeted, yes. All
right, so they're targeted,

487
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:33,260
but in the targeting them they found a
bunch of shit that you're not supposed to

488
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:38,090
do and that's what got them removed.
I think that there is a good argument,

489
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,770
uh,
that Facebook could make,

490
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,590
which is very much a nuance
troll terms of service argument.

491
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:46,740
But I think it's more of a veneer or
facade than the real heart of why they did

492
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,830
what they did. But again, that's just my
opinion. I'm not stating that as a fact.

493
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,040
I agree with you. I mean, surely
what they should have done,

494
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:57,960
especially given the popularity of
these sites, is warn them and say, Hey,

495
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:03,030
you've got to stop doing this because if
you don't, we are going to remove you.

496
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,980
You are violating our terms of service.

497
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:09,570
You are linking to add farms and you
have posted from multiple fake accounts

498
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,980
stopped doing that. Just use your one
authentic account. We support free speech.

499
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,160
That's what we would both like.
Right? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I mean,

500
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:19,650
it could be also that they feel
like the right wing sites do this.

501
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:20,670
We have to do this too.

502
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,560
This is how people do it in 2018 is how
you really get the word out. That true.

503
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah. You know, I just,

504
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,050
I've found it interesting that it was
all alternative media and political

505
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:32,350
accounts and restore left.

506
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,090
It was just the main thing that seemed
to be the connecting tissue through it

507
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:39,510
all was relatively
antiestablishment. Right. All right.
