1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,600
Now there's no public support
for lobbyists, right? There's no,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,360
there's no people out there that are
super psyched that lobbyists are out there

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,450
and exerting their influence on our world.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,840
But they obviously have enormous financial
backing behind them and they have

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,570
incredible influence in our,
in our culture.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,990
But if you had some magic wand that you
could wave across this system and fix

7
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:30,810
it, wouldn't removing lobbyists the one
of the first things that you would do?

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,490
No. No. Why? Why so? Well,
because look, you know, Congress,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,170
especially in the current government
legislates on a whole bunch of issues that

10
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,970
they don't have a clue about,
right?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,380
They don't know squat diddly about
99% of what they're legislating mouth.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,140
They need information.
Um,

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,730
one of the other things Gingrich did
was to completely may C8 Congress's own

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,260
information service.

15
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:58,260
They used to have a really powerful
information service that help congressmen

16
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:00,210
figure things out.
All of that basically gone.

17
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,730
So they rely on outsiders to come in and
help them understand it. Now, my view is,

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,601
you know,

19
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:11,190
that's an imperfect system because there's
great inequality among the quality of

20
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,024
lobbyists.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,130
But if all lobbyists were doing was
providing information like, congressman,

22
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,650
here's what's going to happen.
If you pass this bill,

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,770
like these jobs will disappear or this
lead will reappear in the water system if

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,190
that's all they were doing.
That's a really valuable thing.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,460
Information to the Congress to help
congress decide but to do is an essential

26
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,810
part of making democracy work.

27
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,170
The part of lobbying that
is the corrupting part where
they become the mockers

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,070
for the money. Not so much that
they give it directly, but you know,

29
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,320
they call their clients and they say,

30
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:50,190
you need everybody at the c level in
your corporation to send $2,700 to this

31
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,560
person,
and they steer it like that.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
When they become the kind of source
of a resource for members of Congress,

33
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:02,110
that's when they have this influence,
which is not related to their argument.

34
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:06,330
So you know, I've met lobbyists who,
who hate the system as it is right now.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
They'll say things like,
look,

36
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:12,750
I want a system where I win because my
ideas are good. My arguments are better.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,440
I don't want a system where I win because
I'm able to channel more money than

38
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,830
that guy. Cause that's not a
democracy like a democracy should be.

39
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:24,270
These representatives are listening to
us and then they do the right thing based

40
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,070
on what they think helps
their constituents,

41
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,130
not how much they're going to
raise if they do this over that.
