1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,850
Sushi gear for less.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,800
Are there more or less of them
than people that are in cults?

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,280
Uh,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,210
there are vastly more paying attention
then people in cults. Yeah. Well,

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,793
yeah,

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,920
that's way off cause I think there's
like a billion Catholics. Well,

7
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:26,510
if you're going to call Catholicism,
I grew up in it. Okay. 100%.

8
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,100
It's just a cult with a billion people.

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:32,930
Whenever you got a guy who dresses like
a wizard and sitting on a golden throne,

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,680
oh boy.
We're talking about me.

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,920
But that is why this is a problem,

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:44,190
is that there's many people that live
their lives by these ridiculous ideologies

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,870
that are illogical.

14
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,950
Okay.
So I'm gonna,

15
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:53,790
I'm gonna Challenge you on this tech them
from predators and Facebook likes. I,

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,100
I'm going to challenge you on that.
Please do. Catholicism is not a cult.

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,790
What is the difference between a
cult? Here's, I had a bit from my act.

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,230
Let me just,
uh,

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,380
call his bullshit and it's created by one
person and he knows it's bullshit in a

20
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:09,550
religion.
That guy's dead.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,063
Okay,

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,220
so let me, this is, boy, this is
rough territory, but for you. Okay,

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,560
let's say for me, this is
everyday say, yeah. All right. Uh,

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,850
let's say Moses comes down the mountain
with the tablets. Oh, that dude. Okay.

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,910
I don't know if Moses did come
down the mountain with the tablets.

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,410
Don't think he did. Let's say
you did. Okay. Um, did he,

27
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,380
did he know he was bullshitting
people? Well, do you know

28
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,370
religious scholars actually
believe in Jerusalem? Actually,

29
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:36,430
believe that was all about now the whole
burning Bush tell me they believe in,

30
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,450
there's the acacia butch,

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,160
which is rich and DMT and they think
the metaphor of the burning Bush was

32
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:46,900
actually a psychedelic experience and
that Moses during this psychedelic DMT

33
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:50,350
experience came back from
the other dimension that
you go into when you go into

34
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:53,470
the DMT trance with all this.

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,960
Yeah,

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,070
really standard.

37
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,400
The standard messages that I have
myself have gotten from the psychedelic

38
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:03,430
experiences that you have to treat each
other as if we're all one and that are a

39
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,010
separations are all illusions.

40
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:10,011
That you are literally living a life
that if I was born in your body and a had

41
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,130
your genetics,
I would be you and you would be me.

42
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,670
Cause we are all the same
and our differences are
really what the illusion is

43
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,440
when we were these temporary beings.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,400
And that negative thinking and negative
feelings and all these things manifest

45
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,040
themselves in the negative
actions and negative thoughts.

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,100
And you can change that and you can
change the frequency in which you exist in

47
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:29,934
this world.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,740
Like this is essentially what the 3000
year old version of Moses or more than

49
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,980
that Moses has tablets were that they were

50
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,240
the god was the burning
Bush. Perfect. Perfect.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,780
Let me ask you a question. You've done
some holistic hallucinogens. Oh yeah.

52
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,620
And you've had some insight and that
insight has something to do with treating

53
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,530
people. Yes, it definitely
did. Okay. Was it true?

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,530
Well it definitely has benefited me.
True or false? I, if you asked me,

55
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
is it true that you have had a positive
experiences from psychedelic drugs where

56
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:07,900
you have interpreted those
experiences and improve your life?

57
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,030
Yes, that's true. Okay.

58
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,320
So if you now go and you convey that
thing to somebody who hasn't had the

59
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:15,390
experience themselves,

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,890
is it bullshit?
Well,

61
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:20,280
here's the thing about psychedelics as
opposed to all the other ideologies is

62
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:23,790
that they're very repeatable. You don't
have to believe in DMT. If you smoke it,

63
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,860
you're going to experience it with yeah.

64
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,880
Believe in it or not. Right. And
actually I think this was, I mean,

65
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,360
I am a cautious fan.

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,180
I say cautious because I don't think,

67
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,470
I'm not a fan of the idea that these
substances should be used recreationally.

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,940
I think that's a mistake.
I agree with you.

69
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,850
I think it's fine to have a great time,

70
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,560
but that these things are so powerful
that one should be deliberate about it.

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,600
And you know,
don't do it with a TV.

72
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,980
I like about doing it recreationally
as it's gonna get more people to do it.

73
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,070
And that if you think it's
recreational and then you do it,

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,850
there's going to be a certain percentage
of those people that go. What was that?

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,170
That's not what I thought it was.

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,090
I thought it was going in
there and have a good time.

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,890
And I just communicated with God.

78
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,460
Yep. Um, air quotes. God. Yeah.
Air quotes. Well, but air quotes,

79
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:15,140
God is marvelous because air
quotes God is the real deal. Yeah.

80
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,130
Right. In other words, it's not a
dude on a cloud. It's something, uh,

81
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,500
it is a metaphor for something lodged
very deep in the mind where you can't find

82
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:25,311
it directly.

83
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:29,570
And this is a hack that many cultures
have used to access that layer.

84
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,070
And it's all very familiar to us.

85
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:35,030
And when you talk to people that
have studied DMT in particular,

86
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:37,820
one of the reasons we think
it's so familiar to us when you,

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,050
when you have this experience,

88
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:42,140
one of the first things that happens is
you feel like you've been there before

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,090
and they believe that this is because
during rem sleep your brain produces DMT.

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,160
Yup.
It's very difficult to monitor.

91
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:53,210
But they have been able to through the
Cottonwood Research Foundation, uh,

92
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,990
which all started from the work of Doctor
Rick Strassman out of the University

93
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,870
of New Mexico who wrote a book called Dmt,
the spirit molecule,

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,980
which was one of the very
first times with a DEA,

95
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:08,300
allowed them to do clinical
studies on people with intravenous

96
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:11,420
dimethyltryptamine,
which is like fucking serious shit.

97
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,370
So instead of like this 10 to 15 minute
trip, you're gone for a long time,

98
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:21,371
half hour plus and deep deep experiences
that a lot of these people mirrored.

99
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,420
They all, they, they, they had
like super similar experiences.

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,790
But through the Cottonwood
Research Foundation,

101
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:33,200
they've found that live rats are
producing DMT in their pineal gland.

102
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,280
This has been proven now, which it
was really just speculation. It was,

103
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,460
there was anecdotal evidence,
but now they know that rats produced this.

104
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,700
So they don't know exactly when people
do it cause they would have to do the

105
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:44,301
same thing they do.

106
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:47,450
Their wrath would have to open your
brain up until they develop some sort of

107
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:49,250
sophisticated detection methods.

108
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
It's just speculation as to when the
brain is producing this incredibly potent

109
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:58,070
psychedelic drug. But it's
there, right? No, it's producing

110
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,530
it. We know it's produced in the
liver. It's produced in the lungs.

111
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,340
It's endogenous to the human
system. And we don't know why. Yeah.

112
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,540
Well I'm pretty sure I have a good insight
into why. Okay. But for the moment,

113
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,640
let's pursue the issue of what the
implications are. Hold onto wild.

114
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,300
Cross my fingers. Cross your
fingers on that one. Um,

115
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,620
the story you've just told,

116
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,400
it's perfectly plausible whether it's a
hundred percent accurate or not and we

117
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,234
don't know,
right?

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,300
But the idea that your mind contains
mechanisms that go into some sort of

119
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,530
psychedelic state without your conscious
mind being able to tap into it.

120
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:35,210
So your conscious mind
walks around during the day,

121
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:39,050
not realizing that you're tripping at
some other moments for some purpose.

122
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,760
It's all very interesting.

123
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,230
You're not tripping and you're
sleeping mind for no reason at all.

124
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,260
You're doing it for productive reasons,
logically speaking.

125
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
It has to be the case that if you're
burning energy and going through the,

126
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,370
um, costly exercise of thinking
even in the psychedelic way,

127
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,800
that it's happening for a reason.
Right.

128
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:04,970
And that means that we have carried this
with us from an ancestral state into

129
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,600
the modern state and we now have molecules
that we can trigger it when we want

130
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:09,550
to.
Um,

131
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,580
that gives you access to
a style of thinking that
you're telling me has altered

132
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,900
your understanding of your relationship
to other people and that it

133
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,000
metaphorically lines up with what you
often hear delivered in religious terms.

134
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,180
Right? That abstractly. Yes. Right.

135
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,930
And so when you say Catholicism is a cult,

136
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I don't agree because Catholicism
historically must have been delivering

137
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,520
messages that caused people to correct
their thinking in ways that made them

138
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,930
collaborate more effectively,

139
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,890
that made them better able to find the
opportunities in their environment.

140
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,480
I'm not advocating that,
um,

141
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,770
we should sign up for belief systems
that are at odds with our modern

142
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:03,980
environment.
But one thing we can say,

143
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:08,981
I believe for sure is that religions
that have stood the test of time did so

144
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,420
because their value to the
people who believed in them.

145
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,490
It was so great that those,

146
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:19,580
the disbelieved were out competed now.

147
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,090
So we get into trouble in
the modern circumstance
because we can look at many of

148
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:29,330
the teachings of any of these ancient
religions and we can compare them to what

149
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:32,510
we learned scientifically and detect
that there's something not right.

150
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,420
Can I stop you there? I'm sure
I'm Scientology. Is that a cult?

151
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,300
Too early to tell. Okay.
But let's stop. Well,

152
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,890
oh, the guy who created it. Well, we do,
but we all have. So let me drag you back.

153
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,390
By the way, I'm very uncomfortable
with Scientology and what it does,

154
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,950
but the problem is, um, as
Scientology itself points,

155
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,620
if you looked at the inception of
something like the Catholic Church,

156
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,150
you might be equally troubled. Sure. Which
is why I think they're both colts. Well,

157
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:06,870
but let's be careful about that.
So what do you think a cult is?

158
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,130
What do you think would call it? Well,
I think a cult is the predatory version.

159
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,340
It is tapping into people's natural
tendency to believe in what I call a

160
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,660
metaphorical truths.

161
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,870
And it is using it very often to
extract resources from them. The church,

162
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,740
well, no, not like the Catholic Church.

163
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,390
The Catholic church is so long
standing and the population that has,

164
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,020
I guess what I would say is if a
population succeeds by believing in these

165
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:40,650
things than cult is not the correct.
Uh,

166
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,420
I think you and I have different terms.

167
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,930
Were we using different definitions of
the word cult done? But let me, let me,

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,690
okay. Take theirs. There's a
very interesting comparison.

169
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:53,510
So Joseph Smith who started the
Mormon church had a ahead return,

170
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,430
right? He had a competitor, uh,

171
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,000
at the time as a book called
the Kingdom of Mathias,

172
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,820
right about his competitor at the time.
And to me,

173
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,940
the two looked equally plausible. The
story that they were selling. Now,

174
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:10,941
Mathias never had more than 30
followers and his religion died out.

175
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:15,100
And Joseph and Joseph Smith one and
in the Mormon church is obviously a,

176
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,850
a real thing.
Um,

177
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,010
but these sets of beliefs
are advanced by somebody,

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
whether those somebodies are cynical
when they do it or whether they are

179
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,520
earnest.
I think many of these,

180
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,410
the ones that we have that have lasted
for long periods of time have been

181
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,470
advanced by somebody who
was in one way or another,

182
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:42,471
conscious or not DMT or not tapped into
something that when delivered to other

183
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:48,600
people actually constituted a kind of
insight now as opposed to being a con man.

184
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,860
Right.
Okay.

185
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,783
And so,

186
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,420
so the origins of the Catholic church
most likely came from some desire for

187
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,420
order and a,

188
00:10:58,421 --> 00:11:03,421
a scaffolding of how to behave and to
give people rules and structure for how to

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,550
get through this life with the
most amount of positivity and love.

190
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,820
And by disciplining them and having
these grave punishments being held over

191
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,340
their head,
burning in the fires,

192
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,210
the pits of hell if they decide to
have sex with another man or where two

193
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:25,560
different types of cloth or whatever the
other silly things that were in the old

194
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,360
testament by doing this,

195
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:29,800
what they've essentially tried
to do was offer people's trucks.

196
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,490
Um, no, it's, it's not
really structure. It is a,

197
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,490
an analog for truths that can't be spoken.
Um,

198
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,970
literally because nobody knows
how to phrase them. So let's,

199
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:47,240
let's deal with the church on the one
hand and Moses on the other. Okay.

200
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,580
Moses is obviously important
in, uh, in Jewish history.

201
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,130
If Moses

202
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,800
ate some DMT from the Acacia Bush,
I think it was smoke and we smelled squad,

203
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,150
the whole thing.
And the burning Bush,

204
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,890
let's say he smoked it and let's say he
was super savvy and farsighted and you

205
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,030
know, obviously he didn't know
anything about molecules, right?

206
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,170
Suppose that he had some ancient
model of something and he threw,

207
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,140
there must have been something in that
plant that caused crazy things to happen.

208
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:21,220
Let's suppose he didn't believe that
he had contacted God or that God had

209
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:26,020
contacted him, but you woke up from
the thing and was like, wait a minute.

210
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,880
I know what these people are doing wrong.

211
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,270
I'm going to write it down
and tell them came from God.

212
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,250
Is Judaism now a cult?
I think they're all cults.

213
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,150
I think all ideologies are cults.
I just don't, I don't know.

214
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,040
I don't think there is
any one person who wrote,

215
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,840
first of all, when you're
dealing with a Christianity,

216
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,450
you're dealing with translations,
right? Or Judaism, you're,

217
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:56,350
you're dealing with like ancient
translations of languages that aren't even

218
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,920
spoken anymore. Right. And
you're also dealing with a,

219
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,430
an oral tradition of who knows how many
years before it was ever bothered to be

220
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:04,264
written down,

221
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,600
but write but written down by people
and then people decide what stays in and

222
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:10,900
what doesn't.

223
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,490
They changed the rules like the priests
used to be able to marry priests in the

224
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,180
Catholic Church. The pope, you, Steph
wives, sure. Now they ran armies. I mean,

225
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,220
this is clearly something that human
beings have a hand in manipulating and

226
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,560
changing. And they do it for the
benefit of the structure itself. Well,

227
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,220
they're not doing it for the benefit of
the human beings that are a part of it.

228
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,150
They're doing it for the benefit of the
structure itself. Oh, that I don't agree.

229
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,680
Well, what's, in what case? The money and
the, the, the, the amount of, I'm not,

230
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm not saying you don't have corruption
in all of the structures you do. Um,

231
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,720
but I am saying that there is it,

232
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,910
I mean this is exactly parallel to
what we were talking about before.

233
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,430
There is the predatory version,
which I would call a cult, right? Um,

234
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,310
and there is the earnest version,
which I would not call a cult.

235
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,060
Now I'm very uncomfortable with any of
these things governing policy in the

236
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:05,800
present because none of them have a
literal relationship with reality that

237
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,610
allows them to deal with the fact that
we've got all these new problems for

238
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,590
which there are no,
there's no religious wisdom.

239
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,400
Maybe there's a problem in
the word called maybe, uh,

240
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,340
maybe we should just say

241
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,290
a structure created by human beings,

242
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,860
which is basically all
structures, all structures, all,

243
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:31,861
all models of behavior where you
have to adhere to certain things.

244
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:37,951
But the problem with religion and even
with a lot of cults is these supposed

245
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,850
grave consequences for Dva.
Right? Well, so, all right, let's,

246
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,220
let's,
let's pick up Catholicism.

247
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,990
It's easy because so much of the
structure is visible to us. Okay.

248
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,740
I would argue that Catholicism

249
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,060
is going to be true of all
of Christianity. It's going
to be true of Judaism,

250
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,680
but Catholicism is,

251
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,520
it is easy to see how it would facilitate
collaboration that effectively it

252
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:09,710
would recreate in some sense the insight
that you're talking about from DMT and

253
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:14,030
that it would instantiate it in the
population in a useful way that would

254
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,300
facilitate collaboration and disrupt
processes that cause infighting.

255
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,870
So spending before it
might be a structure,

256
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:27,770
it's a scaffolding for human behavior
and ethics. Right? But imagine, I mean,

257
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,990
we can see it in Catholicism.
I know where it is.

258
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,140
So every week you have to go and confess
the shit you're doing wrong to the dude

259
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:39,290
in the box. Okay. That's how they
used the spine, you know? I mean,

260
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,390
that's what that was for. Well,
but why are they spying on you?

261
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:45,470
I mean knows they want to make sure
that they don't get overthrown. I don't,

262
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,390
I think, I think you're too cynical. Yeah,

263
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:51,320
because what do you think they're doing
well? So, first of all, I'm a biologist.

264
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,183
Okay.

265
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,110
How are these priests who don't marry
passing on their genes? They're not. Oh,

266
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,260
they are. Oh, what are they
doing? They're sneaky. No,

267
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:05,290
they're facilitating the stability of
the lineage that they are in charge of.

268
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,840
So the point is they don't
pass on their genes directly.

269
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:12,290
They're passing on their genes
indirectly through the population.

270
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,560
Their interests are synonymized
with the population that they are.

271
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,890
Um, they are preaching too. And
so you tell the dude in the box,

272
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:26,200
which you've been doing wrong. Imagine
it's adultery. Okay? Oh God, I'm,

273
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,840
if I die before next week and I haven't
confessed my adult, you go to hell,

274
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm going to go to hell. That dad had very
unpleasant place. I'm telling that guy,

275
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,910
it doesn't get to have
someone to tell him.

276
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,880
So now the person had been committing
adultery with his thinking. Oh Shit. Well,

277
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,020
I was going to keep this a secret,

278
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:42,590
but now the priest is going to know that
I've been committing adultery because

279
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,070
he's going to hear from the other person.
And so I better confess too.

280
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:50,030
So now the priest has a sense of like,
oh, there's an adultery problem in the,

281
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,820
in the congregation. And
the priest is, you know,

282
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:56,000
flipping through the book and thinking
how this week, what should we talk about?

283
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:59,930
And so, you know, the priest then gets
up at the pulpit and, uh, you know,

284
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:03,490
turn your book to it's all and whatever,
um,

285
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,530
and starts going on about adultery and
the people in the congregation who are

286
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:13,640
engaged in adultery or thinking, Oh
shit, this is god talking to me directly.

287
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,580
God knows what I've been
up to and he's not happy.

288
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,390
And that's why we're reading this psalm.
I better cut it the fuck out. Right?

289
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:24,110
So my point is,
the dude in the box,

290
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,100
he's taken a vow of poverty.
He's living in the church.

291
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:31,490
He does well when the
town does well. Um, he,

292
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,040
he's not having babies of his own,

293
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,220
so he can't really get ahead by himself.

294
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,900
He gets ahead genetically speaking
when the town does well and he's in a

295
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:44,510
position to spot what's
going wrong in the town.

296
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:47,450
And he doesn't have a dog in that fight
because he's not involved in business.

297
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,190
He's not involved in mating and dating.

298
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,700
If you don't know saw relatively recent
when it comes to the Catholic church in

299
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:54,890
the last couple of hundred years.

300
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,570
And I would argue if you look
back at any of these traditions,

301
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,290
any of the ones that worked
well successfully have
addressed the question of how

302
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:06,270
you prevent corruption from emerging.
Well apparently it was sexual corruption.

303
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,460
These guys were rock stars.
Like the priests were essentially the,

304
00:18:09,461 --> 00:18:14,130
the guys who had the direct line to God
and just like professors have been known

305
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:18,350
to do, not you, but you know, some
have sex with their students, you know,

306
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,390
and cause the students like
look at them like, oh my God,

307
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,150
I can't believe that professor sitting
down here with my work. And even mean,

308
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,700
it's like that's a very minor connection
in comparison to the connection to God.

309
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,870
Anybody who's going to have anybody
who's going to have power is in danger of

310
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:34,704
abusing it.
Sure.

311
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,330
I wouldn't say it's interesting that
in the Catholic church and in other

312
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,950
traditions where, uh, uh,

313
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,450
marriage and making money are impossible,

314
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,410
that these appear to be, uh, evolved.

315
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,480
Um, what's the word? Uh, it's like, um,

316
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,220
error correction or, or
protection from, from a virus.

317
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,030
So an outbreak of corruption in the church
is a bad thing from the point of view

318
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:07,290
of the wellbeing of the congregation.
And, uh, something that says, well,

319
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,420
if you're a priest and you're
spending money in town,

320
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:11,820
people are going to look at you funny
because you're not supposed to have money.

321
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,480
And if you're, you know,
hanging around with cute girls,

322
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,790
people are going to look at
you funny cause you're not
supposed to be having sex.

323
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,750
Um,

324
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,750
so this limits their ability
to get away with stuff.

325
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,890
I'm not saying it's zero,
obviously it's not.

326
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:29,090
But the idea that there
will be protections in, um,

327
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,140
in each tradition for this that
religions that don't successfully protect

328
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,390
against abuses of power,
um,

329
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,980
will succumb in competition to
religions that do it effectively.

330
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,220
And so you're absolutely correct that
all of the changes in a religious texts

331
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,630
that people believe in this,

332
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,470
that's all human beings making decisions
about what to keep and what to throw

333
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,360
out.
And I'm not arguing anything else.

334
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,370
What I am arguing is those that have been
insightful about what to keep from the

335
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:03,060
point of view of the particular problems
faced by the population that they are

336
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:03,720
in,

337
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,720
we'll have a competitive advantage
because they will function more cohesively

338
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,030
then a population of atheists who doesn't
have somebody looking out to prevent

339
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,290
outbreaks of competition inside the,
the lineage outbreaks of infighting.

340
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,130
So if you were looking at
it in an objective way,

341
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:26,370
like say if you were an alien from
another planet that didn't understand the

342
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:31,250
language and you just observing
the structure, you would
see as error correction.

343
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:34,530
The structure would say, oh, they realize
that there was an issue here with power.

344
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,190
And so they error corrected by making
these priests be celibate and then they

345
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:42,150
figured out a way to keep them from
having money and that'll keep them from

346
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:45,510
being invested in, you know? Okay,
yeah, I see what you're saying.

347
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,260
And I think it's very misleading people
who analyze things the way you and I

348
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:55,261
would because there's so much hocus pocus
associated with the structures that,

349
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,630
you know, it's like constantly
putting a finger in the,

350
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,290
in the eye of an analytical person. Of
course. I mean just the way they dress,

351
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,681
right?

352
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:06,670
I mean just the wearing the wizard costume
and holding the staff and sitting on

353
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:10,540
the golden throne and, and all of
it. I mean, all the pageantry to it.

354
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:14,740
It's all preposterous. I mean, I agree.
Looking at it as a modern person,

355
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,090
it looks preposterous to me. On the other
hand, there is no way I'm telling you,

356
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,500
I mean, most of my colleagues
I'm sure would disagree
with this, but I hope to um,

357
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,410
to show them to be wrong on this front.
The,

358
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,440
there is no way that the huge amount of
effort and resource that is invested in

359
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,470
these structures was an error,

360
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,160
cannot have been an evolutionary error.
Because if it was,

361
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,450
the huge investment that population's
put into these structures is an

362
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:47,320
opportunity for some population that
behaves in exactly the same way.

363
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,080
Except it doesn't make that error to win,
right?

364
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:54,790
But when you get power and then you
have the momentum of that power, um,

365
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,550
overcoming the, the population and
then you have positions where the,

366
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,384
the,

367
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,670
the behavior patterns are extremely
restrictive and you have to behave inside

368
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,980
these behavior patterns or there's
grave consequences. I mean,

369
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:13,960
you could conceivably run
that for a thousand years
without any error correction

370
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,090
and that's what you've got with Islam,
right?

371
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:21,091
You've got a very ancient form of religion
that Michael Shermer wrote a piece

372
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:25,270
about it that's pretty interesting where
he was talking about how it's the only

373
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:29,410
religion that didn't go
through the enlightenment and
he makes these comparisons

374
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:34,411
to like the corrections that have been
had with other religions as time's gone

375
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,830
on that haven't happened there. And you
could equate it to resource management.

376
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,740
You could create it to the part
of the world in which they live.

377
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:42,281
You could equate it.

378
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:45,250
There's a lot of different ways that
you could try to figure out why this

379
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:49,720
happened. But the reality is
that that thing has not changed.

380
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,480
That structure has not
changed for a long time.

381
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,890
I think you've hit on exactly the,
the right point.

382
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,253
Um,

383
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Islams mechanism for preventing
outbreaks of chain parasitism was to,

384
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
to hard code the thing.

385
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,440
And this is a tragedy because it,

386
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,790
what it means is that where Islam needs
to update it doesn't have the mechanism

387
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,400
for doing it. So, uh,

388
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,630
but also has a built in
way to keep people a board.

389
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,620
Like if you become an apostate that you're
allowed to, you can kill them. Right.

390
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:29,800
And kill apostates which is there is no
other religion that we have right now

391
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:33,230
that operates like,
that has draconian commissions.

392
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,400
If Scientology did that
right. Well, I mean,

393
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:40,630
Scientology obviously has a huge number
of completely unacceptable mechanisms to

394
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:41,770
keep people from leaving.
Well,

395
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,500
but how is that not a cult since it was
created by a science fiction writer?

396
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,770
Literally out of nowhere.

397
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,710
I'm going to be horrified if I said
it wasn't a cult too early to tell.

398
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,500
Right. How's that possible? Okay. So that
could be some benefits in the future.

399
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,180
Scientology continues to
evolve and self correct.

400
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,840
It could get to the point where it's
a behavior pattern that could be

401
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:08,680
complimentary.
And perhaps even beneficial to people.

402
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,010
I do not believe that this
is where it is headed.

403
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,100
But if a thousand years from now it
had flourished and the population that

404
00:24:18,301 --> 00:24:23,220
believed these things was
successfully, uh, growing,

405
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:25,350
you'd have to say, well, there's
something in that set of beliefs.

406
00:24:25,351 --> 00:24:28,540
It's working for these
folks. Um, so anyway, I,

407
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,190
I'm not arguing that it isn't a called,

408
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:34,200
it has lots of hallmarks that
make me think I'm troubled by

409
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:39,590
much like Mormonism. You know, the guy who
made it, but this, and unlike Mormonism,

410
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,650
which was an 1820,
we have video,

411
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,330
we see l Ron Hubbard is bad teeth and
his fucking captain's outfit on with the

412
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:48,530
metals that he gave himself.

413
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,540
Hey, what is this? Right. Oh, right.
Oh, you get a planet when you die,

414
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:56,510
or something like that. It sounds like a
cult to me. On the other hand, you know,

415
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:59,210
I mean, we've got the Mormons get
a planet when you're dying. Sorry.

416
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,300
Cytologist don't get a
planet. No, no. The Mormons

417
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,600
do. And it was in one of the,
uh, Osman brothers albums.

418
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,340
They all went to these planets, like in
the album. I forget what the album is.

419
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,970
It's a hilarious album. But if
you open it up, it's all planets.

420
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,860
And the album,

421
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:23,720
the name of the album is this concept
that you get a planet when you die.

422
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,120
This is something that's believed to me
because I am universe is so big we can

423
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:30,054
each afforded

424
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,860
it is the plan. That's it. See that, uh,

425
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,800
that is some Joseph Smith Shit.
By the way. It's a wonderful book.

426
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,880
If you, if you read the, the
actual origins of Mormonism
people to listen and go,

427
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:47,020
wait a minute, what do they
believe? Wow. Did they believe
some wacky stuff? But, uh,

428
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:47,770
he,
uh,

429
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,770
he had a golden or a seer stone rather
that allowed him to read the golden

430
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:53,704
tablets.

431
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,390
The seer stone was a special magic rock
that allowed him to read these golden

432
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,690
tablets that contained the last work of
Jesus cause at the inside of the album

433
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:02,480
with all the planets.

434
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,250
So I, I believe he was actually
illiterate and that was a con man.

435
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,120
He was murdered,

436
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:12,440
put a sheet over his head and dictated
what he was supposedly reading to

437
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,360
somebody else. That's my
understanding of it. But, um,

438
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,610
it was a charismatic person. Like many
people have created cults. He was, um,

439
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,630
I think what they did right. Mormon. Yeah.

440
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,440
Are some of the nicest
people I've ever met.

441
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,890
They have an amazing sense of community.
They're super nice.

442
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,540
And I've always said that if
I was going to join a call,

443
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,070
I think I had joined the Mormons,

444
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,310
but where they fucked up as
they regulations came in,

445
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,950
they started restricting the market.
They started,

446
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,160
the regulators came in and stop these
people from having nine wives and then

447
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,570
they're not going to be so nice anymore.

448
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,530
The reason why they were so
nice is because they have
these crazy relationships.

449
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:52,810
There were having orgies every night.
We had nine people living in the house.

450
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,860
Then they allowed to have sex with.
There's a problem with your, they,

451
00:26:55,861 --> 00:27:00,060
because for everybody who had nine wives,
they were eight dudes who had not.

452
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,500
Those guys got to get their shit together
and start their own coal gas where you

453
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:08,910
know, well, maybe they are gay. I don't
know. Um, what about the women too, right?

454
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,810
Well. How about a woman who
has 10 husbands? You know,
this is bullshit for her.

455
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,980
That doesn't happen. Yeah, it should
right now be possible. No, no.

456
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:18,990
See there's a really good
biological reason biologically,

457
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:24,120
and it doesn't make any sense, but
you were digging deep. Oh Man, don't,

458
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:26,220
don't,
don't go polyandrous on me.
