1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,400
Got to tell him, man. I mean,

2
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:06,180
if you watch his fight with Glover to
sharer are you watch his fight with the

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,480
Little Nog? Yeah. That mother fucker's
of destroyer. He does. He's a destroyer.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,950
We don't want to be,
we don't want to be in front of them.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,970
And that shows you how
fucking tough DC is. Yeah.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,790
That guy twice I throwed everything.
I had him, everything I had, I,

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,610
I need him in the face. Uh, kicked
him in his body. Sometimes I hit him.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,280
I say like goes like this. I mean he
just, he just put, he just kept going.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,490
DC's an animal, a four wheel
drive, just kept on going on,

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,170
whatever. And he just,
same pay. Same Pace. Yeah.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,270
If I fired them again, I will, I
will. I will not stand in this book.

12
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:40,170
I want to stand in front of him.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,650
So you think that was the critical error
right in front of 100% reach advantage?

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,210
Yeah. I respect that.
He's wrestling too much.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,140
So yeah, if I found them again, I
would do it a way different way. Yeah.

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,660
I'm sure he'd do something different
too though. Right? He probably do.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,260
You probably do, but it's still do one
thing and call it like, oh all the time.

18
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,910
Just keeps moving forward.
That's what it does.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,950
That's what you gotta do
is you've got to catch him.

20
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,970
When he's coming down from a heavyweight,
he says you've ever the towel.

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Like it's pushing down on it. It's
so awesome. I saw that. I saw that.

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,170
I want him to come down. I hope it's
coming down. He can't, he can't just like,

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,130
you know, take that fight. Now he
know. Even if he wins, he has to come,

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,220
come down and defend and fights
and if he beats deep bay,

25
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,780
he might freak Francis again.
Who knows?

26
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,770
You might fight Volkov who you know who
could fight? No, he has to fight me.

27
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,350
It doesn't want to fight me, but it has
to fight me. He has to in your mind,

28
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,880
he has to fight. That's what I need.
Yeah, that's mine. It's him or John.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,870
So John's first. You would like
to be the first guy to fight John.

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,980
I welcome coming back right away.
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm trying,

31
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm in camp and I'm not in camp. Sorry.
I'm training right. A feeling great.

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,460
My shoulder's good.
And I'm just waiting for an opportunity.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,870
The light heavyweight is
pretty wide open right now,

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,000
particularly with this decision for DC
to fight against day. So we, you have,

35
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,000
you know, it's interesting
like you have, um,

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,010
owes Demir who just lost, right? You got
your friend Jimmy Manwell, you have a,

37
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:17,810
a few guys who are at the top
of the heap, you know, uh,

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,620
but you're the standout right now,
John being in the limbo.

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,810
Yeah. He's gone. Nobody knows
what's happening with him.

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,180
Stands out to you in that
division. Ilir Yeah, yeah,

41
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,790
yeah. You know, I want him
to find my teammates radical.

42
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,210
I don't find my teammates really,
I've been touring with him since I was,

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,370
I started my career. So do you meet
Jimmy? And the other is, you know,

44
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,560
we've been saying to each
other that whatever happens,

45
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,160
we're not fighting each other,
you know. Um, but, uh, yeah, the,

46
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,990
the only, the only the only five that
makes sense for me right now. It's a,

47
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:55,470
it's fighting, fighting the top guys
in our rank number one right now.

48
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,090
So I can't look back. I can look
down. I have to look up what, what's,

49
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,880
what's the next up here and uh,
if you take it from there,

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,750
we take it from there. And, and uh, like
you said with John Jones, he's in limbo.

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,420
I hope it comes back.
If it doesn't come back,

52
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,430
maybe I'll fight him in boxing.
I fight him in boxing too.

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,460
Why does he want to box?
He's been boxing Lenny's Instagram.

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,040
There's all they do is box now.
Right now we're really, yeah.

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,900
I haven't paid attention to his Instagram.
He's boxing all the time. Yeah. Yeah.

56
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,120
I don't see you see him coming back
as a boxer though. Mcgregor money.

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,940
We could. We could, yeah,
that's, that's another thing.

58
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:38,570
But we can think of like maybe a side
show here. We can box or whatever.

59
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,410
You just want to get in there with
them somehow or another that somehow,

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,620
somehow or another your competitive
drive once you get in there with them.

61
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,100
That was my, that's my,
like I told you, it's, it's,

62
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,850
it's bigger than winning the belt. That's
your Mount Everest, John Joan. It is.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,610
John's out there going,
yeah, he knows that.

64
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,200
He knows that he is,
but he's still got that corvette.

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,120
Yo sell that thing. Get a minivan. Drive
slow. It looks good. Man. Looks real good.

66
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,983
Yeah,
you do.

67
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,830
It's gotta be so frustrating for him to
be in a situation that he's in. Yeah.

68
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,010
I can't even imagine. Yeah, I can
imagine either. It's, it's fucked up.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,780
It's a crazy situation to be in.
