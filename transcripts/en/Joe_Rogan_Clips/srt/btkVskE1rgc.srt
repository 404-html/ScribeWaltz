1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,331
Well,

2
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:05,040
it seems complicated to people when you
try to explain campaign finance and you

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:09,540
try to explain contributions to candidates
and contributions to sitting senators

4
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,020
and congressmen.
It's,

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,250
it's complicated and there's
so many different things
to think about when you're

6
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:18,990
discussing this that to a person who's on
the outside, well, how do you fix this?

7
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,130
Well, what, what are the laws now
while how did it get that way? Well,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,280
well w w how about make it so
they can't give them money?

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,400
And there's all these like real
simplistic views of it from the outside,

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,820
but it seems that it,
at the very least,

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,940
limiting the amount of
money at someone's a lot.

12
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,360
Like what is the maximum amount of money
someone can give to a candidate right

13
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,670
now in the primary and the general,

14
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:45,030
it's $5,400 $2,700 in each,

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,250
and that goes up according to inflation.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,930
And that's pretty small potatoes compared
to what the super pacs are doing and

17
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:52,330
reflection.

18
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,740
So you have these people running who
expect they're going to raise the money to

19
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,320
run their office from
their direct contributions,

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,640
but they're counting on the super pacs
to come in and spend ungodly amounts of

21
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:02,940
money,

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,780
like tens of millions of dollars to
support their candidate or to oppose their

23
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,610
Optima, their opponent. Uh,

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,650
and so the supporters for
those super pacs or even tiny,

25
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,870
there's are the adolfs in America,
people named Adolf, this tiny, tiny,

26
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,950
tiny number of people who are
contributing to those, to those things.

27
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,450
But you're right, people. Look,

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,380
there's no reason why most Americans
should understand the complexities of

29
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,540
campaign finance law
and they don't need to,

30
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,630
what they need to ask is do we have a
system of integrity in the way we select

31
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:40,230
representatives? And if you're, if
you're not brain dead in America,

32
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:42,450
you believe the answer
to that question is no.

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,930
We do not have a system of integrity.
There's no representational integrity.

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,810
It is corrupted in all the obvious res.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,150
And like nobody should be forced to study
campaign finance in order to have the

36
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:58,380
entitlement to say, hell, hell
no. This system has got to end.

37
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,860
And so I think you're
right. If we, you know,

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,310
people are forced to like articulate all
the 34 different changes that have to

39
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,770
happen, we're never going to get
there. But let's not go there.

40
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:12,390
Let's just start and end with it is a
corrupted system and we want politicians

41
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,340
to fix it.
And if they don't fix it,

42
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,180
we'll throw them out into a
get the politicians who do. Um,

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,220
and if we could build that as
the movement, the recognition,

44
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,500
the core message of 2020,

45
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:26,520
I think there's a real shot because
we've primed the Republican Party.

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,300
There are a lot of people in that
party who are now so disgusted with the

47
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:34,110
corruption of the system. Not
Necessarily Mitch Mcconnell, he loves it,

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,760
but you know,
reward Neri,

49
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:40,620
Republican voters and the Democrats have
now committed themselves to fixing this

50
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,560
corrupted system. It, this
is the moment to do that.

51
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,260
And we don't have to get into the details
of how much you should be allowed to

52
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:50,220
contribute to say there is a way to fix
this that would give us a representative

53
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:54,360
democracy. Maybe not. Again, but for
the first time wise, Mitch Mcconnell's,

54
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:58,770
so a uniquely evil,
this guy has had it in his,

55
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,550
uh, DNA from the first
moment he went to Washington.

56
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,370
Um, to end any regulation
of money in politics.

57
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,810
He engineered the selection of the FEC.

58
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,330
This is the federal election
commission commissioners,

59
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,340
so that they would block basically
every enforcement action with the FTC.

60
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:25,450
The FTC does nothing now because it's a
commission that has half Republicans and

61
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,230
half Democrats. So if the Republicans
disagree from the Democrats,

62
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,400
then nothing gets done.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,660
They can't enforce the most simple
rules anymore because Mitch Mcconnell is

64
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,110
populated the FEC with people who don't
believe in campaign finance rules.

65
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,650
He has said citizens United this decision
that said corporations could give

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,110
unlimited amounts of money to
independent political speaking.

67
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,750
It says one of the greatest
decisions of the Supreme Court.

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,870
And he said he was going to
fight like hell to defend it.

69
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,730
And when this proposed HR one was
raised to him, Mitch Mcconnell said,

70
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,810
there's not a chance in hell. This will
ever even get a debate in the Senate.

71
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
This man is obsessed with the idea
that money should have the power in

72
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,600
Washington that it has right now.

73
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,960
And people are talking about reforming
it are the enemy. And so, you know,

74
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,550
the thing about Mitch Mcconnell is he's
actually an incredibly smart man and

75
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:19,660
he's an incredibly smart strategist and
he's been playing this game for a long

76
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,600
time. Um, and um,

77
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,990
and I think he's like responsible for
85% of the judicial structure that makes

78
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,580
it possible for this to be blocked.

79
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:32,581
There's an amazing series
to debates happen 20 years
ago between John Mccain and

80
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:33,994
Mitch Mcconnell.

81
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,210
So this was when Congress was passing
something called the McCain Feingold law,

82
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,670
which was the last great effort
to deal with this problem.

83
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,700
It was flawed and a bunch of ways,
but it was an important success.

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,190
Mitch Mcconnell, um, uh, stood
on the floor of the Senate, said,

85
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,830
Mr Mccain says that, uh, the
Senate, we can't say Mr again.

86
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,360
So the senator from Arizona has
said that the system is corrupt.

87
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:59,380
I want him to name the corrupt people.
And Mccain stands there and said,

88
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,290
I'm not talking about particular
individuals. I'm talking about the system,

89
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:06,640
it's the system's corrupt. And then
Mcconnell, almost clueless, just said,

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,490
if the system's corrupt,
there must be corrupt people.

91
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,770
If there's not corrupt people
and the system's not corrupt.

92
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,040
So the only corruption he could imagine
was corruption where somebody was taking

93
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:21,520
a bribe. And if that's the only
corruption we're allowed to remedy,

94
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,030
then the whole system of influence we
have right now is not to be touched.

95
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,370
But you know,
I think we Keynes point was,

96
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,010
you can have a system filled with lots
of honors Congress people and lots of Ana

97
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,370
senators who never engage in bribery,

98
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,300
but they know how to Bob and weave and
bend and speak and say the right things

99
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:47,530
to attract the right kind of money. And
that's as much corruption as bribery is.

100
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,960
And Mccain's view was we had to end it.

101
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
So he was the last great
Republican fighter for reform
of this corrupted system.

102
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,561
There'd been many,

103
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:02,450
before Barry Goldwater was an incredibly
vocal opponent to the role of money in

104
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,600
politics.
Um,

105
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,840
but I think what we have to do is find a
way to revive that and to leverage from

106
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:13,340
this presidents assertion that this is
a corrupt system and we have to change

107
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:18,020
the system into actually
building the political power
to make that change happen.
