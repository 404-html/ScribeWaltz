1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,310
The joe rogan experience when we're
talking about Jeff Bezos before the show,

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,770
who's now the richest man
in human history. It's like,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,900
it's inconceivable amount of money.
He's worth $105 billion. Right.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,310
Which is just like,
what the fuck?

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,700
He's like the eighth biggest landowner
and United States. Do you know that?

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,820
He just buys. It's crazy and
I'm not stunned. Of course.

7
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:25,770
Not 300,000 acres of
Texas. Whoa. That's a lot.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,330
That's a lot. Yeah. That's a
big slab. Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,030
Pretty sure his DC home was either,
uh,

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,760
I feel like it was either a museum
or a hotel before. He was like,

11
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:40,290
make that shit my house. Now
I'm museum. They were like,

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,040
it's your house.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,980
I wonder what he's like to hang out
with because there's a photo of him.

14
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,480
See if you could find this photo at Jamie.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,720
There's a photo of Jeff Bezos from 1993
and he's got like a vinyl banner above

16
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:57,561
his desk that says amazon.com and it's
just him and his Janky little fucking

17
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,670
Ikea desk,

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,840
like bad kind of Chubby typing away.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,890
She got some muscle in on jacked and
Tan and probably got a supermodel for

20
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:14,790
girlfriend. Does he know he's got a
wife for curricular? Yeah. Normal. Yeah.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,330
She's an author. Yeah. How
long? I know I'll have, hmm.

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,260
He doesn't schedule morning meetings so
he could hang out with the kids. Really?

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,970
Yeah. Wow. I read all this stuff.
I wonder why he's going so hard.

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,270
You know when you hit 105 billion,
yeah.

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,360
You would think you'd go,
Eh, we're good. I know.

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,090
I think you just start really
collecting cause you're like,

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,100
cause you know when he
bought the Washington Post,

28
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,610
you know it's not like he's like,
I love journalism. He right.

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,220
Be Cool to own a newspaper.
You know what I mean?

30
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,510
Like what do you at that level
you're just like, I like waterfalls.

31
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,880
Are there any for sale or
something? You know, he's got,

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,180
Washington Post is one of the weird
ones where you get a link some,

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,170
they'll send you a link and you click
on it and it's a Washington Post article

34
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:05,040
and it says you obviously love great
journalists write sign up. Like fuck off.

35
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,370
They don't even give you the free reads.
I feel at times we'll give you 10 free.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,100
I signed up after I, you know, I
kept clicking those. I was like,

37
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,520
I better sign up Washington Post. I feel
like click number one. They're like,

38
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:18,750
do you want to read this? You want to pay
or not? Yeah. I'm not a, I'm not paying.

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,290
Yeah. I mean I, I support
paying for journalism,

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,200
but I feel like they should
give us a taste. You know,

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,010
we should get a little taste.
It's tough to trust journalism these days.

42
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:33,540
It's tough to trust like how fucking
weird of your article is going to be.

43
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,070
That's true. It's true. Journalism is
tough. Uh, watching news has become,

44
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,020
man, I remember when it started
to skew to personality and taste.

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,130
Now it's like off the rails. It is off
the rails. That's where the money is.

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,670
I know, but it's like you were
totally just going with who,

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,460
like you're going to watch,
you can select,

48
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:58,461
what do I feel like leaning towards and
then you watch that Tucker Carlson or

49
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,470
you know, yeah, yeah. Rachel Maddow.
Yeah. There he is. That's that picture.

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,270
Oh my God. Isn't that crazy? Yes. He
looks nothing like that now. Yeah.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,050
It's what 105 billion will do.

52
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,900
He's just sitting there
with that amazon.com banner.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,920
I hope that's still hanging
somewhere in his house. Yeah,

54
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,540
he probably shoots loads on that thing.
What do you,

55
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,070
oh my God. Yeah. Crazy
that he started off.

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,720
I remember Amazon being a book thing.
Yeah.

57
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:32,020
I remember being a place to buy books
and I remember thinking, how weird,

58
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,520
look on an online bookstore.

59
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,640
Why wouldn't you just go to the bookstore
store where you could see the book,

60
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,020
right? Like, and all those books
are shut. She's like, they close.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,790
It's only a few left.
Well,

62
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,030
I know a guy who got a deal with
amazon.com to publish a book.

63
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,290
It was like when Amazon started
publishing books and they blackballed him

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,151
because of this,

65
00:03:55,151 --> 00:04:00,151
because he had had traditional outlet
deals before and you know his books would

66
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,910
be front and center in Barnes, noble,
and all these other different places.

67
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,420
He's a pretty popular author, but as soon
as he went to amazon.com they're like,

68
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:11,520
fuck you. And they just shut
them out. They shut him out
of all those stores. Yeah.

69
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,610
And I was like,
whoa.

70
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,710
Like there's like a weird book war
going on that I didn't know about.

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,620
They're both probably try.
I mean there's book,

72
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,380
people were trying to keep their business
model going and thriving, you know,

73
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:24,700
and he ends up doing it by threats is
never the way to go. Probably not. No.

74
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,240
I mean the best way to go is when Amazon
publishes a book that people actually

75
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:32,050
want to buy in your store. You dumped
foc short and your store. You know,

76
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,810
I hate about these uh, super
rich guys. They'll never,

77
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,980
they never in their interviews taught
have like the only one who will talk like

78
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,640
what it's like to ball at that level and
make it sound fun and like the things

79
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:46,400
you want to add is mark Cuban. I've
seen him in interviews and be like, I,

80
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,720
I got last shit.
And like knows that.

81
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,320
Like that's a genuine curiosity
for people. Like, how fun is that?

82
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,950
You have to seven 47th. He's like,
yeah man, it's pretty cool. Right?

83
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,270
And he talks about it,

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,750
but I saw this interview with gates and
this guy was asking all those questions.

85
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:05,330
He was like, you have to worry
about like when somebody asks you,

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,620
like when you ask for something that
someone's going to try to ask for more

87
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,700
because of your known wealth. He's like,
you know, my charity really is like,

88
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
just like dodging all those questions
of like the fun shit that everyone was.

89
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,670
He just kept going back to
his charity and we're like,

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,220
we know you're a fucking charitable guy.

91
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,320
Tell us what it's like to own six planes,
bro. Like what kind of Shit do you have?

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,970
You know,
he's just like this Zana do house.

93
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:35,440
It's like 70,000 square feet or
something. Well, he's got a house,

94
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:38,910
I think it's on Puget sound.
Um,

95
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,780
it's somewhere in the Seattle area.

96
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,130
Is Medina Medina or Medina says that
what it is, I think is what it's called.

97
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:48,810
It's so freaky. Look at that. It looks
like using the nod and ad blocker.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,900
What'd he pulled up, which pull up 19
crazy facts about his house. Oh, okay.

99
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,410
$123 million,
disable your ad blocker so we can read it.

100
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,360
So we, um, we were in Seattle and there's
this a thing that's near a bridge,

101
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,660
um,
where you,

102
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:08,450
you go under this bridge
and they have this, uh,

103
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,800
these clear walls where you can see the
salmon swimming up the salmon ladders,

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,060
but they have everything set up with
these clear like glass walls so you can

105
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,700
watch it with, it's really
pretty bad ass. Yeah.

106
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,880
But the guy who was there who was the,
uh, you know, the guide of this thing,

107
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,970
who's explaining us,
you know,

108
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,630
how this works and which kind of salmon
you're looking at and the whole deal.

109
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,410
He was like,
you know,

110
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,790
my uncle worked on the Bill Gates' house
and starts talking about Bill Gates'

111
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,130
House and where Bill Gates
houses and where he lives.

112
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,950
And I remember thinking like,
how weird must've B,

113
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,910
if you're so rich that all everybody
wants to do is talk about like, Hey,

114
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,350
my friend worked on your heart, his home.
And I was like, well what's it like?

115
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,570
And he just starts
describing skill as well.

116
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:51,740
He has like some sort of a submarine
access and Casey's getting kidnapped.

117
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
Like someone's trying to jack them.

118
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,960
They can get in a submarine and shoot
out into the river. I'm like what?

119
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,290
Yeah I don't know even how much of that
is even true because this guy seemed

120
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:05,291
like he was missing a little piece of his
brain start really adding stuff to it.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,380
Yeah. So I was thinking, I was like
how much of this is urban myth?

122
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,960
I know that they were reporting even like,

123
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,620
I don't know when that house was built
10 15 or whatever years ago that even

124
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:20,480
back then there was shit in his house
cause it was super high tech of like if

125
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:25,481
you walk in a room music would play and
as you left the room music would die

126
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:29,340
down and pick up in the next room. So
that you know, it had, which at the,

127
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,420
I think you could probably regular person
could probably do something like that

128
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:35,060
now.
But like that was unheard of.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I think you wore a pin him pin on and
that pen as you walked into different

130
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,410
rooms,
recognize that you were the person,

131
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,850
so he had specific colors that you liked.

132
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,330
So they'd be like backlighting that
was just like to be a, his kids,

133
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:54,800
like he's big on, uh, he's the one
that started that giving pledge,

134
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,830
which is like for billionaires to give
the overwhelming majority of their wealth

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
to charity so that you don't pass
on billions to your children.

136
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,510
Right. So his thing is like, I'm
going to leave my kids money,

137
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,890
but not like crazy man. It's that money,
which you're like, yeah, that's, you know,

138
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,290
I totally get the idea behind that.

139
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,770
But also like if you grew up with his,
you know,

140
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,610
you're his kid and you're
like, oh, there's, we got
lions or whatever, and then,

141
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,310
and then you're like, you know, you
grow up and you're like, I'm a whatever,

142
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,790
a photographer now, uh,
my dad left me $5 million,

143
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,870
but like $5 million is great.
It's great. But my thing is like,

144
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,140
it's such a step down
from what they're used to.

145
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,170
I feel even remotely bad for some fucking
kid who gets $5 million from his dad

146
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,500
feel bad. What I'm saying is that that
adjustment has to kick you in the balls.

147
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,460
I mean, the exposure that they've
had, the lifestyle is like, it's not,

148
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:57,170
it's unfathomable to us. Like we can't
even, it's beyond, they're just like a,

149
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,280
it's like being the,
the, a prince, you know,

150
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:03,660
it's like your dad's assault
and the Brunei, and then
he's like, well, go fuck him.

151
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,270
I mean, they're probably well adjusted.
I don't know why I assumed that,

152
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,750
but I think that like,
uh,

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,030
he and his wife seem like such reasonable
people that I bet they've, you know,

154
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,760
prepared them for, for, for what's coming.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,430
[inaudible]

156
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:24,230
yeah.
