1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,440
I forgot.
That's the Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,500
It's funny because like
there are these chapters,

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:08,750
it's like this is all coming full circle
to what we're talking about with like

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,970
Richard Branson on a boat,
getting his dick sucked doing coke,

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,570
but,
but here's the thing,

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,030
there's a cycle and if you hang in
there long enough becomes cool again,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
like if you're hammered and
you're 20 and you're out there,

8
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:26,590
how it a party is kind
of silly and it's fun,

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,580
but if you're hammered and
you're 60 it's kind of sad. Yeah.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,790
But if you're hammered and your 90
it's funny again. Yeah, absolutely.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,940
It's going to hang in there. If you're
a 90 year old drunk, I got a job out.

12
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:44,110
You all just shocked my Gig,
which by the way,

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,340
apparently the latest in the
sexual harassment Olympics,

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,690
the latest a entry is Stan Lee
from marvel comics. Really?

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,620
Yeah. He's 95 years old. Yeah.

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,260
He lives in some giant mansion
and he has a bunch of nurses.

17
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:03,820
He's trying to get them all the bloom.
Of course now he says it's the shakedown.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,380
He says they're all, they're all
just trying to get money from them.

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,370
May very well be the case.

20
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:14,371
She or it may well very well be the case
that he is like a lot of 95 year old

21
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:18,730
dudes with 20 million bucks in the
bank and about six months to live.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,090
Just getting it on. What do you
do? You try, you'd go for it.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,290
He swing those fucking
dice. Come on. Seven

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,700
Stanley, if he really can. If
the enemy, if you're worth,

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,730
well, hold on. Go back to that. What does
it say now? He, okay. He bought someone.

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,110
Then it was revealed that someone had
bought an $850,000 condo in his name

27
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:47,170
without his knowledge. Yeah, that was last
week. I don't know if you're at oh no.

28
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:47,860
What happened?

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,300
Follow police report after discovering
that someone had stolen $300,000 from him.

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,253
Wow.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Using a forged check and then it was a
reveal that someone bought an $850,000

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,070
condo in his name without
his knowledge of fact.

33
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:05,080
It came to light when his team
did a full audit of his accounts.

34
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,860
Following the forged check, whether this
is any way related. Okay. This guy be,

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,890
he might be being honest.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,770
This might be in reaction to
the shakedown, the shakedown,

37
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,530
but this guy has so much money that
someone bought an $850,000 condo in his

38
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:28,000
name, and he didn't learn about it until
they were going over the books. Well,

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,721
he didn't.
Yeah,

40
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:32,150
he didn't mind me about it until
they found a $300,000 stolen cheque.

41
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,640
That's a baller. Yeah. Stanley,

42
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,120
y'all and out of control hero.

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,560
ALTEC kicking kicked
fucking ass superhero. Yeah.

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I'd like to think that he's not the guy
who's trying to tell these maids to suck

45
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:51,550
his deck. Naw, I doubt it. I
like to think that. Me Too.

46
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,600
I want some heroes left a
couple of those guys. Phew.

47
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,870
But hang in there guys.

48
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:09,470
Okay.
