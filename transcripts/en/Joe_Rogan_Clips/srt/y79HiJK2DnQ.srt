1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,590
I mean, it was this, you get people scared
and they'll vote, vote a certain way.

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:09,180
And Yeah. So, yeah.
Amazing Times though. Yeah.

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,760
As a journalist, do you look at
these times and say, this is great,

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,080
this is great for business,

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,240
or do you do you more so look
at it as a human being and go,

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,440
this is just a fucking mess.
And I wish we weren't so ridiculous.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,200
So when, when I first started
covering the Trump campaign,

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,410
I thought this is the most awesome
thing ever because, uh, uh,

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,940
that dynamic I was talking
about before about,

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,460
about reporters wanting to
be on the ground floor with,
with a future winner. Um,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,590
nobody wanted to be on the Trump campaign
because nobody thought he was going to

12
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:47,500
win. I was stoked to the assigned, uh,

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,660
to cover Trump because I thought this
is the most insane thing ever. And He,

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,480
you know, maybe you can for your
style of journalism. Yeah, exactly.

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,350
I thought this is,

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,930
this is the black comedy that I was
then I was sort of born to cover and,

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,550
and born to write. And for
the first, I don't know,

18
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:06,630
five or six things that I wrote
about it, um, about Trump.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,190
I thought it was the most amazing,
crazy, interesting story of my lifetime.

20
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:15,600
And then it took this incredibly
dark term where he actually won. And,

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,440
um, I think it was a dark
turn for him too. Yeah.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
There's no question about
it. No, there's no, I mean,

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,300
I knew some of the people in his campaign,
I can't say this definitively,

24
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,160
but I,
but I,

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,420
I have a very good educated guests that
they had absolutely no expectation of it

26
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:34,620
ever even been close,

27
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:39,390
let alone winning and that and that they,
uh,

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,160
that they did this as a
publicity stunt in the beginning,

29
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:49,161
probably with the aim of either creating
a media network or just bolstering

30
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,440
Trump's overall Q rating
or whatever it was.

31
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,730
I think BC might've pushed him towards
the presidency by firing him from the

32
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,030
apprentice. Uh, yeah,

33
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,200
cause he was still the host of that
fucking show while he was running for

34
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:07,310
president.
They fire him and then Arnold takes over.

35
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:11,840
People forgot already.
Arnold Schwartzenegger
with for a very short time,

36
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,710
you're fired. You're fired. You're fired.

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,830
He was the guy for awhile. Yeah. They
had that flame war remember as, yeah.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,730
It's really weird. Yeah. Fucking strange.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,910
But NBC might have given him the final,
you know,

40
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:29,180
you might have taken an extra diet
pill that day and went, fuck it.

41
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,390
We're going all in the wall.
Got 10 feet higher

42
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,800
on Swartz.
Bigger says he's done with the apprentice.

43
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:40,790
Blames poor ratings on Trump
involvement. Oh, that's hilarious.

44
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,191
That's right.
Yeah.

45
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:46,030
They had that whole back and forth over
who was to blame for the ratings. But uh,

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,240
listen, as a host of that
show, Donald Trump was great.

47
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,320
Oh yeah. He's the perfect guys to
host that show. Arnold's too nice.

48
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,340
It's not the right guy. He's
not a billionaire asshole. You,

49
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:04,180
you need a total jackass and, and
get it done. One of those guys,

50
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,390
you need one of those guys.
You got fired. And the, the,

51
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,680
the same thing that made Trump perfect
for that show made him perfect as the

52
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,200
main protagonist in campaign coverage,

53
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:18,370
which is actually really just a
really long super boring reality show,

54
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:21,740
or at least that used to be
until Trump came along. Uh,

55
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,880
Trump completely changed the
dynamic of it. You know, if you're,

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,520
if you're thinking of it in terms
of how it looks to a network,

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,430
what were the networks thinking before,
if they,

58
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,120
if they were going to have people like
Scott Walker and Lindsey Graham be the

59
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,640
stars of,
of their lead reality show.

60
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:41,470
Like let's get a real performer in
there. Right? And, and when they did,

61
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,720
when they,
when,

62
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,060
when Trump entered the fray and became
a real candidate and started getting

63
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:46,810
votes,

64
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,810
suddenly news started making money and
like for like real money for the first

65
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:55,660
time. And there was a, there's
an amazing data point right now,

66
00:03:55,661 --> 00:04:00,400
which is that the public trusts
the press less than ever, right?

67
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,700
They believe the things that we say
less than ever, all the polls show this,

68
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,600
that there's been a dramatic downturn
and how much people will put stock.

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,410
And things that people
like me say, right? Uh,

70
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,850
but they're watching television,

71
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,880
a new television news more
than they ever have by a lot.

72
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,370
So what are those two
data points say together,

73
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,430
put together that people are
consuming news not as news,

74
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:26,320
but it's entertainment there. There, there
are watching it more. Right. So we're,

75
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,310
we've, you know, CNN made
over $1 billion last year.

76
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,560
They're just eating into the
entertainment budget. That's,

77
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,160
that's all they're doing. And
it's all Trump. Uh, which is,

78
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,240
is fascinating and kind of horrifying,
but, but really interesting too.

79
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,910
Isn't that also what he played
upon when he was running?

80
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,410
Like he would say outrageous shit.

81
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:48,220
So they would cover him and
that essentially gave him
free press. Oh, absolutely.

82
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,800
Yeah. And He, there was
no doubt in my mind that,

83
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,980
that he was doing that intentionally.
I remember watching him,

84
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,981
and I'm in New Hampshire where he's
giving a speech and you probably remember

85
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:05,260
this, this woman stood up and said,
ted Cruz is the pussy. All right. Yeah.

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
And,
uh,

87
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,820
and Trump looks over at her and he says,
oh, that's terrible. That's terrible.

88
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:16,540
She just said a terrible thing about
Ted Cruz. Right. And I remember,

89
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,890
I remember him looking over at the,
at the rise of where all the cameras are,

90
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,900
and you could see him thinking, he's
thinking it's, it's a story for six hours.

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,100
If she says it, it's a story for three
days. That's why I say it. Right. Right.

92
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,990
And he, he thinks, and he goes, he just
said that Ted Cruz, the pussy a right.

93
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,140
And next thing you know, it
like completely dominated
the news. And, and he,

94
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:43,000
he completely, he understood the dynamic
of how the news works better than,

95
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,520
than even the people in the
news understood it. Well,

96
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,710
certainly better than Ted Cruz. Yeah.
That's for sure. Ted Cruz, that the,

97
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,490
the recent praise of Trump and then they
go back to like what he said during the

98
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,930
campaign.
Oh my God.

99
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,680
It's no one should ever listen to him
ever again about anything. Oh yeah, no,

100
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:05,160
it was, it was, it, it's
hilarious. Ted Cruz, you know,

101
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,790
first of all,
my favorite part of that whole campaign,

102
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,960
what's the thing that he couldn't shake
about being the Zodiac killer? Like, uh,

103
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,520
and, and reporters would
give him shit about it. Like,

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
we would talk amongst each other, like,
who's going to ask him about it the next,

105
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:25,010
you know, and, and, um, and everybody knew
that it was, it was bullshit. You know,

106
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,980
that he was born after the killing
started and everything, all that stuff.

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,720
But somebody would always make
it a point to say, so what,

108
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:33,030
what do you think about the,
you know, the rumors about,

109
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,830
and you could see that it just,
it completely drove him to distraction.

110
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,830
He didn't know how to, how to
make a joke out of it or, yeah.
