1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,820
Through the fucking Tsa thing on your
right. Yeah, I'm sure they must be wreck.

2
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:06,440
Really worried about people
walking in that store.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,190
You got to get buzzed in and Oh
fuck you.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,800
He sounds something dude.

5
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:17,880
You could smash and grab
like $6 million crazy.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,410
Somebody just did that recently.
Um,

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,900
in England they smashed and grabbed
a watch store with machetes.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,340
Yeah. Cause you know there's this
thing in England going on right now.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,780
I don't know if you know it,
but they have,

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,950
London has for the first time
ever passed the United States, uh,

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,510
passed a New York City rather for
the most murders. Really? Yeah.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,090
Ever since he was stabbing each
other and stabbing each other.

13
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,470
So the London mayor,

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,000
mayor of London on Twitter wrote a
tweet that has been getting him tortured

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,650
online saying there is no reason
to have a knife. If, well,

16
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:57,240
I saw that knife, you will be PR.
We catch you, you yo regular guy,

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,100
regular guy dive. I open packages, I carry
a knife. I want to cut a piece of rope.

18
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:05,280
I have a knife on me. He said, okay. Not
Anymore. No. In London, this guy saying,

19
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:07,230
if you have a knife and
you're caught with one,

20
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,930
you'll be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,330
And of course United States were
going crazy over here. Like oh it's,

22
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,630
I thought it was a gun problem and
that was a fucking gun problem.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,500
You got a band nine is what's next
steps fucking scissors we need to do.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,850
Where are you going? Where's
this going to end? Yeah. Yeah. I,

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,700
I do have to think that. I think we
have a little bit of a gun problem.

26
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,950
We definitely had an issue problem.
We definitely have something going on.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,820
But this smash and grab
these motherfuckers use
machetes. That's gangster.

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,740
That's game. Cause they
need, nobody had a gun.

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,810
He tried to use a machete and dudes behind
the counter of shotguns. Real problem.

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,830
There's a homemade machete. A
homemade machete. Yeah. Wow.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,480
How do they know it's homemade? Cause they
call it, the guy says quotes, homemade.

32
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,220
They caught them in my house right here.

33
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,590
Good for, good for you. I guess he
didn't get away. No. Good attempt. Yeah.

34
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:00,210
But it's again,
watches,

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,130
like when you think about something
small like jewelry and watches,

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,920
something that's this little on something
you fit in your hand could be worth $1

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:07,950
million.

38
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,940
It's one of the only things in life or
something that fits in your hand is worth

39
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,980
$1 million.
Yeah.
