1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,100
You know,
a little bit easier.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,090
What is it like when a one of those giant
tubes crashes down on top of you? Um,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,490
yeah, so this game Medina, um, he,
he ended up winning the contest. Um,

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,100
it's not super fun when you eat.
It could imagine it's, I mean,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,640
you've probably talked to Shane
and that's me actually. Yeah,

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,810
I've talked to Shane about it.
Yeah. And I mean, look, Shane,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,430
no one's more of an authority than
Shane is. Maybe not in the super hollow,

8
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,560
crazy stuff. I mean, whatever.
Shane writes everything.

9
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,900
But the biggest waves in the
world change the authority.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,650
Like he's had wipe outs
that he came close to dying.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,520
He probably talked about
the vest he created because
of that, he almost drowned.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,200
He created a vest that you pull a CEO
two cartridge and it blasts, you know,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,920
this big bladder and
lifted to the surface.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,930
Even if you get knocked
out or taken water,

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,850
someone's going to find you and probably
save you. Um, but yeah, this is,

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,050
that's me there. So I didn't make
that, but that wasn't even a big one.

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,470
You're not for that day. That was
a small way of fucking huge though.

18
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:01,290
When that's coming down. See where
I'm at, I'm kind of in blue water,

19
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,100
so I was able to dive and kind of get
under it, not get sucked back over.

20
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,680
So there's a little bit of a
skill that goes with wiping out,

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,360
so you understand that energy.
It's, you know, it's like a,

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,980
it's like a tornado or like a hurricane.
Like the eye wall is the worst,

23
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,500
but you're fearing the center,
you're fine. You know, I always,

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,370
I've always wondered like,

25
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,890
could you follow a hurricane
inside the center of the eye?

26
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,020
Like could you just stay
with it and be okay?

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,930
I bet you could if you moved at
a really slow speed right there,

28
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,360
don't move that they only move
about 10 to 20 miles an hour.

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,450
Sometimes less kind of
playing go that slow. No,

30
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:34,740
but maybe you could stay in your car,
run kind of like, you know, find a road.

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,690
If you had a really good gps system,
you've got to go, no, no, no.

32
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,510
Don't go northwest. Go
Northeast. Yeah. Okay.

33
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:45,870
You're going to have to go off road
or you'll die. But so that energy,

34
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:48,170
all that energy is in where
the lip, where the, you know,

35
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,130
if you're in the center
that you're pretty safe.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,190
But as soon as you get sucked in right
into the wall that and you get pitched in

37
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:54,024
the limb,

38
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,630
that's when the lips spreads the water
that it hits and it sends you right down

39
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,240
to the reef. Especially in a
place like this where it's,

40
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,050
when you see a way that's real hollow,
it's generally a lot shallower than it is.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,770
Um, hi. So the wave will
be 15 feet in the water,

42
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,000
might only be five or six feet deep.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,940
So think of all that
energy it's going to hit.

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,440
Most of it's going to hit the reef at
some points. So that's the, you want it,

45
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,490
you want to try to kind of fall like
where that flips landing and then escape

46
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,080
under it into blue water.

47
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,590
What do you do when you know you're going
to hit a reef? You kind of just brace.

48
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:30,090
You don't want to hit your head. Um, for
the most part, you can tell up and down.

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,620
I mean, sometimes you lose your
equilibrium a little bit underwater,

50
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,960
but for the most part you can tell what
is up and down so you can feel it coming.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,280
And I mean, I'm going to put my arms there
before I to take it on my head. Right.

52
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,590
Of course. So I'm, I'm like trying
to be like a cat. Like when I hit,

53
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,730
I want to be able to, I'll break my
hands or feet or whatever, you know,

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,290
I'm not worried about that. I don't want
to get knocked out. Right, right, right.

55
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,700
So I think everyone, uh, default
is to try to cover your head.

56
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,210
Um, you know, if you hit anywhere
else, you're kind of okay.

57
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,670
You just don't wanna hit your head. And
when the waves come crashing down on you,

58
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,180
do you lose your sense of
up and down? You can. Yeah.

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,100
But you know,
you're,

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,370
you also have your board connected
from the leash and that's usually,

61
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,140
that's generally going to pull
up. So you kinda know, um,

62
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,970
if you don't feel your board pulling,

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,890
you're kind of worried like
shut my board might hit me.

64
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,530
It might spear me underwater.
You know,

65
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,410
you can occasionally get spirit in
the face with your board or a fan or

66
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,880
something that's kind of spooky.
Um,

67
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,900
I was surfing with a guy who's
like a big brother and me.

68
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,920
I just traveled with Tom Carroll.

69
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,130
He's a two time world champion and we
were surfing Tahiti one time together and

70
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,780
he used to wear a helmet.
A lot of guys don't work.

71
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,030
Most people don't wear a helmet,
but Tom used to wear a helmet.

72
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,210
He was real really used to it.
But having something, you know,

73
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:42,940
an extra say inch around your
head or half inch, it's like,

74
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,120
it changes your judgment a little
so you gotta be used to it.

75
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,810
I always felt like it was weird.
It's weird for sparring too. Yeah.

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,360
It fucks with your peripheral
vision. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:55,810
So it would mess with me when I tried
to wear them and that extra weight and

78
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,570
like when we're trying
to on a critical way of,

79
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,360
we're trying to pull in the barrel, we're,
we are dealing with inches, you know,

80
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,710
percentage of inches. Like just tucking
your head into that. And so you got to,

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,530
you got to kind of be really
aware of your range and your,

82
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,320
your ability to like Tuck
your head at certain places.

83
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,020
And I was never comfortable with it,

84
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:17,500
but my surfing with Tom and he wiped out
and his board spirit him in the ear and

85
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:22,220
it broke, it broke the helmet and
broke his eardrum. Jesus call.

86
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,110
We were just wondering like,

87
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,020
what the hell would have happened if
he didn't have his helmet on? You know,

88
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,520
like probably would've killed him,
you know,

89
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,900
would it definitely knocked him out and
we didn't have a jet ski with us that

90
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:34,900
day or anything. We were, you know,
500 yards or more off the beach,

91
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,790
half mile off the beach
somewhere at this like that.

92
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,540
Do you have to get it surgically
repaired? Uh, no. You? I don't think so.

93
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,640
I think I've never heal up.

94
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,790
I almost busted my eardrum like six
weeks ago in Hawaii. Just free diving.

95
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,340
I felt it like,
like a pinhole leak.

96
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,030
I could feel it like going and I kind of
got dizzy and I would just came up and

97
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:59,650
stop diving. But, um, there was a guy, um,

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,080
I got a buddy named Greg Long.
He's,

99
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,900
he has drown and he's
been attacked by a shark.

100
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,520
Not Too many people can say
those things and he's alive. Um,

101
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,060
how do you get saved when he drown?
Uh, that's a really crazy story,

102
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,860
but I'll talk about one sec.

103
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,690
But he did break his eardrum at mavericks
up in northern California and he just,

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,130
you just flounder. You don't know what
you think. You're swimming one direction.

105
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,910
Your, it's like you have liberty. Yeah.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,030
It's like your boat's turn in and you
don't know which there's no rudder,

107
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,050
you know, and you're, you don't know
what's up and down and you, you know,

108
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,540
you think you're summing up and you're
going sideways and it's really dangerous.

109
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:34,960
There was a,

110
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,710
there was guy in Hawaii a couple of years
ago that drone surfing and outer reef.

111
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,140
He and a friend of mine caught a wave and
this guy wiped out. He didn't have all,

112
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,470
he had run the surf trunks and
generally will wear like even a wetsuit,

113
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,790
which is just then, but
it keeps you warm. Um,

114
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,980
and even that's enough flotation to
where if you'd got knocked out you'd

115
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,670
probably come to the surface.
So this guy wiped out his leash broke,

116
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,350
so he lost his board.

117
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,150
And then we think near the guys who
are out there think that he popped his

118
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:07,940
eardrum cause they said they saw him
hit the surface and start like his feet

119
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,370
were coming up and his hand
was coming up and you know,

120
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,720
he was kind of just floundering
around and then the next wave hitting,

121
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,410
they never saw him again,
but he was only in surf trunks.

122
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,010
So they didn't ever find the body,
um, because he didn't float up.

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,890
But if he just had it even just a
wet suit, just some neoprene hamper,

124
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,890
found the body and find him. The waves are
huge. It was, you know, it was like 40,

125
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:29,510
50 foot, whatever. But it was
really unfortunate. It was a real,

126
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,980
those things are really like sobering in
the surf community because we all know

127
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:37,670
each other and, um, and you know,

128
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:42,650
ultimately you're doing this for
fun and you know, it's, it's a,

129
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,490
it's a heavy thing, but it's crazy that
your eardrum affects you that much. Yeah.

130
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,151
I mean,
I've seen,

131
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:51,530
I've seen people that have inner ear
infections and they'll get dizzy walking

132
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,080
and you just don't know what they're
doing while they're one front in front of

133
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,640
the other. They want to fall sideways.
It's very strange. Yeah. Well, so Greg,

134
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,730
Greg Long, he'd drown actually
at a place called Cortez Bank,

135
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,930
which is about 120 miles off the coast
of Dana Point. It's just a [inaudible].

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,010
It's basically the top of a mountain on
an island that never hit the surface.

137
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,220
And, um, it was discovered when,

138
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,960
I think it was a nuclear ship actually
grounded itself on that reef back,

139
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,780
I don't know, 30 years ago or
something and caused a lot of,

140
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,070
caused tens of millions of dollars
of damage to the ship navy ship. Um,

141
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,400
and yeah, I don't know if they
had sounded the bottom by then,

142
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,670
it must not have known it
was there. But, um, anyways,

143
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:36,050
this wave breaks when it's really
big and um, Shane's been out there.

144
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:40,580
Shame is actually, um, I think Shane
was out there this day, not positive,

145
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:44,930
but I'm pretty sure Seamus, out during
the session there's about 15 guys out,

146
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,850
doesn't guys out. And uh, Greg
took off on a wave and uh,

147
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,130
somebody who is in front
of him on the wave,

148
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,590
which kind of changed his
angle a little bit, but he,

149
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,240
I don't think he would've
made the wave anyhow,

150
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,680
but it just puts them in a little
bit of a precarious situation. Um,

151
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,690
and he ate it and was down a long time.

152
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:07,691
This wave has just so much energy in it
because there's nothing between where

153
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,530
the wave started.
And this break,

154
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,530
like it's thousands and thousands
of feet deep that you know,

155
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:16,790
over the whole Pacific. So there's no
continental shelf to slow the wave down.

156
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,600
You know, if you can imagine the
east coast, we have small waves,

157
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,680
a big part of that.

158
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,130
And part of that is because most of the
storms go west to east and they don't

159
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,970
come towards us. But even on a
hurricane are our surf. Not that big.

160
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:31,610
Because we have a continental shelf
that goes, you know, you can go out,

161
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,810
you can go 20 miles and it's 70
feet deep some places. So it swells,

162
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:39,920
just drag in the Pacific, they don't drag,
there's just nothing to get in the way.

163
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,010
So these swells are going 35
miles an hour when they hit.

164
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,810
So it's a lot faster than a normal wave.

165
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,200
So there's all this energy in the way of,
and so when Greg went down this way,

166
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:51,140
it was probably, you know, 40
foot face or whatever, 50 face.

167
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,280
He was underwater and he's really calling
him. He's, you know, he's probably as,

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
as ready for anybody in big surf.
He's totally prepared.

169
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,630
He's done all the CPR
and breathing courses and
everything and he was real calm

170
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,520
and he said he pulled his
vast and it didn't work.

171
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,350
And then he pulled another one and it
didn't work and he pulled it a third time

172
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,580
and it didn't work. And so he's
like, Oh fuck, I'm screwed. You know,

173
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,790
that kind of thing. But he, at that
point you're, when you start to pull it,

174
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,700
you are, you're already in
a little bit of a, some,

175
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,610
some guys pull it right away
just to be safe on a big wave.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
But some guys kind of wait and go,

177
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:28,590
I'll see if I'm able to pull this one
off and I'll save my little canister.

178
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:33,150
Cause you only have, like, some of the
vets have to two canister somehow for,

179
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,290
so you don't want to have to
go change your canisters over.

180
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,070
So if you're thinking going to make that,

181
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,560
you're going to get back to the
surface. Are you? You're okay,

182
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:42,630
you can handle it and you've got a
good breath. You're like, I'll just,

183
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,950
I won't pull it. But he pulled three
times and then he'd blacked out. And, um,

184
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,210
they, luckily it had really
good water safety crew and um,

185
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,150
I don't know that it was
his brother that saved him,

186
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:57,720
but a couple of the guys went and grabbed
dove in and pulled him up by leash.

187
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,460
Luckily he was to the least cause he
wasn't floating cause he didn't have the

188
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:06,420
Seo too. And then, um, he had
taken a lot of water and uh,

189
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,500
they had to airlift him off the boat
in height and big seas that night after

190
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:15,150
dark. Wow. And got him back to the
mainland. So did they do CPR on him?

191
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,030
They did CPR,
yeah.

192
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,960
And then the come back to consciousness
came back to consciousness,

193
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,040
but he was like awake while the airlift
and nobody gets fucked up. Yeah.

194
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,450
But guys can have secondary drowning.
Um,

195
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,470
we still have water in the lungs and
you're not like aware of the symptoms or

196
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,620
whatever. Um, I don't
know. They pump it off.

197
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,160
They can't just like hang by
your ankles or anything. Yeah,

198
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:35,160
I think they pump it out.

199
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,460
I was with a buddy in Australia a year
and a half ago and he almost drowned,

200
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,470
got knocked out his board, hit him
in the Chin and knocked him out cold.

201
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,650
And, uh, I was,

202
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
I was sitting out the back waiting for
a wave and I heard everyone kind of,

203
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,390
I heard another friend screaming.

204
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,390
Luckily the waves kind of stopped
and they were able to get to them,

205
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,610
pull them up on a jet ski and a,

206
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,470
he had taken in some water and he's
puking and coffin, all this stuff.

207
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:05,430
And I came up from behind and
I didn't see his neck. Um,

208
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,090
and I heard one of the guys
say, Oh, he got his board,

209
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,920
hit him in the neck and the throat.

210
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,780
And so I was expecting this artery
because, or like the throat to be open.

211
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,590
I was like, okay, I don't want to
look yet cause I was behind him.

212
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,050
I didn't want to get it to go around
them and try to look. I'm like, okay,

213
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:22,890
let's get him into the beach.

214
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:27,420
Luckily we had a jet ski because we were
about a mile off shore. And, um, I just,

215
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,560
I held on the jet ski and kind of,
I just squeezed on B,

216
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,180
we have a sled on the back of the jet ski,
like a body,

217
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:36,690
big giant bodyboard with handles.
So I just kind of straddled him,

218
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,440
my other friend rode the ski all the
way up on the beach. And then I thought,

219
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,810
okay, when we get the beach, I'm going
to have to see, this is going to be gory.

220
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,340
But luckily he wasn't opened up.

221
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:48,810
He just had a huge hematoma here on
his neck and he, it didn't slice him.

222
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,390
It just like contusion, like blunt
force. That's very lucky. Yeah.

223
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,930
But he spent two or three days in the
hospital because they were worried about

224
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,410
secondary drowning, which I don't exactly
know what secondary drowning means,

225
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:03,880
but I guess when you have a water salt
water in your lungs, it can, I don't know,

226
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,610
maybe from the way it
laid down or I dunno,

227
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,300
I should try beat super school that
right out to your living. Right. But uh,

228
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,340
you know what I mean? Yeah. You must
see a lot of crazy shit in the water.

229
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,140
Like, I've seen some crazy stuff.
Yeah. Wild life. And I mean,

230
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:25,141
you must see an amazing amount of
fish and the shark copics super.

231
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,560
It never ends. You know, like, I mean,
anyone in the world I meet is like, Oh,

232
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:33,850
I'm scared of sharks. Told me that
story doesn't ever end that story.

233
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,780
It's a primal fear like, and
eaten by a monster. You know,

234
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,510
you feel so vulnerable in the water.
I mean,

235
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,970
maybe you feel less vulnerable because
you're bored and you have a board and you

236
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,890
knew so quick with the board.
But like someone like, oh, you,

237
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,190
you are totally vulnerable if a great
white one too. Oh yeah, completely.

238
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,850
If a shark over, I mean, even
if was six foot shark wants you,

239
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,470
but that's the, that's the misconception.
You know, everyone thinks, oh,

240
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,030
shark death, you know, jaws
just fucked everybody up.

241
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,410
So I was seven or
something when I was six,

242
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,660
I think when jaws came out
and I watched it, you know,

243
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:12,790
I watched frickin poltergeist
when I was like 10, you know,

244
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,470
my parents let me watch
it, everything. And my too.

245
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,530
Maybe that's why I always thought there's
some boogeyman in the closet, you know,

246
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:24,730
or whatever. But the same. Yeah.
And uh, it keeps your prepared.

247
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,160
Maybe that's why I started
training with a dragon, you know.
