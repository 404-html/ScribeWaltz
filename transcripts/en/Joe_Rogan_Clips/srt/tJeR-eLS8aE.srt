1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,240
Why is this not legal here? Well, uh, it,

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,300
it's considered to be a new drug by the
FDA and that's the number one reason.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,490
There are four countries so far
that have approved MSC products.

4
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:23,080
There's Canada and New Zealand were the
first to go to Canada and get this done.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,830
Well not for the only, only for
certain conditions. So in Canada,

6
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:29,400
New Zealand they approved
bone marrow Mscs,

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,430
which are in my mind are not
as good as umbilical cord.

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,520
And I explained why, um, and,

9
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:41,170
and then South Korea as
approved and biblical cord
for knee osteoarthritis only.

10
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:43,120
So the cells have to be
injected into the knee.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,940
And then Japan just recently
approved the same product. That's it.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,530
It's used to treat very
serious acute graph,

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,700
acute graft versus host disease in
children after they've had a bone marrow.

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,330
That's fine.

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,800
Now are there peer reviewed studies or
anything that shows the efficacy of this

16
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:04,460
intravenous use of these stem cells?
Yeah, there, there are hundreds.

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,520
There are hundreds. And my
book MSC, which is, you know,

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,850
you don't want to read it unless you
want to go to sleep unless you're looking

19
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:15,380
for something, you know, it's just,
it really is purely a research tool.

20
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,300
Um, we have 800 references and
we reference every clinical
trial that's ever been

21
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:22,480
done with mscs and human
beings and there are 800. Okay.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,230
Well I've had some great
results with stem cells.

23
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:30,190
Doctor Rodney Mcgee in Las Vegas,
a shot a bunch into my shoulder.

24
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:34,840
I was at the door of surgery. I was
like my shoulders and pain all the time.

25
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,860
I can't do a lot.

26
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:39,460
Every time I do something I have to ice
it down for a day and now I have full

27
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:43,030
function. I mean, it's crazy. I mean I
was literally, I mean it still clicks.

28
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,460
I've got some weird shit in there and
there's probably some stuff floating

29
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:49,810
around in there. But as far as like the
function of my shoulder and the pain,

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,790
it's like a 100% I can do
basically everything. Right,
right. Yeah. Yeah. I was 57,

31
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,750
58 years old and this is like what,
four or five years ago?

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,430
And both my shoulders torn labor
rooms, arthritis, bone spurs,

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,960
like rotator cuff issues.

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,850
And I went down and I got 10
billion sales in each shoulder.

35
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,970
I said to the doc and how's
this going to hurt? And he says,

36
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:17,500
only when it comes out the other side.
But he put it in and it was,

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,970
you could feel him pierce the
capsule and you could feel pressure.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,070
And I couldn't flap my wings for three
days, but after that, no more problems.

39
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,100
And this is different than the stem cells
that you can get in the United States

40
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,770
currently? Yes. What's
the difference? Well,

41
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:36,880
the difference from umbilical
cords, I had a, what is it called?

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,090
What's the kind that you can get
here in the United States? Well,

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,870
you can use the only thing that's legally
legal in the u s at least for now,

44
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:46,980
I don't think it's going to be last
much longer as from amnion. Yeah,

45
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,450
there's an exemption in the,
uh,

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,280
it's a federal federal exemption for
the use of amnion for wound covering.

47
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,080
And a lot of people have now translated,

48
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:59,560
now they're using it in
joints and things that,

49
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,170
but you don't think they're going to
be able to do that very much longer?

50
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,430
I don't believe so.
Why is that a,

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,570
cause this commissioner FDA Commissioner
has made it very clear that he doesn't

52
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:11,860
like it and, and they, they really
haven't liked it for quite some time. Um,

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,060
because the, the exemption is
for one thing and, and, and,

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,890
and doctors are using it for
all kinds of other things.

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,750
I don't necessarily agree with it.
I just,

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,610
I just know what's coming down the
pike from a regulatory standpoint. Uh,

57
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,790
and, and you know, there've been some
regulatory things that have come out.

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,550
They've gone after clinics and you know,

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,910
I think they've shut down three places
in just in the last couple of months and

60
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,410
they haven't gone after amnion yet.

61
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:39,520
But I think they're building their case
for it and unfortunately that's what's

62
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,520
going to happen. So why would they
go after it? That's what's confusing.

63
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,730
If you've seen all these benefits and
I haven't heard anything about negative

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,880
results. Yeah, I don't,

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,900
I don't understand it myself to be
honest with you. It's, you know,

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,760
amnion it's been used clinically in the
United States for over a hundred years,

67
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,250
uh, without serious
adverse events. But, um,

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,040
I think it's more about the claims
that people are making because there,

69
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,010
there haven't been studies, for
example, of Amnion, you know,

70
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:08,170
amnion tissue injected into a joint.

71
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,850
And I think that the biggest concern is
the claims that are being made and maybe

72
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,760
people are being vulnerably,
you know, I don't know,

73
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,120
vulnerable to the economics of
it. I'm, I'm not really sure,

74
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:23,490
but I know that I just, you know,
I have my finger on the pulse and,

75
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,700
and that's, it seems like they're
gone. They're gone after fat. You know,

76
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,200
we were the first in the world
to use fat derived stem cells in,

77
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,400
in 2006 in 2007,

78
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:38,270
we published in on using those to treat
rheumatoid arthritis and, and, uh,

79
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,160
multiple sclerosis,
a,

80
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,790
and then a lot of doctors in
the u s started doing that now.

81
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,110
Now there's new guidance to industry
that came out a few months ago that

82
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,380
specifically prohibits using it for,
for example,

83
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,080
taking your own fat, isolating the
stem cells out of it, and then, uh,

84
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,920
injecting them in your bloodstream or
even a jacking him into a joint. So,

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,970
um, I, I don't, I don't
really know the whole,

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,180
the motivation behind it,
but I know that the,

87
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,680
the very clearly stated that
that's not going to fly anymore.

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,580
[inaudible]
yeah.
