1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,090
There's some scientists making weed now.
I mean they've gotten,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,670
they got real botanists involved.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,490
There's money in it now and now
that it's opening up in Canada,

4
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:12,990
it's going to be really weird because in
Canada they're making it legal, right?

5
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,180
It's legal now.
So um,

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm pretty sure RJ Reynolds is that who
it was and we just dumped a shit ton of

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:23,360
money and did some marijuana production
in Canada that's going to file suit in

8
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,360
the United States.
It's,

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:27,330
there's too much money involved in it
and it's going to be good for everybody.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,220
It's going to be good for capitalism.

11
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,450
It's going to be good for people getting
marijuana as long as regular people can

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,720
sell marijuana to let fucking Rj Reynolds,

13
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,720
as long as they don't put some
restrictions like they were trying to put,

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,760
was it you Jamie?

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,110
They told me about what they were trying
to do in Ohio where they were trying to

16
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,060
make it set up where you could,

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,500
you could grow weed but only a couple
companies could grow it so that we would

18
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,660
be legal, but only a couple
of companies would monopolize.

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,020
And then everybody was like, fuck
this. But Dad ended up passing it.

20
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:59,760
I believe that's terrible. It's sad
that that mean that's such a corruption.

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,220
That's like saying, okay,
you could have tomatoes,

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,900
but we're the only ones who grow these
fucking tomatoes. Like why? It's a tomato.

23
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,260
That's a law against nature. So you're
saying that nature can't take place.

24
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:12,330
I can't put a seed in the
ground and grow my own shit.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,540
Get the fuck Outta here is
illegal. It's illegal. Okay.

26
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,590
How's it different than corn? How's it
different than a fucking, uh, a pear tree?

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,880
It's not. It's a legal life form.
It's a life form. It's a plant.

28
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,340
You're allowed to grow it.
And if you say you can't grow it,

29
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,450
you got a corrupt system.

30
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:31,950
You got some bullshit law that you
weaseled in because he greased up some

31
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,530
assholes and the other people
don't have as much money as you do.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,240
So the only reason why that ever happens
or people are so desperate to get legal

33
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:44,190
weed that they let some dickhead dominate
the entire industry. Some greedy. Fuck.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,120
Now the deal is it's
legal or it's not legal.

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,470
Otherwise we're in some sort of a weird
dictatorship. You know, this is not,

36
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,950
you can't just decide it's
legal, but you're the only
one who gets to make money.

37
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,860
Fuck you. It's a plant. That's crazy.

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,920
Imagine if you owned all the pine
trees in the country. Donald Dominique,

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,270
my country, my pine trees. You want
to buy pine? You buying it from me?

40
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,910
I find you in a fucking Christmas tree.
I'll take you out crazy though.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,030
What happened last week? We call
[inaudible]. I don't know. In New York.

42
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,520
You said he's wants to legalize weed.
Oh yeah.

43
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:21,360
He wants to make it recreationally
legal in New York. Stupid to shoot down.

44
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,270
You should be making money off of
it. It exists. No matter what you do.

45
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,690
If you're a capitalist, if you're, you're
a person who believes in a free market.

46
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,320
You already have whiskey, urea,
half pills, people can get high.

47
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,770
They're not so just, they're just
not. Stop with the childish arguments.

48
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,460
Give the fucking people freedom
and make money off it. You dummies.

49
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,020
That's what everybody should be doing.

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,450
They should make it legal and
profit off it and it will.

51
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,040
It shouldn't stop with that either.

52
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,410
It should go to mushrooms should
go to a lot of different things.

53
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,460
They should set up clinics.

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,830
She set up places where people
can go through mushroom therapy.

55
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:54,060
People that suffer. They're coming
back from the war. PTSD. You know,

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,810
there's, there's so many different
benefits for depression, uh,

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
people that are getting ready
to, to, you know, to pass away.

58
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,620
They have extreme anxiety.
A lot of that is alleviated by mushrooms.

59
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,430
People that have gone through extensive
cancer treatment and realized their

60
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,264
terminal.

61
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,500
One of the best things for these people
as mushrooms is that it helps them ease

62
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:16,930
their pain and suffering.
And they'd last dying days.

63
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,690
And it doesn't seem to have
any negative effects, you know,

64
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,420
other than the occasional person
losing their fucking marbles,

65
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,950
which is going to happen
no matter what you do.

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,000
It's something that should be studied
and it shot something that should be free

67
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,130
and it could benefit people.
So it should be fucking legal.
