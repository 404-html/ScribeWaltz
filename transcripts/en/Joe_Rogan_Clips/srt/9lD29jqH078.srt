1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,130
Eight walkers at the, but, well, I don't
understand how you think that we, we,

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,730
you're almost losing America and there's
a battle for America in every regard in

3
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:15,570
terms of just the people that
were running like Hillary Clinton.

4
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,180
Like this woman was a globalist.
Like, just think about who we were,

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,990
who we were in bed with, like Saudi Arabia
selling all of our uranium to Russia.

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,580
Like, like Trump came in and was like,
no, like America people. We were the gap.

7
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,270
Like we lost them.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,660
We're losing the middleclass a gap
between the rich and the poor was like

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,860
literally causing that, uh, policies,

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,440
shipping all of our jobs overseas,
the regulation,

11
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,520
the government getting bigger and better.

12
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,580
You can't do anything as an entrepreneur
entrepreneur in America without a piece

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:44,550
of paper from the government, discouraging
people with this piece of paper,

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,360
like sending,

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,280
like shutting down the factories from
getting that there's something, you know,

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,810
there's a little land between New York and
La, I believe it or not. Like, you know,

17
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,740
and this is what Trump understood.
We were losing that and,

18
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:57,720
and Trump appealed to that.
Those people. I'm still floored,

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,560
like as I'm traveling the world and
seeing different pieces of the country,

20
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,720
I'm learning how ignorant I was like,

21
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:05,450
and that's the best thing
in the entire world.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,140
Just I fell victim to the idea that
like it was progress, it was progress,

23
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:13,110
it was progress. We have to care about
the environment. It was progress.

24
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:13,791
And it's like,
no,

25
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:17,880
like we've been losing America has been
losing and Donald Trump understood that.

26
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,540
And in a way that I didn't end, I thought
we have to care about the environment.

27
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,120
Not even a little bit, not
even a little bit. No. Okay.
Let me, let me clarify this.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,020
I don't throw trash on the ground. Like,
and I'm not saying like we need to like,

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,460
you know, trash the environment. Like, um,
but do I believe in climate change? No.

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,090
You don't believe in climate change?
I think the climate always changes,

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,240
I guess is what I should do.
I believe that this is like,
you know, an issue that,

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,120
um, is being that that
is fatal global warming,

33
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,070
which they've changed conveniently.
They got rid of the word one.

34
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:51,150
Scientists started disproving it now
based only say client climate change. Um,

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,090
now I think that that was just a way
to extract dollars from Americans.

36
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,760
I don't at all believe they had no
actionable plan. It was great for Trump.

37
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,370
Took out of that deal.
It was terrible. Okay.

38
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,550
But this is an incredibly
complicated subject, right?

39
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,930
If you would have to talk to a bunch of
different scientists and see how they

40
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:10,740
gathered data and see what they understand
about co two levels and what's the

41
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:13,690
danger of them, right, and what
can combat it and what could not.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,510
Have you done all this? So I think
flipping opinion. Listen, I'm not,

43
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:20,700
this is not, this wouldn't
be the hill I died on, right?

44
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,550
But it's not about the part. I just
genuinely, I've read a ton about it,

45
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:26,040
but I would not be able to, I would not
be able to come to you and say like,

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,190
this is my strong opinion. But here's
like the easiest way to say this, right?

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,190
The fact that there is a disparity in the
science committee about whether or not

48
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:36,330
it's real, it's enough to have
very little disparity. Most, most,

49
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,800
most scientists,

50
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,890
most the vast majority agree that human
beings are negatively affecting climate

51
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:47,670
change. Yeah. The vast
majority. Yeah. I don't,

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,920
I just don't think so.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,730
So you think that the very few scientists
that disagree with the consensus or

54
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:56,510
the ones that are correct? Well,
I think if something is it, it's,

55
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,130
it's either subjective or it's objective
and their objective truths. Right.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,500
But it's subjective.
If you're saying that there are some,

57
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,460
I don't think there's very little,

58
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:06,730
there are some that don't get paid to go
on TV then some of that or not bill Nye

59
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,570
who are not funded scientists.
Um, and, and that has been a hold,

60
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:12,630
well not assigned to,
you know,

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,890
just not broke my heart
when I found out mouthpiece.

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,770
But that's the, that's the
point. The son of a good word.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,540
I don't think Al Gore is a scientist,

64
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,880
but bill Nye is like a science
influencer or a science entertainer.

65
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,130
Like it doesn't have a background in
actual science. He's not a scientist,

66
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:36,530
doesn't have a phd in science,
had to do with Phil Knight.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,610
He promotes science.
Science is not bad.

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
But the real problem is with climate
change is that we for sure there has been

69
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,630
ups and downs throughout the history
of this planet. There are observable.

70
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,200
They've,

71
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,250
they followed them and we was one of the
subjects that I had earlier today with

72
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,820
um, Dr Robert Schoch in
2014, the vast majority,

73
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:02,020
87% of scientists said that human
activity is driving global warming.

74
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,440
Yet only half the American public
public ascribe to that view.

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,441
So 87% and this is scientific
American dotcom though.

76
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:14,320
Like that, that means it's, it's
making money. I don't trust that.

77
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,940
If it was a.org I would
probably take that.

78
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,600
But that this is just a random
website and scientific American is not

79
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,190
necessarily a random website. I don't
believe this at all. Just so you know,

80
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,590
you don't believe it. Like I genuinely
don't believe it. I know you do,

81
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,850
but I genuinely don't believe it.

82
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,620
I believe most of the time the consensus
of scientists that are studying the

83
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,454
data,

84
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,370
and so what they're doing is studying all
of the stories that came out about the

85
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,370
scientists that said that when they tried
to present their evidence to show like

86
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,500
they were basically just getting
shut down at every corner.

87
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,910
You can pull that up too. Like scientists
who look up, look up the opposite, right.

88
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,440
Instead of instead of looking for,
didn't search for it.

89
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:56,880
That's what I've found when
I searched it. Sorry. Yeah.

90
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,450
Look up is my question. Why are
you so sure? This is an extremely,

91
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,370
extremely complicated subject.
I said,

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,020
I am not so sure that I would die on
the hill for it. My opinion right now,

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,390
and it's just that it was a means,

94
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,270
because forget the fact of whether
you believe global warming is real.

95
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,630
Let's say it's 100% real estate. We know
faculty wheel. Is there a, well, let's,

96
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:24,100
let's be clear. Global warming, global
climate change is definitely real.

97
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,880
It's happening. The question is, has
happened. Yes. It has always happened.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,900
What are we, what is the, this is the
climate change. Yes, the climate changes.

99
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,740
It was different weather
yesterday than it was today.

100
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,590
The climate is forever changing like that.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,750
That's the problem is that
people are making it seem
like that's something weird.

102
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,510
No, not less. Not your, you're
misrepresenting the issue.

103
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:44,800
The issue is people think that human
beings are exacerbating climate change to

104
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,110
the point where there's a,
there's a tipping point.

105
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,610
We cross over that tipping point.

106
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:53,440
We're going to deal with huge problems
that could be corrected if we act now and

107
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:57,800
put a lot of funding into climate control
and this is what Howard bloom was on

108
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,450
talking about a few days ago.

109
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,170
He was talking about that the real
future involves the technology of climate

110
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:08,171
control and that what we have to be really
careful of is letting it get too far

111
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,420
where you can't ever
stop it and pull it back.

112
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,130
This is what scientists are warning about.

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,650
This is why they want emission standards.

114
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,760
This is why they want to figure out how
to get people to be aware of the fact

115
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:25,100
that this is a real issue. Now
it regardless. Human beings,

116
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,530
if they never existed, the earth
has constantly gone through cycles.

117
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,640
The question is not whether or not the
earth has gone through cycles of cooling

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,120
and warming, right? The question
is, are we exacerbating that?

119
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,260
The vast majority of scientists
say we are okay now this could,

120
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,010
this could negatively impact
all sorts of coastal cities.

121
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,660
This could be a gigantic problem.

122
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,780
This is not like propaganda that's drummed
up by some sort of big business that

123
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,480
seeks to make money off
of this or some sort of a,

124
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,020
well, they won't even say ship it.
Al Gore might've made some money off,

125
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,780
but who's making money off we went that
we were in and they were, they were.

126
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,210
That was like the amount of
money that America was losing.

127
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:07,510
But here's what I was gonna ask you,
so let's just let mount of money.

128
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,750
America was losing. What do you, who
was the mayor of Paris Agreement?

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,530
This is the reason why we wanted to
get out of the Paris agreement is,

130
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,710
but that's where I wanted to get to.

131
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,150
Let's say we all agree that global warming
is real. I don't believe it's real.

132
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,750
Okay. So I can't sit here. The
question for why have a belief?

133
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,430
What do you mean?

134
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,120
Why have a belief as to whether or not
global warming is real or not real?

135
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,600
Because I just, I just find that
you don't understand the science,

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,080
but why have a belief in it? Right. So
it's how I believe it's on a belief in,

137
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:39,970
I don't believe in it. But you have a
belief that it doesn't exist. I know.

138
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,940
I personally think that
this was just the next,

139
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,450
the fact that it was presented to us
by Al Gore and it's just, it was, yeah.

140
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,400
Not presented to us by just by Al
Gore. Al Gore made a v a film. Right.

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,650
And he's been called like the first green
billionaire who's made a shit load of

142
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,300
yeah.

143
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,740
Any flies in his private plane because
he's so worried about the admissions.

144
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,450
Okay. That is hilarious.
Hilarious about that.

145
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,300
All of the people that are telling
us a fucking politician, right.

146
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,990
There's gross and is to all that stuff.
Right. And that's what worries me.

147
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:09,830
So my question is, let's
say that it's real. Okay.

148
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,310
Let's just assume like if that's
the best way to have it today,

149
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,550
let's say it's 100%.
Yeah.

150
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,920
Do you feel that you have found in your
research that there is something that

151
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:22,130
human beings can do that
would change this all around?

152
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,360
That's possible?
Yes.

153
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,850
One of the things that they're figuring
out how to pull carbon out of the

154
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:29,180
atmosphere and even even
possibly reuse it. There's,

155
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:32,270
there's all sorts of things that people
are trying to do. I mean we had, um,

156
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,590
what was the young man who made
that uh, device boy, boy on slot.

157
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,660
He figured out a way to uh,

158
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,950
make this device that pulls plastic out
of the oceans. They're figuring out a way

159
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,390
very important.
Yeah.

160
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,880
There's a lot of it will pick as
plastic just can't like over time.

161
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,860
But that's what I mean. Like,
so when I say that I'm like,

162
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,980
and I believe in recycling.
Like I'm not like a person that's like,

163
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:55,470
this is the idea that the government is
just going to take the trillions dollars

164
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,930
because we're in some agreement where
we're all agreeing that we should do

165
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:01,560
something. Is, is useless.
And look from the stuff.

166
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,740
Like there's obviously a lot of debate
here. And as I said, like I'm not,

167
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,950
so at the one thing you'll always find
with me is I'll never pretend to be so

168
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:08,450
educated.

169
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,370
Something like I'm not going out in
college campuses talking about global

170
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,980
warming. I don't do that. Right. But why
are you saying that you don't, I just,

171
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,920
I just don't, I just, I don't know.
Maybe because they got so close,

172
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,110
maybe because it got so politicized,

173
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,250
uh, studies into scientific
agreement on human cause,

174
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,010
global warming and look
at all the studies.

175
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,190
It's between a hundred
percent and 91% at the lowest.

176
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,550
91% of one of the studies from 2014
with the Union of concerned scientists.

177
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,610
Yeah. Work. They almost, it's,
it's a pretty broad consensus.

178
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,670
Who Do,
who are they pulling?

179
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,620
Is it the people that are a part of
this? No. Um, it's a good question.

180
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,850
That's what I'm asking.
10,306 scientists to confirm.

181
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:58,851
Over 97% of climate scientists agree in
over 97% of the scientific articles find

182
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:03,870
that global warming is real
and largely caused by humans.

183
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,860
So my question to you is if you want to
step outside of the scientific consensus,

184
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,130
which is vast and involves
10,306 scientists and just say,

185
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:18,030
I don't believe in it. Yeah, even if
you're right, even if you're right,

186
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,590
you don't have enough information
to say that. Right? Correct.

187
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,670
I said this is what you're saying.
You don't.

188
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,661
I don't,
but yeah,

189
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,960
I would have to have someone sit down
and convince me that it was real.

190
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,230
I personally don't believe
it. That's okay. It's good.

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,480
It's good to start at a place of not
believing something. No, it's not.

192
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,060
You think you should start with
believing everything. Okay.

193
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,230
It's did not believe either or
not believe. Yes. Not believe, no,

194
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,550
but don't say you don't
believe. Yeah. I learn about it.

195
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,590
Learn about it and then have an opinion.

196
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:46,660
But you're stating this
opinion without having any real

197
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,920
standing on what climate science, but
that's, that's exactly what an opinion is.

198
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:53,160
I'm not going, like I said,
if, if, if you said that Ken,

199
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:55,670
as you went on to 10,000 college
campuses and you said that global warming

200
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:58,840
wasn't real, then we'd have a problem.
You and I are just having a conversation.

201
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,250
Yeah. But why have an opinion on
something that you don't have data about?

202
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,610
This is my question. Like, yeah,

203
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,800
I don't necessarily have an opinion
on climate science. I really don't,

204
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,240
cause I don't know much about it.

205
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,330
But what I do know is that what I've
read is that the vast majority of people

206
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,030
study it or an agreement the
human beings are affecting. Yeah.

207
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,900
I don't, I just, my recall on a
lot of the things that I read,

208
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:23,060
and this was a while ago, so this is why
where I, when I first formed my opinion,

209
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:26,770
I'm not believing this. I read a shit
ton of articles, can't recall the data.

210
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:28,710
Cause it's like I said, this was
something I was super passionate about.

211
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:31,930
It was like somebody posted something
and then I went on like a tear or reading

212
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:35,920
about it. Um, but it was
essentially just noting that.

213
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:38,070
And a lot of the studies,
like when you go in, you,

214
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,860
if we had time to sit down and really
pull this up, they're pulling, you know,

215
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,200
10,000 scientists that are within a
community that is fun. Like these.works.

216
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,120
Do you believe? And everything that
media matters. Dot media matters.

217
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:52,630
Dot Org puts out for statistics.
Right? That's a political,

218
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:54,670
that's a arm of the Democratic Party,

219
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,010
but I know,
but I'm just politics versus science,

220
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,620
but this has been politicized that
science has been politicized. Yes, it has.

221
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,760
Global warming in particular has been
politicized 100% it has been politicized.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,211
Right.

223
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:10,180
That's the whole reason that I fell down
this dark hole one night reading about

224
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:12,640
it and I did. I was like, you know
what mean the day? I don't really care.

225
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,990
It has been politicized.

226
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,140
I think that's also maybe why you're
saying you don't agree with it so quickly

227
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,030
because it's an idea.
That's why I read it.

228
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:23,230
An ideological right wing point
is that global warming isn't real.

229
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,990
If you're one of those people that
thinks global warming isn't real,

230
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:28,720
you're almost always on
the right and that's fine.

231
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,430
But I'm telling you that again,

232
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,420
I didn't do a deep dive on all of this
because I read about it because it was at

233
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,350
a forefront of discussion.

234
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,350
And so I read about it all night and my
conclusion was that they started pulling

235
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:41,110
up all of these studies from the person
that you know did this and I did a deep

236
00:12:41,111 --> 00:12:44,860
dive on and they started showing how like
these community of scientists were in

237
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:48,190
fact somewhere behind that.org as
someone that was being funded. So to me,

238
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,880
the issue got to politicize for me to,
to,

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,610
to believe that global warming was
something that was going to wipe out the

240
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,180
world.
Now that is a fact,

241
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,900
but that doesn't mean that the funding
affects the scientific research and the

242
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,550
data which they all agree on.

243
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,090
And this is universally
across the entire plant,

244
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,160
thousands and thousands of scientists
would not stake their reputation on false

245
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:12,960
data.

246
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,960
What what they're saying is not that
the only reason why the world is getting

247
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:21,820
warm is because human beings that the
only reason why the climate isn't totally

248
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:24,580
static for the rest of eternity
because of human beings.

249
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,730
What they're saying is we are negatively
impacting our own environment and we're

250
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:34,861
doing it because we existing negative in
RG and we use coal and fossil fuels and

251
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,090
emissions and we're raising our co two
levels and this is based on data and this

252
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,380
is,
this is something that you can look at.

253
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,160
You could look at the data and follow
where they're getting this information

254
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,520
from and follow how they're making
these conclusions and follow.

255
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,700
The vast majority of these brilliant
people study the shit their whole life.

256
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,731
And if I look,

257
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,510
if I was a person that was putting forth
policy on climate change or if I was a

258
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:05,890
person that put out by opinion
publicly on Paul on on climate change,

259
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:08,890
I would do all of that. I'm just
not, I understand what you're saying,

260
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,430
but what I'm saying is that you are a
very smart person and people listen to you

261
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:15,430
and they're going to listen to you for
a long time. I believe this is a this,

262
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,180
but hold on, let me finish
what I'm saying. One,

263
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,190
depending on how you don't have to
have a formal opinion on everything.

264
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:25,570
What you do have to have is the ability
to know when you don't know what the

265
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:29,330
fuck you're talking about. You said
you don't believe it. Don't be.

266
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,140
Maybe you asked me and I said this
wouldn't be the hill I chose to die on

267
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:33,490
because I don't,
I don't why?

268
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,210
Let's say you don't believe
in because I just personally,

269
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,100
if you bought not have a belief until
you really prefer if my language as

270
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:45,130
opposed to admitting that I do not
know this, I wouldn't die on this hill.

271
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,750
I've never made a B.
I've never made a public statement.

272
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:49,930
You would have preferred if I had
just started it by saying I have no,

273
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,860
I have no opinion. No, don't know.

274
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,030
Okay. That's what I'm saying. You, you
say, don't you say, I don't believe in it.

275
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,380
I don't believe it.
You're,

276
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,930
you're saying really clearly that
you don't think it's real. I mean,

277
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,640
I think it would be the same if I
said to you like, you know, uh, do,

278
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,820
do you believe in God right
now? I would say, I don't know.

279
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,590
I feel like this is sort of
like linguistics though. No,
I would say, I don't know.

280
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:17,150
I always say I'm agnostic. People say
like, I believe I believe it or I don't.

281
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,760
Right. So it's like if you say, I think
a lot of people say they don't know.

282
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,010
I think believe is definitely where
the associated with God. But, um,

283
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,880
but if you say, I don't believe in God,
and then somebody starts saying, oh,

284
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,770
you need to form it did, it's like, it
just, I just don't believe in it. No,

285
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,190
you don't.
Because God is not scientific data.

286
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,430
There's a big difference between measuring
the co two levels in the atmosphere

287
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,690
and the deciding whether or not
there's an afterlife. I just, I,

288
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm sorry that I just don't believe,
I don't believe in global warming.

289
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:48,410
I'm happy to
five.

290
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,940
I had married an influencer and
you're a very bright person.

291
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,390
I would if somebody had asked me like
at a place where on influencing on a

292
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:59,240
college campus, what's your
opinion? I would say I have none.

293
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,920
I bet you would say I don't
believe in it like you just did.

294
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,940
Absolutely not what you just did it.

295
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,830
There are so many instances where
you could watch it just like,

296
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,840
and you can ask Dave Ruben when he asks
me a question, I say I don't have, no,

297
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,860
you and I are having a
conversation one on one. I'm not,

298
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,350
I'm not sitting here to try to,

299
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,390
I don't go on campus talking about
global warming because I don't,

300
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't have an opinion on it. If you
press me and asked if I believe in it. No,

301
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,910
I don't really believe in it,
but it could I go deep dive and and,

302
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,840
and learn that perhaps I'm wrong.
Sure.

303
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,140
I personally am inclined to believe that
a lot of those studies are manipulated.

304
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,220
As I said during the one night that did
deep dive on it and when they showed

305
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,500
like all of the pieces
of evidence or whatever,

306
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,720
it just seemed a little shaky and
I felt that it was politicized.

307
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,510
But I think I have a right to say
that I don't believe in something,

308
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:43,190
but I then I also don't know.
And that's what I said to you.

309
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,410
I don't believe in it,
but I wouldn't die on this hill.

310
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:46,400
I don't know enough about it.

311
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,980
But you also said you don't believe
in it and you stated the reason why,

312
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:56,210
because you think it's a scam. I don't,
that's the truth. What do want me to do?

313
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,910
I'm gonna lie to you. I'm not, I'm not
sitting here saying like hated issue.

314
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,650
It may complicate. That's fine. But what
do you want me to lie to you and say,

315
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,640
if I'm not a politician, you want me to
say you should the correct term. Like the,

316
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,280
I feel like this is like the editing of
people do like when they're like, oh,

317
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,780
a bond. If they ask a
question, you don't know.

318
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,840
This is the way I'm not running for
office. I'm answering, I'm talking to you.

319
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,360
I don't believe in it. I
appreciate you. I can't be fake.

320
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,380
This is my number one problem
in life is I can't be fake.

321
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:24,230
And I know that you're pressing the air
and that you want me to adjust and to

322
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:28,310
say like, I don't, I do not have an
opinion or the, but I'm not a politician.

323
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,230
I'm telling you I don't believe in it.
Could I? Could I change my perspective?

324
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,700
It was even in a year after I read
just a regular person, you said,

325
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,690
I don't believe that I'd probably go all
right. The problem is you're not, you're,

326
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:43,610
you're, uh, you're a very influential, I'm
aware when I'm on stage, when I'm on my,

327
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,320
you could tell you
there's no videos of can.

328
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:49,650
If someone's talking about global
warming, I'm aware of that. Exactly.

329
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,520
Now it's going to be rubbing again. It's
by the way. I should, yeah, exactly.

330
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,350
We're going to be mad at me.
We know. What's funny though,

331
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,260
is that like it, this feels so like
we're not on the Internet right now,

332
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,660
but it's like I still don't
feel like we're on the
Internet. This is the problem.

333
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:07,480
Yeah. Well, like if we were,
if you and I are on a college
campus, I'd be like, Eh, I,

334
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,270
I'm not really sure.
I don't have them for my discussion.

335
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,810
Jack Shit about global
warming or really don't. Yeah.

336
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,910
I think with the real fear
is not even global warming.

337
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,350
The real fear is global cooling.

338
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,710
The Ice Age is the most terrifying thing
that can happen. Human beings. Yeah.

339
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,560
That shit happens. Everybody dies.
Yeah. I know. Global warming,

340
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,790
you just move inland.
Yeah.

341
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,150
I think that the real thing that
people are concerned about is like,

342
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,920
just beyond any of that stuff.
I don't know.

343
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,780
I think that there's like
more concerned in society.

344
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,560
Like I personally think
that some scientists are
talking about global warming

345
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:35,341
and it got politicized.

346
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,860
They figured it was another way to extract
human beings money because of fear.

347
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:40,650
That's my opinion. Okay. I think
there's probably some truth to that.

348
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,650
We're going to find our core scientists
that agree with everything we saved.

349
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,650
It's improving that Harvard studies
had been in incorrect because they were

350
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:49,520
being funded by, I'm certain you
know, political interest groups,

351
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:53,370
so I'm not inclined to pull
up something on a, and. M

352
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,490
I'm blanking.
It'll come back to me in a second.

353
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:59,430
But there were Harvard papers that had
been funded by certain researchers that

354
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:03,150
are trying to get a certain political
position out in it causes mass fear and

355
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,840
people are willing to spend their money
a certain way. Charlie possible. It is.

356
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,640
It's real. That's very real. People
are flawed, so I'm not inclined.

357
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:11,670
When someone pulls up an article
and says, look, a 10,000 scientists,

358
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:13,800
I err on the side of, okay, I
don't know those scientists are,

359
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,870
I don't know what the rest
organization is funded by,

360
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,480
so I'm going to stick by my guns and say,
I don't really believe in it yet. Now,

361
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,240
if I decide that I'm going to run for
office and I've got to make a decision on,

362
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,430
on the atmosphere and in,

363
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,660
in what we're going to do about
global warming and cu two missions,

364
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,880
you better believe I will be
fully ready to discuss it.

365
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,700
I'm not going to make a youtube video
and just know the outskirts of it.

366
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:32,970
I don't do that. Right. But if you
and I are having a discussion, sorry,

367
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:37,560
I don't believe it. Like, I mean
almost to say, open, open to learning,

368
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,220
open to learn, always open to
learning. I've, I've been wrong before.

369
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,610
I was a liberal two years ago, you
know, um, or three years ago. So that's,

370
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:49,370
that's not a problem. I'm
open to learning, but I'm not
going to like pretend like,

371
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:51,980
say something that feels inauthentic.
And what I wanted to say there was,

372
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:54,320
I don't believe in it. It's just one
of those things that it's become,

373
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,090
it's a real right wing talking points.
