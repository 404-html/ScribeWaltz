1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,190
I just don't want to be the
weakest link ever on a film. So,

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,160
so that's what you want to do when you're
done with all that? For sure. For sure.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,680
Did you, is that always been an
aspiration or is it something you saw?

5
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:13,990
I was like a way to do it after.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,570
Oh Man. Got a lot of stuff, you know,

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,040
I don't really even like fighting real
honest. Yeah, I'm just good at it.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,250
What don't you like about it?
I don't like the politics behind it.

9
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:26,220
I don't like the, a martial art
aspect has been taken away from it.

10
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:30,460
I don't like to um, disrespect to
the sport. Um, guys that are not,

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,090
not really training hard.
Um, it don't look the part.

12
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,740
I think professional athletes,
you'll look a certain way. Um,

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,760
I really just don't like the youth.
Um,

14
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,920
this generation of fighters at watching
move on TV on youtube and they're going,

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,570
they tried to do it.
They don't want to drill repetitious lead.

16
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,990
I don't want to actually put in the work.
Um, why does that affect you though?

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,110
It affects me because our sport is also
the fans and the fans actually cultural

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,770
who gets to fight and if a guy's going
to talk to enough shit and so I were in

19
00:00:56,771 --> 00:00:59,250
flight suits then this day and age,

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
that's good enough for a tighter shot
and I think there's disrespectful to

21
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:06,090
everybody that came before that.
Remember that you had to go tend to know.

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,970
Then you get the fucking
call from the UFC,

23
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,950
give Connor want and low ball fund in
the UFC and a 500 record he's going to be

24
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:16,600
in the UFC. And I just, it's,

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
it's ways that the sport is
taking the love out of it,

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,440
but I just find a way in
dominated my opponents,

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,020
taking all their tools away from them,
you know,

28
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,490
Dean Tom and shout out to them and
Duke Roufus or fucking masterminds.

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,930
So I take pride in that, take pride and
going in there. They're not getting hit,

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,130
um, dominated, knocking people
out, whatever. When you say
you don't like fighting,

31
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,740
you like all those things you don't
like to what other people are doing?

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,090
I love training. I don't like what I
don't like the split the sport has become,

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,330
so this is an interesting thing to
talk about because a lot of people have

34
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,400
different points of view on that.
And one hand,

35
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,680
a lot of people like the traditional
martial arts approach of respect for your

36
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,820
opponent and just fighting to the best
of your abilities and letting the chips

37
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,970
fall where they may. Whereas
other people say, well listen,

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,230
to get people to show up, to get
asses in seats, to get paper view bys,

39
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,350
there's gotta be some drama and
some entertainment value to it.

40
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:13,110
And that's where someone like Connor
comes into Connor's the only one has done

41
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,850
it though. Yeah. Well Rhonda a little bit.

42
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,830
Rhonda did it a little bit.
Connor is done it the best.

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,530
He actually puts in the work he a
son in before he has a sunny day,

44
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:23,590
but he didn't,
he he his mouth,

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,770
his mouth was louder and he's actually
probably the best at it. He's,

46
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,950
he's probably, he's better than
Conor edit columns, very close.

47
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,300
But Connor actually delivers on more than
more of what he said he's going to do

48
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,500
it in shell did.
I would agree.

49
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:39,280
So if you got to think of anybody who's
brought both worlds together best,

50
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,760
I would have to say Connor,
he knocks a lot of guys.

51
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,220
I would try to call the round,
he's only lost a few fights total.

52
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,720
And even though it's fights,

53
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,720
it was RiskMatch war fighting
the guy switched opponent.

54
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,990
This node is different
weight class. Um, you know,

55
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,450
he's second those risks and
rewards that if you lose,

56
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,850
it's not really that big of a deal.
You know, nobody's going to really,

57
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:00,160
oh my God dropping down
to the bottom of the pack.

58
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,750
But these other guys that haven't
done it don't have the skills,

59
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,890
ain't putting in the work.

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,920
I mean it can kind of really just
where you see the trend, right?

61
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:13,810
There is a trend right now
at least though, incredibly
disrespectful, very rude.

62
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,500
And you know, you saw what happened
with Colby Covington and you know,

63
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:21,580
at least be good at Marangu. You know
what I mean? Daddy pressing charges.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,540
I mean that is a Queef.
Well this coward Queef Clinton.

65
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,300
There's a lot of attention being placed
on him though. I mean you, let me see.

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,460
It's nicely effective. Let me see how
much attention is being placed in mind.

67
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,510
It is effective in the moment, right? I
mean don't want to go back to this stuff.

68
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,600
It's effective in a moment.
I'm going to tell you why because um,

69
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:46,020
sometimes that's sometime I sports
is like, you know, nothing going on.

70
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,920
It was like fuck with this is
talking shit. Let me listen to him.

71
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,370
And right there at that point kind
of was around, Rhonda wasn't around.

72
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,910
I wasn't around who is UFC
really projected as a star?

73
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,270
Sage Northcutt had a few bumps.
Paige vanzant had a few bumps.

74
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,900
They tried to push up and Ghana.
But what started to have,

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,630
so if you've got this person
that's willing to go crazy,

76
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,750
even though we know it's WWE,
the person is really not getting slammed.

77
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,020
We want to live in that moment anyway.
We want to go for the villain.

78
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,310
Who has he really beat behind Damien Maia?
Well,

79
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,130
what was the other top 15 victory?
Well, the Damien Maia was a big one,

80
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:19,740
but that was a big one.
But he was one,

81
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,460
but he was unmotivated and he was a guy
that already had his title shots and you

82
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,370
know, he's getting up there in
age. What is really his motivation?

83
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,880
I wrote the book on how to beat Damien
Maia and he didn't even read the book.

84
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,940
He just skim through it because
no part of the book said,

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,270
let the Jujitsu guy to fuck you
up and bloody your face cold.

86
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,840
Because Cindy did that by himself.
I didn't do that. You know,

87
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,720
even with my right arm being
messed up. So, um, yeah, he just,

88
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:47,590
I'm just looking like how
many followers just have,

89
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,320
like, he didn't have a big following
before that. That was his biggest fight.

90
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,110
That was the big, the big coming. I don't
want to this credit, I'm Damien Maia.

91
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:01,110
Minimize a, Gee, you know, I don't want
to discredit Colby, but you know, for you,

92
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,380
for me, have some people in your resume
have some, you know, I didn't be Derek.

93
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,830
I mean Teryx Hafeni,
Paul Daley, Jordan, me,

94
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:12,400
and this is before I even got in the UFC.
My first fight was Jay Herron,

95
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,210
who had only been stopped by George Saint
Pierre lost one fight to be in action

96
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:20,320
that was close and had won every fight
after that. So I never had it easy fight.

97
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,190
All my guys was either former champions
or former contenders are former,

98
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,080
you know, people that were
interim champions and when
you got a list like that,

99
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,090
you should don't get the respect Koscheck
Condon when he [inaudible] you don't

100
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:38,570
get the respect from who if I caught
them, oh my God can care less what

101
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,560
they have to respect. You
definitely get respect. Watch this.

102
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,650
When you think of Robbie Lawler,
Carlos Condit, right? Right.

103
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,190
They're in a different category as
it were to you that I'm the champion.

104
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,920
I beat both of those guys.
What do you mean by a different category?

105
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,200
I th I see them in a category
then this might just be me.

106
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,560
I see them as in the category is if
you're talking about guys who are going to

107
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,990
enter the hall of fame,
right?

108
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,140
And you think about all
Josh Koscheck and um, oh,

109
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,670
Carlos condit and Robbie Lawler and you
know this guy and Anderson Silva doll,

110
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,260
all those different guys. But it's funny
that I've defeated these guys, right?

111
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,360
You're crazy. You're talking
crazy. I don't think so. No,

112
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,500
you definitely talking crazy.
You're the champ champ. You,

113
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,220
you're acting like people don't
respect you as the champ. They respect,

114
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:31,120
they respect the people out. Carlos
condit gets more respect or rather log.

115
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,280
It's more,
that's crazy.

116
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,680
Carlos condit gets more respected. Me.
Robbie Lawler gets my respect to me.

117
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,880
But from who though? Sure. Even guys,
even guys that I defeated, like,

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,860
you know, um, Stephen Thompson, he drops
and they'll get more respect to me.

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,030
I'm not gonna say that, but people are
willing to be like, oh my God. You know,

120
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:52,030
tell them Dana said, tell them to
get in the cage with Tyrone Woodley.

121
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,100
He didn't say,
hey tire and tell them to get in.

122
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:56,680
Case with Stephen Thompson
on a seven fight win streak,

123
00:06:56,681 --> 00:07:00,970
knocking everybody fuck out with a really
super word style that took me months

124
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:05,050
in a fortune, bringing all these fucking
crazy taekwondo, Raymond Daniels,

125
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,410
all these, the best of the
best to train him to beat him.

126
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,810
Like nobody gave me that pass.

127
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,800
I don't know why you concentrate on that.

128
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,560
I know that seems but you are
because you're talking about it.

129
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm not concentrating on when he has
these nutty thoughts. I'm telling him,

130
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,290
telling me, I'm telling you this is all
nonsense. This is a wasted, wasted energy.

131
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,560
You think when you think about and that
it doesn't matter to me because my path

132
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,380
is pretty clear what I want to do. I
want to do the best. I want to rent.

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,440
I want to be the best waltz with
defending undisputed UFC welterweight.

134
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,930
We in 2007 when that was the shit.

135
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,000
Now Shit is in the middle of wire.

136
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:47,370
It's kind of middle of last quarter and
they fight and supervise that are bigger

137
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:51,540
than a world title fight because I know
you as much you don't know you as much

138
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,340
yet and whether whatever.
Look,

139
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,300
Connor is a weird enigma and whatever
reason why that got caught fire the way he

140
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:01,820
did. It's a weird combination
of personality, results,
skill. It's a lot of,

141
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,330
and Ireland, Ireland is a big factor.
I mean, if Conner was from Nebraska,

142
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,950
I guarantee you
it's not just a big fight country.

143
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:14,490
The loyalty and the love that those
people have for the people that fight from

144
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:18,080
Ireland. There's not no, there's
nothing like that. It's, it's a,

145
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,440
it's a weird anomaly,

146
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:24,441
so he's just this weird aberration and
he gives people almost like false hope of

147
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,440
what's possible because I don't know if
it's possible with a lot of people just,

148
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,000
it just, it's lightening in a bottle
for whatever reason. It worked with him,

149
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,920
but he started it himself and then what
happened? Her company jumper cables. Yeah.

150
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,600
You'll see. Put the
machine behind them. Right?

151
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,360
They definitely put them in the machine.
Behind him.

152
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,810
There was giant hordes of
people flying in from Ireland.

153
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:48,330
I remember one of some of his
earlier fights I was like,

154
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,040
and I was commenting on and I was saying
this is a guy who was on the undercard

155
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,100
and they're acting like this is
the main event, a paper view.

156
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,540
They've flown from Ireland.

157
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,290
The audience is filled with thousands
of people that flew from Ireland

158
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,170
and now it has does. Even back
then. It was insane when he fell,

159
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,440
he know him back then. You know, it was
funny, somebody while striking coach,

160
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,950
she's like, Conor Mcgregor's is
huge star and da Da da Da. I'm like,

161
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,710
that's where he at first
got into UFC and I'm like,

162
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,830
I don't even know who the fuck
is cute is he was telling,

163
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,410
he was trying to convince me, no,
he's a superstar, he's Dah, Dah, Dah.

164
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,330
And then every time I get a chance I
said, you were right. He wasn't dead.

165
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,600
But there's more of a get ended up being
a superstar and he loves to get their

166
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,690
credit because at that moment I think I
was getting ready to fight Doug and Kim

167
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,660
and he kept home at this Conor McGregor.
So I said, let me look. This is my focus.

168
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,840
Let me look them up because you
obviously got a boner for this dude,

169
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,960
and I looked him up. I'm like,
all right, he's good. I get it,

170
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,520
but let me see and beat a couple people
and then if he can beat Dus, import, Yay.

171
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,630
Then I'm going to give him
his props. Knocking. Talk to
us. Important doesn't pray.

172
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:54,810
I said, all right, well,
he's 100% legit. He's legit,

173
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,780
but it's what else is going
on? It's so weird. It's,

174
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,420
he's not just legit.

175
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,990
He's also this unbelievable personality
that people are drawn to him.

176
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,730
That's no one can manufacture
that like he's, he's rehearsed it.

177
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:12,150
He's practiced that. He's looked in
the mirror, he has natural wit. He's,

178
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,240
he's willing to go risky and
say some below the bill shit,

179
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,960
and he does his research. He don't come
to a press conference, just you know,

180
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,210
smoking.
You liked the front row of a comedy show.

181
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,440
He looking into some deep shit and
when you get there you kind of stumble.

182
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,820
So you're right. He has that.
He also has a fight style.

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,300
He also has so happened to do
80% of shit he says going to do.

184
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,680
So now he's the fucking Messiah.

185
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,900
But you can't say that the UFC has not
gotten behind you or people don't give

186
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:40,980
you the respect that you deserve.

187
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:44,170
That's why you are not in the same
level as you said. You said that it,

188
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:47,400
him and Connor are super fights.

189
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm saying that he has gotten it and I
was saying that he has gotten it and he

190
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:55,790
has lived up to what he said he's going
to do. And then on top of that, you gotta,

191
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,060
you gotta be able to fight. He can fight
and he has been able to talk. So now,

192
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:03,420
not only Kinney, generate the paper,
view bys and get people interested.

193
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,220
He's actually going to deliver a knockout
against Josie auto stop as it gets

194
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:12,380
Eddie Alvarez. And the crazy, you know,
back to back fights with when they did.

195
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,670
Don't you think that you're
in an unusual situation?

196
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:18,200
First of all because you win the title
by spectacular first round knockout

197
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,240
against Robbie Lawler,
right? Unbelievable knockout.

198
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,480
But then you have the most awkward
and difficult God to defend your title

199
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,660
against Wonderboy.

200
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:32,640
Thompson is a very unusual opponent and
it's hard to look good against them and

201
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,200
that'll all the people that fought him,

202
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,350
you're the only guy
that put him in danger.

203
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:40,650
Not once but twice and
the way you fought him.

204
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,140
I've defended the way you fought
him many times. Cause I say, look,

205
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:48,020
if you look at tactically, if you look
at technique and you look at the, the,

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,580
the art of fighting,
that's the way to find them.

207
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,310
If you're a guy like Tyron Woodley, a
powerful punch, it was a great wrestler.

208
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,220
Who's got one real one punch,
knockout ability.

209
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,400
You're not going to open yourself
up to Wonderboy. Exactly.

210
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,070
And don't get picked apart.

211
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,370
You're not going to fight him the way
he wants to fight would you did as you

212
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:10,870
laid back a lot and people booed a lot
because of that. But when you connected,

213
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,990
you are the one that heard
him in those two fights.

214
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,220
He was the one that was in big trouble
in both of those fights, not you.

215
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,430
Well, his fight was, it was, it was
not for me. I'm never, um, you know,

216
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:26,070
I got the same thing in the Maya fight,
but at the end of the day,

217
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,970
if someone's attempted to take you
down multiple times, over 20 times,

218
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,700
it's very hard to get in any type
of change. Every time you swing,

219
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,670
they want to go on and eat three shots.

220
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,850
Well, the Maya fight was
tough too because your injury,

221
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:39,750
but you got to go back and look
at like Anderson Silva dark days.

222
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:43,020
There was a dark days when Anderson Silva
fought Damien Maia where nobody wants

223
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:47,200
to have anything to do with them after
that fight. And Anderson Silva fought. Um,

224
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,910
when he fought there, there's,
there's several fights where, um,

225
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,030
he had just boring results and people
weren't interested in him fighting

226
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,210
anymore. One spectacular
knockout and everybody's back

227
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,063
got it.
It again.

228
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,360
And then one spectacular knock out to
get the belt and then everybody slowly

229
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:09,830
forget about it moments later. Cause
at the time Stephen Thompson said, Nah,

230
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,710
where the fight Robbie and I think
he's going to win anyway and that Ah,

231
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,590
and then he think I'm supposed to be just
so graciously like God that's fighting

232
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,360
the honor. And the na you wanted to
fight Robbie, right? You say rob,

233
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,110
who's going to win?

234
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,260
You say you personally prefer to write
fight rob because I'd been waiting around

235
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,700
even though that wasn't the
case. So you said this, uh,

236
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,020
so don't think that I'm just going to
give you my spotlight and say, hey,

237
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:33,590
you know what the others do this. No.
If I'm seeing the table being set,

238
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,950
I know there's Nate disease out there.
Nikki is out there.

239
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:39,950
George Saint Pierre is Michael Bay's
means guys that have that name,

240
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,200
they have that status
that I'm trying to get to.

241
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,120
Those are the guys I wanna fight.

242
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,960
I want to knock those guys now because
now I can continue to intro myself up

243
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,980
fighting him. Well, he's trying to
get the same thing I'm trying to get.

244
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,160
Why the hell am I going to pull
you up with me if that's the fight?

245
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,620
They wanted me to fight one on one.
They never offered me to fight.

246
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,150
He said something. Then I think the
UFC thought I wouldn't take the fights.

247
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,110
The first time they offered
me the fight accepted it.

248
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,570
So when all these people are like,
oh my God,

249
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,150
you don't want to fight trying to pick
his fights, he's just got the belt.

250
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm like, Ooh man, you,
it's not, I'm talking about

251
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,590
too many people saying things that
you're responding to that are,

252
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:16,490
that are irrelevant.

253
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,180
I think it's the two people that that are
in the organization. I got to, you know,

254
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,470
you're dealing with people that I
don't deal with them in that regard,

255
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:27,440
but as far as like people
that are analysts and experts,

256
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
as far as like the social media,
like I really don't read social media.

257
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,990
I post because I want to post and I'll
leave it alone. So that's why I say that.

258
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm not saying without saying who it is.

259
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,510
I'm not saying that the fans are making
me feel some type of way. Cause my,

260
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,480
my path is clear. I want to be the
greatest welterweight of all time.

261
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,540
[inaudible].
