1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,350
Yeah, it's gonna be tough for him.
Well, they were trying to get him, um,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,510
he was trying to get the
Conor McGregor fight.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,470
That had been a tough fight for him.
It would've been a tough fight for him.

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,760
But at 155 pounds is not a bad
fight for him. No, not really.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,580
But I mean,
the problem is stylistically he just does,

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,020
he doesn't move his head enough.
Yeah. You know, and Nate, I mean,

7
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:26,370
Nate doesn't either, but Nate took a lot
of shots, you know, to the hit. So I mean,

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,780
it's kind of a bad, I don't
know. Yeah. But Nate, Nate is a,

9
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,370
Nate is a very good boxer.
Yeah. Make a box. Nate Diaz is,

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,510
it frustrates the shit out of me
that he's not fighting. Why is that?

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,850
Because I like to see him.
I want to see him get in there.

12
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:43,590
I want to see him make
money while he can too.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,860
I mean you're only going to be able
to live this lifestyle for, I mean,

14
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,020
I know he made a couple of million
dollars off of the Conor fight,

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,430
but he hasn't fought in two years more
than handling and else like put the dust

16
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,750
employee a fight that was going to happen,
but then Poria got injured,

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,570
he's got some hip issue and then he
pulled out of that fight. I just,

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,240
I was looking forward to that
fight. I want to, I want to
see him back in it. Yeah.

19
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:09,810
But I mean I would've loved to seen that
fight and then never supposed to find

20
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:14,400
Mazda doll. That's, that's not
going to happen. Oh, why? I Dunno.

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,830
That's the perfect fight.
Great fight the fight.

22
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:20,790
Where you going to got like the Hispanic
culture, the civil war and that's fine.

23
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:23,160
Yola going at it.
Yeah.

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,850
That would have been a great stylist
and like they would have talked trash to

25
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,070
each other.
It would have been crazy.

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,610
Whoever dropped the ball
on that needs to be fired.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,100
I think nick just decided not fight. I
don't know. I do not know. I don't know.

28
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,350
I'm talking out of my ass.
I don't know the specifics,

29
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,290
but I was looking forward to it.
But then I saw an article that said Nate,

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,530
Nick Diaz confirms he's not going to
be fighting in the UFC to 35 I'm like,

31
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,060
what? What? Get in there. Oh come on man.

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,100
Last time we fought was Anderson Silva.
That's crazy. That is crazy. That's crazy.

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,430
But I don't know.
I mean I don't know Joe.

34
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,850
And this is something that we
kind of kind of stopped doing man.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,650
Like maybe they ain't got it no more.
Well I don't know if it's,

36
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:10,200
he doesn't have it anymore because
we haven't seen him. Not Habit.

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,760
He fought well against Anderson Anderson's
185 pounder. I wouldn't lead down.

38
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,250
Yay. I mean, I mean,

39
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,900
I mean honestly if anybody could still
fight in her old age to weigh those Dib,

40
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:26,370
Diaz brothers fight their style will
allow them to fight longer cause they're

41
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:31,020
not like the best athletes. So they
were not I own skill and just endurance.

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,940
Endurance. Yeah. So they can fight longer.

43
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:37,800
So I'm assuming that they
still have something left in
the tank. I'm sure. I mean,

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,370
they're obviously not out of
shape. They're both things. Yeah,

45
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,560
they look like their fit.
I see them training,

46
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,540
I see pictures of them with Jujitsu gies
on and hitting the bag and shit. This,

47
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,970
you know,
who knows man.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,020
I mean it's also like they want that
big payday, you know? Especially now,

49
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,380
and they should get that big payday.
But goddamn, if I was the UFC,

50
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,620
if I am fuck yeah,
I think those guys are superstars.

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,970
I think the UFC doesn't know.

52
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:08,140
I think one of the reasons why Nate
Diaz versus Conor McGregor was so big is

53
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,040
because people love Nate
Diaz to Yay Conor McGregor.

54
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,160
No doubt Conor Mcgregor,
no disrespect to Eddie Alvarez.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,230
But when Conor McGregor
fight Eddie Alvarez,

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,710
the vast majority of the
eyes were on Conor McGregor.

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,620
When Conor McGregor fights Nate Diaz,
you,

58
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,290
you're looking at a lot of
people who love Nate Diaz. Yeah.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,630
But how do you think that happened?

60
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,780
Like how do you think Nate
got that says that star power,

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,080
you think he legitimately doesn't give
a fuck? He smokes weed all the time.

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,980
People love it. They love the fact
that those guys are like that. No Man.

63
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,760
But what does that say about our
fan base and our society? Well,

64
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,950
I don't know. You know, what does the,

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,050
here's what's disappointing to me,
that for whatever reason,

66
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:53,090
mighty mouse never became
a giant superstar. Yeah.

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,640
That confused the shit out of me.
I'd watch that guy fight, you know,

68
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,010
when he took Ray Borg and suplex him and
caught him with an arm bar on the way

69
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:04,990
down and was like, what the fuck does
this guy have to do to become a superstar?

70
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:07,720
I mean,
his skill levels off the chart for sure.

71
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,500
It doesn't get hit for sure and put
it on, he's a dazzling fighter. Puts,

72
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,330
puts on show skill for skill.

73
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,720
There's nobody on the planet who can do
what he does now. He's the best ever.

74
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,880
He's the best physically ever.
Yeah.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,290
When the only thing that keeps him from
being thought of as universally the

76
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:28,291
greatest of all time is Jon Jones and
Jon Jones been able to beat better guys.
