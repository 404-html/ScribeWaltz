1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
I see these edge cases, like we say,
look, if it's legal it can be there,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,450
but we still see edge cases
where we have to make decisions.

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,800
So what's like an edge case?
I mean,

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,250
let's see, I mean there is,
I don't even want to go here,

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,250
but I will all right there,

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,430
there is a type of animation,

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,320
oh porn anomia yeah, yeah.
That is very sketchy.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,730
That Uber, you know like child
porn, animated child porn,

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,050
and we've taken the stance that look,
it's, it could fall under obscenity laws,

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,990
so we don't, we're not cool. But you
know, that is a huge debate, right?

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,710
That, that that has not been decided
by the Supreme Court if animated,

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,920
you know,
kids like they will do the weirdest stuff.

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,230
And I,

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,700
I just don't want to be telling people
what is and what is not art. Right.

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,670
So like some of that Japanese
stuff with tentacles, look,

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,490
some of that stuff was just like,
what is happening here?

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,030
Like octopuses banging chicks and every
hole and they're choking on it and

18
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,690
they've got one of their ass and one
of their vagina and it's all like very,

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,130
very liquidity. You know, there's a lot
of splattering going on. You're like,

20
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,660
what the fuck is this? And is that okay?
Because it's just art, right? I mean,

21
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,320
if it was a person getting fucked left,
right and center by an octopus,

22
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,590
he'd be like, yeah, I think we've crossed
some lines here. That's beastiality.

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
But if it's an image and then,

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,330
then the image is a girl with
a school girl costume on,

25
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:38,400
she's dressed like a Catholic school girl,
a little skirt,

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,480
and she's getting banged by an octopus.
What do you do with that?

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,110
Right? I, yeah. Yeah. What would
you do? It's a good question.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm glad I don't have a social media
site where I have to make the decision.

29
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,960
Well,
the real concern would be,

30
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,000
is this something that is actually
illegal? That's the thing, right? And we,

31
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:04,680
we've tried to look at the case law and
we've seen that this type of stuff has

32
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,530
been, you know, called obscenity before.

33
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:11,370
And so we're just not going to
risk it. But I, I still, you know,

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,950
in a alright, nipples, nipples look right.

35
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,940
Did you know that free the nipple
started out with fortune? Well,

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,470
everywhere. It's a whole, it's a
whole movement. To be honest, it,

37
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,460
Time magazine just did a really
interesting piece about a,

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,780
a statue they got banned from Facebook in
a sense. He was a naked ancient statue.

39
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,050
That's a nipple. Like,
I'm sorry, that's not,

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,030
that's not realistic.

41
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,110
That that's not helping society
taking down a naked statue.

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,290
When we were talking about the other day,
uh,

43
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:48,291
during the Superbowl that a Adam Levine
had his shirt off and Brian read,

44
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,790
Ben was like, Hey, d wasn't that like what
Janet Jackson got in trouble for? Like,

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,890
yeah,
why does,

46
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,360
why is it okay if Adam Levine shows his
nipples and Janet Jackson's nipples are

47
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,980
offensive because there's
sexualized because she's a woman.

48
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,860
This is the weird fact.

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Men had to gain the right to have their
nipples shown in public back in the day.

50
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,780
When's the day I, if you, if you go
on the, the free the nipple site,

51
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,230
go on their Instagram or something.

52
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:23,180
I think that's maybe where I saw it back
when I used Instagram. But you know,

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,460
society is evolving.
We're going to get there,

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,100
we're going to be able to handle it I
think or give people the controls so that

55
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,890
they can only see the types of
things that they want to see.

56
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,190
That's ultimately what it's about.
So like you should have like a filter.

57
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,900
Do I want 18 plus? Do our want. Um, PG 13.

58
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,550
Like what, what kind of distinction
do I want? Yeah, yeah. And then when,

59
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,630
when things come up,

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,140
like one of the things that Instagram
has been doing is like they say,

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
I follow a lot of hunters and Instagram
has things where they say, warning,

62
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,830
this is a sensitive content.
Uh,

63
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:59,670
nature is metal gets popped on that
a lot too because nature's metals and

64
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:00,371
Instagram site,

65
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:05,371
that's all like these crazy images and
videos of animals eating other animals

66
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:09,210
and attacking their animals.
And sometimes some of them,

67
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:13,000
they just decided this one's too fucked
up. You know, like just decide you,

68
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:17,700
I like this one of them where
a a lion is a looking out of a,

69
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,800
a Willdabeast asshole. Like
from the inside, like this,

70
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,700
this giant hole they've eaten through
its stomach and the, it's looking out,

71
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,770
it's asshole. And then I'm like, yeah,

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,620
this one you're going to have to click
on your own. You have to double click.

73
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,590
What do you got Jamie? Basically
from, I just looked up,

74
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,940
Tarzan is the catalyst for why guys
wanted to wear their shirts off.

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,650
They had like a 1920s 19 terrorists
they had to wear and pools.

76
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:42,450
They had to wear a top.
But look,

77
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:46,770
this only covers one [inaudible] they're
probably tired or sweaty or alien right

78
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,620
there. That's how they started doing
down the strap. Look at it says here,

79
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:52,860
saucy lifeguards, flash,
rebellious nipples.

80
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,853
Ah,

81
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,060
areas 37 that's hilarious.

82
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,330
So it was Tarzan 1937 in New
York state's male shirtless ban.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,180
That's when they overturned at the
incident attracted press attention as

84
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:13,380
Atlantic city. The other waterfronts
similarly mandated against men. Nips.

85
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,150
Would that legal domino tipped along
with the help of Hollywood hunks.

86
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,610
And you were talking about how
their Twitter has porn. Yes. Yo,

87
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,470
a lot banned from Google play for that.
Twitter has it.

88
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,240
They're up on Google play. It's Twitter
has a substantial amount of porn.

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,960
You know, you follow like some of them
gals and they just want you to see, look,

90
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:41,820
here's one in the my pussy right
there. Take a look. Thank full blown.

91
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:45,330
Not Offensive. Well, it's not
offensive. You've, you've followed them.

92
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,680
If you follow certain porn stars, we
can't make their own terms. Oh really?

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,040
But they're just allowing it because
they know they want that traffic. Oh,

94
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,280
is that what it is? They want
that traffic to traffic, bro.

95
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,990
Yeah. Um, it's a problem if you hand
your phone to your kid, you know,

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,440
and they accidentally click on
that link and I'm like, Mommy,

97
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,490
what's happening with her?
