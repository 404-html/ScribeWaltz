1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,140
The joe rogan experience,
you know,

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:06,660
I remember he cried after the
Vegas Shooting and he's from Vegas.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,850
Did he cry recently? Was it the
school shooting? Yeah. Yeah,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,780
but that was brutal though.
He's fucking go out with,

5
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:16,680
was there that night and she was at
the trop and then all the people came

6
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,910
running down into the trop.
Oh, so new year's Eve,

7
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:24,510
I'm with Vegas shooting people.
They had to stay there for a couple hours.

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,840
They had everything under locked down
because they didn't know who had guns and

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,300
who did. And they didn't know it
was one person or 50 people. Right.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,000
And she's there. She's
at the trop. And uh,

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,060
she got kind of traumatized by it.
So New Year's Eve,

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,380
we're walking outside and all of a sudden
she starts shaking and she was having

13
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,080
an anxiety attack, you know,
about being in a crowd.

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,680
So I was just fucking are trying to
make her laugh. I said, no, don't,

15
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,240
don't worry about it. And then we're,
you know, fireworks. So she said,

16
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,130
all I really care about is fireworks.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,790
And you took that away from
me because you're selfish
and feelings, you know, but,

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,450
but I got her laughing
anyway. The fucking, the,

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,130
the volume of them,
it's just,

20
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,350
it seems like every couple months there's
a new one. You remember when Columbine,

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,920
we thought this is terrible
and it's won't happen again.

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,960
It's like there's so many Nalia, you know,
you get used to it, which has said, yeah,

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,040
it's fucking crazy. And I don't
know what the answer is. You know,

24
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,010
I don't know if it's
a tighter gun control.

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,340
I don't know if that would stop them
because it would just make it more

26
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:26,120
difficult to get guns. But
would that be enough? I mean,

27
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,430
but we're not doing anything. Well,
interesting thing. Got to try something.

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,990
I don't know what to do.
I mean,

29
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,520
and there's also the number of people
that are on psychiatric medications.

30
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:38,490
It's fucking crazy. Well, I think that
for the [inaudible] or whatever they are,

31
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:43,150
they shouldn't be sold. They shouldn't be.
I mean, I, we didn't really need that to,

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,770
to kill a pheasant. It's
not a, a hunting gun really.

33
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,410
You're the guy who designed them, said
he it was w we made it for war. Yeah.

34
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:55,411
The real real guns for hunting are
usually usually bolt action rifles,

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,660
which means you have a,
around,

36
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,570
you have usually two or
three in the magazine.

37
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,650
You have a couple or one in the
chamber. You put it in there, cheeky,

38
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:06,730
lock it in place,

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,030
the clamp it down and you fire a shot
and then you have to bolt it again.

40
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,990
You have to use the, the action again. The
shell pops out and another one goes in,

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,890
bolt that down and then you get
another shot. It's a very slow thing.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,150
It takes a couple of second
musket. Whereas these ais,
you're like tack, tack, tack,

43
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:27,610
tack tack or with the bump stocks.

44
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,110
They apparently the president wants a
ban bump stocks with a bump. Stock is,

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,123
Oh yeah.

46
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,190
It's a stock where you pull back on it
and apparently you push forward and pull

47
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:41,650
back at the same time. Uh,
I might be fucking this up,

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,320
but the thing is the stock makes the, the
trigger go like that, that, that, that,

49
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,910
that, that, that, that, that where
it's almost like an automatic weapon.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,120
And Trump just decided to ban those.

51
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,650
And there's a lot of people that are
up in arms about him banning those,

52
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,170
like these, the gun rights. People
don't want to lose anything.

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,650
They don't want to lose any rights.
Right?

54
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,700
They don't want to lose any
fucking crazy ass weapons.

55
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,450
They think that any slip is,
uh,

56
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,090
is eventually going to lead to
them getting their guns taken away.

57
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,820
Like I follow a bunch of NRA people and
gone people on Twitter and Instagram

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,300
take their guns away. They think they
are, they think they are. I mean,

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,210
I agree with you. I don't think
that's ever going to come to that,

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,200
but the idea that tighter
regulation, um, is bad.

61
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,860
I don't think that's true. I
think, uh, I think first of all,

62
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,560
you should have to go through
some sort of examination.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,450
If you can go through an exam,
you don't,

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,410
you can't drive a fucking car unless
you prove that you know how to operate a

65
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,190
car. Like someone has to be there with
you. That's an expert. So driving expert,

66
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:44,890
who watches you? They watch.
Make sure you know what to do.

67
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,650
What do you do here at this light?
Do you know how to hit the brakes?

68
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,660
Do you stop perfectly look left and right
before you turn all that shit is super

69
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,700
important. If you want to
drive, how the fuck is it?

70
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,530
Not Super important if you
operate a goddamn firearm.
I know, I don't understand.

71
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,750
I like the kid who bought the,
I think the kid who did the, uh,

72
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,530
the latest shooting in Florida,
I think it was, if I'm a have,

73
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:08,980
I'm putting two stories together,
I don't know.

74
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:13,360
But apparently he was under age and had
fake id and still was able to buy it.

75
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,200
I don't know. I didn't read that story.
That'd be, you know, I avoided the story.

76
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,290
I saw the kid's face and I saw
the, it's, it's fucking insane.

77
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,690
And then you hear all the stories about
kids that were saying that they knew

78
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,290
that this kid was going to be a
school shooter anyway. They, they,

79
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,560
they were saying in, in the past.
And then one of the things he wrote,

80
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,430
he wrote it on Facebook or something
that he wants to be a professional school

81
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,264
shooter.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,830
And then two years later and
he got visited by the FBI,

83
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,580
the FBI actually checked this fucking
kid out. Talk to him about him, the side,

84
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,270
he wasn't a threat. How do you decide
someone's a threat or not a threat? Well,

85
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,430
if you're talking to them, they're
a threat. I mean, they may be,

86
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,580
I can't talk to everybody, but I, I would,

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,400
I would be suspicious of anyone that it
took that much energy to go find out.

88
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,010
What, how did they find them? Why would
they, why would they would question him?

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,840
Yeah. Um, I think people were saying
that he's a fucking psychopath. Yeah.

90
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,610
It hurts.
It's just sad.

91
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,570
It's just fucking sad that it's
sad that anyone could do that.

92
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,470
It's sad that anyone would be hurting
and so fucked up that you could take a

93
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,540
child. Imagine you have a kid, right? You
got a little dom Irrera little tiny baby,

94
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,860
and he's just a cute little fella, little
tiny baby, and they don't know anything.

95
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,160
They didn't tickle him.

96
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:29,050
And then from there one day that
becomes as to a school shooter,

97
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,130
Oh my God. That's what people have
to take into consideration. This boy,

98
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,090
this 19 year old boy who did that
was a baby at one point in time.

99
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:40,390
He's a failed process of failed product.

100
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,120
Yeah.
