1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,190
Dope. Yeah, that's true. Our whole,
that's just from you. Yeah, that's it.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,030
Even when you were, you were
doing taekwondo, no one gave
you a nickname? No, Joe.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,480
No. When I was a playing pool
a lot, I was Joe the comedian,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,790
GSP with us on the podcast.
He just did on your turning sidekick.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,830
Holy Shit.
Talk about endorses.

6
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,540
Critiquing it as good for a half an
hour has gone on about his power is

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,030
incredible. No Shit. George. Holy Shit.

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:31,290
As GSP going off on Joe Rogan. Yeah,
we trained a little afterwards.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,610
I'd say I switched my mats out. I had
those a zebra mats that are super smooth.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,910
No Bueno to slick move

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,900
on,
on throwing kicks DVD.

12
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,990
Was it 1997 some sort of a
video will still, you know,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,050
people still John Danaher
just put out a DVD.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,370
Well he put out a video on demand.
I bet he paid

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,240
wranglers and fucking under
Armour. Todd's of course, but a DVD

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,460
pack game.
Fanny pack.

17
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,940
Uh, yeah, I would, uh, I would
do that. George and I, we,

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,970
we went over the front
leg side kick first,

19
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,400
which is like the most important part,
the attorney sidekick.

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,400
Once you get the front leg side kick down,
you understand how that works.

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,570
Then you turn and then it's basically
you're turning and then throwing the front

22
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,000
leg side kick.
It's just got like an extra push to it,

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,080
but most people do the front,

24
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,820
like psychic rom there needs to low and
when it needs to low, you lose all power.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,830
Crazy shit.
If he's going to fight at 55 yeah,

26
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,950
the ones are kind of 55 100%
and he's only 185 pounds.

27
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,880
She has pain 55 and
he's only doing it once.

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,870
It's going to be the winner of Conor.
Khabib, he started doing this is see,

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,670
look at this. This is what Wonderboy
does. It's CR. That's weird.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,610
That sideways stance is
hard to fuck with man.
