1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,010
Are applying.
I mean even just yesterday,

2
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:06,780
I think some journalists got banned
from Facebook. Where the store,

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,760
yeah. Let me, I'm going
to send this to you Jamie,

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:13,761
cause it's a really crazy one because
they wanted her to show who her funding

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:18,750
sources were and I didn't even know that
there was an area where you could show

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,290
that. So it's almost like they're
making this up as they go along. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,740
Kyle Kalinsky sent me this today. I want
to send this to you right now. Jamie.

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,790
Hang on one second.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,080
Hold on. I'm very quiet. Unfortunately.
This is an audio show. Live there.

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,880
Yes. Not Dead Air. There you go. Okay
Buddy. I just send it to you. Okay. Uh,

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,110
Facebook suspended in the now tweets,
uh,

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,140
page at the behest of CNN and the
u s government funded think tanks.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,640
Says we had almost 4 million subscribers,

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,620
did not violate Facebook rules were
given no warning and Facebook isn't

15
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:03,700
responding to us. So yeah.
What is, what was the,

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,950
what it would actually started
this off. I mean, who knows?

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,380
They don't communicate with anyone. They'd
been banning legit accounts for years.

18
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:14,710
They,

19
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,750
you cannot even send a minds.com the link
through Facebook messenger right now.

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,230
Blocked. What? Yeah. Why's.
If you post in the newsfeed,

21
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:27,850
it says careful,
this could be an unsecure website.

22
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,523
Oh,

23
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,330
just clicked on a link from TMZ yesterday
and got the same thing from on Twitter.

24
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,110
Twitter. I said this might be malicious.
They're spam. They're could be from minds.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,580
No, that's from Tia. TMZ Link.

26
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:42,980
It was clicking this like this
story is on Tmz here to see the,

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,560
the rest of the story. So they're trying
to keep you from going to TMZ. Yeah.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,460
I don't know why it was the first
time I've ever seen that, eh,

29
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,800
it's probably caught up in some algorithm
and I sent an actual written letter to

30
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,050
Facebook about it.
Obviously I don't get back.

31
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,820
And then there's no human written letter.

32
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,460
He wrote it with a piece of paper
known now that would have been cool.

33
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:05,020
I sign it with ink. But really we
had no, cause our lawyer said to,

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,410
you know, that actually proves
that you sent them something,

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,870
some sort of diligence, but
there's, there's just no recourse.

36
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,370
It's their lost. So explain.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,600
So if someone is trying to say
on Facebook messenger, hey,

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,430
you should go check out minds.com they
won't let you post that link. Nope.

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,580
And what is their excuse? They
don't tell you. No, don't.

40
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,680
So is it because you're competing
social media network? I don't know.

41
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:36,850
I don't want to get into, I
don't know. You don't know?

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,900
I'm not going to say no. It does.
Yeah. Yeah. You don't know why it does,

43
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:41,560
but you know,
it doesn't,

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,580
they're calling us unsecure and I'm
pretty sure that Facebook got hacked.

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,160
You know,
they compromise everybody's data.

46
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,750
Like do you want to talk about unsecure?

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,470
There's no more unsecure site that exists.

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,270
It is kind of funny, right? I mean
after those and after all the, uh,

49
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,330
the Russia stuff, yeah. It's um,

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,440
it is kind of funny calling somebody
else on secure. Yeah. They're insecure.

51
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,600
Mark Zuckerberg is very insecure.
Well, he's also stupid rich. He, um,

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,300
he seems like he's too rich. Like he
fucked up. Like he's there sipping water,

53
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,930
like a robot trying to figure out what
the fuck he's doing with this life.

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,090
I think that they're scared because they
know they've betrayed everybody and so

55
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,060
it's hard to get them to, to speak.
You know, it's interesting with,

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,750
with Dorsey here because I, you
know, give him credit for speaking,

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,320
but the fact is that he's not
answering the question well,

58
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,110
he's bringing someone else in to answer
the questions in the next go round.

59
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,460
And so that should be very interesting.

60
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,020
He actually didn't know the
answer to those questions.

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,050
I think he probably doesn't know all
the specifics because he's a CEO of not

62
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,000
one, but two different
corporations. He's busy shit.

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,680
And also we're but true.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,340
But I think that when we look at the
policy that exists on these networks,

65
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,000
like he is in control of the policy
to large degree. There's a board,

66
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,360
I don't know if there's a decision
making process, but he has a large voice.

67
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,960
I don't know how large his voices,
I assume that's probably true.

68
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,920
But one of the things we did detail on
the last podcast with Tim Pool was how he

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,910
wasn't the CEO for quite a long time fired
and then rehired at that point. Yeah.

70
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:23,620
So, um, obviously there's some contention,
there are some issues and you know,

71
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,430
there's a,

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,370
it's a lot of money involved in these
things and I think that plays a giant part

73
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,200
and how they decide to make decisions.
And,

74
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,890
but do you think that an
advertiser in reality doesn't like,

75
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,000
say you're an advertiser and you want
to advertise your computer. Okay.

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,350
And there's a video on youtube that
is about something controversial.

77
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Does it actually make sense for that
advertiser to not show their product on

78
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:55,570
that controversial video? Don't they want
to sell computers? Uh, well it depends.

79
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:55,901
I mean,

80
00:04:55,901 --> 00:05:00,340
if the controversial videos are about
how Jews are evil and you have this video

81
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,350
about Jews being evil and then you know,

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,590
like by Razer computers come
on tucked on at the right.

83
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,450
But do you think that people actually,

84
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,160
I can understand not wanting to support
certain types of content and maybe

85
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:17,161
advertisers feel like they're supporting
that content by advertising next to it.

86
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,480
But I also don't think that people,

87
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,830
when they're watching a controversial
video on the Internet say,

88
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,300
oh my gosh,
you know,

89
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,250
this advertiser is completely out of
line for being next to this controversial

90
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:34,000
thing. I, I don't think that's a, a
healthy direction to move. Well, okay,

91
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,020
that's one way to look at it.

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,130
Another way to look at it is if you
are a giant company that sells things,

93
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,890
let's say you're Toyota
and you're selling Tundras,

94
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,150
you don't want your Tundras
to be associated in any
way with something that you

95
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:48,040
might think is negative.
It's their prerogative.

96
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,470
If they're paying for advertising,
they can kind of decide.

97
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,390
This is one of the things that's
leading, um, youtube and specific,

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,130
and I've had
a ton of conversations about this there.

99
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,380
It's leading them specifically to try
to de monetize things that could be

100
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,370
considered distasteful or
insensitive or controversial.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,300
And it's very frustrating to content
creators when you talk to them.

102
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,560
They're essentially saying that they need
to do better and that their tools are

103
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:19,460
very blunt,

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,830
that they don't really have the correct
computer learning tools to figure out

105
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:28,130
what is offensive and why.
And then there's a human review system,

106
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:32,180
which is very weird. And we've run
into that many times where like,

107
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,550
we'll have like a podcast
with like say Tom Papa,

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,000
who's an uncontroversial
fantastic standup comedian.

109
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:41,690
And it's like demonetized and then we're
like, why? What happened? And then we go,

110
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:44,180
what the fuck can we talk about?
We didn't talk about anything crazy.

111
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,690
And it's really damaging for brands
when it gets demonetize right away.

112
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,410
Cause it's that initial time period
that generates the most revenue. Yeah.

113
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,440
Said when you have to go back and do it.
I mean,

114
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,960
so I agree with that,
but,

115
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,340
so we built a tool that's like a peer
to peer advertising tool. So it's not,

116
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,780
there's two options.
You can,

117
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,810
so you earn crypto for your contributions
and then which Cryptos do you support?

118
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,710
We have an ethereum based token,
but we're going to support all of them.

119
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,820
So what does a theory on base token? So
it's an Erc 20 token. What does that mean?

120
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,530
It means that we basically reward people
for all of their activities. Okay.

121
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,610
So like say if Jamie's posted on
mines and uh, people love his posts,

122
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,290
he gets rewarded in some, yeah.
How much? How much again? Well,

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,650
can I go buy one token will give you a
thousand impressions. Oh, so you, it,

124
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,410
we're not focused on like, oh, you're
going to make money from this. Wait.

125
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,600
[inaudible] we're saying one token will
give you a thousand impressions or you

126
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:45,530
get a thousand impressions from,
you get a token from 1000 impressions.

127
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,850
One, when you use a token
to advertise on mines, Oh,

128
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,670
you get a thousand impressions
when you boost your posts with it.

129
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,350
So if you use the Crypto,
you use a token,

130
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,190
you guarantee views. Yeah.
That's weird. And it, why?

131
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,370
Well, you're guaranteeing
people see something. Well, we,

132
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,650
when you boosted, it gets fed to people's
news feed chronologically, right?

133
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:13,820
I say so there's just a backlog.

134
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,270
So sort of like when Instagram
has a sponsored posts,

135
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,010
except we're not spying on people to,

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,750
when we send them Instagram Spaz on
people to mine. Yeah. I don't know, man.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm stupid. Help me out. It's.
