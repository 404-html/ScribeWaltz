1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,660
And in the conservative world has to be
careful. This podcast could sink a ship.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,360
I'm pro nuance. Yeah. How'd you
come up with a shirt pro nuance.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,640
I know. Shit. Listen, I think the way
that I came up with it is because in the,

4
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:15,270
in the hunting world there is this,
speaking of conservative,

5
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:19,170
there's this like there's the conservative
traditional district and there's the

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,110
more progressive folks that
you have met and been around.

7
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,260
You've been around both, but it'd be
around both Eder more environmentalist's,

8
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:29,460
more public lands, more access.
Right. So there's kind of like to,

9
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,370
of course there's always two sides of
politics, but they're just in this case,

10
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:33,780
two distinct sides,
right?

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,770
And the line kind of gets drawn
around one a little bit around guns,

12
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,320
but also a little bit around
the environment. So part
of the biggest issue in,

13
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:46,260
in politics for a hunter angler right
now is like, I really like guns.

14
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,390
I like the second amendment.
I dig what's going on there.

15
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,470
I'd like to support that.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,140
But what I also like is healthy
ecosystems and environment and I,

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,920
and I like habitat for wild game to
live. And public lands and access. Well,

18
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:03,690
it just so happens that a lot of the a
plus rated politicians for the NRA are

19
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:08,691
like f minus or a d plus rated in
protecting wildlife and wild lands.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,850
And a lot of that's around extraction
and different things like that.

21
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,684
But extraction

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,260
minerals and oil and natural
from valuable lands. Right.

23
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,220
So then change the way
these lands are scheduled.

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,503
What it's under.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,960
Yeah. I mean there was a lot of
action. This is our around monuments,

26
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:25,460
of course that was one big one,
but it's,

27
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:29,810
it's just around like the general basis
of even as a hunter, but all Americans.

28
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:33,980
But as a hunter, I'm faced with like
I love wildlife, I love wild places,

29
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:36,470
clean water, clean
lands, I'm all for that.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,150
That's a huge part of what I believe that.

31
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,520
But I also believe in
the second amendment.

32
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,230
I believe in my rights
to defend my family.

33
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:45,560
I believe in my right to to own
firearms and to, and to do that.

34
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:49,400
So I believe in those two things, but
because our politics are the way they are,

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,560
it doesn't leave room for those two
beliefs. When I'm at at the voting booth,

36
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,420
sometimes not all the time,

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,570
hardly leaves room for those beliefs
in normal conversations with people,

38
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,800
unless you absolutely know that the
person's going to be objective and as your

39
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:09,610
shirt says pro nuance this,
that the idea that you,

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,160
you shouldn't be able to defend your
family is where it gets crazy. Yeah.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,750
It doesn't get crazy that you want
to be able to defend your family.

42
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:21,751
Like why do these movies all have
robberies and breakins and bad guys?

43
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,250
Well, why did you visit a real
things? It's a real thing.

44
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,350
So the idea that you should just be a
sitting duck because there's so many crazy

45
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:36,400
fucks out there that want to shoot
up schools and go on mass shootings.

46
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:40,600
It somehow or another you
are being conflated with
them that you're going to be

47
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,870
being got confused with them or categorize
with them. Like how, how is that?

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,340
These are different things.
They are just both involve guns.

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,593
They are their things.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,920
It's like the insole that drove all of
those people in Toronto. I remember that.

51
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,180
Yup. You know what? If that keeps
happening. That's happened many times.

52
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:00,430
You've seen people kill people
cars over the last few years.

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,550
It's been like four or five big events.
Are they mutually exclusive?

54
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,790
Like I want to be able to defend my
family and own firearms and have that

55
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,630
freedom. That's big part of this country.
But I also don't want people to die.

56
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,970
Exactly. In mass shootings.
I don't want that.

57
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:16,540
I want worse on the other side of
the coin with when it comes to like

58
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,660
environmental issues and around hunting
public lands and things of that nature.

59
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,090
I want coal miners to have jobs.

60
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,170
I want people that work in an extraction
industries to have an opportunity to

61
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:29,080
work and live and do what they need to do.

62
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,280
But I also want to protect our ecosystems
at all costs because you can't replace

63
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:33,800
that shit.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,790
Right.
And there's gotta be other jobs out there.

65
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,850
If the government put its resources
instead of propping up old ways of doing

66
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:48,150
business that pollute the environment
versus new ways of doing business are

67
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,740
certain cities and with with government
programs, that's entirely possible.

68
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:51,961
Yeah.

69
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:56,961
There are certainly reasonable and and
healthy ways to mine copper or are there

70
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:02,100
ways to, I don't know. There is, I mean
there's responsible ways to do that,

71
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:06,900
but at what, at what costs? You're
still, you're still extracting,

72
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,790
right? You're still
doing something, do it.

73
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,060
You're still changing the
natural environment there.

74
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,820
Yeah. Someone was trying to make that,
that argument with fracking with me.

75
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,260
I was talking to him about that.
Is it Josh Fox's documentary? Um,

76
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,510
what is, uh, he, he was
on the podcast, the um,

77
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,690
something fracking nation.
What was his, uh, he made a,

78
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,860
it was a very good documentary and it
was when I had him on the podcast was

79
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:36,150
interesting because he seemed like he
had been attacked a lot for it and even

80
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,250
misunderstood.
Like some of the questions I was asking,

81
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,650
like maybe they were coming from me
and I will say, no, this is just like,

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,230
what was it called? Fractionation? What
does it, yes. Gaslamp. That's it. Oh yeah.

83
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:48,300
I said, okay. It's um, it's disturbing.

84
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,810
Like you're watching some aspects of it,
like when they were wedding lighting,

85
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,300
their water on fire and then
someone tried to say, oh,

86
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,820
there's some places where you've always
been able to let your water on fire,

87
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,490
and I was like, okay, wait, okay,

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,670
the lighting your water on size.

89
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,970
Real argument that someone
said that that's not really
from fracking and I said,

90
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:10,500
okay, these people said that there
was no lighting, the water on fire.

91
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,630
Then people started fracking.
The water smell like shit.

92
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:15,600
They started lighting on fire though.
You're saying those are not connected?

93
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,890
Well, over the years, Joe,

94
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:21,710
we've been able to light our water
on fire for a number of reasons,

95
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,970
but 4th of July

96
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,730
I would think to be confident about that,
and I'm not confident about it,

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,730
but to be confident about what that
guy said to me when he was saying that,

98
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,564
it's always been like that.

99
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,860
You would have to have
done massive research.

100
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,380
You would have to spent time there.

101
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,180
You would have to been working either
directly or indirectly with the scientists

102
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,420
that are collecting the data. You'd have
to get it from them. You'd have to know,

103
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:47,250
you'd have to see it,
you'd have to make sure was sure.

104
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,760
Or you have to be a person who is
not interested in the actual truth.

105
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:56,970
They just have an idea that they want to
push through. And this is a weird thing.

106
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,970
Certain right wing folks,

107
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,810
there's a weird thing they want to
push through that business is good and

108
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:07,811
environmentalist are all pussies and
hippies and Weirdos and losers and these

109
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:13,040
things don't jive in the world of someone
who actually loves and appreciates the

110
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,800
actual earth of course,
man, because weird. But

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,980
there is no way that anyone
could argue, right? There's,

112
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,850
there's in the hunting world
or something like access and,

113
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,030
and public land and all these
things become a big deal.

114
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,070
But you can define access in a
ton of different ways. To me,

115
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:30,970
accessible to me,

116
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:34,840
access could be I like wilderness or
did the only way you can access it is on

117
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:38,590
foot via, via trailhead.
Someone else might say,

118
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,840
access to me is uh,

119
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,830
elderly folks or disabled folks bail them
to get on into a car and drive through

120
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:48,010
a road and public land. Or,
or get into an ATV and drive.

121
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,780
And so politics are being what they are.

122
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,640
Politicians take this term of access.
It happened around national monuments.

123
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:02,320
They take one side said the president
is stealing your land and the other side

124
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,720
says,
the president is giving back your land.

125
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,040
Somebody there either both sides
are full of shit or one of them is,

126
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,660
I remember when this came up,
Patagonia,

127
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:13,730
which is a giant company
in the trap doors,

128
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,260
had a big ad on the Internet that said
the president just stole your land.

129
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
And then I heard Rinella talk about, and
he said, this is, I'm going to paraphrase,

130
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,120
but he basically said, if you say
that the presence until your land,

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,930
you're not being careful with your
words. Yes. And you're not being asked.

132
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,950
You're being inflammatory. Yes. You're
being absolutely inflammatory. Yeah.

133
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,680
Because it's not again,

134
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,280
that that you're talking about grand
staircase Escalante in bears ears,

135
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,770
National Monument bears
ears being in Utah,

136
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:43,830
being explained to people what
happened the boy, um, I'll,

137
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,820
I'll do my best. Thank you Ben. So,

138
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,430
so the antiquities act,

139
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:53,420
let's get back to the antiquities act
to protect the antiquities act is to

140
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:58,280
protect, um, culturally
or socially, emotionally,

141
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,800
culturally significant pieces of land,

142
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,220
all the way to things like
the Grand Canyon. Right?

143
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,830
And so spin it up to the end of,
there's a lot that I just skipped over,

144
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,470
but I'm going to spin it up to the
end of the Obama administration.

145
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,580
President Obama used his executive
power to protect large swaths,

146
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,080
millions of acres around that bow around
bears ears national monument to protect

147
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,640
not only the, the significant
places for native Americans and for,

148
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,870
um,
native tribesman around bears ears,

149
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,240
but many millions of acres around that.

150
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,830
And so then it becomes the problem
I have in the why that kind of,

151
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,920
that tee shirt exists. It becomes a
political football throw back and forth.

152
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,800
It's not at this point in time
what's best for bears ears,

153
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,730
what's best for that national monument.
It was best for,

154
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,560
for it to be fairly owned. What's best
for the people, the jobs, the place.

155
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,800
It becomes what's best for
each side and their rhetoric.

156
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,820
And so president Trump asked secretary,

157
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:07,440
former secretary of Interior
Ryan Zinky to review,

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,030
I think it was like 10 monuments to see
if they should be reduced based on the

159
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:16,770
predictions that Obama had put put into
place. So he reviews these 10 monuments.

160
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,330
He cuts out eight of them
and hones in on two places,

161
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,350
bears ears and grand staircase Escalante.
They then say,

162
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,930
we're going to reduce the
size of these monuments.

163
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,540
When you say cuts out eight of them,
what do you mean by cuts out?

164
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,360
They review the other eight and say
they're fine. They're good to go,

165
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,020
no changes necessary. Okay. Some
would say they did that as a,

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,590
as a straw men as eight strawmen to knock
them over and look at these other two.

167
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,140
They said we will reduce the PR,
the,

168
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,430
the area that is designated
as a national monument.

169
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,300
And here again,
it comes to both sides.

170
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,330
They would say because President Obama
wielded his powers corruptly to protect,

171
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,640
to be as an environmentalist,

172
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,910
to protect lands that didn't need
protected under the antiquities act.

173
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,960
Because the antiquities act does say it
should be the smallest acreage possible

174
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:07,794
to protect.

175
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,090
So now you get into stuff that I'm not
an expert in and around legal jargon and

176
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:17,091
going back to things that were written
in the 1930s but we get to a point where

177
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,060
one side saying,

178
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:26,061
here is the Republicans trying to shrink
down these monuments so that they can

179
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:31,050
then go the companies that are can then
go and lease these places for mining,

180
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,520
but they can't currently do on their
protections as a national monument.

181
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,380
The other side is saying,

182
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,430
we're trying to protect
culturally significant lands
and these millions of acres

183
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,650
need protected.
They need protection for lots of reasons.

184
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,800
So you end up with
those two sides talking.
