00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,180
And that's the problem with that,

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,020
with a lot of what's happening in our
government. People saying, you know what,

4
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:13,021
I really want to believe in this absurd
story and therefore I refuse to accept

5
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:16,270
evolution. If you're the vibe, if you're
Mike Pence, the vice president of country,

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,400
you say,
I don't believe evolution because I don't,

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,700
it doesn't agree with my
ridiculous fundamentalist ideas.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,380
And he said that in
Congress, right? He said,

9
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:24,910
we shouldn't be teaching
evolution in schools.

10
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:29,790
We should be teaching intelligent
design. And, and why? Because he, he, it,

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,590
it offends his personal faith.

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,110
Perhaps it might also be a political
ploy. It might be. I think he's,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,900
he knows that a large percentage of the
country finds comfort in a leader that

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,090
subscribes to the same sort of
superstitions that they did. Yeah.

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:46,990
Yeah. I, I, that could be a, he did this
before. He was in a national officer.

16
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:50,860
He was a congressman. I suspect he
did it. It sounds like he believed it,

17
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:53,500
but you're right. Who knows. Right. But,

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,420
but the point is that we, we, we
should realize that the only, that,

19
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,040
that we shouldn't listen to that kind
of nonsense because we may not want,

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,280
because there are a lot of people in
this country who do think that evolution

21
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,460
directly confronts their belief in God
or the Big Bang directly confronts their

22
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:15,010
belief in God and therefore they don't
want their children to learn about that.

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,320
But what an awful thing to do to your
children to withhold evidence about how

24
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,540
the world really works.
Because you don't,

25
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,700
you don't have to believe in the big bang,
but it really happened.

26
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,950
You don't have to believe in evolution.
But it happened.

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,890
It's like Philip k Dick said the,
the,

28
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:32,380
the science fiction writer reality
is that which continues to exist,

29
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,250
whether or not you believe in it.
Okay.

30
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,410
And so you may not want to believe
in it, but it happened. And,

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,430
and for you to withhold that kind of
knowledge from your kids because you're

32
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:45,190
worried it's going to affect
their faith is, in my opinion,

33
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:50,191
child abuse because you're hindering their
capabilities as an adult in a society

34
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:53,230
which is highly technological
to function effectively.

35
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:56,140
They're doing it because they believe
in as well when they need. It's right.

36
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,870
I'm not believing they think they're
helping their kids, but most of,

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,270
I don't know if you're a
parent. I am. We've all screwed
up our kids, right? Yeah.

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,950
We all do things for our kids because
we think it's good for them and,

39
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,930
and sometimes it is
and sometimes it isn't.

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,450
I'm not saying these people
are doing it because they,

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,590
they want to hurt their children.

42
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,590
They think somehow that not believing
in God makes you a bad person. Right.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,650
But there's no evidence
of that. In fact, in fact,

44
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,870
a Steve Weinberg who a Nobel prize winning
physicist has said, and I love it, he,

45
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,390
he, he said, so they're good people
in the world. They're bad people,

46
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,150
good people to good things,
bad people do bad things.

47
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,340
When good people do bad things,
it's religion.

48
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,790
Do you think that religion in its earliest
stages was in a sense primitive man

49
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,890
with no science trying to figure out the
world and trying to have some sort of

50
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:47,440
rules like almost like a
scaffolding in order to,

51
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
to move to the next. If you see that it
exists in so many different cultures,

52
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,990
it might have been something along that

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,380
was that way.
It their effort.

54
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,140
It was their effort to understand the
world around them based on what they knew

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,860
it was noble.
You know,

56
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:03,220
they tried to understand the world
and so there's nothing wrong with it.

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,230
But claiming that we today should
be guided by the worldview of,

58
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,130
of illiterate peasants in the Iron Age.
Peasants who, who didn't know the earth,

59
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:16,570
orbiting the sun and wrote down scriptures
based on their beliefs at the time.

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,430
They'll argue that that
should guide our life.

61
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,850
Today when we discovered a hundred
billion galaxies in the universe and

62
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,300
discovered all this stuff is ludicrous.
So you're absolutely,

63
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,330
the birth of science and religion
are the same. And in fact,

64
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,150
modern science grew out of religion.
People point that out and they say to me,

65
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,540
how dare you talk about religion?
You know, as, as being outdated.

66
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:38,110
Science grew out of religion. And
I say to them, well that's fine,

67
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:42,130
but children outgrow their
parents, right? So great.

68
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,683
No doubt,

69
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,620
religious ideas and all early scientists
were religious because it was the only

70
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,454
game in town.

71
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,600
You couldn't be educated except the
church controlled all the universities.

72
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,630
And so it was like the National
Science Foundation of the 16th century.

73
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,090
It's not surprising they were
all religious because that's,

74
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,220
that was the only game in town.
So that,

75
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,130
that co helped create the
birth of modern science.

76
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,790
But science outgrew it and that's okay.
Kids outgrow their parents.

77
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,160
Thank goodness.
Well,

78
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,980
I think maybe that might help
kids outgrow their parents.

79
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,810
Why the getting religion forced down
your throat is one of the best ways for

80
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,890
kids to, for some kids as they get older.
Some for some kids it's like you and me,

81
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,900
but I get lots of letters.
You know,

82
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,240
we made this movie called the unbelievers
and, and about, which followed me,

83
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,840
Richard Dawkins and I around the
world as we talked about this stuff.

84
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,100
And it was nice and maybe, and I, and I
hope, and it's a, it's a well made film.

85
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:36,490
I liked the moat filmmakers made it,
but I found people come up to me.

86
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,250
I had no idea of this.

87
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,010
It's one of the negative aspects of
religion that I never appreciated.

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,940
I have people come up and he almost
everyday or write me and saying,

89
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:46,420
you know what?

90
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,340
I saw that movie and I realized I'm not
a bad person for asking questions and

91
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,070
I'm not alone. You know, these
people from small towns in Georgia,

92
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,120
they have no one to talk to.

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,020
They think that the only ones who's
asked the question, is God real?

94
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,030
Is it okay to not believe in God?

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,310
And they're told by everyone else
he'll not only you'll go to hell,

96
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,300
but you're a bad person and suddenly
they discover that's not true.

97
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,420
And so I think there are a lot of people
who have that forced down their throats.

98
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,470
It's really hard when you're a
kid, you know, and have these.

99
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,800
And that's why I do think any kind of
religion for kids is kind of child abuse

100
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,240
not.
And no matter what,

101
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:23,770
because these concepts of a dainty and
the possible existence of a purpose of

102
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,780
university are very deep and
subtle concepts and expect
a three year old kid to,

103
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,040
to,

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,390
to Ram that down at cure all kids' throat
is unfair because the kid rested it.

105
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,500
It ends up being internalized in
ways. And a lot of people, you know,

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,680
I hear a lot of people who've had deep
religious educations who say, you know,

107
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,870
it's hard to outgrow that
because when you get,

108
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,400
when that's rust into you as a child,
it's really hard to over ever overcome it.

109
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,450
The guilt feelings that many religions
introduce the fundamental notion that,

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,170
that you know,

111
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,700
you're ultimately sinful and no
matter what you do is sinful,

112
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,810
is something a lot of
people have hard times with.

113
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,230
And that claim of sin is just so you know,
I've debated people who you know,

114
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:11,120
who argue that homosexuality
is, is, is, is sinful, you know,

115
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,780
and then, and it's unnatural.
God intended it to be otherwise.

116
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,280
And then I pointed out,
well, you know what?

117
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:19,520
You take all mammals 10% in every species,

118
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,160
almost 10% have homosexual relationships.

119
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,360
Sheep have long 10% of sheep of
longterm homosexual relationships,

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,540
or they sinful. Okay?
It's not a natural at all.

121
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,840
It's a natural consequence of
whatever by now why it's a case.

122
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,670
It's an interesting evolution of question,

123
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,550
but it's certainly not a
natural and seems uniform.

124
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,720
Then if it's 10% plus or minus a little
bit, it certainly seems to be biology.

125
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,830
There's some purpose. There's some,
there's some biological purpose to it.

126
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,250
And so to argue that it's both unnatural
and wrong is to misunderstand biology.

127
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,140
But people grow up being told it's
evil because the Bible said it.

128
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,070
And then they don't want to give people
who homosexual the same rights as other

129
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,090
people because they tell them,

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,970
they say God didn't want
them to have the homestead.

131
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,050
So the problem is people are told these
things that are ultimately wrong because

132
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,870
you know, maybe, you know,
because for whatever reason,

133
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,730
the tribe that wrote down that that
scripture wanted to make sure that the,

134
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,740
there weren't homosexual
relationships in the group,

135
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,700
which is really baffling when you talk
to people about the Bible in the Old

136
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,780
Testament versus the new testament.

137
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,810
And they don't even understand where
the new testament was created by

138
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,000
Constantine and a bunch of bishops. They
threw a bunch of stuff. And by the way,

139
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,050
they think it's kindler gentler. Sure.
The Old Testament is one of the most,

140
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,200
you know, look at the current people
say the Qur'an is violent and vicious.

141
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:37,880
Read the Old Testament.
You know,

142
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,830
you're supposed to stone your
kids if they disobey you.

143
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,520
And the reason kill people that were
two different types of cloths. Exactly.

144
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,350
And the reason that nowadays sort of the
old Abrahamic religions of Judaism and

145
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,130
Christianity may seem a little less
violent than Islam for some people,

146
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,270
is because, you know, people
take the Quran literally,

147
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,320
and that's part of sort of
fundamentalist Islam. Very few,

148
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,120
very few people take the Bible
as literally as it namely, Hey,

149
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:08,240
we're going to stone kids in
the 12th century. They may have,

150
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,950
but now we've outgrown it. And the
Islam is 600 years younger. And so it's,

151
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,010
it's just the old testament is
just as violent as the Qur'an,

152
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,470
but no one takes it seriously.
But people,

153
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:20,090
most people who call themselves religious,

154
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,570
they pick and choose the things they like
from the Bible or the New Testament or

155
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:27,800
the old testament. They pick and choose
the nice kinder, gentler things. You know,

156
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,890
Richard Dawkins Foundation in England
did an interesting survey. Uh, so they,

157
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,940
the British government does a
census, you know, and, and they,

158
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:39,020
they ask people's religions as part of it.
And in the last census,

159
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,560
remarkably only 55% of the people
said they were Christian Church,

160
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,140
Church of England, which was one
of the lowest ever. But fine,

161
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,980
they went to those 55% people. They did
a survey of those and they said, okay,

162
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,590
why do you call yourself Christian?
Do you believe in the Virgin birth?

163
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:53,700
Do you believe in transubstantiation?
Do believe in, you know,

164
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,450
and went down the list and people say,
no, no, no, no, no. And then they'd ask,

165
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,940
why do you call yourself Christian?
And the answer was,

166
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,740
we like to think of ourselves as good
people. So religion is USERP morality.

167
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,090
And somehow people throw
out all of the evil.

168
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,320
And it's not just the Old Testament.

169
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,250
No one talked about hell
more than Jesus Christ. Okay?

170
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,950
Jesus guy is supposed to love.
Everyone talked about hell.

171
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,150
This eternal damnation for
people who disobey as, as,

172
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,330
as Christopher Hitchens used to say,
God is like a cosmic Saddam Hussein,

173
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,440
but worse cause it almost saying use
just torture his enemies while they're

174
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,220
alive. God has worse. He takes
the people that I was like,

175
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:35,070
it torches them from all eternity.
Who wants such a God? What an awful,

176
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:36,180
disgusting idea.

177
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,390
Okay.
