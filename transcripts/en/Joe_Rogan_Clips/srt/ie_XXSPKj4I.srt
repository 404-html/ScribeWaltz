1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,730
Hello Freak bitches,
you know all that power already.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,430
Like why would he,
why would he want to be the president?

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,720
It just seems like such
a fucking helacious job.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,980
Unless he really feels like he can fix
things or he's really gonna make a ton of

5
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,410
money from it.
I mean this is a guy who plasters his,

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,080
his fucking name on buildings and Shit,
you know.

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:26,370
So I think it's really just a matter for
him of like, this is part of my legacy.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,540
You know, towards the end of my life
I was president of the United States.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,750
It's so weird.
It's so weird cause it's,

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,960
it's another version of what many people
did with Obama in this weird way in

11
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,470
that when Obama got into office,
there was all these, a really,

12
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,610
really rational people that said all
kinds of crazy shit. And by the way,

13
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,040
Trump was amongst them.
He was a birther. Yeah,

14
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,720
he was a member for the longest time. He
was convinced. Somebody convinced him.

15
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,800
I Dunno who convinced him.

16
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,610
I Dunno if you've ever really relinquished
it and realize that it was wrong or

17
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,250
if he still holds onto the idea. Did he
ever really believe it too? I don't know.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,230
You know, I don't know. But you know
who started that whole birth of thing?

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,580
Hillary Clinton. Yeah, she
did. That's right. That's
something that people forget.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,700
It was during the,
uh,

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,730
the campaign between her and a Obama when
they were trying to get the nomination

22
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,460
in 2008. Yeah. Yeah. She, she had,

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,220
well she had one of her little org
send out materials that you know,

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,620
showed Obama and like the,

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,150
like he was wearing like some
African Muslim garb. Shit.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,970
Cause he went on a visit to some other
company. You look at him, you know,

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,040
he's Muslim and uh,
you know,

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,750
and Trump just ran with that. Yeah. Or a
lot of Republicans did to cause, you know,

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,640
well I guess that's just how they play
politics. They have some like that,

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,480
they just run with it.

31
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,510
It's just so strange to see when you
got a candidate named Barack Obama.

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,201
I know,

33
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:59,201
you know it's easy Hussain who saying
Obama like Barack Hussein Obama Sane in

34
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,790
that the guy you know
ran a racket and Obama,

35
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,780
it had the similar to the name of the
guy that crashed those planes into the

36
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:10,860
towers and yeah, somebody had a
Joe really good, well wrote a joke.

37
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,240
I don't remember who it was though.

38
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,350
It might've been 20 inch
glove but I mean it's just,

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,010
this is almost a s a similar reaction.
I don't mean it's less,

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,440
it's more rational or less rational.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,140
What I mean is almost like
the energy of the reaction,

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,340
like the energy of the birthers and the
guys who were convinced that he was some

43
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,580
sort of undercover Muslim and then he
was going to get into the White House and

44
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:34,320
tried to take America
down from the inside.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,180
Like that feeling that the amount of
energy that way is mirrored now on the

46
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,800
left. Maybe even though, yeah,

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,980
maybe even past I would say probably I
might not be right cause I might not be

48
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,910
remembering it perfectly.

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,440
But I feel like the energy on the left
of people getting mad at Trump is more

50
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,030
powerful or more,

51
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:58,140
there's more to it than the energy
that I saw from people on the right.

52
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,330
They wanted Obama out of office,
but it might just be my memory.

53
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,970
And you got to remember too, there's like
an age gap there. Yeah. Cause you know,

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,270
most of the people who were talking that
shit about Obama were, were pretty old.

55
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,600
Right, right. And a lot of the people
now that are pissed or really young,

56
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,520
so they're more likely to take
to the streets and you know,

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,260
smash things and hold
up signs and you know,

58
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,980
act wild and shit and mace people.
Yeah.

59
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,090
And I perspire when Bush took
office though, like when Bush, uh,

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,880
was, was being inaugurated, I remember
he was driving down, uh, to the,

61
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,470
to the White House during the inauguration
day. And they were, you know, with,

62
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,390
with Trump, the protesters kinda
came the next day. But with,

63
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,970
when Bush was inaugurated, the protesters
were all there the day of. And you know,

64
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:44,770
Bush couldn't even do the
little traditional walk
down the last few blocks of

65
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:44,961
the,

66
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:49,840
the journey because there was so many
protestors and people were just throwing

67
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,310
things at the fucking motor Cade and shit.
So I mean like this is not unusual,

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,030
but that was towards the end.
No, that was the very beginning.

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,360
What am I, which 1:00 AM I thinking of?
Wasn't there one towards the very end that

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,500
I think we're thinking of different ones.
Okay. I think I'm, my memory's fucked up,

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,550
but I think there was one towards the
end where they had planned on having him

72
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:17,850
walk down some long stretch and they
had to abandon it and get them into car.

73
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,810
Is that the same stores? Uh, yeah.
Well I think that was both times.

74
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:24,050
I think it was the first,
but even during his first time,

75
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:28,070
like when he was just first
being inaugurated president
in 2000 so right after

76
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,820
Clinton, like that inauguration was
bad. It was almost the same. Yeah,

77
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:32,421
it was terrible.

78
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:36,440
It was almost the same as what you see
now because people had had this Democrat

79
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,890
in power for eight years
and they thought like, yeah.

80
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,140
And they thought Gore is a shoe in because
Clinton's popular just same as like

81
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:49,910
Hillary's a shoe in because Obama's
popular. Right. But you know,

82
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:54,770
a Republican ended up taking it and,
and they just freaked out.

83
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,500
And it seems like that
always just happens.

84
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:00,020
I mean like this kind of like backlash,

85
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:04,040
like it always is kind of sold
to us as like this is new,

86
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,920
this is like, Oh wow, look
at what's going on now.

87
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,470
Isn't this crazy what crazy
times we live in? But it's,

88
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,980
I look back at my memories of the past
and it seems like this is pretty par for

89
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,840
the course. I think you're right.
Now that I'm thinking about it,

90
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:18,510
it's almost like we go through
these like cycles. Yeah.

91
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,420
And if a president gets past
one cycle removed from his,

92
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,800
his tenure,
then people forgive them.

93
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,820
They forget and they changed their
opinion. Yeah. Like Reagan, like, man,

94
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,340
when I was a kid,
Reagan was a pariah.

95
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,840
Like people were so upset about Reagan,
they were so upset.

96
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:43,530
And there was the contra versus Nicaragua,
uh,

97
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,100
trial that was on television with Oliver
North and we were finding out on TV,

98
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,400
like whether or not the government had
sold arms and lied about it and weather

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,100
then, you know, the,

100
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:01,100
the whole Reagan thing was the
one that Reagan sold arms to Iran,

101
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,210
the great Jimmy Tangle,

102
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:06,250
hilarious standup comedian in Boston has
this bit about it because they, well,

103
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,070
that was when Reagan started claiming
all timers or when he claimed memory

104
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:12,560
issues, which turned out to be
true. I mean, you really did.

105
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,590
I have memory issues and he probably
did it a time, but they asked him,

106
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,100
did you sell arms to Iraq? I said,
I don't know. And Jimmy Tangles,

107
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,690
like mister president,
if you ever sell to people,

108
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:28,370
hate us, jot it down,
was like, make a note,

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,840
put it on the refrigerator today.
I sold Amz to people who hate me.

110
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,320
You have to hear him. I mean, you know,
it, it, it, you have to realize though,

111
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:40,470
like America's always has been
a huge arms dealer. I mean,

112
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,320
we're constantly selling weapons.
Oh yeah. I mean like if he,

113
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,610
if he didn't remember why he did it,

114
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,250
it's probably because there were
just so many other transactions.

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,520
I don't think the president personally
gets involved too much in that sort of

116
00:06:50,521 --> 00:06:51,900
stuff. But no, probably not.

117
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,200
Country sells weapons all over the
place and we continue to do that. Yeah.

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,760
My point was there like eight years later,
he was the great Ronald Reagan.

119
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,110
Oh yeah. Eight years late. Lion eyes
goes through the Clinton administration.

120
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:07,050
Everybody's done with Clinton getting
his dick sucked and the White House and

121
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,560
all that craziness. And, and
then as soon as that's over,

122
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,370
people start reminiscing to Reagan.
It's really interesting.

123
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,650
It's really interesting how we do it.

124
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,660
And so now Bush went through this period
of being hated and he's out of office

125
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:26,130
at Obama, goes through his period of
being hated for eight years. And now that,

126
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:30,840
and even more unreasonable Republicans
in office, people long to the Bush day.

127
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,690
Oh yeah.
Like you,

128
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,980
you notice their trot and
Bush out and keep doing
interviews with them. Like, Hey,

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,970
remember this war criminal
now he's okay. Well, he's,

130
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,590
he's uncle Bush Bush here,
uncle Bush going to set you on his knee.

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,670
They um,
super important.

132
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,260
What does that protests during the Bush
administration eyes and Augie aerations.

133
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:53,130
Yeah. Yup. Wow. What does it say
and fuck Bush. Oh, buck flush,

134
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,800
flush. There's a couple of years.
My President of course, man,

135
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,330
of course. So you know, this
is, this is all so cyclic. Yeah.

136
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:06,930
It just happens over and over again and
people think it's new and the, you know,

137
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:08,460
for some, I think, I guess it's,

138
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:12,120
it's the country just has a short
memory to what a crazy show.

139
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:17,121
This is what a crazy show we're watching
the battle to control the world.

140
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,930
Yeah. Political Theater, pageantry.
But you know, like it's just,

141
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,680
I mean like I don't want to get into like
you already had Alex Jones on the show,

142
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,270
so I can't really get in to that
level of territory. But I mean,

143
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:34,350
I do agree that these
parties are constantly just
working together behind the

144
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:37,620
scenes,
and that 90% of the issues they agree on,

145
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,100
they just make a big spectacle of the
little things they actually disagree on.

146
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,900
To distract us with a show.
You look, America, look,

147
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,950
look at us. We're fighting.
We're fighting. Right?

148
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,240
How'd they stopped paying
attention? Okay, now we've made it.

149
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,610
Now we do the real deals. Who are we
going to bomb? Who are we going to invade?

150
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,200
You know, uh, who are we going to
sell weapons to? Whatever. Yeah.

151
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:07,910
Yeah.
