1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,130
G about that fucking
dude in Colorado today.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,610
He killed a mountain lion with his
bare hands. He smothered it to death.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,520
It get jacked him while he was jogging,

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,760
he was running on the trails and
mountain line grabbed him from behind.

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:16,410
He got to struggle with is 80 pound cat
and wound up suffocating it, I guess. Wow.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,570
Fucking bad ass jog or just,
yeah. I want to know on a toddler,

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,660
just call them them all a
Fokker bars. Net fuck you. Fuck.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,050
It would have to be like Derrick
Lewis or someone you know, like,

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:32,310
so I can't picture anyone else being able
to do that. Maybe he's a Jujitsu guy.

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,180
Yeah,
we see him.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,230
I've seen him when my kids were really
young in Calabasas where I live,

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,610
I saw one like just pacing back and forth
and my back fence. Oh, lime Jesus. Yeah.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,710
They're out here, man. They're out here
and we see coyotes and deer all the time.

14
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,520
But mountain lions, that's,
that's next level. Scary. Yeah.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,670
A friend of mine just sent me a message
this morning when, uh, I was, uh,

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,670
when I posted that thing on Instagram
about that guy that killed it and he said

17
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:01,671
he was running on this fire road and he
realized he like felt weird and looked

18
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:08,811
over and 20 feet away from him was a
big cat right above him on this ridge 20

19
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:14,910
feet. So that's basically us to
that wall. Big Cat just looking at,

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,690
and he said he waved his arms to look
bigger and to think just walked away. Wow.

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,360
Ah, I carry a knife when
I run, I carry a fucking,

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,780
uh, half face blades.
It's got to like a loop.

23
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,520
You could stick your thumb into it so it
stays in your hand. And people are like,

24
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,680
why are you running with a knife?
What the fuck are you doing?

25
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:37,320
Like you don't need it until you do.

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,840
And when you do you want to have it?

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,160
Didn't someone get attacked by a coyote
and hidden hills like running today?

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,990
How do I hear a story about that?

29
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,850
But I mean I've ran in my neighborhood
before and up to coyotes ran right.

30
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:54,660
Pass me the creeps. Yeah, they usually
don't mess with like humans, you know.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,650
Well we had a problem with them killing
chickens cause I have chickens in my

32
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,610
yard. Yeah, I've lost a bunch of
chickens to coyotes were they were,

33
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:02,970
they were on top of the chicken coop,

34
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:07,380
poem tiles off of it and they're creepy
little fuckers math, but they're little,

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,390
you know, these are like 35 45 pounds.
They're not very big, but they're creepy.

36
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,120
There's something about their little
wolves and they're looking at you and

37
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,760
they're trying to figure out a way like
what can they eat? What can't they eat?

38
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,560
They're out there scraping, scraping and
grinding. They're sneaky. That gangster.

39
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:25,320
Like I saw one of my friends,
a dear friend of mine,

40
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:28,440
he lost both of his dogs
to coyotes and he had,

41
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:32,100
I think he had like surveillance of it
and one is in the yard and he's playing

42
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:36,270
dead and then his a dog's approach,
what they think is dead.

43
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,440
And then basically like his home,

44
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,020
he comes out of nowhere and
attacks on the end. They both,

45
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,230
and the one that's playing dead attacks
and both of his dogs were a rap.

46
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,530
How big was dogs? Small. I
mean, they were smaller dogs,

47
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:52,710
but now he has like big German
shepherds and he's, you know,

48
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,010
he's kind of like a bigger dogs
now, but it was really sad, man.

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,910
It is a very, very, very crazy, yeah,

50
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,291
they,

51
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:05,620
they figure out some way to work and
cooperate together without communicating.

52
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,640
It's very interesting.

53
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,910
Like if it wasn't so sad that
they're killing someone's pat, it's,

54
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,960
it's really kind of fascinating
that they're so smart
that they would play dead.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,750
There was a guy that used to work at this
pet store that I go to and uh, he, uh,

56
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,000
also worked in a veterinary,
I'm center,

57
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,340
a medical place and a pit bull came in
big at one of those big Jack pit bulls

58
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,230
just covered and cuts. It
cuts all over its body. And,
uh, the owner was, you know,

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,100
they asked the owner like,
what the fuck happened? He
goes, I don't know. He goes, I,

60
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:38,800
I came home and he's covered in cots. I
really have no idea what happened to him.

61
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,160
So stitch the dog out, but hundreds
of stitches all over the dog's body.

62
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,970
Then he takes a walk outside of his house
and he follows his dog's blood and he

63
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:53,410
goes up into the hills near his house
and he finds nine dead coyotes. Wow.

64
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,540
That pit bull was starr apparently tear.

65
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,160
And he said it looked like Vietnam.

66
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:04,240
It looked like a fucking like saving
private Ryan just ripped apart coyotes.

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,350
Nine of them.

68
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,360
This motherfucker just went mall and
they must have been so bombed out there.

69
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,560
Like when look at this dog. Yeah,
there's nine of us. We're good.

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,450
We got this guy and then you see this
fucking fire hydrant head just, well

71
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,570
that doesn't feel pain. They,
they've engineered those things.

72
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,100
Like there's some pit bulls. This is
pit bull. Uh, if you go on Instagram,

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,670
I think it's, I am the hulk.
That's, that's the name of the,

74
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,180
it's a 200 pound pit bull. Like
they've gotten them to 200 pounds. Now.

75
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,600
It's the most preposterous thing you've
ever seen in your life. It looks like,

76
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,090
like, like Brock Lesnar, if
it was a pit bull, it's like,

77
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,040
it doesn't even make any sense.
You look at it like that.

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,370
A pitbull used to be like a 35 pound dog.
These to be small.

79
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,170
They look at that thing. Why in the
fuck? Imagine if a coyote saw that.

80
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,820
Fuck

81
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:59,000
those bull mastiffs.
There's fucking scary too.

82
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,810
Yeah. I had a master if he passed
away recently, I was 13 years old.

83
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,660
We had to put them down then. It was
really sad. He was, he was a great dog.

84
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,640
Mastiffs are so sweet. Look, look
at the size of that fucking dog man.

85
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,440
Just yoke to just crazy
200 pound pit bull.

86
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,910
It's just so crazy.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,090
They make them that big now. Like a
hundred pound pit bull used to be a bit.

88
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,890
I had a 90 pound one. It was a big dog and
I was like, wow, that's a big pit bull.

89
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm like, yeah, it's a big pit
bull. This dog's 110 pounds bigger.

90
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,430
Maybe it doesn't even make any sense.

91
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,523
Wow.

92
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,150
It's a fucking tank. Yeah. But that,

93
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,000
that's one of my favorite coyote death,
death stories.

94
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,870
This guy going up into the hills and
find all these dead coyote is just laying

95
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:55,650
in a pile. They tried to ambush
them. What they would do,

96
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,970
they tried to get one to come
out and try to get chased,

97
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,180
and then the one would run, and then
the other ones, ones with jump it.

98
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,890
There's like a gang.
It's straight up.

99
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,970
That's crazy that they think like
that though. That they've actually,

100
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:10,510
they have actually have
strategies. They're savages. Yeah.
