1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,661
Now,

2
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:05,661
what do you think about these guys that
are talking about bringing animals back?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,370
Um, like as a scientist?
Sure. De Extinction is,

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,610
it's a weird word. It is. It is. It's a
reintroduction. Is that a better word?

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,920
They call it the extinctions I would
call. That's what they call it. Yeah.

6
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,000
De Extinction is,
to me it's fascinating,

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,940
especially if it's something like
say the passenger pigeon, right?

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:28,490
We used to have billions of them in
the United States, wiped him out. Um,

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,540
and now they're saying, you know, Dick, we
can take the closest living relative, uh,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,650
isolate some jeans and make a new
passenger pigeon. Is that worth it?

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,350
Cause it's something we wiped out
in the last hundred years. Yes.

12
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:44,790
I feel like that's, we should heal the
ecosystem by putting that back. Right.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,670
That being said,
we still need to learn from our mistakes.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,580
Like we need to take into account
what we did and why we did it.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,390
And like do I think there should be a
Jurassic park and a bunch of mammoths and

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,020
TRX is absolutely not. That's a
waste. Whether we can or cannot do it.

17
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:01,890
To me that's a waste of scientific
resources that could go towards conserving

18
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,630
things that are on the brink.
Now,

19
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,960
when you say like he'll or men,

20
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,910
the environment or the ecosystem,

21
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,090
when you would bring back something like
a passenger pigeon isn't like 90% of

22
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,540
everything that ever existed
extinct. Sure, absolutely.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,530
So does the ecosystem adjust and evolve
and would reintroducing something like a

24
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:23,400
passenger pigeon would it kind of fucked
things up that exists now where new

25
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,040
animals have taken a different
position on the hierarchy?

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,810
It's too short and evolutionary time.

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,830
So we are in what's called the
sixth mass extinction event, right?

28
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:34,530
There's been five others before us.
The one we're in now,

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,040
it's happening at 80% greater rate
than it's ever happened before.

30
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,720
So we are wiping out things more
quickly than the world can adapt.

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,220
So you know, you go into an environment
and you take out all the apex predators,

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,270
the prey explodes, the prey
explodes, the grass gets eaten down,

33
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:54,660
everything collapses. Now if you
left that environment over time,

34
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:58,750
over evolutionary time, it
would adapt, right? Maybe say,

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,760
say all of the predators got a
disease and they died dad out over 300

36
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,880
generations during that time,

37
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,860
something would evolve within the
environment to adapt the prey so that it

38
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,840
didn't wipe out the environment. That's
just kind of the nature. It's balance.

39
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,770
But when you go in there and do
it in 10 years or five years,

40
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,640
it throws off the equilibrium.
So when you, in theory,

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,700
when you reintroduce something that's
been, and it's not theory, it's,

42
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,271
it's science,

43
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,850
they've shown this even right here
in the California Channel Islands.

44
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,820
When you put something back
that's missing from the ecosystem,

45
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:32,250
it's like you're putting a
piece of the puzzle back, right?

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,310
And then you can allow it to do
its thing over evolutionary time.

47
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,080
What did they do in the channel islands?

48
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,500
So I was actually a big part of
that and I loved, loved the project.

49
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,860
So the California channel islands were
settled by agriculture. There were sheeps,

50
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,290
goats, pigs, blah, blah, blah. There was
everything brought over there. Right?

51
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,140
And so not Catalina, but think about
the northern channel islands. Um,

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,200
what happened was when all
these animals were brought in,

53
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,500
all the farmers were there.
Then Golden Eagle started coming over.

54
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,140
Golden Eagles came over to eat
the pigs and everything else.

55
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,450
They flew across the ocean,
flew across the channel,

56
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:03,010
started praying on pigs
and everything else.

57
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,220
There was an animal on the channel
islands called the Channel Island Fox.

58
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,160
Very gorgeous, cute,
cuddly little Fox. Um,

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,650
you can see them if you've got a Santa
Cruz island, there's loads of them now,

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,400
thanks to the work that scientists have
done. Anyway, they were like, okay,

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,180
the Fox is being there. It
is, isn't it gorgeous? Thanks.

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,740
So the Fox is being wiped out through
habitat destruction through all these

63
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:27,280
undulates that have been brought in.
So scientists got together and said,

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,240
what undulates cows. Yeah, domestic
animals, cows, sheep, goats, et cetera.

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,020
So scientists came in and said, you know,
the habitats getting destroyed, the,

66
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,380
and that,
that's just the keystone.

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
There were several species that were
on the decline. The cows are getting,

68
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,320
the livestock is wiping out the habitat.
The foxes are declining.

69
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,530
What did we do? Well, obvious answer.
Let's remove all the livestock.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,170
So we removed all the livestock,
right through helicopters.

71
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,540
It was a lot of pigs that were causing
damage, all that kind of stuff.

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,373
We were moved at all.

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,950
Then the Golden Eagle started praying
on the foxes because their main habitat

74
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:59,350
was gone. So now the foxes
are under even more pressure.

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,000
So then we were moved the Golden Eagles.

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,130
This is a very abridged
version of what happened,

77
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:07,180
but now we've got the Golden Eagles
also pushed out the Bald Eagle,

78
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,680
which are fish eaters,
which lived on the island.

79
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,580
So now after loads of years of removing
golden eagles, like relocating them,

80
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,050
removing all of the livestock,

81
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,600
now you have a healthy population
of channel island foxes.

82
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,340
The Bald Eagles are
back there eating fish.

83
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,060
The whole ecosystem is back in balance.
Had it been left the way it was,

84
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,540
what you would have found
at the California Channel
Islands over say 20 or 30

85
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,320
more years, 40 or 50 more years?
No foxes, no, no bald eagles,

86
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,390
a ton of Golden Eagles and a ton of pigs.

87
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,490
And likely over time pigs would have
exploded to the point that they Easter

88
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,840
island to themselves. Right? They
ate up all the resources, destroyed,

89
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,930
all the habitat. Population
collapsed. Golden Eagles collapse,

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,420
nothing left on the APP. What do you
mean by Easter island themselves?

91
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,640
So you're familiar with Easter
Island and South America?

92
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,360
I know what those statues are
and all that stuff, but I,

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,150
I'm not familiar with what happened
to Sean. So that island is,

94
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,840
was an ancient civilization. That was
the Mech. It had everything offline.

95
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,150
It had big trees, tons of food,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

96
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,230
People settled there and they said,
this place is incredible. It's,

97
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:06,730
it's paradoxical. Um, and then they
started cutting down the trees to fish.

98
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:08,200
They started eating all the mammals.

99
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,870
And what actually happened is
because there were so remote,

100
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,630
the middle of the ocean, nowhere near
South America, nowhere near anywhere else,

101
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,930
they cut down the last tree.
There were no more canoes,

102
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,600
there was no more food on the island.
And the population collapsed.

103
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,620
The island was barren. It was void of
trees, void of life, void of anything.

104
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,680
And they didn't have the canoes or
anything to leave anymore because they cut

105
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,030
down the last tree to build,

106
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,980
build a boat or make firewood and
everybody there died. Oh Shit. So that,

107
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,600
that's what happens when you
use up every last resource. God.

108
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:41,950
So wow, when did this
happen? Uh, I couldn't,

109
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,340
couldn't tell you cause I thought it
was like a mystery what happened to the

110
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,870
population of Easter island. So
they, they're pretty, that's yours.

111
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,830
That's the accepted, that's the
scientifically accepted understanding.

112
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:54,610
Did they get this from fossils?
They get this from bones. So they,

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,820
they've sort of pieced it together.
Yup. They took, they take, you know,

114
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,460
isotope samples and measure
carbon dating and Yadda Yadda.

115
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,590
I think that the heads are
still a pretty big mystery.

116
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,570
Why I think a certain people believe
that the heads were like, uh, an Ale,

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,990
you know, calling to the gods to help save
things cause they were going so badly,

118
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,870
Yada Yada. But I believe the heads
are still a pretty big mystery.

119
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,900
But the actual anthropology,
that population, the collapse is,

120
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,430
is known to be due to a running out
of resource. How long did it go for?

121
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,420
Couldn't tell you. Did they have an
idea of how long the population lasted?

122
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,580
I think it's all, I think
it's all published. Yeah.

123
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,680
I don't know off the top of my head,
but it was,

124
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,030
it was a thriving population that
flew too close to the sun as they say,

125
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,050
because of Easter Island, small
size. When he's 63 square miles,

126
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,410
it quickly became overpopulating its
resources. We're rapidly depleted.

127
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:46,100
When Europeans arrived in Easter island
between the late 17 hundreds in the

128
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,660
early 18 hundreds it was reported that
the more I were knocked down and the

129
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,280
islands seem to,
did I say that right?

130
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,370
My why being knocked down and the island
seem to have been a recent war site.

131
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,440
Hmm. Last supplies. Yeah.
Let's see. The next one there.

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,160
Constant warfare between the tribes,
lack of surprise, plies and resources,

133
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:07,994
disease,

134
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,060
invasive species and the opening of the
island to foreign slave trade eventually

135
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,060
led to Easter island's
collapsed by the 1860s wow.

136
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,010
So it didn't take long. 1700
the 1860s that was a wrap. Wow.

137
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,810
It was annexed by Chile,

138
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,960
and so they've never tried to repopulate
the island with trees or anything else,

139
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,780
and they're just kind of leave it alone.
I believe so.

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,630
I know you can go there and visit it
and see the heads and I think there are

141
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:36,140
some things there now, but it's, it's
barren. There are no trees. There's no,

142
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
you know,
it's all been depleted.
