1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,950
Well she did. This was the fucked up thing
was she wasn't in any way overweight.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Like she was beautiful. She had great
body. She just, it was just like a weird,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,940
she was an actress, you know,
and I think that that pressure,

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,450
the pressure, that Gig is
just so crazy. It's just,

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,990
first of all, you take
someone who, most of the time,

6
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:25,890
the reason why that we want to become an
actor is because they didn't get enough

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,890
attention.
That's a lot of what causes it.

8
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,891
Especially if you have like this weird
sort of nonspecific desire for fame.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,340
It's not like you,
you're a really good character actress.

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:41,760
You know you're a Faye Dunaway
or something like that.
You just really good at,

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,680
you love the craft of creating a
character. Now there's a lot of them,

12
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,200
they just want to be famous.
And why? Why is that?

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,810
It's usually there's something
fucked up from childhood.

14
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:56,070
Usually somebody wasn't paying
attention to them. Parents split up,

15
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,200
something went wrong. Right? Yeah. See,

16
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,620
take this person that's super insecure
and has is exorbitant need for attention,

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,320
and then you put them through
this audition process.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,230
The additional process is
the craziest thing ever.

19
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:11,460
It devastates people's self esteem because
you just get rejected all the time,

20
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:12,280
rejected all the,

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,070
and you're not selling a tee shirt
that know want you're selling yourself.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Did I state this girl when I first
moved to La and when she would go on

23
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,810
auditions when if she would get rejected,

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,810
she would want to fuck like a wild animal.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,540
It's like she wanted
something to just like,

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,770
she wanted to just fucking scream too.
She wanted to,

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,660
she was w it was like the stress of it
all was so crazy. She wanted validation.

28
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,980
She wants to blow off steam.
It was just the stress of it all.

29
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,010
It's so unhealthy and the people that
go into that are some of the most the

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,073
least,

31
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,720
it's the least advisable career path
for them to be. How exactly? Yeah.

32
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,090
It attracts the wrong people.

33
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,850
It's just a fucked up situation.

34
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:06,900
You have these people judging you like
come on in Kyle. Yeah, I can't tell it.

35
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,970
Tell us about yourself.
A lot of trouble auditioning.

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,410
Tell me what your favorite animal is.

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,970
Who you are. I told them, you
told Tom he loved it a level.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,930
That's great. Wow. Tom Cruise. I
want to audition once and this girl

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,550
told me, she asked me where I was from
and I said I was from New Jersey. And uh,

40
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,920
she goes, uh, she goes, I'm
from New York. She goes, well,

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,540
I'm actually from New Jersey, but I don't
tell people that. I go, why? She goes,

42
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:41,160
well, it's cool to say you're from New
York. I go, that's ridiculous. I go,

43
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,160
that doesn't make any sense at
all. I go, why would you lie? I go,

44
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:48,150
and then he just told me and she goes,
are you ready to audition?

45
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,680
I'm like, okay. So she's like
giving me like the sour look.

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,470
And I had a same with the
audition, told you gay. And then I,

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,510
she had a sour look on her face and
I had to sing a line from a Bruce

48
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,600
Springsteen song to her in the audition.

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,120
It was so humiliating.
Auditioning for Tara band movie,

50
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:11,090
some terrible movie.

51
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,650
It was a singing in the movie where
there's a guy and a girl and you know,

52
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,771
like Tom to grow.

53
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,700
How much a lover and I'm
singing like fucking born to
run or something like that.

54
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,570
I don't even remember.

55
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,730
I think everyone would love to
hear a little bit right now.

56
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,370
Ooh, can dream. I don't remember.

57
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,600
I don't even remember what song
didn't get it. No, no, no, not,

58
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:36,010
not only did I not get it, but this
is very, very important moment for me.

59
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,290
I left and um, I realized that's
when I realized I was like this,

60
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:46,090
this whole process for me at least
is broken. Like I'm not good at this.

61
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,670
This is not like I'm not good
at pretending to be someone.

62
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,770
Like everybody who goes in there,
they,

63
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,360
they go into these auditions and there
was these people who were like air quotes,

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,920
working actors. They do little
s I, you know, I was on,

65
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,880
just shoot me for saying, you know, I
had a nice episode on this. You know,

66
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,520
those people,
they're like hopping around those people.

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,640
They develop this real slick
way of talking and they
don't say nice to meet you

68
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,080
because they might already
met you. So they say, good
to see you. Good to see you.

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,210
Kyle. Good to see you. Oh
it's cause I keep remembering,

70
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,070
forgetting funes Dunbar's number only
serve certain number of people you can

71
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,670
keep in your head. But this,
this, this way of doing it.

72
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,930
I was recognizing it the way they would
talk. Everyone was like super left wing,

73
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,230
super progressive.
No one explored ideas.

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,100
You just adopted whatever everybody else
was going with and ran with. Oh yes,

75
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:42,550
I agree. Hillary is so much more
qualified ever. He would just be blue,

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,320
just say shit like that.
It was just,

77
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,590
it was really strange that were
like real obvious Democrat Lien.

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,260
They weren't thinking it through.

79
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,150
They just adopted this mindset and they
were just sneaking their way through

80
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:55,984
this system.

81
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,130
They were like exploiting
little personality holes in
the system and they would

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,440
get,
become friends with casting agents.

83
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,820
And one of the casting agents was a woman
I knew this one casting agent who was

84
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,821
friends with a friend of mine and she
was kind of gross and just being nice and

85
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:14,910
being kind by saying Kinda.
And uh, she fucked it.

86
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:18,070
All these actor guys and she would go,
I want to know who this is.

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,460
I can't tell you. She, she, she's a
nice lady. She just looked, she's,

88
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,600
she was basically doing what a lot, she
was doing the casting couch in reverse.

89
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,370
Right. But she was like aggressive,
sexually aggressive with guys.

90
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,960
Yeah.
And one of my friends,

91
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,210
she's super sexually aggressive with one
of my friends is a Henrietta Weinstein.

92
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,990
I can't tell you.
Well she,

93
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,250
you know,
she was,

94
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,990
she was casting quite a few
different shows and she knew how to,

95
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,890
she knew how to get these,
these, these exploit people,

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,460
these guys that were saying
good to see you. Those guys,

97
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,160
she would fuck those guys. Cause that
was, that was the way they could play it.

98
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,830
You know,

99
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,510
that's the way they get close to this.
Her seduction went,

100
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,370
I don't know when it was. It's brutal
though. Auditioning and it's hard.

101
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm terrible. I booked one,
I've gotten like sketch shows,

102
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:15,050
but I've only booked one show
where it was like a script. A Guy,

103
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,440
it was a sitcom I booked like I guest
starring thing and I went in and I'm a

104
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:23,070
terrible reader and for the read through
they do a read through with a network.

105
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,070
Like I don't, a couple days before
they shoot and they gave me like,

106
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,210
oh you have eight new lines, whatever.
And I can, I read like a third grader,

107
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,100
very poor.

108
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,330
So I the Big Table read through it and
I stammered through the whole thing.

109
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:41,220
I got fired. So the only show I booked
really off. It's typical audition,

110
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:44,840
reading a script. I was fired
from Jesus Christ. I mean,

111
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,360
so many wasted hours memorizing,
paying,

112
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,940
acting coach and none of it
worked out for me is why?

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,370
Cause I get really nervous.
I feel very judged.

114
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:57,100
I feel very uncomfortable.
I'm a terrible reader.

115
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,820
So I ended up like having to memorize it
and then most of my time is like trying

116
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:08,240
to remember. It's just
basically get too nervous. Sir.

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,800
Did you ever try to like see a
hypnotist or anything like that or

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,590
no, but that probably would have been a
good idea because it was a mental, yeah.

119
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,190
Shutdown. Like, you know, some
people just react. You don't,

120
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,220
can't help how you react. But
it's like, if you can imagine,

121
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:25,840
if you're afraid of bees for example,

122
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,740
it's like go in and audition with a bunch
of bees flying around. You did your,

123
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,440
your,
your body's reacting and like a fear way.

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,550
It's really hard to grab your facilities
to act or whatever you're doing.

125
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,163
It's possible.

126
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,050
Yeah. So, yeah, no, I get it. I mean,
especially if you think like this,

127
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:46,070
God, this could be it.
This is the big moment.

128
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,940
Always one of the worst ways
for you to behave like or,

129
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:53,570
or to perform rather in something
that's like really important,

130
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,830
especially with an acting
situation where you know,

131
00:07:56,831 --> 00:08:01,831
you're supposed to pretend to be in love
or to pretend to be happy and whatever

132
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,930
the fuck it is. Like you're, all you're
thinking is don't fuck this up. Don't,

133
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,800
don't fuck this up. And that's like the
overlying mantra to all your thoughts

134
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,840
doing it.
Do this correct is not the great mindset.

135
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,980
Were you going to do a good
performance? I like, um, uh,

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,940
oh,
I just fell out of my head

137
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,870
whenever I was about to say
I was going to be hilarious.

138
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:25,790
It was the best part of the show.
It was going to be great. Yeah,

139
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,460
that, but this is one of the reasons why
so many people are so crazy out here.

140
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,820
It's like come here crazy.
And then the system gets some crazier.

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,370
And then you also realize that unless
you're doing something like what you're

142
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:40,190
doing or are you just doing
your own thing on Instagram,

143
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,400
somebody has to pick you to work.
You have to get picked,

144
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,340
which is just nuts.
Like as comics,

145
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,240
all we have to do is just go to an open
mic night practice, you know? Right.

146
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,580
Come up with some jokes, do well you
come back, do well, you come back,

147
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:58,710
you just keep grinding.
A couple of years down the road,

148
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,020
you're starting to get like a
Gig here and a gig there. Yeah.

149
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,970
I'm opening up for this guy and yeah,

150
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,800
I got a Gig Mc and at this place and then
a couple of years after that middling.

151
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,510
And then a couple of like, there's a,
there's an actual thing you can do.

152
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,390
If you're good, you can
do, you can make a living.

153
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,160
I can't imagine just just being an actor.
Oh, forget it. Ah, they go crazy, dude. I,

154
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:21,180
I have friends that are just actors.
They go crazy.

155
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,170
They all go crazy.

156
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,330
By the time they're in their forties
they're out of their fucking mind.

157
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,520
And Women, oh, the,

158
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,900
that they feel like they feel like they
have this little tiny ass hourglass and

159
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:35,640
it's just run a sand every
day. Yeah. And like you said,

160
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,930
it's, you know, a lot of times you're not
starting with the most secure people. No.

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,920
Almost never.
