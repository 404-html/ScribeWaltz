00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,190
Hello Freak bitches, intelligent
conversation about that, right?

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,140
Because the lefties say,
oh,

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,500
too much inequality and they need to
be listened to because the evidence is

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:13,230
quite clear.
If you let the inequality ramp up enough,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,890
the whole system destabilizes because
the people at the bottom think fuck it.

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:20,910
We'll just, we'll just flip the
system upside down. No one wants that.

7
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,400
Like right wing conservatives
don't want that.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,380
So cause you could make a
republican argument and say,

9
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:29,010
don't let the inequality in
your neighborhood get out
of hand because the crime

10
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,590
rate will skyrocket.
And the,

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,740
the empirical evidence on
that is overwhelmingly strong.
Inequality drives crime.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,050
Now you can say,
you can argue about why,

13
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,450
but the fact that it does
is that's not disputable.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,810
So we can have an intelligent discussion
between the left and the right and the

15
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,110
discussion would go something like this.
You need innovation,

16
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,880
you pay for innovation with inequality,

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,540
but you need to bind inequality
because if it's too intense than things

18
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,990
destabilize, it's like, okay, we can agree
on that. We've got the parameter set.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,980
Now we have to,

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,280
now we have to start thinking very
carefully through how to do the

21
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:02,550
redistribution issue. And we don't know
how to do that. So you might say, well,

22
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,590
we have a guaranteed
annual income for people,

23
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:06,630
which I think is a horrible
solution by the way,

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,400
but it addresses the right problem.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,460
The problem is is that
we're hyper productive,

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,470
but the spoils go to those at the top.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,390
And some of those resources need to be
funneled down to the people who have zero

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,690
so that they have an opportunity to at
least get to the point where they can

29
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,930
innovate. And so the bloody whole
bloody thing doesn't wobble and fall.

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,130
And we could we,

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,430
and I would say in some sense that's
what the political discussion is about.

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,340
But we, we've, we've skittered off
into these radical oversimplifications,

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,200
which is something like, well, if,
if you have more than another person,

34
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,860
you're an oppressor and you're evil,
and if you have less,

35
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:44,650
it's because you're virtuous and
victimized. And that's just a nonstarter.

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,730
So you you think that there's a real
problem with like something like a

37
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:50,880
universal basic income? I think
it's horrible. I do. Well.

38
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,410
I think the idea that the solution is a
basic income is not a good idea because

39
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,410
I think the problem is deeper than that.
I,

40
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,810
I don't think the fundamental problem
is that people don't have enough money.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,970
I think the fundamental problem is that
human beings in some sense are beasts of

42
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,010
burden and if they're not given,

43
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,390
if they're not provided with a place where
they can accept social responsibility,

44
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,390
social and individual responsibility
and an honorable manner,

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,340
they degenerate and die. That's the
opiate crisis in west right now.

46
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:24,990
Like men need men who are,
men don't need money,

47
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,040
they need function and we've got
a problem. One of the problems is,

48
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,430
for example here, here's an ugly stat.
I think I told you this once before.

49
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,780
It's illegal to induct anyone into the
armed forces if they have an Iq of less

50
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,400
than 83 and the reason for that
is the, the, the armed forces,

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,640
despite having every reason to draw the
contradictory conclusion has decided

52
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,250
that there isn't a single thing that you
can be trained to do in the military.

53
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:54,060
If you have an Iq of less than 83 that
isn't positively counterproductive,

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,840
that's 10% of the population and
we're producing a culture that's

55
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,320
very cognitively complex like,

56
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,330
what the hell are you going to
do if you can't use a computer?

57
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,010
Like if you can use a computer,

58
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,250
you're at least in the game if you can
really use when you're hyper powerful.

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,430
If you're not literate
enough to use a computer,

60
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,900
you're at zero 10% of the population.
The Conservatives say, well,

61
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,610
there's a job for everyone. If they
just worked hard enough. It's like, no,

62
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,280
and increasingly know and
the liberals say, well,

63
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,220
everyone's basically the same and you can
train anyone to do anything. It's like,

64
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,080
no,
you can't.

65
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,490
I want to go back to the inequality
point here because if you look at this

66
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:38,260
biologically, actually I think it
reveals a lot. Why are we, I mean,

67
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,960
we know from,
uh,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
from careful study that people are
motivated by the degree of inequality more

69
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:50,590
than they are the, the absolute
level of wellbeing that they have.

70
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,930
And there's a very good,
it's tragic,

71
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,760
but a very good evolutionary
reason for this,

72
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:59,761
which is if you are working on some
piece of land and your neighbor has the

73
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:03,400
adjacent piece of land and they're
doing twice as well as you,

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,250
it's because they know
something you don't, right.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,840
And so becoming focused on what they're
doing that you're not doing is a

76
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,360
rational thing to spend your time on.

77
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:15,460
So you can figure out what it is
that they know that you don't.

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,930
In the modern environment,
this is a catastrophe because
who are your neighbors?

79
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,440
Well,

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,580
you've got some box sitting on the wall
of your living room that has a totally

81
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:28,810
artificial portrait of other people
who may be much wealthier than you.

82
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,500
And it's broadcasting in as if you're
looking in their window right in the

83
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,480
adjacent house. And so you think
you, you're being triggered to,

84
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,090
to think that you're
doing something wrong,

85
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:40,780
that you might fix when in fact the
solution may not be, first of all,

86
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,730
the person on the other side of
that screen may not be for real. Um,

87
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,700
but even if they are, they're not
living in the same environment as you.

88
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,050
The technology is interfacing with,
uh, with our, our brains badly.

89
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,000
But so we have the perception of
massive inequality economically.

90
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,770
We do have massive inequality.

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,150
You're arguing that the solution to
this involves some sort of massive

92
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:08,290
redistribution as solution, I would
say solution. But nonetheless,

93
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,860
redistribution is wildly
unpopular for various reasons.

94
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:16,030
And so what we've got now is a situation,

95
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,100
this is speculative,

96
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:22,840
but what's really happening
is that austerity is being
used as a threat to keep

97
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:26,170
people who would otherwise rebel
against the inequality in line.

98
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,570
And my fear about this is that this is
exactly the conditions that are going to

99
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,430
trigger that,
uh,

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,150
tribal population against population may
hem that we were talking about at the

101
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:44,370
beginning of this conversation that
when people have the sense that the,

102
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,700
the burst of growth that they
were experiencing is now over,

103
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,780
the natural response is to turn on those
who are not as powerful and take their

104
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:53,614
stuff.

105
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,190
That this is a totally indefensible
but nonetheless biological

106
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,100
pattern of history.
And that if we want to avoid that,

107
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,490
we have to stop sending the signals that
trigger us to imagine that we've just

108
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:10,340
run to the limit of the
opportunity that we had discovered.

109
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,580
And it is now time to look and see
who can't defend their position.

110
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,170
How are we sending these
signals? Well by, um,

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,880
basically failing to provide enough
wellbeing that people's perception of the

112
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,590
inequality is reduced
to a tolerable level.

113
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,260
What's the argument for
universal basic income?

114
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:33,870
It's certainly certainly a strong
one. And I, you know, it's also,

115
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,880
it's also a good argument for equality of
opportunity, right? Because people are,

116
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,910
people are actually not as resentful
about the success of others as you might

117
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:47,630
expect. They're resentful about it
if they feel that the game is fixed,

118
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,420
but they're also willing to
consider the game long term.

119
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:54,500
So lots of people will say, look like
I'm stuck at not zero, I'm stuck at one,

120
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,710
but my kids might make it to
four and that's good enough.

121
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,170
And that's been the American
dream. Right? And, and that's,

122
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,700
that's a really high power antidote
to inequality. It's like, well yeah,

123
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,540
there's some inequality. We need it to
keep the generative mechanism going,

124
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,730
but the game is fair
and you can play it too.

125
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,850
And there's some reasonable probability
that either you or someone you love will

126
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:18,020
be successful. So that, so
it has to be a straight game.

127
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,050
And that's why ethics is so important
to keep this landscape stable.

128
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:24,830
People can't play crooked games and the
rich shouldn't be fixing the game if

129
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,850
they want to hold onto their money. And
the problem is, is that some of them,

130
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,870
although not all,

131
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,760
some of them are fixing the game and no
one's happy about that. And no wonder,

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,713
you know,
and,

133
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,720
and I guess that was evidence to some
degree by the 2008 collapse because it

134
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,180
seemed,
and,

135
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,090
and I'm just as uninformed
as the next person. So I'm,

136
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,390
I'm what I'm capable
of commenting on this,

137
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:55,370
it seems from the outside that the rich
disproportionately benefited from the

138
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,470
restabilize [inaudible]
of the economic system.

139
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,190
And people are not happy about that
and they shouldn't be happy about that

140
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:04,340
because it indicates that
there's something fundamentally
rotten about the game.

141
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,541
So you could say,
well,

142
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,170
maybe people can tolerate necessary
inequality if the game isn't raked.

143
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,740
And so that's why everybody has to act
in a matter that indicates that the game

144
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:17,150
isn't rigged. And that means they can't
rig it. That's really what it means. So,

145
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,140
and so we're also being driven
into this inequality corner by,

146
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:26,141
I would say by the postmodernists and
the neo Marxist because they say this is

147
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,950
the pernicious thing. They say, well,

148
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,240
the reason that some people have more
than others is because every hierarchy is

149
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,570
based on arbitrary power
and they're all oppressors.

150
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,230
And the reason they have the money
is because they stole it from you.

151
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,340
And there's some truth in that
because there are some criminals.

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,970
But when you get to the point where
you fail to distinguish the productive

153
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,230
people from the criminals,

154
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:51,080
which is exactly what happened
in the 1920s in the Soviet Union,

155
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,100
you better bloody well what watch out.
Because when you radically make things,

156
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,640
egalitarianism going to wipe out all
your productive people and then you're

157
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:02,190
going to starve.
And so that's,

158
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,250
that's one of the doom end scenarios
that awaits us if this idiot process of

159
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:11,400
polarization continues. And what I find
reprehensible about the universities,

160
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,980
and you're tangled up right
up to your neck in this,

161
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:18,981
is that the universities are actively
agitating to produce people who believe

162
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:23,700
that all inequality is due to
oppression and power. And that's just,

163
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,010
well, first of all,
it's technically wrong,

164
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,940
but you guys both operate in that system.
So what?

165
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,940
Here's the problem. No,
I, as far as I know,

166
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,030
nobody has properly studied the question
of what fraction of the economy is

167
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,780
actually crooked rent seeking,
right? Not Productive.

168
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,640
And I fear that the answer
to that question is that
it's an awful large fraction

169
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:54,930
of the economy, not because
of some, uh, conspiracy,

170
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,940
but because opportunity is finite,
but con Games aren't.

171
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,740
And so anybody who can find a mechanism
for transferring wealth from somebody

172
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,820
else for doing nothing,
finds that mechanism and that
thing is, is ever present.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,800
Whereas discovering the next big thing
that's actually productive is, you know,

174
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:18,420
something that goes along in fits and
starts. And so if we were, I mean really,

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,650
you've described it very well.

176
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,680
We've got a battle between two
characatures of what's true,

177
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,190
right?

178
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,150
Are there either the market is wonderful
and it's producing great stuff with

179
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:35,151
very little corruption or everything that
makes people on equal is the result of

180
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:37,560
corruption. Both of these
things are wrong, right?

181
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Markets are marvelous engines for figuring
out how to do something really well.

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,360
They're brilliant at this, right? And so
people who see that fall in love with it,

183
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,160
understandably because
they're so good at it,

184
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:54,030
but what they're terrible at is telling
you what you should want or what you

185
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:58,950
should do, right? If people tell markets,
here's what we would like to accomplish,

186
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,430
and then the markets tell us, well,
how do we accomplish that best?

187
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,170
That would be a very viable system
that would not result in massive rent

188
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:07,830
seeking,

189
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,400
resulting in everybody feeling that all
of their misfortunes are the result of a

190
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:15,210
rigged game, which is so massively rigged
that when they check, they see, yes,

191
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:19,870
that is actually large, large to large
extent what we're suffering from. Um,

192
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,110
but they want to throw the
baby out with the bath water.

193
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,100
And so they want to throw out
markets entirely, which you know,

194
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,850
would be a terrible mistake.
