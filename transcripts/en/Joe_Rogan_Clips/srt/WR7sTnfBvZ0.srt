1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
Yeah. And, and I think that, um, you know,

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:07,170
so like shoulder to shoulder person a
person, I feel like a bit of a disconnect,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,700
you know?
But social media,

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,120
like we get to share information
sometimes not good information,

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:13,470
sometimes good information,

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,610
like the fact that people
are communicating I think
is important. Um, it's,

7
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,940
it's making people take stands on
things that they're all finding out. Oh,

8
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,900
you believe that too? Or I think that
too, like cool. Like I can find my people,

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,620
you know? But on the actual
like oxytocin, like social side,

10
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,240
people actually getting
to know each other,

11
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:34,890
like those like intimate relationships.
Like I feel like that part is,

12
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,570
is suffering a little bit from it.

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,460
I think that suffering a little bit in
real life because people were in cars,

14
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:42,390
they're in traffic,

15
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:45,240
they're isolated than they go to work
and they're in a cubicle all day and

16
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,090
they'd get home. They're in their
apartment or their house. Yeah.

17
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:53,091
There's not a lot of like interaction
with people and just think this is just a

18
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,570
side effect of modern life. You know?
It's weird that there's so many,

19
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,500
like in La,

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,980
there's so many people next to each other
and almost nobody knows their neighbor.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,450
It's very strange.

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,710
What I'm talking about is I think
countries are stupid like states.

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,240
I think countries like states,

24
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,540
like I think we should build a wall over
Florida before we should build a wall

25
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:17,130
for Mexico. I mean, I mean
Florida is a state, right?

26
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,160
But Florida is just as alien as like
say Finland or something like that.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,363
I mean it's just,

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,490
just the fact that you can move out of
Florida and they're like, fuck Florida,

29
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:29,750
man, I'm going to, I'm going to move to
Atlanta. And he'd go up there and like,

30
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,950
nobody stops you. You just go. But if
you're in Tiawana like you like no dog,

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,980
there's a fence up here, pitch like
this. No, there's no crossing did.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,350
To me that seems like super fucking
strange and almost like guaranteeing that

33
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,820
those spots are fucked forever.

34
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,410
And the only way those anything's ever
going to level out is if you let anybody

35
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:50,460
travel wherever they want.

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,910
And nobody's willing to do that because
it might fuck up the good spots.

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,380
Like la Jolla would be like, no,
no, no. You can't just like, yeah,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
you can't just come over from,
I mean you think about it,

39
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,440
La Jolla has some of the wealthiest
real estate in the world, right?

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,380
And unbelievable.
Beautiful views.

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,060
And you could walk to Mexico
from La Jolla. You could walk,

42
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,470
I mean, what's the distance between
Tijuana and La Jolla? Let's guess.

43
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,800
Let me guess. I'm gonna
say it's 50 miles. Is it 50

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm going to say 50 no, I, it's not that
many cause it's already depending on,

45
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,690
oh yeah. I would say it's
a 30 minute drive. Like,

46
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,950
like moderate, normal speed
limit. No traffic. 35 yeah,

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,420
maybe.

48
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,340
So maybe it's 30 miles.
So it's like a marathon or a marathon run.

49
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,930
Which people do.
They run it all.

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,960
They run marathons all top 2030 to 32
miles 30 so you're in fucking tier one or

51
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,800
you were in a third world country and
one of the worst neighborhoods of a third

52
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,590
world country and 32 miles away.

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,720
You have like these unbelievable mansions
on these bluffs overlooking the ocean,

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,370
like Nigga, that shit.
That's crazy. That's crazy.

55
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:07,270
And Auto, it's very weird.
Yeah, exactly. It's very weird.

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,340
Yeah. And I, and yeah,
that corn, Otto the island,

57
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,800
that's all super wealthy people.
Right?

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,800
That's where Dick Cheney lives apparently.

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,930
Yeah. They, they have the ability
of shutting that whole island down.

60
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:24,210
If there's like vandalism or like,
cause it's,

61
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:27,660
it's got its entry and it's out like,
um,

62
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,860
what is it called? The way.
So it's not exactly an island,

63
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:35,430
like it does attach to the land. What does
that call to peninsula? Yeah. Yeah. So,

64
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,630
but they have an ability at both the
peninsula edge and the bridge to shut it

65
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:44,580
down as a community.

66
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:47,640
If Shit's going down on the island and
they don't want someone to get off.

67
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,790
Wow. Yeah. That's how rich they are. Yeah.

68
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,120
It's only one of the wealthiest
places in the world. And another one,

69
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,310
there's a one off side off of Miami.

70
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,470
There's like some little tiny island
that's filled only with rich people star,

71
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,400
I think so. It was called. Yeah.

72
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,740
It's like one of the most
wealthy places on the planet.

73
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,190
It's one little spot off Miami just
filled with rich folks waiting for a

74
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:13,390
hurricane to fuck up though.
Is that it?

75
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:17,770
Star island is a tiny neighborhood
of massive houses and drama. Oh,

76
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:22,450
there's drama. Oh, see the
big x on it. Like fuck this
place. Okay. It's not a drama.

77
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,140
Damn bad ass houses though. But
they have good brunch to, yeah,

78
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,890
that's a little too, so they have a little
bridge and it's a little tiny island.

79
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,450
All right. Good luck people.
Weird people are weird cat.

80
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,860
That's not safe. Nothing feels safe. Not
in Miami. Pirate. A pirate. Come wipe.

81
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,890
That whole thing that owls,

82
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,190
the place is filled with pirates
that places filled with weird shit.

83
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,280
It's just Florida is so straight. I love
it. I'm joking around, but I hate it.

84
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,110
But I love Miami. I just, it's so strange.
It's such a, every time I go down there,

85
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm like, you should have
to have a passport to come
here. This is not America.

86
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,340
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.
It's great, but it's, it's chaos.

87
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,030
But then there's some Florida spots
like we like, okay, Pensacola,

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,410
you just go fuck yourself.

89
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,350
Would you say it's basically Alabama
as wealthy? It might as well we,

90
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:13,900
other than Roy Jones Jr, I
mean, he came out of there.

91
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,550
You put pence coal on the map.
