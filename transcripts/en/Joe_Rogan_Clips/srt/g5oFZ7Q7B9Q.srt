1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,721
But it's also,

2
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:04,530
they're documenting some of the greatest
standup specials in the history of

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,950
stand up. There's like the Chappelle
specials, the two recent ones that he did.

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,050
They're putting that stuff
out there and they're,

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,560
they're doing it in a way where
no one else would do it. Like Hbo,

6
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,900
which was the gold standard
for the longest time. Yeah.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,350
They would never do two Dave
Chappelle specials at the same time.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,940
Netflix is like, okay, we'll do Dave's
like, I got this new shit I want to do.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,840
I'm going to do it in the belly
room at the comedy store. You know,

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,140
and Dave was so ridiculous about it.
Dave and I were downstairs. Yeah.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,410
While he was doing this, while he was
filming this, we're downstairs, uh,

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,000
in the smoking area of the comedy
store getting high as fuck. Yeah.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,590
And uh, he was so casual about it is
like, hey man, you want to do a set?

14
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,330
You did a set on the, no, no, no. I
just want to watch. I said, no, no.

15
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:49,490
I did three sets a night.
I go,

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,330
I'm just going to chill and hang
out in the back of the room,

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,590
but he was so relaxed,
like during his special being taped,

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,520
he's offering me a guest set. He's
like, hey man, I'll do a set, you know?

19
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:04,400
He still shows up. He'll fly to places
and show up and just do guests sets.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,630
Yeah. I was in Denver. I
come out the green room,

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,820
it's Friday night and chapels in the green
room and I go there with it and goes,

22
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:16,140
hey Joe. I go, what are you doing? Oh
Man. It felt like coming to Denver. I go,

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,130
you want to do a set? It's like, oh yeah,
fuck it. So I bring him up on stage.

24
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:25,020
The audience is leaving, they're leaving.
Can I come back? It's your pals here.

25
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,900
They're like, what's, yeah, yeah.
Everybody comes back. He does 40 minutes.

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,290
It was amazing because that's
how he's doing it. He's like,

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,310
he's doing it for the art. He's not doing
it because he's making any money. Loves.

28
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,060
He did a free 40 minute show for these
people that came there to see me.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,170
Fucking loves it and it's loves it.
And he's, it's like true with him, man.

30
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,090
He's a perfect example
of that just being true.

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,950
He'll show up Monday night at the comedy
store in front of 13 people and he'll

32
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,500
go on stage. I'll do a half an
hour in front of 13 people. Yep.

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,140
And he'll drink and smoke cigarettes
and we'll talk shit and laugh at his own

34
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,280
jokes. And everybody has like one of
the most magical experiences as a,

35
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:04,440
as an audience member you could ever have.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,290
I was young comic in New York and there
was a place called the comedy village,

37
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,890
which was the Boston too. Sure.
So it became comedy village.

38
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:12,750
When did it become the village?
And it's done now,

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,680
but now it's like a Japanese restaurant,
a Japanese restaurant now.

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,420
Got It. Jamie cutten. No,
but, uh, there's a, um, uh,

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,800
and this is, I'm young like bark and
asking people to come in off the street.

42
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,750
Right. And, um, how old were
you when you started? A 23,

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,300
23. 23. Yeah. And, um,

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,480
and Chappelle comes in
and when he gets on stage,

45
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,420
there's probably 13 people in the crowd,
right.

46
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,940
And the fucking word gets out and you
just see people start slowly graphs like

47
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,870
goldfish.
You know what I mean?

48
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,240
When they could send some little
or ducks or something like that,

49
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:50,780
when they send some breads coming in
the pond and the place was packed within

50
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:54,950
like 20 minutes. Wow. Outside. It was
just everybody texting their friend.

51
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:59,620
Oh my God. Chappelle's here to do
so crazy. And he did six hours, Bro.

52
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,430
One

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,660
real dude. There were beer girls
like falling asleep or something.

54
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,590
Maybe four hours, 24
hours, something like that.

55
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,750
It, it, it's, it was jazz.
Right? It wasn't like,

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,630
it wasn't like I'm doing bits
and I'm murdering the whole time.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
He has this ability to make the audience
comfortable intention so that it is not

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,680
anxiety inducing. Right. What,

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,910
what he can do is talk to you for five
minutes straight without a punchline.

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,780
As an audience member, you're
not going, oh my God is this guy,

61
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,020
is this guy not funny?
Well, that was when he was,

62
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,150
he was doing that for a while and
where he wasn't doing scheduled shows,

63
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,570
all he was doing was these
Poppins. And not only that, but he,

64
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:47,460
he brought a fucking speaker and set
up a microphone in the park in Seattle,

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,160
outdoor, outdoor. You
know, he did that early on.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,850
Yeah, I was there. I watched it. We
watched him do it in Montauk, New York.

67
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,680
I saw him do it in Montreal.

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,460
We did a set together at club
soda and actually we got outside.

69
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:05,020
We went outside and Dave just said,
gather round. People gather it.

70
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:07,780
And he started doing stand up to people
in the street and they were like,

71
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,990
what in the fuck?
He was probably like 20.
