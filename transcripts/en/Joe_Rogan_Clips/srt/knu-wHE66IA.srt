1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,550
Her low freak bitches though.
It's hilarious.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,690
Everybody is on steroids.
What a great picture.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,000
So hilarious. They might be
right. Yeah, they might be right.

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,470
You know what I started
watching last night,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,190
I don't know if you'd say it [inaudible]
or [inaudible] is on Netflix.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,920
It's all about doping and this uh,

7
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,410
this guy who was helping the
Russian team on Russians,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,940
there was one estimate that it was
somewhere in the high nineties of Russian

9
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:33,270
athletes are on performance
enhancing drugs. That makes sense.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,910
That's my thing with this whole Jon
Jones stuff and like I go back and forth,

11
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,970
I'm going to quote our friend
Eddie Bravo when you look into it,

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,760
when you look into it that try Nepal,
like so many guys article came out today,

13
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:51,360
I think I'm Fox Fox sports are came out
today of this guy who was a minor league

14
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:56,190
baseball player and he's a pro now and
he's tested twice for a positive and a

15
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:59,250
third time and he's waiting to see if
he gets banned for life because three

16
00:00:59,251 --> 00:00:59,581
strikes,

17
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:03,630
you're out in baseball fan for life
and they're saying the how many guys in

18
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:06,990
baseball test hot for this Toronto Ball?

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,110
And they say in Gnc they have 47
products at GNC that this can show up us.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,710
Wow. I know. So I saw that. My
God, fuck yeah, but wait a minute,

21
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,120
he's not supposed to be taking anything.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,030
You're talking about a guy who was
already lost his ability to make a living

23
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,320
from Mexican Dick Pills.

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,270
Like why would he ever just take something
off the shelf at Gnc? Well, we're,

25
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:30,310
we're not giving the Guy Kudos because
he's the smartest tool in the shed. Short,

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,800
sharp, what I say, smartest tool in
the shed. Well, tools are smart too.

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,420
I smoked a little weed.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,580
You don't have to say, he might've
been like, oh, I need energy.

29
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:46,260
Get me this.
What is that

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,290
bolt out of his neck?
And he takes that dude.

31
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,900
The truth is I would never do steroids.
I put that on my children.

32
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:57,950
I put that on my heavenly father.
He did not bring heavenly father,

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,570
loved how he capitalized
heavenly and father cause uh,

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,300
for sure do spect while re you know,
and get to hell has Spec Hispanic, um,

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,360
thirties facing up man.
Imagine if he comes back at
34 and still fucks everybody.

36
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,470
But he's 260 pounds at heavyweight just
merged. Fuck all this cutting weight.

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,320
Just just go on a power lift and
rampage for the next four years.

38
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,230
Keep your body in shape. It's still
fuck everybody up at heavyweight.

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,840
But if you look at that trend of ball man,
and you see how much,

40
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,070
how many guys test hot for it. And they're
like, what? Dumb fuck, it's not in there.

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,350
I can see Jones argument a
little bit. Yeah, I know.

42
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,150
I go back and forth and
I'm off the Jones Stream,

43
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:37,590
but when I see that and I see how big
of an issue it is in baseball and minor

44
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,490
league baseball, you Sada in the
commission might be like, fuck,

45
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,800
look at all these guys, man,
we've got real issue here.

46
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,580
Maybe he did fucked up so then I think
there's no way they give them four years,

47
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,061
but I asked,

48
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:51,580
they're going to realize I haven't heard
of anybody else tested positive for the

49
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:55,650
stuff in the UFC of you.
Is it the same stuff,

50
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:59,830
Frank Mir test positive for you?
This is other thing.

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,850
Usually if a guy tests hot for something
out of one of those major camps,

52
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,470
other guys can test hot for the same
stuff and last he's getting it straight

53
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,330
from the power lifter guys. Yeah, hours.

54
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,790
NFL brothers didn't
Frank Mir eat kangaroo.

55
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,700
Those is like tainted kangaroo meat.
Bro was at the worst argument efforts.

56
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,350
The worst ever because people don't
even eat kangaroos. Smart Guy.

57
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,090
He's the smartest tool in the shed.
Some people eat kangaroo,

58
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:29,100
but it's not common table
fair in Australia. Fuck No.

59
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,700
I was just in Australia doing shows them
how to eat kangaroo burger. No, fuck no.

60
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,870
They eat venison. Beef eating cake. Yeah,

61
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:42,760
but couldn't say what he was flagged
for. My favorite part, however,

62
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,840
he was still given a maximum
punishment by, you saw the,

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,140
I think as he claims he listed numerous
potential sources for the positive test

64
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:53,440
including eating kangaroo
meat while in Australia.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,400
You saw it as like what out of here?
That's the best you got.

66
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,210
We've heard a bunch of shit,
but that's all you got, boy.

67
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,580
You know what's interesting? It's
like how much does it help? How much?

68
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,210
Like what? Think about like
what these guys are doing.

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,190
I mean definitely steroids help right
to steroids make you a better athlete.

70
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:18,670
They allow you to recover,
let's say 10% better. Yeah.

71
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,530
It's hard to tell though because could
John beat Daniel Cormay without that

72
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:28,130
small dosage of Terenna
Ball? Yes, he could do.

73
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,350
That's what DC was saying. He was
like, the guy doesn't need to do it.

74
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,810
He's super talented.
Does it need to do it?

75
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,370
I know that's why when you look at the
evidence and like why this small amount

76
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:42,400
of travel ball and you see all the
other guys testing pause for it,

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,800
how much would this really helped him
when he risked all this to take something

78
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:52,660
piss hot and it's really not helping
that much. And then where do we stop?

79
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:57,010
So right now we want to enlist and I've
been the fucking poster boy of making

80
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:01,630
fun of John on this stuff.
But in all seriousness, we're
do. We'd say, all right,

81
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,460
most guys are doing it.

82
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,410
Cause that there was this a heard Luke
Thomas talking about it. Uh, they uh, uh,

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,170
water right? Will sat in water. Yeah,
water is the big one. I think. Uh,

84
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,230
in 2007,

85
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:19,231
they did this survey of athletes including
fires that were going overseas and

86
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,070
competing and they,

87
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,900
they ask them as at a kind of under
the radar how many guys are doing

88
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:29,740
performance enhancing drugs. It
was an alarming number. Like 78%.

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,760
And that's people, you know. I bet it
would be a little higher than that. Yeah.

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,650
So like, you know what
I'm saying? So we're,

91
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,830
we're going to tarnish John's name
and he's not the greatest of all time,

92
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:41,800
but it's like, okay, but then
you'll pay to watch over him fight.

93
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,870
You'll pay to watch Vitor Belfort fight.
You know,

94
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,810
like we don't know exactly
who's doing what. Right.

95
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:50,380
But if Overeem becomes a champ, I
guarantee you if he pisses hot as a champ,

96
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:53,020
people turned on him too.
No, I get it. But he, he's,

97
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,590
he's tested for way worse things
than John has, but he hasn't, he,

98
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,860
we tested testosterone, right,
didn't he? It was just testosterone.

99
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,510
Oh my God, I got an elevated testosterone
levels pain. I mean the same shit.

100
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,380
Remember when he was Uber Rheem? That's
more than just tossed around. But he,

101
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,160
but he tested positive for that, didn't
he? And he said a doctor gave him a shot.

102
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,320
Wasn't that like the whole deal
at some doctor or shoulder at for,

103
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,360
I know there's no, I don't, but let's
just think about what they are like.

104
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,810
So he tested positive for
testosterone, I believe. Well,

105
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,600
if you test positive for that,
and if you had an exemption,

106
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,170
that means his levels were on that feet
doorbell coordinate mark cart shit where

107
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,150
they test, you're like, holy fuck man.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,830
[inaudible].
