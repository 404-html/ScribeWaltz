1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
I was wishing to have a little
more of that floating around in me.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,980
It's a bizarre heritage.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,450
You know the idea that there
was a different type of
human that bread with Homo

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,380
sapiens and that there's like little
bits and pieces of it floating around in

5
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:18,180
Peabo. Yeah, and and people
discuss them. People discuss.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,700
I was having an argument the other day
where they see a need and or tall or

7
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,920
neanderthal and everyone
grows up saying neanderthal.

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,230
It's one of those things you're supposed
to switch once you realize how you're

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:28,560
supposed to do it. Right. Neander tall
by just can't get comfortable with it.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,030
I go back and forth.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,690
There's a lot of words that like that
where I know you're supposed to do it by

12
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,840
can't get comfortable with it because I
feel like it makes you sound pretentious.

13
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,140
Does it's like rolling your
r's and certain Spanish words,

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,390
but we had this idea that the,

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,300
we had this idea of the
neanderthals as unsuccessful.

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:50,940
Right? Right. It's there. These
brutish thugs that died out,

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,010
but they had a 600,000
year run in Europe alone.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,100
600,000 years longer run than homosapiens
of actually existed. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,890
So whatever's, I don't know
that we're going to hit, like,

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,970
I don't know that we're going to
match up and have that run. Well,

21
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:12,220
we'll probably have a 23
and me for whatever the fuck
is after us and they just

22
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:15,930
look so many back then
fuck the human, like, oh,

23
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:20,130
one of those crazy war monger can rapists,

24
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,480
thieving humans died out.
It turns out they didn't totally die out,

25
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,360
overrun with the motions
and lies and they,

26
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:31,530
someone somewhat of a superior race
infiltrated the humans and banged one of

27
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:34,790
them. Yeah. It's, it's, it's
funny to look at that, uh,

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,870
that understanding of, of those,
that understanding of those people,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,320
um, an end up to have the site
to picture in your mind's eye,

30
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,370
even though he can't picture it.

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,490
Like what was looked like when
they were hooking up someone are,

32
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,483
you know,

33
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,620
like anatomically kind of
behaviorly modern humans were

34
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,010
hooking up with neanderthals was that was,
how is it perceived by their peers?

35
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,110
I bet the people that we think of as
people back then, like you know George,

36
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:11,520
the animal Steele is no George animal
Steele is a very famous pro wrestler from

37
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,810
back in the day. And uh, oh,

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,300
I thought you're going to say it was a
paleontologist or an anthropologist was

39
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:19,470
the wrestler. He's a
wrestler, pro wrestler.

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,950
Very famous guy who could
be a fucking case man.

41
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,520
Like legitimately could be a
cave man. Yeah. See if you, uh,

42
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,750
you got a good image of him.

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,140
Now this is what I think when I think of
people now give me a full body one day

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,030
go, oh, when I think of people, he's
hanging on to some homo sapiens,

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,570
homo sapiens from, you
know, 200,000 years ago,

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,650
I think a George the animal Steele,
I think they were something like that.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
So the idea of George fucking a
neanderthal check, not that far off.

48
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,980
I think our ideas like that.

49
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,880
Like Dan rather would be out
there banging some monkey lady.

50
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,990
I just don't think, I don't think that's
the case. Like look at George's body.

51
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,130
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.
He's got the hairiest shoulders.

52
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,600
I've ever seen an a man. So
he's still alive. I do not
know. I don't believe he is.

53
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,140
I hope he's not listening right now. I
don't believe he is. Oh, he's a legend.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,510
Legend in the world
with the pro wrestling.

55
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,480
So it's going to take more news to
hurt his feelings. I don't give a fuck.

56
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,710
He's a legend. But uh, when I was in a kid
in high school, oh he's, he's old as far.

57
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah. He's a pro. Well those guys, they
all, that's a hard way to make a live man.

58
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,960
He died at age 79. He had
a good run. Yeah. That's a
good run for, for those guys.

59
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,550
That's a fucking hard way to make a
living. But have we were talked about, uh,

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,040
the, the idea of neanderthals
is like having a cot,

61
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:48,670
a confrontational hunting style. No,
I don't like we have, cause when,

62
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,120
when,
when anthropologists look at the,

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,580
the skeletal remains of neanderthals,

64
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:59,581
they see this sort of suite of
this pattern of injuries on them.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,510
And a researcher was looking at the types
of fractures that they have on their

66
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,920
bones and where the fractures occurred
and the breaks and cracks and their

67
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,754
skulls.

68
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,050
He was looking at all this and wound up
working with a doctor who had a lot of

69
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,440
exposure to rodeo riders,
bull riders,

70
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,300
and the doctor was,

71
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,780
was observing the way in which that suite
of injuries was very familiar to him

72
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,040
from rodeo riders, the types of
breaks and the location of brakes.

73
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,490
And this guy has this
idea that they had a,

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,750
like a very confrontational hunting style,
um,

75
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,330
that they were like mixing it up with
big animals and an earth thing they found

76
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:48,331
is that when you're looking at
skeletal remains from early people,

77
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,360
you still see that separation
in the saxes, right. That, that,

78
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:59,361
that the males would suffer injuries
with a greater prevalence than females.

79
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,910
But with the neanderthals it seems
like they didn't have the sort of like

80
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,090
duplicity of roles.
So the females,

81
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:11,000
the females have the same prevalence of,

82
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,250
of these types of injuries. And so
maybe they didn't have that, the,

83
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
they didn't share that division of labor
where the females as large as the males.

84
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,740
Yeah. I don't know the answer to that. So
we know that they had stone tools, right?

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
The crude stone tools,

86
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,480
but we don't know whether or not they
had anything that could launch them.

87
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,210
Like they didn't have did.
They would do we know if they had spears,

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,960
I don't believe that they've found
they had addle addles. Right.

89
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,810
And I don't know if they were hafting
materials, but they were doing,

90
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,930
they were doing art.
Um,

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,030
and I think there's a little bit of
a debate about whether they're doing

92
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:47,020
representational art, but they
were doing art. They were doing,

93
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,120
they were probably making jewelry. And
he's like, these are all things that as,

94
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,750
as we kind of like wake up to
what these people really like,

95
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,940
and it paints like a more complicated
picture. There's even the steering,

96
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,520
I don't know if this held any water, how
long it was fashionable for, but yeah, it,

97
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,040
this really long history of,

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,270
it was extremely long history of hundreds
of thousands of years in neanderthal.

99
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,111
You know,

100
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:14,000
occupation in Europe and then it seemed
to be that I remember someone putting

101
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:19,001
forth this idea that it seemed to be
that there was this flourishing of

102
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,560
advancement that was contemporaneous
with the arrival of our own ancestors in

103
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,220
Europe is though,
uh,

104
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,380
they were being exposed to or seeing are
and seeing jewelry and mimicking this

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,550
from these new invaders
that were coming in.

106
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,440
But I don't know where
that idea sits right now.

107
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,060
I don't know if it's been
dispelled because of other
discoveries and everything

108
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:45,470
that has an interesting
idea that they would then,

109
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,360
it kind of paints this really sad picture,
right?

110
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,750
That they would be sort of in the autumn,
you know,

111
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,460
of their existence and
here's these adorned people
showing up with these amazing

112
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:59,780
tool kits and all of these abilities and
kind of struggling to start to catch up.

113
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:03,400
You know, it'd be like the
country Bumpkin, you know,
go into the big city and,

114
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,740
yeah.
Well there was also this idea,

115
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:10,700
I think up until very recently
that neanderthals were
not as violent as humans,

116
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,610
uh,
as homosapians.

117
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,610
But now there was an article that was
published just a couple of days ago that

118
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:20,810
new evidence shows that neanderthals
like internees Anda tall violence between

119
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:24,060
each other. It was just as
bad as homosapians. Yeah. And,

120
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,800
and find that in evidence of cannibalism.
Oh yeah. There was a lot of that right.

121
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:31,370
Scraping of inside of the
skulls indicative of tools.

122
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,310
Oh.
Adblocker got busted.

123
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,030
They get us every time with the
fucking ad blocker. Yeah. Um,

124
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,890
what does it say? Humans are
just as violent as neanderthals.

125
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,180
Are you familiar with the writer John
Muallem? No. You'd like his stuff? Yeah.

126
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,950
He wrote a really beautiful piece about,

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,250
he wrote a really beautiful piece
about neanderthals not long ago. Okay.

128
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:56,084
I fucked it up.

129
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,080
What they're saying is that modern
humans were just as prone to violence as

130
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:00,914
neanderthals.

131
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't have a problem where I think
I'm conflating this with something else

132
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,110
that I read about Inter,
uh, interspecies violence.

133
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,360
Nando tall on neanderthal violence.

134
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,810
The other thing that's weird about
them is they had bigger brains than us.

135
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,570
They have bigger brains and
they would be like five,

136
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:22,190
seven and weighed 200 pounds. Just
jacked. Just a little gorilla thing,

137
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,690
you know,
it'd be great to see it.

138
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,400
There was a really dumb theory that was
being bounced around a few years ago.

139
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,280
It was really hilarious about
how we wiped out. We, uh,

140
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:35,300
assumed that neanderthals, because you
don't have any soft tissue samples,

141
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,240
we assume that neanderthals
looked similar to humans,

142
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,100
but because of the very different
shape of their skull this guy had,

143
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:47,840
instead of giving them European looking
white skin, turned them into a gorilla,

144
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,000
turned them into a giant muscle
bound gorilla that preyed on people.

145
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:55,010
And this was like,
I believe this guy was an,

146
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,290
is actually was a professor and it
seemed almost like a goof at first.

147
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,620
You remember this, Jamie? We
pulled this up a few times,

148
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,300
like killer neander tall theory
think you call it. But yeah, it was,

149
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,080
he had drawn this thing black,

150
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:14,430
like a gorilla with like giant muscles
all over the place and these big crazy

151
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:18,600
eyes and that it painting
neanderthals as a Predator of humans.

152
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:23,400
And that's why we wiped him out.
Yeah. But my limitations as,

153
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,263
uh,

154
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,020
see I was gonna say my limitations as an,
as an anthropologist,

155
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:31,840
I'm certainly not an anthropologist that
I'll just do dude who's interested in

156
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:36,760
it. But one of my limitations is
I'll here theories floated. Okay.

157
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,020
And I don't follow them long enough to
see which ones have any traction. Right.

158
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,270
I'll just read about him and, and
I don't, I don't take it as Gospel,

159
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,360
but I'll read about it and I'll be like,
that's interesting.

160
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,370
And it was sort of like
shaped my understanding of it,

161
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:52,870
but then I don't keep track of it.

162
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,070
Like I try to really follow the story
of like the peopling of the Americas.

163
00:09:57,071 --> 00:10:01,450
So when it comes to, to the human
history of the Western Hemisphere,

164
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,670
I sort of follow and like ideas.

165
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:07,000
We'll get floated and I'll track the
idea to see where it lands in terms of

166
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:10,360
scholarly consensus. But on other
stuff, like with neanderthals,

167
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,130
I'm always a sucker for
a neanderthal story,

168
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:17,131
but I don't track what ideas that float
up or just very quickly denounced as

169
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:22,640
being complete rubbish. Mm. Yeah. It's
a weird one. You know, it's a, it's,

170
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,260
it takes time to get,
it takes time to follow this stuff.

171
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,180
Go and go to that other picture. That's
what it is. Them, them and a us. Yeah,

172
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,340
but look at soon as some of his images,

173
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,590
look at that image that he
has on the cover of the book.

174
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,160
Like those are the idea that
there some way better ones.

175
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:43,630
There's some way better images
where they drew of a full body ones.

176
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,720
They had a,
is it in the article?

177
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,430
Was a link to the show website
from a different article. Just go,

178
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,880
go to that and then go
to images because a,

179
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:59,110
there was some really bizarre fucking,
yeah, there it is. Upper left hand corner.

180
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,110
This is what this guy, yeah. Well
that thing he's got going on.

181
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,990
That thing is not making art.
You don't think so?

182
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,060
No. He's making meat, man. Come on. Yeah.

183
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,920
Yeah.
It's pretty preposterous.

184
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,670
But neanderthals didn't
have fangs like that.

185
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,520
Now did they know what it is that he's,

186
00:11:21,521 --> 00:11:25,480
he morphing in the end it all into a
gorillas that was trying to do, oh,

187
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:30,220
that's a how I, okay. Monkey Gorilla
neanderthal. But yeah, but like, oh,

188
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,700
it's got it snarling with, it's
fucking vegetable. Eaton teeth.

189
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,050
Anyway, it's, it's a,
and then there's the,

190
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,070
do we even know what those Denovo
eons to s, how do you say that word?

191
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:46,340
The one from Russia? Yeah. They don't have
any idea what they looked like, right?

192
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,400
No, I don't feel like someone pinky
bones and shit. You know they have that.

193
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,110
That one's not that one.
I don't know.
