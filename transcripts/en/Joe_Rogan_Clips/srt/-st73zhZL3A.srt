1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,920
Her low freak bitches for people
that don't know what's going on.

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,420
Let's lay out all of,
uh,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,660
all the events that have transpired.
Essentially,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,990
you were being asked to step
away from your college for a day.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,320
Is that what it was? Is it one day?
Well, this goes back farther than that.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,860
Lay out the whole thing. Okay. So we
couldn't possibly lay out the whole thing,

7
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:32,310
but let's just for people that have
no idea what's going on right there

8
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,430
listening right now and they're like,
who's this Bret Weinstein guy?

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,490
So the core of it surrounds a tradition
that we have at evergreen called day of

10
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,400
absence. And this tradition stretches back
long before I was ever at the college.

11
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,600
I've been there 15 years.

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,650
This tradition of stretches back into I
think the early seventies. And it's a,

13
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:53,400
it's built around a play
written by Douglas Turner Ward,

14
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,440
a black playwright and the play,
um,

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,660
portrays events in a fictional town
where the black population decides not to

16
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,470
show up one day, um, in
order to emphasize their,

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,400
their roles in the town that the
white population is unaware of. Um,

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,270
and as you would imagine, all hell
breaks list. So anyway, that's a,

19
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,430
it's an excellent play. And, uh,

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,800
some early faculty at our college decided
that we should have a day that mirror

21
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:20,250
and disadvantage and that,
uh,

22
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,990
originally black faculty and students and
then later people of color would leave

23
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,710
campus for a day to emphasize the
role that they play in our community.

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,030
And then they would later the,
um, the tradition was amended in,

25
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:35,970
had a day of presence attitude at
where people would come back to campus.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,070
And this has been going on.
Uh,

27
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,740
as I said since the 70s and
the whole time I've been there.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,070
And then this year it was announced
by the organizing committee that the,

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,820
uh, the situation would be reversed
and they asked white students,

30
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,500
staff and faculty not to
come to campus. And, uh,

31
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,750
that did not at all sit well with me.
Um,

32
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,710
as I said in my letter to the,
uh,

33
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,870
the person who had announced this Rashida,
who I should say a staff and I,

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,190
she has ended up at the
center of this controversy,

35
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,670
I think wrongly just because my letter
and response is addressed to her.

36
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:14,290
And then it was made
public by our school paper.

37
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:19,170
So her name has been dragged front and
center. But in any case, my letter,

38
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:23,070
I said that there was all the difference
in the world between a population

39
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:27,510
deciding to absent themselves from a
shared space in order to highlight their

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
role and a population deciding to absent
another population from a shared space,

41
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,620
which I find unacceptable as as a person,
as somebody devoted to,

42
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,100
uh, the gains of the civil
rights movement. Uh, I just,

43
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,130
I and I should also probably say as a Jew
and when people start telling me where

44
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:51,720
I can and cannot be, um,
it, it rings alarm bells.

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,770
Um, so that, that's the gist of the story.

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
And the letter caused
quite a stir amongst,

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,110
uh, students, staff and faculty who
responded. Many of them quite angrily,

48
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,711
privately.

49
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,460
Of course people were much more divided
on the matter and there were plenty of

50
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:11,680
people who agreed with my letter,
but publicly speaking,

51
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,940
there was condemnation of the
letter. But the uh, the event itself,

52
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,900
they have absence was mostly uneventful.
I,

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,520
I did go to campus as I said
I would in my letter and um,

54
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,140
I actually, uh, it's neither here
nor there. It was accidental.

55
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,480
But while I was on campus,

56
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:34,810
I ran into a student
that I know very well,

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,800
actually a student that my wife and I
were abroad in Ecuador with last year we

58
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,280
were teaching abroad and uh,
we had 30 students with us.

59
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,680
And so one of the students who
had traveled with us to Ecuador,

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,450
happen to be on campus to, this is a
student of color. I'm going to stop this.

61
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,700
Too much banging around in
here is very distracting.

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,180
Sorry.
That's all right.

63
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,820
That was going to go on and I was going
to drive me crazy. Right? Keep going.

64
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,060
So I ran into this student that I,

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I know well and care about quite a bit
and we had a very nice conversation.

66
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,160
Mostly not about day of absence.
As a matter of fact,

67
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:22,220
I can't even remember if we
did talk about day of absence,

68
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:26,660
but there was something poignant to me
about the fact that while I was being

69
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:30,920
condemned for, uh, re refusing
to accept this new formulation,

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,160
that I was able to meet with a student
who is important to me and thee neither

71
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:42,680
of our racial backgrounds is fun,
is primary in our relationship.

72
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,390
We know each other as people.

73
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:48,140
And that's really how I would like to
see all of us interacting on campus.

74
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,050
We all have our backgrounds,
they matter to us, but it can't,

75
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,160
it cannot become the primary
interface between us.

76
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,730
Let, let, let me stop you here
and let me try to understand, um,

77
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,360
what the reaction was because you rightly
said that you think there's a huge

78
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,620
problem with asking people to not show
up simply based on their color of their

79
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:13,540
skin. Exactly. And what was the
argument against that? Like when,

80
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,620
when you said that,

81
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,520
and I read your letter and your
letter didn't sound racist at all.

82
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,150
It sounded very well thought out.
It's a, it made a very good point,

83
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,040
but the response,

84
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,120
the inflammatory response to your
letter was so disturbing and shocking.

85
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,500
Was there anyone who had reasonable
debate with you about this?

86
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,810
Was there anyone who said,
well,

87
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:38,620
we should take into consideration
why they're asking us to do this.

88
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:41,980
We should sit down with them. We
should talk through this. Was there,

89
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,120
was there anything reasonable or was it
just dig your heels in the sand and then

90
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,500
let the insults and the white
privilege and all these accusations can

91
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,960
fly? Well, um, like I said,

92
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:55,620
there's a huge difference that you can't
see unless you're at the center of one

93
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,454
of these things.

94
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,830
Between the public discussion and
the private discussion privately,

95
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,810
I had very interesting discussions
with many people that was not absent,

96
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,990
but if you were to look in on the
discussion at the public level,

97
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,350
it looked as if there was
consensus United against me.

98
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,760
Now when you say public and private,

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,900
are the same people making contradictory
statements in public that are,

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,640
that are commiserating with you in
private or is it just different people?

101
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,440
A few of them do that.

102
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,560
The act that actually is the thing I
find most surprising is that sometimes

103
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:32,580
people will privately say one thing to
you and then publicly do another. Uh,

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
mostly it's different people.

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,090
And I should say the people who have
talked to me privately and expressed

106
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:41,820
concerns are actually
quite a diverse group.

107
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:46,740
So it's not as if white folks are
disturbed by this and people of color are

108
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:50,700
United. It's not at all like
that. But the part of the,

109
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,380
the hidden story here is that
in order to invent advance,

110
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,160
certain policy proposals,

111
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,850
it has to appear that the community is
United behind them and that anybody who

112
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:04,980
stands against them is standing
against them for illegitimate reasons.

113
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,660
So that means that the number of people
who are willing to express any sort of

114
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,100
nuance about what's taking place has to
be small and they have to be dismissible.

115
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,820
So what they did is
they called me a racist,

116
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:22,620
which is ironic, um, because
I'm an antiracist, I really,

117
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:25,140
I've,
I've gone out of my way to,

118
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,030
first of all study the question of
why racism occurs. And, uh, I've,

119
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,260
I believe been pretty
courageous in fighting against
it where I've run into it.

120
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:37,930
So to challenge me with
that particular epithet, uh,

121
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,340
was a mistake on their part.
It was a strategic mistake.

122
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,810
And I kept trying to tell them all this
was still internally being discussed in

123
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:46,231
the college.

124
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:50,700
I kept trying to tell them that they
should really check the concept that I'm a

125
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:53,340
racist.
They should ask because if they did,

126
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,940
they would discover that
they were actually way off
the mark and then they would

127
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,470
have an interesting puzzle on their hands.

128
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,680
Then they would have to explain to
themselves why they had found themselves

129
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,221
hurling.

130
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:07,221
This most poisonous a term at somebody
who not only isn't a racist but is pretty

131
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,080
nearly the opposite.
Yeah.

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,970
Well it's, it's a standard maneuver
when someone wants to silence someone.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,020
When someone wants to put someone in a
category that's instantly recognizable,

134
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,430
one of the best ones is racist.

135
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,220
Oh, absolutely. And, and
what I found is that, um,

136
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,340
people simply could not figure out what
they would do if that a term was applied

137
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,850
to them. They were able to preview in
their minds what that would be like.

138
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,290
And so many people could see that
there was no escape for them. Right.

139
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,180
So

140
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,420
it's like being called a rapist almost.
It's like even if you are exonerated,

141
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,760
there's still that cloud
hanging hanging above you.

142
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,480
Yes. But this also actually points
to something pretty important.

143
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:55,800
And for anybody who travels this ground
themselves, they're going discover this,

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,420
that many of the terms that are
being used have been redefined,

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,520
but they haven't been fully redefined.

146
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,660
So one of the things that I've seen in
several places is that a term like racist

147
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,870
has been redefined so that the bar
for being a racist is so low that you

148
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:14,550
couldn't possibly help but trip over it.

149
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,440
But then once you've tripped over it
and you have accepted that you are a

150
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:23,220
racist, then the stigma goes
back to the original definition.

151
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:27,600
So it is the dodging and weaving between
the two definitions that actually does

152
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,800
the heavy lifting.
Well,

153
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,920
there's also a really disturbing idea
that's being bounced around lately,

154
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,910
that it's impossible to be racist if
you're anything other than white. Right.

155
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,310
Which is ridiculous.
It's preposterous.

156
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,180
Anybody who looks up the actual definition
of racism will discover that that's

157
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,120
preposterous. Um, but yes,

158
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:50,121
that does pass in certain
places as logical and just
it's parroted and this very

159
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,220
bizarre way it's supposed
to be on challenged. And
this is a very recent thing.

160
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,830
I mean this is not something that existed
two decades ago. Right. I agree. And uh,

161
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,430
the pace at which it's moving in the
last few years is very surprising.

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,660
It is surprising,

163
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:10,500
but it kind of makes sense because you
get into these root groups of people,

164
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,910
they have this confirmation bias,

165
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,330
they lump up together and
they all reinforce their
ideas and this echo chamber

166
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,970
and they all do it inside the colleges.

167
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,490
And then when it gets out
to the rest of the world,

168
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:24,210
as we're seeing with your
case at Evergreen, it, the
rest of the world is like,

169
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:27,270
what is going on over here?
Like what is happening in school?

170
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,650
And people who are sending their children
off to school are very concerned with

171
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,260
the indoctrination of these ideas and the,
the Eh,

172
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,360
adopting these very rigid mindsets that
the rest of the world just simply could

173
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,260
pick apart pretty quickly.
Well,

174
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,860
this is the most shocking thing
because I'm, you know, I'm,

175
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,810
I haven't been censured,

176
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,080
I haven't been suspended them still
on the email distribution list.

177
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:56,790
So I'm watching the traffic inside of
my college and I'm able to compare it to

178
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,320
the huge flood of stuff that I'm seeing
from the outside world as they get wind

179
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,520
of what's going on at Evergreen.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And the difference is a million
miles inside of evergreen.

181
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:13,690
Actually, we are descending further
into madness. The, the faculty, um,

182
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,800
are,
uh,

183
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,850
blaming the fact that the campus had to
be suddenly closed due to a threat from

184
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,130
the outside yesterday,
uh,

185
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:27,470
on me for having talked about this
in the outside world specifically for

186
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,210
hilarious. I can't see you.
I can't use that term yet.

187
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,760
Hopefully some day. I hope
it's soon. And you know,

188
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:40,050
I must say one thing that I don't know,
we haven't even talked about where this,

189
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:41,880
uh, where I got thrust
into the spotlight here,

190
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:45,360
which your listeners are going to have
to know in order to understand why I'm

191
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:48,630
even sitting here. But, um, but the, uh,

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,560
the intensity and the out of touch nature
of the discussion inside the college

193
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,110
simply reinforces the,
uh,

194
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,270
the impression that something
is desperately off that,

195
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,510
that what we really have is
a filter bubble that is so,

196
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,050
so strong that even when the world sends
very clear evidence that you've missed

197
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,540
something somewhere and it's time
to rethink what you've been doing.

198
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,820
They're not waking up. And I, I
love this college, this college.

199
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,650
We maybe we'll get to talk about it,

200
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:28,450
but the structuring of this college
is so unusual and what one can do as a

201
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:31,900
professor at Evergreen, uh, if
you're really dedicated to teaching,

202
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,760
it is the place to be because you
have unparalleled pedagogical freedom,

203
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,310
more freedom than you'd have as
a tenured professor at Harvard.

204
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,530
And you also have room
to teach individually to
students because our students

205
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,710
take one program at a time,
they're full time in one program,

206
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,440
and the professors teach one
program at a time full time,

207
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,000
and they can go on for a full year.

208
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,330
So imagine you've got 25 students and
you have him for a year full time.

209
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,990
You really know every student in your
class individually, not just by name,

210
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:06,040
but you know how they think, you
know, their backgrounds, you know, um,

211
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,970
their blind spots.

212
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:09,460
And that allows for a kind of teaching
that can't be done anywhere else.

213
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,490
So I am quite distressed at the fact that
evergreen is now endangered by what's

214
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,070
going on.
Um,

215
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,170
and I really would like to see it wake
up and rescue itself because it is worth

216
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,404
rescuing.

217
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,790
[inaudible].
