Her low freak bitches. Um,
speaking of mushrooms is,

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:06,690
this is something that I
get wrong all the time.

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:10,020
It's one of the other things I
wanted to ask you. What, what is, um,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,080
there's some very close relationship
that mushrooms have and the absorption of

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,190
mushrooms have to DMT.
What,

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,830
what is the chemical
differentiation? Okay. Very,

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,130
very slight actually.
Um,

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,580
the temptation to start drawing
structures is almost irresistible.

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:37,020
Write some stuff down. Go ahead. I'll draw
awesome. Here. Do we have a visual? No,

10
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,880
we don't, but I'll save that
piece of paper. Okay. Well, uh,

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,820
I don't want to get too far
into it, but basically, okay,

12
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:49,800
so you've had organic
chemistry. Yeah, no, no.

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,540
Okay. Well then this spam
organic chemistry. You are,

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,800
you are organic chemistry. Well, this
may be a useless thing, but it the,

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,720
here we go. We could see it up on the wall
here. We've got it up on the screen. Oh,

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,140
there you go. Oh, okay. Well there you
go. Yeah, we don't have to draw struck.

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,470
You could look at it right here so you
don't have to turn around and look to

18
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,880
your right. Dennis. Turn and
look test. Okay, so right.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,360
So you can see if you've,
so there's Serotonin,

20
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:21,000
silicon and dimethyl trip to me.
Wow.

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,740
You can see that silicon and die muffled
trip to me and I were very close in

22
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:30,510
structure. The only difference is
that hydroxy group, that Oh h group,

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,380
that's the only difference.

24
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:36,000
So Allison is exactly the same thing
as an end dimethyltryptamine that's

25
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:36,510
correct.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,510
Why single trivial difference is
what makes silicon orally active and

27
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:47,130
dimethyltryptamine is not. Wow. Wow.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,100
Because what's going on with that?

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,810
This the static diagram,
eh,

30
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,710
different molecular model would show up.

31
00:01:55,711 --> 00:02:00,330
Well what's going on the is that
that nitrogen there in when sums and

32
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,250
physiological solution,
the nitrogen is charged,

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,840
has a positive charge. They oxygen,
it doesn't have the h there.

34
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,490
It has some negative charge.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,090
So the nitrogen curls back and is in
close association with the oxygen.

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,690
If this makes any sense,
the enzyme can't get to it.

37
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,700
That's why it's orally active because
essentially it can't get to that nitrogen.

38
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,120
What that enzyme does is cleave off
that nitrogen model a mean oxidase.

39
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:40,270
It takes away that nitrogen and
it can't do it with awesome.

40
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,820
So that's why cellSens orally active.
It doesn't require an they mail inhibitor.

41
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,590
It's just in some ways it's the
perfect psychedelic because you know,

42
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,240
no preparation needed. You'll just
bend over and pick the mushroom.

43
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,130
They'll preparation is required,

44
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:01,131
which is probably why very ancient
man knew about suicide cyber,

45
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:02,680
and they couldn't,

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,680
they couldn't not have if they were living
in an environment where it was found

47
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,240
[inaudible].
