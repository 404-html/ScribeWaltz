1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,790
I find that a lot of people that are,
um,

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,060
that are steadfast in their
resistance to vaccines, they,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,640
they also believe in a lot
of other questionable things.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,380
It seems like these things get lumped
into these groups of things that they

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,890
don't trust the government about.
Right, right. Yeah. I think that's part,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,270
I think that's probably true.
Yeah.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,300
That's what it slash which
was she government, which
was, which was inch. Well,

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,850
you know, it was interesting.
So, you know, I said,

9
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,700
we know we need to hear from the Centers
for disease control and more than the

10
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:36,190
surgeon general. Now they're
starting to speak out. But you know,

11
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:37,290
the people counter that said,

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,900
well part of the problem is people
don't trust their government. And I say,

13
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,310
well that's true of some, but I think
most people, if you know, with the,

14
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,220
if we had a,
you know,

15
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:49,590
a more visible public health force
out there, people would listen to it.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,251
Well,

17
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:53,880
I think that what you're talking about
in terms of these poor neighborhoods,

18
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,020
in these parents' sides,

19
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,710
getting into people's system and affecting
cognitive development and what it was,

20
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,430
the other one besides Chaga
was that toxic. Uriah says,

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,780
what's the cognitive development?

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,630
The fact that there's actual
cures for these things too,

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,820
that I estimate an an a paper.

24
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,200
There are 2.8 million African Americans
living in poverty with toxic horizons.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,860
Wow. This is not a rare disease, Joe.
This is, this is a common disease,

26
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,000
but it's so unknown,

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,480
but it's occurring among the poor and
it's chronic and debilitating affection.

28
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,460
It's not dramatic. It's not an 90. It's
not killing people. Is this mostly,

29
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,410
and this, the climates
as well? It's probably,

30
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:32,370
it's more in common in the south and
the north. Is it because they've long,

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,550
longer time to do this because the eggs,

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,510
the eggs are in the environment and
the worm develops within the egg.

33
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,050
Is there any other diseases that are going
on that we don't know about? Um, yeah,

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,170
yeah, sure. Um, there's other,

35
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:50,730
there's a brain parasitic
infection called cysticercosis.

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,600
That one is from eggs.
Um,

37
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,810
often from individuals
who have a tapeworm. Uh,

38
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:02,760
so that's where we're seeing
cases of that. Um, there's, uh,

39
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,490
some of the viruses
transmitted by mosquitoes.

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,030
One of the ones we don't talk about a lot,
which is a very serious infection,

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,740
is West Nile virus infection.

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,710
That's got very high rates of
not only encephalitis, but also,

43
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:18,090
uh,
one of our faculty members,

44
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:22,530
Christie Marie is showing very high
rates of depression and other neurologic

45
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:26,360
debilitation four. And that's another
one we could probably use a vaccine for,

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,700
but there isn't the
market incentive to do it.

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,630
West Nile virus does come up though the,

48
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:33,160
at least that's discussed in the
news and people are aware of it.

49
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,620
You said it right, but there's no vaccine,
there's no vaccine. But there could be,

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,140
what does it there could
be holding it back.

51
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,300
What's holding it back
is lack of market forces,

52
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:47,080
lack of financial incentive
for the pharmaceutical
companies to take it off. Um,

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,160
so if there's an extremely
large investment to develop
something along those

54
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:57,030
lines. That's right. I mean, and vaccines
are for an investor's perspective,

55
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,880
tough sell because you know, there's
a possibility, you know, first of all,

56
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,310
you need many years of clinical trials.

57
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,490
It can sometimes take two decades from
the original conception of a vaccine to

58
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,290
actually going through a clinical trial.
So the hook where vaccine,

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:15,850
I've been working on a,
we've been doing it since the 1990s.

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,850
So we're talking decades
long time horizons.

61
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,600
When you talk to an investor about
something with decades long time horizons,

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,400
you figure it out, right? The light,
the lights go out. I mean the, uh, very,

63
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,520
very quickly. So we're, it gets
gross, right? Because this is all,

64
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:35,521
we were relying on these
private businesses to invest
money to cure a public

65
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,850
health issue. That's right. That's
right. That seems kind of crazy. Well.

66
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,230
So in response to that,

67
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:46,231
what happened was after the Ebola fiasco
in 2014 where we didn't have any bowl

68
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,660
of vaccine and Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone,

69
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,550
a group of individuals came together
at Davos, the World Economic Forum,

70
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,090
and I'm including the gates
foundation and they put around,

71
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,550
they put developed this concept or
which at an organization called Sepi,

72
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:08,551
the Coalition for epidemic preparedness
innovation to incentivize a biotechs and

73
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:15,211
pharmaceutical companies to embark on a
diseases for which of pandemic potential

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,220
like Ebola, like last of fever,
like mayors, corona virus infection.

75
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,391
And that was great.

76
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:25,540
But the problem was they didn't
address these poverty related diseases.

77
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,680
So those of us who are working on poverty
related diseases are still kind of on

78
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,730
the outside looking in.

79
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,660
It just seems like having everything
managed by private companies that need to,

80
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,730
they,

81
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,850
they need to have some sort of a financial
incentive to attack these diseases.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,870
That seems like a crazy way to deal
with health crisis. That's right.

83
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,930
That's right. And so what
I've recommended, as I said,

84
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:53,230
the set that organization Sepi
is great for what it's doing,

85
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,060
but we need another mechanism.

86
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:00,061
What I've proposed is that since these
diseases are so common among the poor and

87
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,570
the g 20 countries,

88
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,290
these are the 20 largest economies to
put together public sector funds for that

89
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,584
purpose.

90
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,510
Public sector funds for investing in
developing vaccines and treatments for

91
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:17,380
poverty related diseases, these chronic
debilitating diseases. And in fact,

92
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,880
you know, we can show that the using
working with health economists,

93
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,270
we actually work with a terrific health
economist. His name is Bruce Lee.

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,200
Evolve all names.

95
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,390
He's a professor at Johns Hopkins
and Ai Right now. He loves it.

96
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,250
Um, um, and he's able,

97
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,570
he's been able to show 'em that our
vaccines are not only cost effective,

98
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,570
there cost savings, meaning that
they're economically dominant,

99
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,070
that they'll actually save money.

100
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,670
The problem is you still doesn't help you
with the fact that you still need some,

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,620
but the return is on public health.

102
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,090
You still need somebody to come along and
provide that investment. So, you know,

103
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,230
so what's happened is our,

104
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,860
our technical ability to develop
vaccines has outstripped our,

105
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,420
our, our financial instruments
that we have to do it.

106
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,360
So I get a stream of young people,
uh,

107
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,790
in my office wanting to
go into global health.

108
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:11,870
I mean the commitment for this next
generation and know they get a lot of bad

109
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,170
press, but my impression is this
next generation, their commitment,

110
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,710
the public services and an all time high
and they say, you know, Doctor Hotez,

111
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,480
I'm all in,
I'm going to go into global health.

112
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,250
And there are a little bit disappointed
when I tell them get an Mba or get a law

113
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:29,330
degree because where we need
the innovation now is in the,

114
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,090
it's in the finance sector,
there's a,

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
there must be a business model out there
that would work that would figure out

116
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,410
how to do this.
I just don't have the background to do it.

117
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,230
It seems like once the momentum is in
the corner of this being handled by the

118
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:49,231
private sector and that the private
sector has to develop these vaccines and

119
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:52,900
these treatments and they have to do it
with some sort of financial incentive.

120
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,570
If they don't have a bucket of
gold at the end of the rainbow,

121
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,260
they're not going to take a ride. That's
right. That's right. So that's crazy.

122
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,870
It's crazy. The reality. And so, um,

123
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,760
what the exciting thing
about what I do is, you know,

124
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:10,930
developing these vaccines for poverty
related diseases as there's no roadmap

125
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,210
right now,
there were in clinical trials,

126
00:07:13,211 --> 00:07:17,470
I don't know what the roadmap is to get
to licensure and getting these vaccines

127
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,304
out to the public.

128
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,220
The terrifying thing to thing it keeps
me up at night is there's no room. Right.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,170
Both good about good. Yeah. There is.

130
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,440
How much does it cost to get
a vaccine? I mean, in general,

131
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,340
from developmental period to actual app?
Well,

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,760
the pharmaceutical companies
have traditionally said billions,

133
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:42,710
but I don't think that's the case.
I think one of the reasons, um,

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,240
why they're doing that is because they're
also recovering their r and d costs.

135
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,100
You know, they're putting
money into R and, d that they,

136
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,140
that they re that they charge in order
to either make a profit or at least a

137
00:07:57,981 --> 00:08:00,890
eve. And so for instance,
the cervical cancer vaccine,

138
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,560
the HPV vaccine that,
you know,

139
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:07,100
when I last look was
$420 for the three doses,

140
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,460
it doesn't take cost $420
to make that vaccine it,

141
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,460
it's just that they're recovering
their r and d costs, which is,

142
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,450
which is fair enough.

143
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:21,290
So one of the things that we're
proposing to do for our neglected disease

144
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,560
vaccines is we'll d link the
R and d costs. In other words,

145
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:28,820
if we've gotten grants, whether it's
from the gates foundation in the past or,

146
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,150
or the Nih or the European Union or
the Dutch government or the Carlos Slim

147
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,810
Foundation, we're not going to pass
those costs on a, we'll just, you know,

148
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:42,080
that was used for r and d and we
would just cost for the cost of goods.

149
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:45,290
So at least we can get it down to
just a couple of dollars, a dose,

150
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,460
a few dollars a dose.
