1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,490
Hello Freak bitches.
He was willing to keep the MOOC.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,270
I mean the MOOC.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,620
The butchers only ousted because of John
Kelly and the Mooc is what did the MOOC

4
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:14,640
say? What was his, I was about Batman
and sucking his own cock. Yeah,

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,170
that's exactly right.
About him performing.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,130
Why would he think that he could say
that once he's in the office? I mean,

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,630
first of all, I was thinking to see band
and could even possibly do that. I mean,

8
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,090
Ban is not that flexible. I
know Steve, that's, that's not,

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,590
that's not something gets repertoire
a giant unit, but it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,030
Just the idea that he would think,

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,720
I mean he must be emboldened by the fact
that Trump has said so many outrageous

12
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:35,940
things. I mean their reports
from the New York Post that,

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,350
that he actually had the Trump liked it.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,320
Then all that happened is that there
was so much blow back that he had to

15
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,590
replace Kelly. You need puts Kelly in
there and Kelly's like, you can't do this.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,000
And Trump's like, okay, fine,

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,380
but doesn't it seem more crazy
to fire a guy after 10 days?

18
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:52,410
And it does to sit him down and
say, hey man, don't say that again.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,770
Let's move forward. That's what
they should've done the next day.

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,110
But the problem is he'd been doing
it for a week at that point, right.

21
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,870
He was out there like saying that writes
previous was leaking on the president

22
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:03,480
and was an enemy of the president for a
week and you're saying that he was going

23
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,370
to get him fired and at the same time,

24
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,220
remember this is the same week that Trump
himself is tweeting out that attorney

25
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,880
general sessions who is his most loyal
supporter for a year and a half that that

26
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,840
guy has like a trader and that he
wishes he would go away cause he recused

27
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,500
himself. First of all, Trump can
fire any of these people at any time.

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,620
Like this is very passive aggressive for
a guy who made his living saying you're

29
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:23,454
fired on TV.

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,850
It's amazing that all the people that
Trump has fire had been fired actually

31
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,684
through surrogates.

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,150
Mike Flynn resigned and James Comey was
fired basically through Rod Rosenstein

33
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,640
and sessions.
And then Rosenstein had recused himself,

34
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:39,350
which is how you get the special counsel
and Comi found out on television. TV.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,090
Right. He's just like an
emissary to go to La and,

36
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:45,690
and give him a letter and like everyone
he fires it has to be fired in the most

37
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,480
roundabout. I think that Trump actually
this, I think the dirty little secrets,

38
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm not sure Trump actually likes
firing people. I think, I think he,

39
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,790
I think he kinda like towards,
I think he likes torturing people,

40
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,530
but I'm not sure that he
actually likes firing them.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,320
Well he maybe doesn't like people
being mad at him face to face it.

42
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,950
I think that's a, wants them to
love him in front of his face.

43
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:05,250
So like when he's not there, you know,
you can make a phone call, fire him,

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,470
hang up the phone and you don't have to
actually see the guy you w wants that

45
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:12,270
guy that liked him.
Yeah,

46
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,660
I don't to call me thing was really
bizarre because it was like, oh,

47
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,823
you can do that.

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,900
Like there's this guy is looking into
improprieties and you can just say,

49
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,120
no, you can't do that
anymore. You're fired.

50
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,190
You can't look into the things I've
done wrong. Yeah, it was. Well,

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
the way he did it was the stupid part.

52
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,990
So I was calling for coming
to be fired since last year.

53
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,270
I thought the way he handled the whole
Hillary thing from beginning to end was

54
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,940
terrible. I thought that Trump should
have replaced him before he became,

55
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,050
you know, as basically day one, here's my
new cabinet. Call me. You did a great job.

56
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,150
You know, usher him out the
door, bringing somebody new.

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,660
He kept him around and then the first
thing he said to call me, you remember,

58
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,810
was when he met him, he said,
you're more famous than I am. Well,

59
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,700
when Trump says that to you, that's
the writing on the wall right there.

60
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,680
First of all, it's not
true, but second of all,

61
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:59,100
I think maybe there was also a part of
the problem was [inaudible] is a giant.

62
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes. You know the chunk colonies will,
but what is he, six eight six eight six,

63
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:07,440
nine yes. Giant dude. Towered over.
Traffic is such a comedy and comb.

64
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,940
He Sang, he was trying to hide in
the curtains. It was wide Trump.

65
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,910
So you just see Herman Munster
over there hiding and the goons.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,810
It's weird. Now. What did you enjoy,
Michelle? I mean it's, it's if,

67
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,070
if I didn't think that
nuclear war was a possibility,

68
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,570
but if I see a fucking Korean missile
headed our way, I'm going to be pissed.

69
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,590
When Colby was handling the email thing,

70
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,720
what specifically did
you not like about it?

71
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:36,721
What I thought it was was crazy was when
he restarted a reopen the case because

72
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,180
of whom?
A having used her clean shoes,

73
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,570
wieners all that stuff. I was like,
that's not enough. Like that seems crazy.

74
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,830
The deleting the emails to me seemed
like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA and

75
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,580
he said essentially anyone else would
be in jail for what she did. For sure.

76
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,490
For sure. Sure. Right. Well, call me.

77
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,900
He screwed it up and then
he really screwed it up.

78
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,060
So when he originally said publicly,

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,770
we're not going to
prosecute Hillary Clinton,

80
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,930
he was doing something he
didn't have the authority to do.

81
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,150
The FBI has not decided
whether to prosecute people.

82
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,300
They refer the information to the DOJ
and then the DOJ decides whether to

83
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,160
prosecute people.
It was Attorney General,

84
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,560
Loretta Lynch's decision whether to
prosecute or not. The statute itself, man,

85
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm a lawyer.
The statute itself did not say,

86
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,620
do you have intent to commit espionage?
Do you have intent to,

87
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,020
to to make classified secrets public or
expose them to the possibility of being

88
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,470
made public intent is not an element
of the crime. Right? If you do it,

89
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,360
it's a crime.
So my wife as it,

90
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:37,630
I should a doctor and that means
that she is under HIPAA requirements.

91
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,380
There's no element under HIPPA that
says that if she reveals somebody's,

92
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,070
you know, proprietary medical information
by accident, well there's no intent.

93
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,050
So she's okay.
That's not part of the statute.

94
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,990
If she brings some of these medical
records out to her car and somebody steals

95
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,330
the medical records, you know, she's
working at the VA or something,

96
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,260
that's a crime.

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,450
It doesn't matter if she intended to
do it and just left it in her purse.

98
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,020
So Komi read the element of intense
into the crime to get Hillary off.

99
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,910
And then he said, okay, we're
not going to prosecute this.

100
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,790
We're going to leave it
alone. He shouldn't have
intervened in the first place.

101
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,000
Remember he made an entire case basically
for why she should be prosecuted and

102
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,880
then at the end he goes, but we're, you
know, but no, we're not going to do that.

103
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,210
He also said, we're going to keep Congress
updated on any future development.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,120
Well you get to October and
there's a future development.

105
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:20,260
They found this laptop with all sorts of
information on it with new emails from

106
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,760
Hillary Clinton that
they haven't seen before.

107
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,520
And now he has an obligation to inform
Congress because he told them that he

108
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,240
would.

109
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,050
And so he screwed the pooch again because
he's afraid that if he doesn't reveal

110
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,990
that information, Hillary goes on
to win. And then it comes out there,

111
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:32,824
something criminal.

112
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,690
Then people are willing to blame him for
Hillary winning and putting a criminal

113
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:38,380
and the White House. So instead he said,
oh, well I'll be fully transparent.

114
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:41,710
I have to honor my institution. I'm
going to put this out there. Of course,

115
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:46,711
then Hillary loses and now he screwed
up twice and then he gets into the White

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,950
House and now he's supposed
to be investigating the
Trump Russia stuff at the

117
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:51,251
same time.

118
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,490
So now he's investigating basically
both candidates in the 2016 election.

119
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,480
He handled this the wrong way every step
of the way because he was so focused on

120
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,250
what will uphold thee in of the integrity
of the FBI and the integrity of,

121
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:07,310
of the investigations and the integrity
of the DOJ. He was less worried about,

122
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,570
okay, what do I actually
have to do under the law?

123
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,310
What's my obligation under the law is
obligation under the law as to shut his

124
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,040
pie hole and the
information over to lunch.

125
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,050
If Lynch wanted to kill the investigation,
let her do it.

126
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,100
So in a sense Trump was right and saying
that he's a grandstander. Yeah, for sure.

127
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,630
I mean,
I think that part was right,

128
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,540
but that the problem remember
was not the firing of Comey.

129
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,430
It was the two days after he fired Comey,

130
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,250
he went to Lester Holt on NBC and he said,

131
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:32,060
the reason I fired Comey was not all
the excuses I gave about the the Hillary

132
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:33,920
stuff.
It's because of the Russia stuff.

133
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:37,220
I was angry about how he
was handling Russia. I mean,

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,930
that's really stupid. That's intensely
stupid. It's intensely stupid.

135
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,860
But it's also strange that it didn't
go anywhere. Right? Like that.

136
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:50,430
Was it like that? That's against the law.
Well it's so it's, you know, obstruction.

137
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,590
So obstruction,

138
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,810
looking at the statutes obstruction
is a little bit more than that.

139
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,740
So you have to actually obstruct
an ongoing investigation
into criminal activity.

140
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,020
There's a counter intelligence
investigation going on,

141
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,930
but not necessarily criminal one.
So not to get too specific about it,

142
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:06,650
but you should get specific about it.
Yeah, I mean the obstruction laws,

143
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:09,050
I mean I've looked into kind of the
statutes that they've used to suggest

144
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:09,884
obstruction.

145
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,640
And it's not clear that there's any
statute that specifically govern something

146
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:13,941
like this.

147
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:18,560
Plus it is true that Trump does have the
power as the chief executive to fire as

148
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,040
the commander in chief to fire the FBI
director for any reason he chooses. Now,

149
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,030
all that said, he can be impeached for any
reason, criminal or noncriminal, right?

150
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:27,320
Impeachment is not a,

151
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,750
you don't actually have to have
committed a crime to be impeached, right.

152
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,640
Most people don't even
understand what a peach means.

153
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,250
They think that some are another impeach
means that you kicked out of office,

154
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,870
right? That's not right. It is.

155
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,240
There's the house and they
have to vote to impeach you,

156
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,890
and then there's the senate and they have
to vote by a two thirds majority or 68

157
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:41,991
yeah.

158
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:46,250
I think it's two thirds
majority to actually convict
you of a set of crimes that

159
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,650
they come up with, but these are
all political definitions, right?

160
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,060
When it says high crimes and misdemeanors,

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,830
it doesn't mean they actually have
to prosecute you like they would in a

162
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,250
criminal court and you'd have to go
to jail or any of that kind of stuff.

163
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,380
Like they could impeach
anybody at any time.

164
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,480
Clinton didn't even have to commit
perjury if they didn't want,

165
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,400
if they wanted to impeach them,
they could.

166
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,730
They could have peach w every president
you can impeach. It's just a vote.

167
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,210
It's just about, so all the talk about
what's criminal and what's not criminal.

168
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,321
The problem for Trump,

169
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,630
there are two ways of reading Trump's
behavior in the whole Russia thing, right?

170
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,470
Way. One is he's got something to hide
and that's the most obvious way he's got

171
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,840
something to hide.
That's why he gets rid of Flynn.

172
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:19,970
We don't know why he got rid of Flynn.
He gets rid of Comey.

173
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,400
We don't really know why he got rid of
Comey and then brags to the Russians that

174
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,520
it's a pressure off him on the Russia
stuff. Yeah. So it's a way, one is,

175
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,280
he's hiding something and now he's
firing everybody who gets in the way.

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,450
And there's, you know, the
chain of evidence doesn't not
fit that. I mean, you know,

177
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,570
he, he's the people he's anchor. Yet in
order, our attorney general sessions,

178
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,810
the Deputy Attorney General Rod
Rosenstein, the former head of the FBI,

179
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:42,530
James Comey, the acting head
of the FBI McCabe, uh, and uh,

180
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,230
and the special prosecutor Robert Mueller.

181
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,180
So those are all people
involved with Russia.

182
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,830
Those are the only people
he's really angry at.

183
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,740
So there's something to be said for
the idea that maybe he's trying to hide

184
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,790
something.
On the other hand,

185
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,430
we haven't actually seen any hard
evidence of collusion itself.

186
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,650
So we saw an attempt to
collude by Donald Trump jr,

187
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,640
but we haven't actually seen any
evidence that the Russians were providing

188
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,620
special information to
the Trump administration,

189
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,750
which was then being weaponized
for use in the campaign.

190
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,840
We haven't seen any of that stuff.
So here's the other plausible theory,

191
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,220
and this goes to Trump's personality.

192
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,260
He's so petty and he wants to be loved
so much that he is angry that people keep

193
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,180
saying he run because he
won because of the Russians.

194
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,380
And so now every time people say that,
he just gets pissed and he fires people.

195
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,340
So Komi I mean this is totally plausible,
right?

196
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,390
Komi comes to him and has said privately
that you are not under investigation.

197
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,590
And Trump says to him, well why don't
you just say that and call me says,

198
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:37,140
well I can't say that cause if I say that
I'm going to have to update congress.

199
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,870
If you do fall under investigation
and Trump doesn't like that,

200
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,730
he wants the public to
know he's free and clear.

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,520
So if fires coming and then
he goes up public and he says,

202
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,290
I didn't like how he was handling
the Russia thing, I'm innocent.

203
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,120
Why won't these people leave
me alone? Right. So he is.

204
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,100
So there's two ways to read this.

205
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,210
Either he's totally innocent but stupid
or he's trying to hide something.

206
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,340
Those are the only two plausible
ways of reading the situation.

207
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,120
The Donald Trump junior thing was really
bizarre because he released all the

208
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:04,110
emails. Like I just, yeah, it's
like, look, I've got nothing to hide.

209
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,700
Like you aren't supposed to
do any of these things you're
saying in these emails.

210
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,090
Yes. That was, it does not a good moment
for, for Trump. Jr Do you think he got,

211
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,520
I mean, and then you hear that he was
coached by his dad again, you know this,

212
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,120
none of this is good stuff. I had that
thing that Donald Trump jr releasing the,

213
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,620
first of all, it is imperative
to note eight minutes later,

214
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,000
the New York Times released
basically the email chain, right?

215
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:28,530
So he was meeting his, beating it out of
the gate. And so he puts that out there,

216
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,060
which was a smart move. I mean
it, it would be smart if you,

217
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,720
it'd be smart if he had found
a way to spin it, right? Right.

218
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,830
Like if you had done it,
if he had done,

219
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,860
this is the thing in politics and now
the way politics works now is your

220
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:38,694
smartest move.

221
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,570
If there's dirt about you is to be the
first person out the gate with it and you

222
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,580
put a spin on it, right?
So like Barack Obama,

223
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,610
imagine if Obama hadn't said anything
in 2008 and then we found out a week

224
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:50,040
before the election that
he did coke in high school.

225
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,210
Now a lot of people wouldn't care. A lot
of people would write in 2000 George W.

226
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,650
Bush was hit with a DUI charge from like
1973 and it probably lost him a point

227
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,400
in the polls.

228
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,540
So what Obama did is he wrote an entire
memoir and he just kind of dismissed it

229
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,550
right in the middle of an he goes,
you know, when I was in high school,

230
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,090
did a little blow, no problem.
Did a little blow. Everybody
would. And Everyone, oh,

231
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,860
okay. Did low blow. All
right. You know, cool.

232
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,310
So if you're going to release this kind
of stuff, you have to put a spin on,

233
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,210
it trumps in your,

234
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:19,230
didn't he just put out the emails and
the emails themselves contain the damning

235
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:22,620
material, right? It says right in there,
there's a Russian government lawyer,

236
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,710
the Russian government sees this as
part of its effort to aid Mr Trump's

237
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:30,260
campaign. And Donald Jr is like, thumbs
up guys. I love it. Sounds awesome. Right?

238
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,350
And so that does not look good.
It's not quite as much as you know.

239
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:38,100
People on the left want to say it as
meaning that there's no evidence yet that

240
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:41,190
any information was actually exchanged
with the Russians or that anything came

241
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:44,010
to the meeting. Most of the people in the
meeting who have said something, it's,

242
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:45,450
and nothing came of it,
you know?

243
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,160
But we don't know whether
Trump knew about the meeting.

244
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,900
I find it kind of hard to
believe he didn't, you know,

245
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:53,010
considering every major campaign
figure was there but, but you know,

246
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,870
then then they, then they
just keep lying. And this is,

247
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,370
this is the part that's proud.
That's a problem.

248
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,790
Are they whining because they just think
they can get away with it and they're

249
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,760
stupid or they're lying because they're
actually being meticulous about their

250
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,920
lies. You know, I tend
to think the former,

251
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:09,520
because this isn't a
professional administration.
I think these, I think Trump,

252
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,970
you know, fibs a lot. He says things
that, I mean, like on stupid things.

253
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,170
He says things like,

254
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,830
the leader of the boy scouts called me
and told me that he loved my specialist

255
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,210
and then the leader of the boy
scouts, like, uh, what? So if it,

256
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,350
so is that a calculated lie to hide
something or is it just the Trump lies by

257
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:26,440
nature and so he does it a lot? Well, I
think he's just so used to putting that,

258
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,980
that spin on things that publicity spin.
Right.

259
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,000
And the thing that he said about this
was that this is what politics does.

260
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,190
What happens in politics.

261
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,910
You get dirt about your enemy
and people exchange information.

262
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,940
It's just what happens. It's just you're
seeing it now. So a lot of people like,

263
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:45,610
yeah, well that makes sense. Right?
And, and this is something that, again,

264
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,580
I think that were shaped by Hollywood
a little bit. Politics is dirty,

265
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,950
but some of this stuff is not usual.
Right?

266
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,610
It's actually not particularly usual to
meet with a government that is really

267
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:58,300
not friendly to the United States to
receive information about your political

268
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,940
opponents. But if you've watched
house of cards, you think, well,

269
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,560
I mean it's like two steps down from
throwing somebody under the subway. So he,

270
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,110
the big deal cards. Uh, I don't,

271
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,270
because I work in politics
and when I go home at night,

272
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,790
the last thing I want to do is watch
entertainment about politics. Now,

273
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,120
watch game of Thrones.
That's his political

274
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,133
Gotcha.

275
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,620
[inaudible].
