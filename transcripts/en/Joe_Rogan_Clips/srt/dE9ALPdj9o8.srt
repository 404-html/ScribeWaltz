1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,680
The joe rogan experience.
Um, in your UFC career,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,070
you had one very controversial
fight with the Tim Kennedy.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,240
That time where you sat on
the stool for a long time,

4
00:00:13,241 --> 00:00:17,410
like an extra 30 seconds in between the
rounds. What's, what's your take on that?

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,930
Okay. Can say that he get Tim together.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,700
These have been gold. Get
follow, get bustle, Metta

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,970
and they call you call it ego [inaudible]
he call you or they bought deal.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,710
He has two colleagues in his life.

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,880
College colleagues from the street
and colleagues from the sport. Okay.

10
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,230
You looked at and kidding and [inaudible].
Both of them have to go hand in hand.

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,843
Okay.

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,050
You could all get Nadia in England.

13
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,800
[inaudible] he doesn't
think he has any of those.

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,460
What does that mean?
Hello? Good to see that.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,360
No lose one. He was holding
onto his fingers and he go
out and grabbed your glove

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,580
for that. Before. For that? Yeah. And

17
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,570
when they were against
the fence and Mcdonnell,

18
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,950
he was cheating.
Yeah,

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,970
but it's my fault.

20
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,880
It's his fault because he didn't have
to let him grab his fucking clubs.

21
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,540
Do you want me to organize a father?

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,960
He let him grab your shirt
and then he grabbed his ear.

23
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,520
He take my glove. He turned my golf. He
eats. He's holding a mom to my glove.

24
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:47,440
He's holding on to my clothes. Grabbed
his glove. He told the referee, he, yes,

25
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,790
yes. Hey, stay like this
yellow thing, right?

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,410
He's got him up against the wall.
Thoughts.

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,850
Let me,
if you remember

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,460
second, now they're against
the fence. Okay, equal

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,190
guantee. He grabs his hair first. Just
Swipe grip you. I said, all right.

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,880
He grabs his lady. Saturday.
Friday he came my gloves.
Yes, I was right. That hobby.

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,490
He lives it. He lets it go right away. Say
he went up and down. They can apply it,

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:28,840
right? Thanks. Second.

33
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,160
Ben took 15 seconds left.

34
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,600
He now had grabbed it. Boom, boom, boom.

35
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,470
You have the West said I'm not,
but they won't that Yo,

36
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,120
he's going to ask you a question.
See if they met us. Downloads Song.

37
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,210
If he sticks his finger in
your fucking I get goes to.

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,250
So what it is that it's a foul foul.

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,570
How many minutes [inaudible] you recover.
It's a good question.

40
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,810
Depending on how bad your eyes or hurt
it might be over cause they see that

41
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:06,240
brand, then that brand, they're
going to want to know my mentee.

42
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,620
How long would it be?

43
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,060
He took a few minutes on a quantum told
me no she did it ain't no [inaudible]

44
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,650
glue. If he kicks you in the balls, take
a few minutes, take a few minutes. Okay,

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,320
I got it.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,970
I said the one thing and they got
in there grabbing gloves is illegal.

47
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,040
Okay. She tell you in
garb. Paid call. No one to

48
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,470
Cabasa if he punches you with your gloves.
I want me holding on to your gloves.

49
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,030
If I'm punching you and I'm holding onto
your glove. Is that legally illegal?

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,050
Illegal. Okay. Okay. [inaudible] how
much time should they have taken off?

51
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,603
So

52
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,190
what you're saying is you sat down for
extra time in between the rounds because

53
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:55,250
he committed a foul right before that.

54
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,180
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no. Get him against him.

55
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,350
[inaudible] he's asking you a question.

56
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,690
[inaudible] if they would
have stopped it but see it,

57
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,670
I'd be through [inaudible]. If
she had, I'd been to SMEs to,

58
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,360
if the judge would've seen that,

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,850
seen him ripping off his glove,
he came to me and said,

60
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:22,090
I was so hoping he would've seen
him punching him. Liked, Huh? No,

61
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,070
my mentor went to the input
and the organization's got you.

62
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,170
How much time would he have taken?

63
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,380
Well, he should take points away.
I said, this is what I think.

64
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,840
I think anytime someone does a foul,

65
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,870
you just take points away on the
I the file kicking the balls,

66
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,200
poke in the eye, point away. Because
even if you don't mean to do it,

67
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,310
even if you don't mean to do it,
lots of Saint [inaudible],

68
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,340
it's still does damage
and it's a foul foul.

69
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,050
So I think you should
get a point taken away.

70
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,860
Okay. Thankfully my Jamaican,
he didn't say it. She,

71
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,690
she knows me. I see.
No, he, I said, listen,

72
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,320
now the APP,
I don't,

73
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,690
the fight ended poke a like I
want gimbal because at the time,

74
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:08,690
and she know [inaudible] he
would've lost the fight. Right,

75
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,030
right. Cause you were hurt. Ooh,

76
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,000
he's getting up in front of AA
or na, he punches him, my boom.

77
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,660
She not by their name and it's like, oh,
did you already said lose it? They fight.

78
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,540
If he wouldn't look at the time when
the end that he would've lost the fun.

79
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,810
Right.
So the

80
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,860
round was over. You sat down
between rounds. What happened?

81
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,310
Mccarthy,
Mary,

82
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,270

83
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,750
It's how I get book and manage it.
Are they lean pillow?

84
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,640
Stay right there and clean them.
But my gut is intelligent.

85
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,080
My could you say, I know can't
do it. No barley and bellow.

86
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,660
So your coach bought you extra time,

87
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,800
bad or Norfolk go by and
I said, dude, I made out.

88
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, watch it. No, come into
North Memorial yelling pyramid.

89
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,150
His trainer couldn't clean them,
couldn't wipe him. And they said,

90
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,550
uniporter condiment. And I listened
the protocol. He said, no, no, no.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,510
[inaudible] [inaudible] it
okay to Cookman like Emma.

92
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,660
Oh, the guy that was supposed to
wipe him down was to cut math,

93
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,490
but the cup man couldn't do it.

94
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,790
So then the other guy had
a company that out of Yale,

95
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,570
the cup man had left already. [inaudible]
rd. Just the only two that were in the,

96
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,420
in the ring with the two trainers.

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,000
[inaudible]
I try.

98
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,120
You even got him.

99
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,830
So did they cover you with water to give
you extra time that they don't want to

100
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:43,330
show up out there? My Tempo? No, no,

101
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,110
that was [inaudible].

102
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,500
He's always done the water exclusively
in his trainings and crusade and I will

103
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:55,650
see him, you know, joking
[inaudible] recover.

104
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,840
He likes the water for recovery,
but again, then he got to them.

105
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,140
Ilene Peng play tells
people to wipe them down.

106
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,370
Right now I am proud of my
temple and put out your record.

107
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,880
It's not for more time.

108
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:09,050
It's for him to recover and could see
that y'all ain't get it done. Dot.

109
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,240
Then they got on to nodded Don, Don,
Don, Leo [inaudible] recovering Mandarin.

110
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,510
I didn't hit him. I ain't get to the
side of my thought here. I said, did I,

111
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:22,870
that I work on after Wyatt,
who's taught in, in Baghdad.

112
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,810
I meant more and with the towels on them
and to wipe it down at the same time to

113
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:31,250
cool him off and call them off. Right. So
at the end of the round, the round ends,

114
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,710
you're sitting on the corner of the round,
supposed to begin.

115
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,400
Tim Kennedy standing up and he's like,
what is going on here?

116
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,560
He thinks maybe the fights over and
you're still sitting here, you know,

117
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,410
he wanted to fight to be over.
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Okay.

118
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,750
[inaudible]

119
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,600
no. Getting up early. I come
with Tim Kennedy and modify them.

120
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,160
[inaudible] you UFC then she had,
I'll take it.

121
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,460

122
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,430
Matt [inaudible] and
I'll let you all know.

123
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:07,920
Getting up earlier first he said he
had an injury, they want to fight.

124
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,090
So it took the UFC three months for him
to fight EOL but he could have had an

125
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:16,120
injury. [inaudible] injury
is possible. Pool Dot.

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:17,970
No,

127
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,970
he's not saying it [inaudible] on up in
there because they gave him the fight

128
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:26,420
three times.

He ain't [inaudible] let me
toss it in the beginning.

135
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,730
He was very nice.

136
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,390
[inaudible] Quando I'm
going to send a lot. Um, uh,

137
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,800
I went in a bizarre way in the
land. Just don't, don't kill him.

138
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,090
He's standing in their mind his
business, but oh, can I? Okay, good. Oh,

no, this a hygiene. I don't do it right.

146
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,630
[inaudible] I said, all right, so see you.

147
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,720
[inaudible] [inaudible] why would he
come up to him and say that if the whole

148
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:55,950
time he's been very respectful to
Tim candidate, right. I don't know.

149
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,880
Because he wanted to talk,
you know, like if a friend,

150
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:06,150
some weight loss, can I say
it was [inaudible] games?
Are they used in sports?

151
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,780
You know, I try to be your friend.
Yeah, that's it. [inaudible]

152
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,940
when we were in the fight, she
threw me off. He ended up in there.

153
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,320
If you watched the fight,
came around,

154
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,760
know an FRC the first round he wanted
easy say well no longer took that under

155
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:24,050
the wrong. I thought he's in
the second round. He's fight.

156
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,650
He's willing to fight for the right.
She knows.

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,430
She knows [inaudible] [inaudible]

158
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,130
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] that
wouldn't have happened with the grab

159
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:36,830
glove.
He would've won the second round.

160
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:41,831
And also him grabbing your glove
is how he was able to hit you.

161
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,370
Yeah. And No [inaudible] he didn't
touch him in the whole fight. Right.

162
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,480
That's what I meant.
Thinking.

163
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,860
So who do Melissa one just in those
last ten second, he the we golden.

164
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,190
Do you get them real fucking hard?
So when you were sitting there,

165
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,820
what was going through your mind when you
were sitting there and Tim Kennedy was

166
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,130
telling you to stand up and you
knew that the round was over.

167
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,460
The rest period was over two thousand
seven thousand eight Tim Keller Valley

168
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,880
shut off the pilot they buy today.

169
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,600
You can look at the top and so panic
domain don't get out. My wipe out there,

170
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,890

up as soon as they fucking wipe me down.

171
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,460
Saint Paul,
can you look at,

172
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:23,461
they come up in Sando [inaudible]
not [inaudible] Sandal.

173
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,040
Give him a guy that got sent out. He
and, and then reality and think that Tim,

174
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,370
can you,
y'all make it.

175
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:37,320
He had guys in your three pence on the
way that he was thinking, Hey guys.

176
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,420
[inaudible] now he wants to come
out to finish knocking me out.

177
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,410
You know, they all got them. You know,

178
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:54,130
how come I didn't let me dry me
off and then we'll fucking fight.

179
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,880
Right. But there was only,
you only get one minute rest.

180
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,540
You were hurt at the end of the round.
There's only one minute rest,

181
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,810
but you took a minute and 30 seconds.
That extra 30 seconds had to help.

182
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,010
Cause he say [inaudible]
but [inaudible] has,

183
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,610
I don't know, cause we'll tend to
us. I will not [inaudible] why not?

184
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,710
[inaudible] yeah. Fuck yeah. Yeah.
But in my, for me, good pop his fault.

185
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,060
It's not your fault. Let me go,
Bro. C C C who is a third lien bill,

186
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,770
if he will have been cleaned up,

187
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,770
McCarthy condition [inaudible]
it was a go out and fight going.

188
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,110
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible]

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
[inaudible] [inaudible]

190
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,540
and he stopped and told him to slow down.

191
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,670
So you're saying that that was not a
ploy in order to get you more rest x when

192
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,990
we went on a whole lot of that by no
mother? No on, no, no, no. For sure.

193
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,220
Yeah.
