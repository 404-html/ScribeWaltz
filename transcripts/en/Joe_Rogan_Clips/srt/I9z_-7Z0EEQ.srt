1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
Hey Joey, Joey's, he
called me a couple times.

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:08,460
Should I answer the phone? If he calls
calling back. Awesome Cock sucker

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,720
made a watch that Derek too.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,460
Darrin tells over there eating pop tarts.
You weighs 500 pounds.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,590
He's talking about Mckenzie
turns ass last night again.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,300
He's terrible about that job.
What do you take? What you think?

7
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,680
That's my,
what do you think happened?

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,090
You think she's just eating all the
fucking time? I don't know Joey.

9
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,850
I don't know what purse.
She missed weight by seven pounds.

10
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:37,630
She's fucking smoking though, right?
She's very attractive girl. Okay.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,690
Joey's right now in the middle of
bomb hits. You can answer that phone.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,460
I'll answer. Hmm? Really?
It's, yeah, I'm surprised

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,960
that's not where he's
calling me. Oh, there it is.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,250
Calling you back where you been dog?
Yeah.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,680
What does that speaker, I'm at times I
had to call your were on the podcast.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,750
We're on. We're on Jre la fight
companion live. What's up?

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,780
What are you doing there?

18
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,450
I am watching Dick like I should just
don't want people to see time to watch

19
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,390
people kick each other in
the fucking head. Today

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,950
you're on the air. You on speaker
phone. Now let me come on, man.

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,270
Cops.
You're what?

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,130
What are you doing a show at cops.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,820
Oh,
La Cobbs is this Friday in San Francis.

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,800
One day this week on the show to discuss.
You'll call me Korea as a fuck.

25
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,670
And uh,

26
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,320
what do you call that fucking extra
extra terrestrial fucking comic.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,473
What?

28
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,093
Right.

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,060
Well, I'm over here smoking the weed.
Daddy smoked, you know what I'm saying?

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,070
But Netflix next week I'm probably
going to tell them new asshole.

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,740
They came out last night to see uncle
Joey. I was dropping fucking dog.

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,910
No jokes on him. His
Shit. I'm ready to go dog

33
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,000
therapy right now just
listening to dogs by pink Floyd

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,061
therapy.

35
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:29,510
Then I'm going to pop up fucking podcast
and I'm doing a few spots that I had to

36
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:33,820
let these mother fuckers know
who's running things. And I said

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,270
Phil against Wonderboy and my man against
the other guy. I watch it tonight.

38
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,104
I'm tape

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,940
Joey, what time? What time
are you tapings on June 4th

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,950
seven and 9:00 PM in Las Vegas.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,940
And where at? Where are the,
where are they filming that

42
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,610
downtown? I think someplace they got,
it's a small place. Joe was made for us.

43
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,040
It's like a seats less than the original
room. Nice and tight. Really. It's like,

44
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,350
it's like Providence, Rhode Island. When
was the last time you went to providence?

45
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,660
Probably years ago. That comedy
connection. Fucking deadly.

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,820
It's deadly.

47
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,690
And so is this is the same
type of layout to 50 to 40?

48
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,130
Are there tickets available? Uh,
there's no tickets available. I mean,

49
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,550
there's something for you. You know
what I'm saying? Right. If you,

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,400
if you show up in the helicopter,
I can't deny it. Yeah.

51
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,680
Power Copter than what you'll know days.
You know what I'm saying?

52
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,650
You just walk in and take the fucking
mic and tell people what's time.

53
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,640
But it's beautiful. But that's
it. There's nothing available.

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,150
I can't wait for people to see that
special. Joey's going to be fucking nuts.

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,180
I can't really, I'm working hard. I've
never worked this hard in my life.

56
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,350
I didn't know the meaning of this.

57
00:03:48,351 --> 00:03:52,340
And so I listen to you or the
tapings and the try and shit.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,610
And now I'm just doing 28
minutes sexual all week,

59
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,820
28 28 28 Oo,
I got to get the big,

60
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,630
I got to get the beginning more jazzed
up because I got to make them watch.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,960
So I got to go out there like a
fucking medial, you understand me?

62
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:09,680
I got to go out there and holds him
to like 14 minutes and let them,

63
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,730
I got the strategy.

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,210
I'm going to go out there and fucking
just go off for about 14 then we go to

65
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,940
watch different corners and then
they come on, I pick my shots.

66
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,170
I just picked my fucking
shots like when fucking, uh,

67
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,150
Eddie's guys fought that dude and he
fucking took the really good striker.

68
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:33,470
I gotta pick my shots in the second round
and then the third round go out there

69
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,530
and just fucking four point combinations
ending with leg kicks the ted down than

70
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:40,730
the, until you can't take it no
more. You know what I'm saying?

71
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,770
That's the strategy, right?
Then I'm breaking it down
to three rounds. Joe Rogan,

72
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,700
you did it. You did last night. The
Ice House said, I told, I told Rodney,

73
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,650
set them on fire man. Yeah, no, no, no.

74
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,190
I broke it down to three rounds
and I'm cutting not in an addict.

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,190
You know what I'm saying? I'm cutting.
I'm looking at it like an MMA fighter.

76
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,200
So I'm training for a fight.
So the first 11 minutes you guys fucking,

77
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:10,150
I got to jump on your criminal shit.
The whole fucking old school.

78
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:14,380
Old School veto the second round.
I'm just picking my shots like,

79
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,580
like a guy gets Edson
Barboza he picked his shots,

80
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,790
he picked them apart. He kicked him in
the side. He fucked up that sciatic nerve.

81
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,410
He kicks him in the body

82
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,190
and then the third round I come out like
fucking that black dude in the 70s that

83
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:35,540
sport when they gave him the bottle
filled with cocaine, milk Joe Rogan

84
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,310
fuckers don't know magic bottle.

85
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,640
Same One Dana brought out for
the fight against out though.

86
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,060
It's kind of Mcgregor.

87
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,250
That's the same one that gave fucking

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,030
don't tell me I know the
characteristics of that fucking milk.

89
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,900
Fuck you pick you're dealing with in
the third round we'd come out like

90
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,750
Brian was that trainer's
name? Uh, is that a manual?

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,590
Joe Rogan. We're watching
it right now. Jamie.

92
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,880
Just put it on Alexis, our guayle.
Alexis Aguayo. Aaron Pryor.

93
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,300
Panama Lewis gave him the bottle with
the original should it shouldn't know

94
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,970
Diego was sending up.
Yeah,

95
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,440
he gave me tell him some
coconut water though.

96
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Looking back and then Aaron Pryor came
out just throwing bombs and fucked Alexis

97
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,640
Aguayo up. That was a great fight, man.

98
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,250
This is the way you gotta do
it, man. Old School boxing.

99
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,150
Aaron Pryor, the bottle.
It's fights up bottles.

100
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,340
I called the bottle that I said
get on the bottle that I mixed.

101
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,820
Did they capture that on video?
It has a bottle.

102
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,760
Give him the bottle that I met
with smoke coming out of it.

103
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,910
I wonder what the fuck was
in that thing. Cocaine. Damn.

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,580
He's doing work. Look it up. Where's
the box? I'll get the other one.

105
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:14,630
The one that I'm mixed. Look at it.
Okay. There's no, no, no, not that one.

106
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,600
Give me the other one.
Okay. How fucking beautiful.

107
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:23,130
It's that that's one bottle sniff and
shit. No, that they try to get more than,

108
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,920
that was the one he goes.
Give me that one. Yeah. Bang.

109
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,150
He got hurt before he fucked out.
Alexis Aguayo had a nasty right hand man.

110
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,420
He was watery, his shit long. So this
is not the main event, is it? Yeah.

111
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:40,320
This is the main event. Can
we are all right, let's go
right back to, to the fight,

112
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,070
Joey. We're about to watch
one the boyfriends until we
love you, man. Love you, man.

113
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:48,220
Love you, man. I will see you this week,
brothers. Thank you, man. See it. But.
