1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,690
You don't ever have to buy meat in
Australia? No. No. Do you ever buy meat?

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,590
If we're eating chicken, yeah, that's
about it. But just to mix it up. Yeah.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,600
The fridge is full. I feel only
friends, fridges, me, families, fridges.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,410
So funny chicken. What's that? Mountain
lion tastes like fucking delicious.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,940
That's what I keep hearing.
It's delicious and people get angry.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,220
It's so strange to me how angry people
get if you kill a mountain line. Yeah.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,810
Cause I think they think
that if you kill it,

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,220
it's different than killing a deer or
something. That's a normal thing to eat.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,470
Even more than a bear. It is get
more angry. So kitty cat. Yeah.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,610
Yeah. Meanwhile that motherfucker will
kill you. I had a bunch of people saying,

11
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,960
you know,
you shouldn't have killed her loan.

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,080
See Mountain lions like I see you dear.
I'm fucking know shit.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,530
Cause if you've seen mountain Lykes lines,
like you seen deer, there'd be no dear.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,440
It's as simple as that. You know,
I don't know what the numbers are,

15
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:56,100
but there's probably supposed to be like
one mountain line for every 500 deer or

16
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:59,750
something like that. Yeah, that's right.

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,980
And they're sneaky creature. You
know, you're not supposed to say I'm,

18
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:04,660
they're not like that. Listen, you,

19
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,430
you could go your whole life not seeing
them and they can be around you all the

20
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,220
time. Yeah, definitely. That's a
fact. If you live in the wilderness,

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
if you live in Montana or you live in
Colorado and you live in the woods,

22
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,160
you might see one every few years,

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,950
you might might issue years and
they are fucking everywhere. Yeah.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,410
I'll say prints all the time,
but I'll never say a cat.

25
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,800
Like I've actually never seen a cat in
a wall or set for the one that I hunted.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,430
And um, that's like that story
I was telling you before,

27
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:39,780
like it was eight and a cough, but they
typically kill a deer every single day.

28
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,350
So it's fucking deer.
The human,

29
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:45,900
Brian allows us to manage things
in a certain way, you know,

30
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:49,530
and it's like these biologist support
all this study and research in the,

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,260
you know, go on. Okay, you
can hunt males in this area.

32
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:56,120
So that's all I could hunt where I
was. I could only shoot a male, a male.

33
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,270
Well that's when the dogs come in handy.
So like I've always,

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,420
I've never really wanted to hunt with
dogs cause I like to do all the hunting

35
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,830
myself.
But um,

36
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:09,150
there's a special bond between the
hunter and the dogs when you're hunting,

37
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:12,000
that's for sure. And it was actually a
really good experience. I really loved it.

38
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,540
But a lot of people frown on using dogs.
But the best way to,

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,780
to determine the sex is the dogs.

40
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:22,950
We'll track it and the line will take
refuge in a tree and then you can have a

41
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:27,400
look at a genitals and make sure it's
a male was binoculars. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,910
Or sometimes if they're low enough
you can tell if the human eye,

43
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:31,860
so the first thing we established was,

44
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,230
well it was a line that I wanted the
lion that had killed that calf was eating

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,890
that calf alive. We ended up getting, uh,

46
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,160
getting the ranch to come in and he ended
up putting a calf out of its misery.

47
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,660
It couldn't be saved and a then we put
the dogs back on that mountain lion track

48
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:50,280
and I chased him about seven miles
and they end up training. We got,

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,610
we marched in and hawked into Detroit
and ended up determining that it was a

50
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:57,720
male. And then, um, I ended up shooting
and it wasn't really good deaf.

51
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,560
It was quick.
But um,

52
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,070
if it was a female would have
had to have left where we were.

53
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,280
Some states aren't like that and counties
aren't like that where it can be male

54
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:08,260
and female if the population is too high.

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,660
What they're trying to do in that part
of Colorado is just keep that mountain

56
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,040
lion population healthy and
how they determined that
was by shooting males only.

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,340
That could change next year.
They could have a rise in mountain lion,

58
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,390
a decrease in the mule deer and other
animals. So they might change that again,

59
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:29,830
but we could only shoot them mail.
So yeah, the problem in America, um,

60
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,150
particularly in California where
they outlawed hunting with dogs,

61
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:38,440
is that the perception of using
a dog to go after an animal,

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,130
the perception is that it's
not fair, but people, I mean,

63
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:44,950
there's going to be hard for some people,
especially animal lovers to understand,

64
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,170
but that is the only effective way to
hunt for mountain lions because there's no

65
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,210
way you're going to sneak up on them.
You're just not.

66
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,270
You're not going to see that.
That's when numbers start to bloom.

67
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,270
And other animals like meal deer
and stuff started to plummet,

68
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,710
which I've heard a lot that's
happening in California,

69
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:02,310
is the mule deer population.

70
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,140
She has been decimated because there's
no control on the mountain lions. Well,

71
00:04:06,141 --> 00:04:07,780
they do have control the mountain lions,

72
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,280
but only government employees killed
the mountain lion kill. Ironically,

73
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,370
the same amount of mountain lions they
were killing when they were hunting is

74
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:16,810
insane.
It's insane.

75
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,460
But instead of people paying money to
do it and getting it ties back into

76
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,770
conservation and getting
the eat the mountain line,

77
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:27,100
which I know again people like, what are
you talking about eating mountain line.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,110
I'm telling you folks, I haven't eaten
one, but I'm telling you and you said it.

79
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,660
Brunello said it's one of the most
delicious animals he's ever eaten.

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
All wanted to bring you sound,

81
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,160
but it's actually illegal to
bring it in to California.

82
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,500
Good thing we always abide by the law.

83
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,250
Adam Green Tree and then
one day I'll try it.

84
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,920
So then I've cooked it up and I'm fading
it to Kim and I was cooking chicken as

85
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,830
well just in case her and
the kids didn't like it.

86
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:57,190
I had chicken on the grill as well and
I said the mountain line first and now

87
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:59,950
we're eating the mountain lion and
I'm like, what do you think of it?

88
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,190
And she's like, Oh, I've got the
chicken. I'm like, no you don't.

89
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,860
You've got the mountain lion.
And it was delicious. Dude.

90
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:10,861
It's tender as I felt like it was a
Tice between like chicken and pork or

91
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:16,390
chicken. And even venison. Like I
found it right in the middle there.

92
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,171
It's delicious.

93
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,300
And I'm not saying everyone should go
out and hunt a mountain line cause you

94
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,280
can't do that.
Right.

95
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,310
But there's certain places that you
can go and get a tag for the benefit of

96
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,610
wildlife and go and hunter mountain line
people who just have a hard time with

97
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:32,611
the idea that you are somehow or another
helping to control the population by

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,060
killing an animal that kills
other animals. Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,050
It's really weird. They would rather
let nature take its course, but what,

100
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:44,320
so even if like,
like let's go to Africa now,

101
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,910
even if the lion population why
outweighed something and was running it to

102
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:52,420
extinction, these people would want to
see it back and just let that happen.

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,860
And it's like humans have got a Brian
capacity that allows us to study and put

104
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,850
research into an animal that's like
actually what would be more healthier for

105
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,450
the whole eco system would be if
we come in and hunt these animals.

106
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,250
And what we'll do is we'll charge people
a certain tag fee to be able to do

107
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,160
that. And we'll put that back into
conservation, which will help this animal.

108
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,360
And then there's just this beautiful
healthy bowl that keeps turning. Yeah.

109
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:20,050
For the people that know it, they respect
it and they appreciate it. You know,

110
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:22,900
people like back country hunters
and anglers and all these different

111
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,060
organizations,
Rocky Mountain Elk Federation,

112
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:28,030
a lot of different organizations that
they have in the United States that really

113
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:32,050
appreciate what they're
doing to promote that, that,

114
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,310
that idea here in America.
But people that don't hunt and don't,

115
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,490
don't go into,

116
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,660
I mean it took me years to kind of
wrap my head around it and really truly

117
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:45,590
understand it and become educated as to
how it works and how wildlife biologists

118
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:48,730
set these standards and they do it based
on healthy populations and how much

119
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:52,150
time they spend doing surveys
and analyzing the population,

120
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:54,130
how important it is to,
you know,

121
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,200
these reports and hunter send
in to wildlife organizations
and the department of

122
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,070
fish and game.

123
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,470
It's really interesting stuff and I'm
not a blanket killer evil because I

124
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:06,660
understand where those people are
coming from as well. And we needed to,

125
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,590
we need a certain amount of that because
it could go the opposite way where it's

126
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,330
like,
let's just go out and hunt everything,

127
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,660
and it's not the case if something's
not in a good, healthy population.

128
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:17,260
I'm not interested in hunting and
overall myself. Of course. Yeah.

129
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,870
Now I want to say these animals stay here
for forever. I want my kids, kids, kids,

130
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:24,800
kids, to be able to see those animals
in good health, healthy population.
