1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
I was telling you guys before I had an
issue today where my credit card got

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,790
robbed and uh, you know,
whatever credit card fraud,

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,310
someone got ahold of my number,
which is really,

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,780
that's the one thing that people worry
about the most about shopping online.

5
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:18,120
Right. But I guess that could
kind of happen everywhere,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,830
but you got to think that if there's
anything that has changed malls more than

7
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:23,460
anything,

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,000
it's gotta be the ability to just
shop online on your phone like Amazon.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,850
That the fact that they figured that out.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,330
I remember when Amazon came out and
it was just a bookstore. I was like,

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:36,240
who the fuck is going to buy books online?
You can just go to the bookstore.

12
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:39,270
This is ridiculous. What a
stupid business. Meanwhile,

13
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,120
that guy has more money than any
human on the planet. That's right.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,250
Yet the poor bastards
getting divorced too.

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,400
I heard last night that there's
a rule and we lash Washington.

16
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,520
That everything that you make as a couple,
you have to split.

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,090
We've been together for over
25 years. Well, California,

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,780
California law is, yes, 50 50 well,

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,270
longterm marriages 20
years or 10 years or more.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,270
It's 50 50 and that
includes downstream income.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,750
You know from anything you did
that you're still getting paid for.

22
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,440
Say 10 years ago you wrote a book
or whatever Mrs. Bezos is getting,

23
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,490
he's worth a hundred plus
billion dollars. They said, wow,

24
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,360
so she's going to get half of that,
but probably going to,

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,390
because it's a lot of stock.

26
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:25,050
They said they're going to have to just
be stay friends because oh they better.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,510
She should be super nice to him.

28
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,090
Even if he only gives her a quarter if
she's like, I got Rollin, I got wrong.

29
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,290
The richest people in the world now,
but after all these bookstores,

30
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:36,991
man in a business,

31
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,350
there's some irony that Amazon now wants
to start opening physical brick and

32
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,450
mortar stores.
That is kind of ironic,

33
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,680
but it does make sense though because
there are some brick and mortar stores and

34
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:50,130
I think that guy's a conquer. I think he
just wants to take over everything. Well,

35
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,360
why else would he buy whole foods? And I
was like, ah, the supermarket business,

36
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,890
I can fuck this up too. Well
automated. He can, I don't know,

37
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,260
maybe you could order whole foods
delivered to your house. I think the,

38
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,400
I ended up that's available yet,
but I think it is right. Yeah,

39
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,600
I was to say it now.
Most grocery stores,

40
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,720
even like all the Ralphs have home
delivery with it two hours to compete with

41
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:14,580
Amazon prime. Yeah. Wow. Are,
and if they don't do that,

42
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,680
you can just order it online and
pick it up. And I'll bring out too,

43
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,370
I went to pavilion's the other day and
they had a bunch of delivery trucks

44
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,030
parked in the parking lot. I was
like, well look at this. Like,

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,930
think of these cool delivery trucks.

46
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,040
Have to have that one store you can
walk in and there's no cashiers.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,800
They just trust that
everyone's not stealing.

48
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:36,801
And I think they just are a comfortable
with a certain amount of theft.

49
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,520
Oh Wow. Hmm. That's interesting. Well,
they probably have cameras everywhere too,

50
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,230
you know? But it's, um,

51
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,650
the online purchasing
like that has got to put,

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,140
that must be putting the most,

53
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,430
as far as like the most impact on stores,
brick and mortar stores.

54
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:55,950
It's like the ability to purchase online.
It's got to be devastating for them.

55
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:58,620
Right. Totally. And up in Santa
Barbara, where I live now,

56
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:01,480
just a riding up state street this
morning, at the end of the ride, you know,

57
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,070
it's like the third,
maybe a quarter of the stores are closed.

58
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:07,690
I had a business empty and you
know, state street, Santa Barbara,

59
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,510
this was like the happened in place to be.
And I,

60
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,420
and a real estate friend of mine says, Oh,
well, let's see that store there. That's,

61
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:17,770
you know, $22,000 a month to lease.
Like, Whoa, okay. So you have to,

62
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,280
you have to have a retail outlet that's
really turning over the customers.

63
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,010
And there's a lot that just can't do that.
I mean,

64
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,780
you can't have an antique store that's
going to do that are a little knickknack

65
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,140
store.
