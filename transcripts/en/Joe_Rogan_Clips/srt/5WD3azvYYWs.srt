1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:00,660
You,

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,650
your people are turning to social media
almost before they turn anywhere you're

3
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:07,980
looking, you know, I, when I hear
about something I almost always,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,570
before I even Google it, I almost always
go to Twitter and check Twitter and,

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:16,650
and you know, and see what's going on
and see talks that go at duck duck, go.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,090
Have you heard of that one? No. It's that,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,800
it's like a privacy focused search engine.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,510
It's like pretty much the only
privacy alternative to Google.

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,470
It's like this idea that we say, I'll
just Google it. Right. Why do we,

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,530
I mean our whole process has been to
like purge proprietary surveillance tools

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:40,401
from our company and I've been trying
to get myself like getting off Facebook,

12
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,480
getting off Twitter,
getting off Instagram.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,330
It's just like there's so abusive to
everybody and it's like there's brilliant

14
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:49,080
people who work there.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,010
I mean Instagram is such a well designed
app or you can call me beautiful.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,640
But so what do you think is
abusive about it particularly?

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,350
There's start with Twitter. They're all
the same. They're all the same. Yeah.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,040
Do you think they're all the same?
Because they're all gigantic businesses.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,350
Yeah.

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,580
And they're all the same because none
of them share their source code and they

21
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:16,320
all spy on everybody and they don't show
you what is happening behind the scenes.

22
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,170
They don't show you what the
code is doing. So like in that,

23
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:20,430
in that note I wrote to the other day,

24
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:24,960
it's like I compare it to like
food transparency. You know,

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,500
50 years ago nobody thought about that.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,580
And then 20 years ago everyone's like,
I want to know what's in my food white.

27
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,640
But why wouldn't you want to
know what's in your apps? Yeah.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,670
I mean it's super sketchy what
they're doing, but how, so look what,

29
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,940
what superskin we don't know.

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,910
But we know that they're
spying on everyone and
tracking you everywhere you go.

31
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:49,200
They're targeting things at you based
on physical location, browser history,

32
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,790
even when you're not on those websites,

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,370
some of their following you around where
you're going on the Internet. Right.

34
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,430
And so some people except that for this
free search engine would free email and

35
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,270
things along those lines.

36
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,620
The PSAP except the fact that a certain
percentage of what they're doing is not

37
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,520
going to be private,

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,110
or at least their searches are not going
to be probably like if you circle you

39
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:13,020
thinking about buying a jeep and you
searched jeeps, you look at, you know,

40
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,850
2019 jeep and then all of a sudden
all your Google ads are about jeeps,

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,390
right? They're like, we know, we
know you thinking about cheap bill,

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,450
and I don't think that that makes people
want to spend more time on Google and

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,710
Facebook. If Fred he does, do
you think it freaks them out?

44
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,190
I think that we're just numb
to it and so we accept it,

45
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,770
but I think it's more that.
Yeah.

46
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:39,771
And so there's all different layers of
like what we use with your browsers,

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,130
your apps, your operating
system, your food,

48
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,310
your government,
your energy.

49
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:55,050
Like all of this technology has code,

50
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,180
right? That's associated with it. So,

51
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,780
and when you open up your computer,
when you sign into a browser,

52
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,480
when you open up an app,
you are empowering that APP.

53
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,360
That's how the apps of the world
become huge, monstrous corporations.

54
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:13,150
This because we all use them everyday,
right? So if you switch from, you know,

55
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,650
oh at Macko s to like a new Linux
or like Debbie and urban too,

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,480
if you use brave or Firefox, if you, um,

57
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,090
you know, ductile goes actually
proprietary, which is annoying,

58
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:29,260
but they are very privacy focused.
And then there's Apps, there's mines,

59
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,600
there's all sorts of,
there's other open source,

60
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,590
decentralized social networks out there
that we can potentially federate with.

61
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,591
There's really cool new interesting
protocols like dat and IPFS that are like

62
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,630
more torrent style backend.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,760
So there's actually no servers in a
giant warehouse like Facebook and Google.

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,410
It's more,

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,580
it's fully peer to peer and we're trying
to balance it because it's not like

66
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:58,900
decentralization equals good
and centralization equals
bad. But like, you know,

67
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,990
in order to get a suite app,
like Instagram style,

68
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,900
you need servers to like process video.

69
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:08,560
And so the tech is still sort of
immature in the fully peer to peer, like,

70
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,880
you know, bitcoin style internet.
But we're definitely getting there.

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,940
And I just think it's important for people
to use things that are transparent to

72
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,110
them and respecting our freedom.
Yeah.

73
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:24,440
I think one of the problems with these
giant companies is that once they become

74
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:26,510
big,
he kind of used them as a default.

75
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,270
And it's very difficult to get people
to communicate with you off of them.

76
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,220
You know? It's a hard to say, hey man,
I'm launching this new social media APP.

77
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,990
I would imagine you could speak to this.

78
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,250
I'm launching this new social media
APP and, uh, I want you to join it.

79
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,460
People like put them already on fucking
Facebook. I'm already on Google.

80
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:48,200
I'm Ernie on Instagram. I don't want to do
that, man. It's too much, too much extra.

81
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,830
And we make it a million times harder
for ourselves because we're not scooping

82
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:56,240
into people's contacts and taken
all their information. You are not,

83
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,100
we're mines. No. Okay. So like when
you give your address book to an App,

84
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,360
who does that? Every most apps would be
you gotta be an Asshole, you know? No.

85
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,290
But when you say,
oh,

86
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:09,530
I want to find my friends who are on
this app and you share your contacts,

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,990
we not supposed to do that.
You're not supposed to do that yet.

88
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
But most people do.
And you know,

89
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,970
your friends didn't give you permission
to give Facebook their phone number.

90
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:20,940
Do you do that?
Used to like seven,

91
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:22,440
eight years ago when
everybody don't do it anymore.

92
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,070
I always say the same thing when it
pops up kit though. Fuck Outta here.

93
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,210
That's always what I say.
Would you like to share your,

94
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:32,760
your contacts get the fuck outta
here. No, you can't have my contacts.

95
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:36,960
You asshole. I know what you're doing.
Facebook is a weird one man. It's so,

96
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,120
it's such a sneaky one. You know,
Facebook and you know like all this,

97
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:47,010
uh, the, the congressional hearings
and the inner workings of it all.

98
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:52,011
And there the fact that
it profits off of outrage.

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,940
So it wants people to argue like the,
the Ai,

100
00:05:56,941 --> 00:06:01,941
the computer learning specifically wants
people to have like contentious debates

101
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,980
about things cause that keeps
their eyes focused on the website.

102
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,040
And if your eyes are focused on Facebook,
you know,

103
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,120
then those Facebook ads are very
valuable. It's really fascinating, man.

104
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,100
I think the outrage is unavoidable
on any network. It's more,

105
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,550
you know, are you gonna? Are you gonna
take down there taking down outrage, Tom?

106
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:29,090
Yeah, sure. So, and it just seems
so inconsistent and subjective.
