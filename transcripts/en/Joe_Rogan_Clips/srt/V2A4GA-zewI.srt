1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,920
This is something that just came up and
we were trying to figure out if it's

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:03,754
nonsense or not.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,990
My friend Adam was here the other day
and we're talking about Toyota trucks and

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,900
he didn't Google Toyota
trucks just discussing it.

5
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:15,040
And he said since then his mentions
had been filled with these little

6
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:19,120
advertisements for Toyota trucks.
How's that work?

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,170
Well, you know how you talk
to Siri? Yes. Um, it, it's,

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,710
it's simple voice rec
recognition. It, it's,

9
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:32,180
it's a carry over from the old days
of, you know, optical readers and how,

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,330
you know, we all thought it was incredible
that you could take a piece of paper,

11
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:38,570
put into a system and it would like take
that information that was on that piece

12
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,630
of paper and now it was on a database
that you could access and manipulate.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,280
And so, you know, voice recognition is no
different in the sense that, so if, if,

14
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,840
if,
for example,

15
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:51,730
if I had this switched on and
it happens to people on the,

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,510
I'm sure all the time
walking around their house,

17
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,600
they'll say something and all of a
sudden Alexa will come on and go, oh,

18
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:58,310
I couldn't find a result for that.

19
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:02,600
But do you want to listen to
Ella Fitzgerald or whatever.
It's, it's always on.

20
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,790
It's always listening,
right?

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,880
And you can do that with anything like
this TV right here if you want it to a

22
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,120
few.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,120
If I knew that TV was going to go into
the office of the deputy foreign minister

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,430
of a country hostile to our interests,

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,700
I could turn that thing into
a receiver obviously. Right.

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,410
And if I could get my hands on that
before delivery, that's a wonderful thing.

27
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,830
Now I've got this in there and it's like
the old days when you would have to go

28
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:30,410
in on a,
an entry operation and you know,

29
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:34,040
you silent drills and
put a device in the wall.

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,120
Now you know, we've delivered a TV.
Now I get no, I get it right. You know,

31
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:43,010
video too. Hey, good for me.
So that Shit's always on in a,

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,600
in a sense.
And

33
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:49,480
so a regular phone that you get if you
just buy an iPhone and you have Siri

34
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,250
turned on so we can say,
Hey Siri,

35
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:55,420
and it turns on that
phone is always listening.

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,850
Well, uh, then now we're getting in over
my head. But it could be, I mean there is,

37
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:05,580
is it possible? Is it, is it capable of
doing that? Yes. Could you do that? Um,

38
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,840
uh,
as an intentional Operation Chore,

39
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,030
is it happening because apple wants
to do it and they want to get better

40
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,160
understanding of consumer
preferences and things?

41
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,080
I have no idea that
that's above my pay grade,

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,500
but I will say from an operational
perspective, sure, yeah.

43
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,350
Racial perspective.
Right.

44
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,940
But like it would kind of be scandalous
if we found out that apple is listened

45
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,370
to everything that you say and then
they're sending them information to these

46
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,760
companies and then they're trying to
sell you whatever you were bringing.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,740
Yeah. But it's one, it's
really, if you think about it,

48
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,410
it's only one step above what
they do anyway, which is, I mean,

49
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,900
if I go in here and I searched
Toyota, right? You know, I'm an,

50
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,340
I'm in the same situation, I'm fucking
inundated with Toyota mentions, right? So,

51
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,290
you know, it's, it's like
the next iteration of that.

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,730
And I suspect that people would,

53
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,340
you know,
that some folks would be outraged,

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,540
but I'll bet people would
just live with it. Right.

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,050
We seem to be willing to give
up a lot of shit, you know,

56
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,230
as long as we don't think that
governments doing it right, if it's,

57
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,860
if it's Google, if it's Google with
somebody, we seem to be fine with it.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,430
But if it's that, fuck it. If
it's that NSA, then now our best,

59
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,120
but that's not who's fucking making
jack off of these things. Right?

60
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,730
So it's Amazon,

61
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,120
Google and all these companies that are
using it to sell your data to make a lot

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,890
of money. Anyway. What do you got Jamie?

63
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,740
Centers call for investigation
of T-mobile, sprint,

64
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,920
Verizon and att and t for
selling location data.

65
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,460
Phone companies.
Know where you are.

66
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,200
Lawmakers want them to stop selling that
information until they can figure out

67
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,860
how to tax it,
that seems,

68
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,360
but what do they sell in
that location data for?

69
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,370
They want to know how many
people are in certain areas.

70
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,470
Is that the idea that that's
telling you where anyone could,

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,780
you can buy that information and
find anybody's, uh, location, right?

72
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,210
But look, they, they, they do these
things now where there's a billboard,

73
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,730
they'll put a billboard up in
a, in a, in a square, right? Uh,

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,450
and you'll walk by and the billboard has
the ability to see where the eyeballs

75
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,820
are, right? So you'll look
and they'll say, oh yeah,

76
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,780
it's looking at me that billboards
looking at me. So that's a success, right?

77
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:14,680
I've scored a hit or a view. And that was
the old days. It was like, you know, how,

78
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,160
you know, how many clicks or how many
billboards got a camera. There's a,

79
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:21,670
there's a ability for that billboard to
sense. And again, this, I go overboard.

80
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,220
If I start talking technical one,
someone will call me out and say, well,

81
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:28,240
it's not exactly how it works, but
uh, in simplistic terms, yeah, it's,

82
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,770
it's an ability to monitor,
um, pedestrian traffic,

83
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,670
uh, to understand, you know, uh,

84
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,700
people's interests and to further refine
so that they can sell a shit better.

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,730
Make your outdoor advertising interactive.

86
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,440
This is putting your phone
directly up to it. It's,

87
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,920
this is like you committing that there,

88
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,630
but there is also what he's talking
about to, this is what he started with.

89
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,150
This guy's talking about,
what's his name again? So this,

90
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,570
you walk up to a phone
that's in the photo,

91
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:01,840
you hold your phone up to it,
it sends a signal to your phone.

92
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,930
It seems like it's always Samsung
knows it. Only Samsung phones,

93
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,440
maybe just a galaxy. Add this
advertising. I have a song for you.

94
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:12,280
These are galaxy ads,
but if you can do a one way transaction,

95
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,740
that transaction can be two
away, easily, obviously. Right.

96
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,890
And it has to be to some degree because
there has to be an exchange of, you know,

97
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,490
sort of a handshake. So I didn't know
that billboards are staring at you though.

98
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,310
Yeah, no, it's, it's, it's a new,
pretty crazy shit. Look, I mean, this,

99
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,560
you can tracking now understanding
where people are. Right? Uh,

100
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,570
as an example, uh, apple, uh,

101
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,320
you know, it used to be putting a
beacon, right? Investigations, you know,

102
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,530
you put a beacon on a car, right?
And you, and it was low clumsy,

103
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:45,070
but it got better and better
as you go along. You know,
now it's, now it's, it's, uh,

104
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,270
it's,
it's pretty remarkable,

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,840
but you can also think about
the electronics that exist in a,

106
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,260
in a current vehicle and a new vehicle.
You can,

107
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:57,600
every one of those has a unique signature.
So whether it's the tire pressure, uh,

108
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:58,371
indicators,
you know,

109
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:02,240
how you get in your car and it says your
left front tire is low. Right? Well,

110
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,510
that's a particular signal.
If I know that signal for that car,

111
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,270
I'll bet I can find that
car. Right? And it's like,

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,390
it's the same with all
the other electronics that
exist within a vehicle. Um,

113
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,550
or just in the shit that we carry around.
They've all got some kind of signature.

114
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,040
So I, but again, I think, you know,

115
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,090
most people are willing to give up a
surprising amount of privacy for whatever

116
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,540
reason.

117
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,570
Maybe because they're getting accustomed
to it and they're not shocked by shit

118
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:26,840
anymore.
