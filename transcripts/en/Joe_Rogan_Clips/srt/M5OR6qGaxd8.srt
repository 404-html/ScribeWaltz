1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,800
And we're live. You've fucking handsome
bastard. Look at you. Oh yeah. This shit.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,970
What's going on man?

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,150
What's going on?
Um,

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,620
every time I've done this
once before and I've watched,

5
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:16,860
you know,

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,110
throughout the years
and when I come in here,

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,300
I get a little, um, nervous. Why?

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,490
You're a guy who knows a lot about
everything and I don't know a lot of,

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,040
I don't know a lot about everything.

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,460
I know enough to make it seem like
I know a lot about everything.

11
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:45,430
Whatever you're doing, it's, you
know more than I do. Right? Like,

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,950
like we were on your treadmill
out there and you go,

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,960
it's 13%. What did you say? 10%
more difficult than regular running.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,010
Okay.
I forgot the fact.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,790
What you just said from
the time we walk in,

16
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,930
I lost it so I don't,
I don't have the repension

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,410
that I wish I had some Alpha brain. I
need something. Do we have any here?

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,200
Is that what I'm missing
in my diet? Alpha? It's a,

19
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,350
what's interesting though is that
people will come up to me with shit that

20
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,620
happened just a few years ago and I'm
like, I don't remember that at all.

21
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,720
Like I think you have a certain amount
of room in your brain and my brain is

22
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:32,750
always deleting stuff that it
doesn't think it needs anymore.

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,280
And then shoving in new things.

24
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,020
Like sometimes someone will tell
me about something, I'm like,

25
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,670
what are you talking about?
And they're like,

26
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:41,360
you don't remember there was the guy
with no arms who drove us around. I went,

27
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:44,600
what? And then I have to go. Oh yeah.

28
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:49,040
It's like I find the folder in my head and
like, oh, there it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,050
And then we went to the pool
hall and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,960
And then I'll remember. Gotcha.
But if, yeah, it's just a,

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,590
for whatever reason, this, uh, I can only,

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,310
I only keep things that I'm
interested in. Gotcha. Yeah.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,400
I just wish I could retain a lot of
the things I either see or hear to then

34
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:11,300
recall it in a conversation.

35
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,100
You can, but you got to write things down.
You got to like want to recall things.

36
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,020
Yeah,

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,641
it's a problem.

38
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:20,210
I don't do a lot of writing as far as
like a notepad or anything to just take

39
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,044
notes.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,170
When you write your act,

41
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:25,470
do you write it in your head
or do you write it on paper or

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,190
it's all audio? Just audio.
I'll go to the comedy store.

43
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:32,720
I record it and I listened to it on
the way home and then I'll go, oh,

44
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:36,470
maybe I'll do this next time. Maybe I'll
do that. I'll take that out and this out.

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,170
And then, uh, so there's no writing.

46
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:43,910
My Act is more recalling stories
then sitting in a room going, oh,

47
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:48,530
I think this is funny. So that's
kind of how I work. But, uh, yeah,

48
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,600
the reason I say that to
start off is just like,

49
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:55,601
I see you go down a lot of different
paths on the podcast and I often the gold

50
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,100
man, if I was sitting in that
chair, could I add to conversation?

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,950
And a lot of times it's,
no,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't kid just because
for whatever the reason,

53
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,030
I, uh, I just feel like I need to
be a little bit more, um, well-read.

54
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,810
How often you read? Uh, like
I read the Goggins Book. Yeah.

55
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,450
And that fucking book, yeah. And Life
Dot Dude had, huh? It's sad life.

56
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:25,810
But then on the flip side,
inspiring to, you know,

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,810
a guy like myself were, you know,
I'm running, I'm running say,

58
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:33,760
or I'm working out and I thought of
this guy, go, you know what, let's,

59
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,570
let's put another mile into
this. So, uh, yeah. I mean,

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm just now starting to get into a
little bit more books than I have in the

61
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,820
past because in the past, to be
honest with you, I haven't really,

62
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,200
I haven't really read much.

63
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,570
I try to read a one new thing a week.
And the way I try to do it is, uh,

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,580
I have, uh, uh, I use a lot of
audio books, but I also read books.

65
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:01,040
So I go back and forth in between them
in between reading and audio books.

66
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,750
But I find for whatever reason,

67
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,990
I retained more with audio
books than I do with reading. I,

68
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,110
maybe it's my add or something like that,
because when I'm reading,

69
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:13,040
I kind of have to back up sometimes. Like
I'll go through a whole paragraph for,

70
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:17,180
I'm thinking about some other shit while
I'm reading, and then I got to go, okay,

71
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:21,140
asshole backup, reread that,
go over it again. You know?

72
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,700
That's what I find. I, I,
my mind wanders like, yeah.
