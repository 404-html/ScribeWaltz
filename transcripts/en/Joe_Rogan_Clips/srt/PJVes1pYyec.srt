1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,700
Well, it's really the same stupid
logic where I was talking about were,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,280
you know Gavin was saying punch people.
When you punch people,

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:09,120
it doesn't end there. Oh, my band
band them. It doesn't end there.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,680
It doesn't end there. You give to
realize also a Twitter is how old now?

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,420
11 years old. 12 years old. 13 years old.
13 years old. Well, 13 years from now.

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,390
What are the odds that there's not going
to be something else? Just like it? Well,

7
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,340
pretty slim. Uh, how we do

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,013
a million, no, but let's,

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,210
let's talk about the
incestuous relationship that
a lot of these journalists

10
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,390
have been defending the policies you
guys push. Gab It was, was, was a,

11
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:35,161
a study was done.

12
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:38,250
I talked about this last time where they
found 5% of the tweet of the say tweets,

13
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:42,150
but the posts on Gab where hate speech
compared to Twitter's like 2.4 so it's a

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,150
marginal increase yet gab is
called the white supremacy network.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,000
Of course you go on it and yeah,
absolutely exists.

16
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,210
They say that synagogue shooter. Oh, he
was a gap user. He was a Twitter user too.

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,890
He posted on Twitter all the time. So
why the media is, is targeting, it's,

18
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,920
it's such a crazy nightmarish reality.
It is active narrative.

19
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,690
And when the Guardian,
uh,

20
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,750
I believe it was the Daily Mail called
Count Danky Law Nazi hate criminal.

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,100
It's not really made a joke on youtube
and he's being, he was arrested. Um,

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,410
I thank God every day we have the
first amendment in this country.

23
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,920
Well there was a cover of a newspaper
that was cause he got a new job somewhere

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,060
they get, he got fired for that. He got
kicked off the show. Wow. Yeah. That's so,

25
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,390
so you have cause of trying again. It,
let me ask you another thing. Do you guys,

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,550
do you guys take the advice of
the southern poverty law center?

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,450
Did we take the advice of like, so it's,
it's widely circulated. The SPLC lobbies,

28
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,660
various social platforms to ban
certain people. They advise. Uh,

29
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,150
it's an important advised youtube as,
as the Anti Defamation League.

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,020
Do you use them in your decision
making process? It rule development.

31
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,030
We're very aware of the flaws with
certain of their research and we're very

32
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,150
careful about who we take advice from.
But do you take advice from them?

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,690
I think that they have certainly
reached out to our team members,

34
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,910
but they are certainly nothing
definitive that we take from them.

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,930
We don't take action.

36
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,840
You'll never take an action based on
the information received from them.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,850
The reason I bring them up specifically
is that they're cited often, you know,

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,491
in the United States,

39
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:05,370
there's other groups like a hope not hate
in the UK and now they're all going to

40
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:07,620
point their, you know, figurative
guns at me for saying this.

41
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,310
But the southern poverty law center,
uh,

42
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,560
wrote an article where they claimed I
went to Iran for a Holocaust deniers

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,910
conference and I've never been to a round.

44
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:18,210
And their evidence was this guy found
an archived website from a Holocaust

45
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,460
denier with my name on it.
And that was their proof.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,820
And there are people who
have been labeled, you know,

47
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,370
extremists by this organization
that have been Sam Harris.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,780
Sam Harris was started, was, I mean
it, didn't, they lose a big lawsuit.

49
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,390
They settled. Yeah. So, so again, like
not, not to imply that you guys do use it,

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
but I asked specifically because it's
been reported to other organizations do.

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,980
So we have activist organizations,

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,340
we have journalists that
I can attest to our APP,

53
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,510
absolutely activists because I've
worked for, I worked for vice,

54
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,670
I worked for a fusion. I was told, uh,

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,960
it implicitly not explicitly to lie to
side with the audience as, as it were.

56
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,640
I've seen the narratives they push and
I've had conversations with people that

57
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:58,950
I'm not going to, I'm going to
keep relatively off the record.

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,730
Journalists who are terrified because
they said the narrative is real. Right.

59
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,750
One journalists in particular said that
he had, he had evidence of, you know,

60
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,130
essentially he had reason to
believe there was a wrongdoing,

61
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,890
but if he talks about it, he
could lose his job. And there,

62
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:16,540
there was a journalist who reported to
me that data in society admitted their

63
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,930
report was, was, was,
was, was, uh, incorrect.

64
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,370
And now you've got organizations lobbying
for terminating Joe and I because of

65
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,620
this stuff. So this,
this narrative persists.

66
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,920
Then you see it all the actions I
mentioned before and all the organizations

67
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,970
saying we're doing the right thing. And I
got to say like we're living in, I mean,

68
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:38,820
I feel like we're looking at the doorway
to the nightmare dystopia of, yeah, I, I,

69
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,660
I just want to clarify like, uh, I don't,

70
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,730
I don't know if we're going
around and saying we're,

71
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,680
we're necessarily doing the right thing.

72
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,960
We're saying why we're doing
what we're doing. Right? Right.

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,830
That's what we need to get better at.

74
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,940
And I don't want to hide behind
what we believe is like the,

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,091
the right thing.

76
00:03:55,091 --> 00:04:00,091
We have to clearly rationalize why we're
making the decision we're making and

77
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,120
more of that.
That's,

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,650
that to me is the prevention from
snowflake avalanche metaphor. Well, but,

79
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:10,030
but I think it's just obvious to
point out, again, I said this before,

80
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,190
we can have the calm conversation
and I can understand you,

81
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,260
but for where I'm from,
where I'm sitting,

82
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,040
you hold a vastly different ideology
than I do and you have substantially more

83
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,980
power and controlling my government.
That terrifies me. And what's,

84
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,580
what makes it worse is that
a Saudi prince, uh, as,

85
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,200
as it was reported that Saudi prince
owns a portion of that company.

86
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:29,680
So I'm sitting here like, just a little
American, can't do anything to stop it.

87
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,850
I'm just watching this unaccountable
machine churn away and you're just one

88
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,760
snowflake in an avalanche. All these
other companies are as well. And I'm like,

89
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,990
well, here we go. This
is going to be a ride.

90
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,290
That's if it just said that Saudi
princes doesn't have any influence,

91
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,540
but am I supposed to trust that that's
the, that's the issue, right? I'm not,

92
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,660
I'm not trying to insinuate he's shown
up to your meetings and telling you what

93
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,430
to do, but when someone dumps $1 billion
a year company, I think it's silly to,

94
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,950
to imply that they don't at least have
some influence, but, but regardless,

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,470
and unlike the Internet
within a company like ours,

96
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:00,040
you don't necessarily see the protocol.
You don't see the, the processes. And,

97
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,670
and that's just an area where we can
do a lot much later, I guess, you know,

98
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,350
beat it over the head a
million times. It'd be the dead
horse. I think ultimately,

99
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,720
yeah, I get what you're
doing. I think it's wrong.

100
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,410
I think it's terrifying and I
think we're looking, we're slow,

101
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,060
we're on the avalanche
already has happened and where
we're heading down to this

102
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,720
nightmare scenario of the future where
it terrifies me when I see people who

103
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:23,170
claim to be supporting liberal ideology,
burning signs that say free speech,

104
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,940
threatening violence against other people.

105
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
You have these journalists
who do the same thing.

106
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,540
They accuse everybody of being a Nazi,

107
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,500
everybody of being a fascist Joe Rogan
and you're like, you're like a socialist.

108
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,350
As far as I know, you're
like ubi proponent. You know,

109
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,170
I wouldn't necessarily say much
so I'm very, I'm being facetious.

110
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,020
I'm because of liberal
except for second amendment.

111
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,690
That's probably the only thing that
I disagree with a lot of liberals.

112
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,440
And then you see what the media says about
everybody and you see how they called

113
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,410
Jordan Peterson all day and night.
Alt Right, alt right hates him. And,

114
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,570
and this narrative is used to strip
people of their income to remove them from

115
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,740
public discourse.
And it's foolish because it ultimately,

116
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,070
upon examination,

117
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,220
like you were saying, that sunlight
is the best disinfection. Absolutely.

118
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,400
Upon examination,
you realize that this is not true at all,

119
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,690
and that these people look foolish. Like
the date in society, uh, article, no, no.

120
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,110
Know all these organizations published
that as fact without looking at any data.

121
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,040
Maybe some did, but anybody, but
yeah, man, no, no, no, no, no.

122
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,350
They still tiding up millions
and millions of people who's,

123
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,250
who are these people that are
still siding it? Guardian. Well,

124
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,430
clients start yelling shame,
but so, so, so look foolish.
