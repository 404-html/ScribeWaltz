1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,980
Should've thrown a knee. Did you watch
the chocolate? They'll fight. Uh,

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,130
just the end of it. Yeah. No good. Right.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,470
How old is he now? 50. Yeah. So
there's hope for me. Oh wait.

4
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:18,490
He lost ships. Well, you've never
been knocked out the way he's,

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,030
he's been knocked out so many times.
I don't think I've ever been knocked out.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,830
Not In the gym. Not over flash.
Flash knockdown. That's it. Yeah.

7
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,910
I've had concussions been knocked out
from like falling and the rain falling off

8
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:33,860
a second floor landing when I was a kid.
Right.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,510
But in finding and never
[inaudible] chucks also,

10
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,430
I think there was an issue with his style
because his style was so aggressive,

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,280
aggressive that people
could just set, set, set,

12
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:49,220
boom and counter like
Rashad Evans did with him.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,700
And so you're getting his momentum
coming forward and the Cheyenne,

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
we get flat line. He doesn't
change. No, he doesn't.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,180
No evolve.

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:04,670
He had a style that was incredibly
affective back in the day.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,330
Yeah. I think he became
married to that, that approach.

18
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,150
You know the approach that works so
well on Bob Ballou so well on Tito.

19
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:15,590
In the early fights,
he was just a marauder.

20
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:18,620
You could hit him in the face of the
fucking crow bar and he would just spit

21
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:22,670
metal out at you. You didn't give a
fuck. He was so bad ass back in the day.

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,870
He relied on that so much. I
remember all the Mohawks. Yeah.

23
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,570
Everybody was a little kid. Yeah.
That's how I like to wear Mohawks.

24
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:30,111
Back in the day,

25
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,980
people were getting in Japanese symbols
tattooed on their head because of him.

26
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just,
that's that style. There's,

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,400
this comes a certain point in time. You
just can't do that anymore. You know?

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,790
I think, um, I dunno,

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,820
like it's a martial
artist, you know, and, uh,

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,630
artists evolve and they're like,
oh, well let me try this new paint.

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,500
Oh, let me try the,
this, this new technique.

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,730
Let me try this shading. Let me, you
know, start sculpting. Let me try.

33
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,180
And I think with, uh,
especially MMA, you know,

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,280
there's so much opportunity
to evolve, just add new, new,

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,910
new nuances to you as an artist. I mean,
I think that's what I love about it.

36
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,870
There's certainly is, yes. But
one thing that does happen when,

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,000
when guys try to add a lot of things,

38
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:24,890
like sometimes they'll try to like say
a wrestler will add a bunch of things to

39
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:27,590
his repertoire,
but then they stopped with the wrestling.

40
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,930
The wrestling is not as sharp and so then
when they go up against a really good

41
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:35,230
wrestler,
they falter and then they're,

42
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,270
they don't have what brought them to the
dance and the first place. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,530
But I think that's just, uh, looking at
your opponent and what's in front of you.

44
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:45,830
And also like being honest
with yourself and like,

45
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,830
like right now I'm looking at
getting back into fighting.

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,680
And if I didn't feel the sharpness,
I didn't,

47
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,290
I didn't feel the fire
and not just the fire.

48
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,800
If I didn't physically feel the sharpness,
if I didn't feel the reflexes,

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,420
I'd have to be honest myself
and say, okay, don't do this.

50
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,570
Do you think that you were Oh,

51
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,590
100% be capable of being rational and
objective about what you can do right now?

52
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,610
Yeah. Yeah, because I don't, I don't
fight for participation awards.

53
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,670
Like, Hey, I'm a, but there's
some UFC fighters are like,
I'm a UFC fighter. Right.

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,290
Yay. I've made it. Like that's not
really making it. You're just another,

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,060
you know, like say I'm a world champion.
I'm a the best in the world. Emma that's,

56
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,990
I'm a UFC fighter is like a
participation metal basically like level.

57
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,670
It shows that you're a
very high level fighter.

58
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,590
You're not a champion in your eyes.
You and champion.

59
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,230
That is what's important.
You want to be the queen.

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,680
You want to be a top of the hill. We went
to the best of your best self, you know,

61
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:50,280
self. Yeah, yeah.
