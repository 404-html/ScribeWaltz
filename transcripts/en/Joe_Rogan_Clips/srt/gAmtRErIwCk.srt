1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,770
For every, every day. They're always,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,550
it's just finding out how to do
hard things is usually useful.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,403
The model,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,590
and it wasn't just the Higgs Boson
particle that you guys had discovered.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,760
What is cork glue on plasma.
Yeah. So that, that's, um,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,600
shortly after the billionth of
a second after the big banks,

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,830
you end up with a supervisor,

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,800
quarks and gluons quarks and the building
blocks of protons and neutrons and

9
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:27,540
gluons are the things
that stick them together.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,490
And so a proton has to up quarks and down
Clark and an eagerness to down quarks

11
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,670
and up quark and so on, so that the
constituents, the protons and neutrons,

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,750
which of the constituents of
our atomic nuclei, um, savy go,

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,330
if you get to very high
temperatures are high energies,

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,670
then the protons and
neutrons faults a bits,

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,570
then you end up with a
soup of quarks and gluons.

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,640
And that's a quiet gluon plasma. And
it's insanely dense, right? Yeah. Well,

17
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:56,910
very high energy. So, um, so you get that.

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,160
So we've been exploring
that bite cause we don't,

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,900
we don't only collide protons
together. We can collide, uh,

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,240
lead nuclei together or Silver
Nuclei together at the LAC.

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,460
And that's when you make these kind of
soups of nuclear matter, if you like,

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,140
very hot and nuclear matter to explore
that physics, that nuclear physics.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,250
Wow. And I was reading something
about the, the weight of,

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,050
of that stuff that like a sugar cube.
Like what,

25
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,310
what is the, what does the actual weight,
well, it depends. Our dense is that said,

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,370
don't they? I mean, they were,

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,230
the thing I remember is it the sugar cube
of a neutron star material, which is,

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,530
I don't know how many hundred million
tons. I can't really, you know, the,

29
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:44,250
it depends. So I don't know
where the quite Glen plasma,

30
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,180
I don't know what number you're,

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,230
there was something that was one
of the things after the discovery,

32
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:54,231
they were talking about the massive
weight of Cork gluon plasma and were like,

33
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,960
almost incomprehensible. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't know the number, but,

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,940
but something crazy. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Now one, once these,

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,620
you got something, Oh, here
it is. 40 billion. Oh my God.

36
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:11,190
A cubic centimeter. Woodway
40 billion tons. Oh,

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,050
good Lord. I didn't know that.
I know David actually again.

38
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,600
Again. Yeah. The dentist matter
created in the big bang machine.

39
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,410
What are they doing right now?
It's um,

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,160
close for engineering and upgrades
and upgrades. Yeah. I mean,

41
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:30,240
one thing we're trying to do is,

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,350
one of the things in particle physics
is that you want as many collisions per

43
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:39,330
second as you can generate and then they,
we have a collision.

44
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,390
We have a, what's called a
bunch crossing LHC. We can vary,

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,070
but it's something like 25 nanoseconds
depending on what to say. It's really,

46
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,750
we get a lot of collisions per second and
the more collisions per second you can

47
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,584
get,

48
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,490
the more chance you have in make an
interest in things like Higgs particles or

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,590
whatever else may be out there
waiting to be discovered. I mean,

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,730
it's possible there are other particles
out there that we haven't yet discovered

51
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,530
that could be within the reach of the LHC.

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,850
And if this one that was in Texas had
gotten built and it was more powerful than

53
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:14,350
the, than the LHC, you'd have even more
opportunity to do something like that.

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,760
Yeah. Now when these things are
created by these collisions,

55
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,500
how long do they last?
Oh, fractions of a second.

56
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,450
So that the general rule in physics,
in particle physics is that they're,

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,660
the more massive it is and the
more things it can decay into,

58
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,680
the faster it'll do that.
So basically the,

59
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,110
the heavy things decay into light things.
And so the only,

60
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,420
the stable particles are
things like electrons. Um,

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,660
and some of the quarks, the quarks
and down quarks is stable things.

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,140
But uh, so, so everything
tends to decay very fast.

63
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,050
So we're talking fractioned
billions of a second fractions.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,970
And how are they less than that?

65
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,530
How are they registering it's
existence? Like what is, uh,

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,030
what is being used to measure it?
So what you see if you collide the,

67
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,260
at Aaic, we collide protons together in
president's got loads of stuff in them,

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,730
loads, ugly ones and the quarks. So
you got a big mess, first of all.

69
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,350
So most of it's a load of particles or
spray. Now we should not interested in.

70
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,850
But sometimes when you,

71
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,200
when let's say a couple of the glue on
this bang together and they can make

72
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:27,880
something interesting like a top quark
or a Higgs particle, what's a top quark?

73
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,170
I saw quite, it's a very heavy, there's
six quarks. There's up and down chairman,

74
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,500
strange bottom and top
US harm and strange.

75
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,540
So strange was literally in the, was
it the fifties I, we discovered them.

76
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,570
Someone said that's really strange and
strange and you kind of farcical and so

77
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:48,850
that, yeah, so we have six quarks
and they're in three families.

78
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,300
So the up and down or one
family and then the chairman,

79
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,880
stranger and other family in the
top and bottom of the third family.

80
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,670
And so we for some reason,
so the only thing,

81
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,140
the only festivals we need to make up,

82
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,930
you and me are up quarks
down quarks and electrons.

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,360
But for some reason there are two further
copies of those which are identical in

84
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,710
every way except they're heavier.

85
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,790
So there's the charm and the strange
quark and if they're in a heavy electron

86
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,000
called a on and then as a the
tough and the bottom quark.

87
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,600
And another happy electron call the tail.
And that's it.

88
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,830
So that there's this weird pattern
that we don't understand. So we don't,

89
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,510
seems like you only needed the
first family to build a universe.

90
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,110
Right. But because some reason
there are two copies now signed.

91
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,280
The heavy ones decane to the lighter
ones is the point. So when you make them,

92
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,280
they're not around very long
as just answer your question.

93
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,290
What happens is that when they decay,

94
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:45,050
they throw their decay products
out into ad detector. So we,

95
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:50,051
we take a photograph of the cascade of
particles that comes from these heavier

96
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,920
particles decaying. And the trick
is to patch it all, look to see,

97
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:57,950
to try and work out where
everything came from. Wow.

98
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,240
Now when they five find
these unexpected particles,

99
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,010
then what happens? Then there's the
study of them. Then there's the, yeah,

100
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,800
and everybody gets together and go,
okay, what the hell is that? Yeah.

101
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,950
What is that and what do we do? So we
want to know where the Higgs particle,

102
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,040
we know what he does,
which is it gives mass to everything.

103
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,840
So it's fundamentally the thing that
gives mass to all the other things in the

104
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:25,790
universe at the most fundamental
level. So, so electrons for example,

105
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,860
and the up and down quarks.

106
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,010
And again I mass from their
interaction with the Higgs,

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,340
that's why they're massive. That's
another reason we exist. You know,

108
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:38,120
we go ray back and we wouldn't exist
if there wasn't mass in the universe.

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,020
And the Higgs is ultimately
responsible for that mass.

110
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,940
And I keep saying,

111
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:48,110
I keep caveat in it because then you get
other sorts of mass that are generated,

112
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:51,950
but, but that the fundamental
basic seed as it were,

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,580
is from is from the Higgs.
Um,

114
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,380
so what we want to know is we want to
know how that thing behaves and the way,

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,480
so you want to study it.

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,020
So you want to make a lot of them so
you can say a lot of pictures of it and

117
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,070
study a lot and say exactly how he does
that. And so that's what we're doing.

118
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,840
That's what we're
engaged in at the moment.

119
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:13,670
We're making high precision measurements
of the way that particle behaves so we

120
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,990
can understand the laws of nature.
I mean that that is the laws of nature.

121
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,390
How are those popsicles behaving
and what are they doing.
