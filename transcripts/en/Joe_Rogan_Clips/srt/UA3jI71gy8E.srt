1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,980
Um,

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,380
out of all the years you've been doing
your show and all the years you've been

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:09,240
given advice. Ha. How did
this catch me outside girl?

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,220
How did this happen?
All good.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,530
I know all the different shows.
But you made a monster. Uh, no,

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,120
I mean it's my moment of
infinity. No, seriously.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,370
This girl comes home with her mother and
her mother actually brings her own of

8
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:28,641
course.

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:33,641
And she's a train wreck and we work with
her and we send her to this ranch for

10
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,830
like four months.
Right.

11
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,290
She goes for a long time and
makes a complete turnaround,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,940
does a really a great job.
They say she's become a leader.

13
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:49,400
She's working with all these
girls doing a great job.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,360
And then she graduates and I remember
this last shot when we do this,

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,490
this piece at the ranch,

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,090
she jumps up on this fence and is smiling
and everything and waving it all one

17
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:08,120
night home with her mother one night.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,540
And her mother's finding people that
are trashing her, the mother on, on uh,

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,200
the social media platforms. Her mother
tracks him down, backs into who they are,

20
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:22,430
gets their phone numbers, calls
him up, yelling into the phone,

21
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:25,640
calling them names and stuff,
gets the daughter involved,

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,650
one night crashes.
So they come back for a followup like,

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:35,480
I don't know, month or two later.
And when they come I say, okay,

24
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,580
we're going to have him back. They walk
out, I have the audience completely empty.

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,560
I have nobody there to play
too. I mean, 250 chairs, empty,

26
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,830
nobody in the house, but me, the mother
and the daughter, that's a good move.

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,750
And they go, whoa, where
is everybody's? Well,

28
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:57,470
you don't need anybody. We're just here
to talk and you know, keep things rolling.

29
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,750
Right. And they were dumbstruck, they,

30
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,500
there was nobody there
to showboat for play too.

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,360
And there's like a 15 minute interview.
They had nothing to say. And off they go.

32
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:13,361
And then this phrase
that got turned into a,

33
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,690
you know, whatever, a meme
or whatever they call it, um,

34
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,090
it just went crazy.

35
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:23,580
And what she was nominated for a grammy or

36
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,620
Siri. I'm serious. Uh,

37
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,420
so I'm, I take no credit or blame. I,

38
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,970
you know, I just did what I could and
haven't seen her saying, I wish everybody,

39
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,610
well maybe she'll turn so
maybe it'll grow her up.

40
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:42,720
She'll turn some paucity valve. But I
hope so. Well that's a very good attitude.

41
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,020
Very healthy attitude for you. But it
is when something goes viral like that,

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,880
something strange that for whatever
reason it catches and takes off. It's,

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,150
it doesn't make any sense. It's a
very weird thing. It makes no sense.

44
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:59,590
She's on a billboard on sunset, a
giant billboard. Oh really? Huge.

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,210
Enormous billboard.

46
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:04,500
It's like one of those sides of the
building billboards where they, you know,

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,390
they put the graphic up and
it covers the entire building.

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,140
It makes no sense. Seriously. Seriously.

49
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,110
And there's people curing cancer and
you can't find him with both hands.

50
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,490
Exactly. Nobody has any idea who won
the last Nobel Prize for science,

51
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,920
but you know, more power to her. I, if,

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,010
if she can turn into something
positive that she have talent.

53
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,510
Have you ever heard any of her music now?

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,890
I have no idea. I've either seen
her on your show. Thank you.

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,480
I appreciate you bringing that up.
Sorry.

56
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:41,330
But it's just so strange that one
train wreck could for whatever reason,

57
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,180
catch on and then all of
a sudden it's gigantic.

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:45,361
Yeah.

59
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:49,350
They say that somebody signed her and
paid her millions of dollars seriously.

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
Like

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,080
close to a million dollars from
a makeup company. Really? Yeah.

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,050
Oh, well, okay. There you go. I
mean, if that's happening, right,

63
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,740
like what would your advice be
then? Would your advice be, Hey,

64
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,370
get your shit together and
stop being crazy? Well,

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,960
she's making a lot of money off of being
crazy and her opportunities before that

66
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,460
were probably severely limited.

67
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,460
Well, they had to be. And
what I hope now that this,

68
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,760
even though this certainly is a quirk,

69
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,300
what I hope now is that she's surrounded
by mature people with business heads on

70
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:31,631
their shoulders and development people
that will actually guide this in a way

71
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:36,530
that it's not 15 minutes. Yeah. You
never know. You know? That's what I hope.

72
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:36,841
Well,

73
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,050
everybody thought the Kardashians are
going to be 15 minutes and it's been 15

74
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:40,510
years.

75
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,030
Yeah. But there's been, you know,

76
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,570
people make fun of them and there's
some good things here to make fun of.

77
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,500
They do things to be made fun of.

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,090
But there's also from very smart business
and branding that's gone into that as

79
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:55,460
well.

80
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,660
Oh, 100%. And you know,

81
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,780
and I was actually very impressed with
her that she actually went to the White

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,870
House to talk about prison reform for
people that are unjustly accused and are

83
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,240
being been in jail for too long
for things that they didn't do.

84
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,000
And that's something
she's actually passionate.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,210
Yeah. And I know Kim and she's
actually a very nice girl,

86
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:17,150
very smart and all.
And as I say,

87
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,600
they've done some very brilliant
branding and it's certainly paid off.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,720
It's just so fascinating when something
catches like that girl, what is her name?

89
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,643
The catch man of science?

90
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,700
Uh, Danielle goalie or
something? Yeah. Yeah.

91
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,360
Cause I didn't know her
as the catch me outside,

92
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,970
but if she didn't say that one phrase.

93
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,310
Yeah.

94
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,820
And she just said that I think to her
grandmother or somebody in the audience.

95
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,380
I know it didn't even register
with us at the time. Wow. It was,

96
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,820
it wasn't a standout phrase in the
interview or anything. It just pass by.

97
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,730
Somebody just grabbed it and,
and then it became a meme. Yeah.

98
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,870
What a weird world we
live in. Yeah, no kidding.
