1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,710
The casinos in Vegas or they're,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,570
they're probably gonna
want to do this fight next.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,110
That's where they want it because they
want all that extra gambling money in

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:11,250
restaurant money and show money. Right.
That's where I would likely, I would,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,870
I would say it's likely gonna wind up,
you know, got a lot of places, you know,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,010
I wouldn't mind going back to
New York as well, garden me,

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,970
you know, you got so many
diverse people there, you know,

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,570
a lot of people look at travels and
stuff like that, you know, all those,

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,370
it'd be busy and stuff. You
know, people want it still
to be easy access. He, Vegas,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,220
Vegas makes it easy for
people because you know,

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:38,280
the airport is right there and then five
minutes away you're on the Strip and

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,420
that's what most of the people be
at and stuff. But you know, we're,

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,780
we'll see when the time comes.
You know, I'm open for any, any,

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:49,640
any place you go when you guys
talking about a rematch maybe, uh,

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,130
we're looking at April, May, June,
somewhere up in there, you know, and uh,

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,160
we'll see what happens. I'm
excited though. You know,
he said he back in the gym,

17
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,240
he t he hit me up.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,160
He sent me a video saying how you
back in the gym and stuff like that.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,700
And I just hit back him.

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,220
Likewise because it's crazy because his
mindset is being back in the gym and

21
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:13,620
mine's is the same way. You know, I been,

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,450
I been traveling a lot talking about this
fight. Like it's been like I'm already,

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,190
you know, it in discussion with
certain outlets or whatever.

24
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:26,600
It's like we've been boosting up this
net, this rematch fight. Like it's, it's,

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,890
it's almost here.
It's been crazy though.

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,240
This is what my career needed as well
too, you know? Um, so I don't mind,

27
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:36,960
I'd been from La to New York.
I'm just getting from New York now.

28
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm back here and now offering
to go to my original home time.

29
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,430
I got some things I got to do out
there, enjoy the, the holidays.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,110
I'm going to take a vacation with my
family and then once I get back on back

31
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,510
into the gym myself. Well, boxing fans,

32
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,340
hardcore boxy fans
already knew who you are,

33
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,490
but this was the breakthrough
fight for the general public.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,990
This is a breakthrough fight where people
know about it now and the next fight.

35
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,430
The rematch.
First of all,

36
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,820
you couldn't ask for a better dance
partner when it comes to promotion.

37
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:09,150
I mean Tyson's fantastic on
the microphone. He's hilarious.
Got that great accent,

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,680
listen to him talk.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,910
So you guys promoting this and getting
ready for whenever that April, May, June,

40
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:16,200
whenever it takes place.
I mean,

41
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,480
this is going to be probably one
of the biggest heavyweight fights,

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,280
if not the biggest of all time. Man, I'm
just so excited. You know what I mean?

43
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,070
Because I can see,
I can visualize it now.

44
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,280
I couldn't really visualize
how big this could become.

45
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,660
I knew it was going to be big, but you
just don't know how people are. You know,

46
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,200
people are funny, especially, you know,

47
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,850
people always have things
to do, you know? Nailed it.

48
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,020
There was nothing else competing with you.
There's nothing else there to watch.

49
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,560
It was perfect. It was a perfect
storm and then it was in Atlanta,

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,630
so stars came out. It was a
big deal, man. It was amazing.

51
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:55,500
And I'll never forget it, you
know. Excuse me. Like I said,

52
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,560
I've been waiting for this. I've been
waiting for that moment for so you know,

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,910
they don't have this problem in the
UK because no matter, no matter what,

54
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,130
they love boxing.
It's the second nature of sport.

55
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:10,090
They don't have college sports and
professional sports that they had to deal

56
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,990
with boxes. Like I said, they're
second nature of sport and you know,

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,220
Eh, you know, they don't have as
many as people we have here to here.

58
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,780
Like what made me 66 million, something
like that. Uh, Alabama and Mississippi,

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,280
they can fit UK in Alabama and
Mississippi combining them together,

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,650
but they can fit the whole state
and in Texas and still have space,

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,840
which over here we got so much.

62
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,860
We got how many colleges and
professional sports and you know,

63
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:43,640
boxing is like probably the
last sport, you know, on the
list. You know, I probably,

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,580
you know,
exaggerating with that a little bit,

65
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,370
but it definitely seemed like
that we definitely, you know,

66
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,640
in the back and there's so
much to compete with. It's so,

67
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:55,210
it's so hard here to do it.
And then when you, when you,

68
00:03:55,211 --> 00:04:00,140
when you finally get that shine, you know,
that's where it comes from. You know,

69
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,190
when a minute, and when you're
in it and you understand it,

70
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,140
it's like how it's so hard.
It was to get it to get to this point,

71
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,430
you know, down there 11 years
and like to get to this point.

72
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,690
And then when you finally get
here is like, you were here.
