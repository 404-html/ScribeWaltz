1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,370
Hello Freak bitches. When are we
going to Musso and Frank's? Oh yeah.

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,170
We got to keep talking about
how we do keep doing that.

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:09,810
We should do that before a set
up the store one night. Yeah,

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:13,890
let's do that as the move. Like gentlemen.
Yeah. Should we wear suits? Yes.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,210
100%. Yeah. Can I have the
lighter please? I have a suit now.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,520
You do? Yeah. And I get a suit for a
school function for my kid. Oh really?

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,330
What do you mean? What kind of
question one? I always have one, um,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,330
that I wear for the UFC, right? Yeah.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,960
But the UFC one stays at the EOC so
that I don't have to do anything.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,220
I just go there. That's smart.
I like a nice suit. Okay.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,810
He just looked good. Do you wear a
pocket square? Always look good. Now.

12
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:47,170
When I hosted this TV show I did. Yeah.
It was always a pocket square idea. Yeah.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,430
They made me, they forced that useless
piece of cloth. Right. There is a funny,

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,990
and I know when you need a tourniquet,

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,530
it was a little pocket square and a
Madonna came in to do the show and uh,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,950
the whole building was like electric.

17
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:03,390
It was like Madonna is coming
and it really was like energy.

18
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,300
Like you could feel energy in the building
because Madonna was walking into your

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,550
color Madonna. So I came
in. Yeah. And I was like,

20
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:11,160
I got to go meet her before the show
or I'm going to be too freaked out.

21
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,570
So I just walked into the dressing room
and I'm like, Hi Madonna. I'm, I'm Tom.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,340
She's like, nice to see you. She walks
up, she goes, this has got to go.

23
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:23,420
And she took the pocket
square out and tossed.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,230
It was like, that's it. I'm not
wearing it. This Guy Ritchie,

25
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,350
her ex husband is a proponent
of the Pocket Square Guy
Ritchie was on my podcast

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,230
talking about the importance of
the suit and had about square.

27
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,440
That's hilarious. Cause she
immediately, I just met her two seconds.

28
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:46,110
She whipped it out of my and
tossed it there. Yeah, she was,

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,330
it's a little kid. A young Tom Papa at
face, son of a bitch. Yeah. Look at that.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,190
Mr. Steal your girl. You fucking
do. I read a lot different now.

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,370
Barber shop. Do I look from that
shot? It'd be honest or what

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,590
we might to Delhi. You gained a couple
pounds. Are you making delicious bread?

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,610
I am. Did a Ricky Gervais' laugh
hard at everything. Uh Huh.

34
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,010
This is move.
It seems like a jolly fellow,

35
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,770
especially when Jerry said it. Yeah, it's
good move. Yeah. I always make Jerilyn.

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,960
Ah,
say it louder.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,793
Okay.

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:31,670
Yeah.
