1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,070
I've never seen anything like,
um, maybe um, maybe a prime Roy.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,300
Yeah. You know, maybe it was different
too because it was technically awful.

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,390
He just had such reflex when they went,

4
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:17,310
that's when he got melted because,
because he never, he didn't jab.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,090
No, he didn't do anything. Right.
Brown took a lead, lead left hawk.

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:25,640
What rights from weird angles and it
worked cause his reflexes were superhuman.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,850
He was superman and then as soon as
they deteriorated a little bit and in

8
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,690
fighting you can deteriorate a little bit.
In baseball you're going to tear.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,190
Got Roy would really got Roy my opinion.
I'm a giant Roy Jones Jr fan.

10
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,350
He's my maybe one of my
all time favorite fighters.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,100
What really got Roy is when we went up
to fight genre wheeze and then he went

12
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:47,430
back down Tarver he was depleted,
depleted.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,430
And I think when he went up to fight Ruiz,

14
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:53,910
he might've had some Mexican supplements
in the system. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

15
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,610
Sure. Yeah. I mean he was like 200 and
plus pounds overweight or something.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,620
Look good. I think he should have
retired after that one. Well,

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,310
he definitely should have consulted with
an endocrinologist to try to figure out

18
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,870
what,
how his system was.

19
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,640
And then the weight cut down to one 75
must have been brutal cause he was smooth.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,260
He looked like shit. He
lost all his muscle tone. He
just didn't, he looked like,

21
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:18,810
and he was shredded in the 90s exactly.
Yeah.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,160
He looked like a guy who's system had
been shut down with the thing that these

23
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:28,050
guys don't maybe don't recognize if they
take some shit or if they, you know,

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,640
even if you just cut too much weight,
your body stops producing hormones. Sure.

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,760
Your body is all fucked up. You're
on, you're on your way to die.

26
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:38,180
Your body is telling you what
the fuck are you doing now?

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,140
So if he was 200 plus
pounds when he fought Ruiz,

28
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,700
then he has to cut down to one 75 30.
Yeah.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,570
And who knows how sophisticated
his methods were. I mean,

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,170
some fighters today are
amazing at doing that. I mean,

31
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,170
they know how to do it correctly.
They know how to rehydrate correctly.

32
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,680
And boxing at least has the,
um,

33
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,910
the benefit of not having Usada
in place like the UFC does.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,180
The UFC has a real problem with a lack
of Ivs and these guys can't rehydrate

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,320
correctly or the way that they want
to. It is dangerous. It is dangerous.

36
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:14,820
But in their defense,
it's,

37
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,880
it's also a way that they can detect a
whether or not someone's cheating. Okay.

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,580
Cause when they're using ivs, you
can mask a lot of shit. Right? Yeah.

39
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,090
I didn't think about that. Yeah.
That's why they do it. Okay. Yeah.

40
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,190
They just won't let you do it.
So when,

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,980
I don't know what happened with Roy
when he did put it in. You're not,

42
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,690
can't take anything
away from Tarver either.

43
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,760
Cause Tarver almost beat Roy
the first time you fought,

44
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,800
but then fucked him up second
fucking fluids head. Yeah.

45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,060
And the famous words, any excuses
died, Roy, right before they fight you.

46
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,590
Anything like that? He was so confident.
I don't think he gets his due either. No,

47
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:54,330
he doesn't. He doesn't. He, uh, he had
some great wins. He had some great wins.

48
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,860
Um, he's still at it too, right?
[inaudible] something like 46,

49
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:02,980
47 he got popped for steroids. Yeah. So,

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,670
well Duh.
If you're 45 and he's still looking good,

51
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,570
there's something going on. The only,
the only person I truly believe in,

52
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,750
I realize you'll, you'll think I'm
biased because of where I'm from,

53
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,340
but I don't think Bernard
ever did anything.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
I don't think you did anything either.

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,860
Bernard just lives clean
and I've seen him, uh,

56
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,430
order grilled chicken and get chicken
that was fried by accident and peel the

57
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:28,470
fry off of it rather than just go,
oh, just this once. I'll do it. Right.

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,810
Watched him take it off to just, you
know what I mean? To not eat that.

59
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,900
It's just insane. Dietary
in the gym, you know,

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,760
I agree. But the Joe Smith fight was sad
to watch. Of course. That was, that was,

61
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:47,080
uh, the Kovalev fight was
sad. I was ringside man.

62
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:51,550
I love Kovalev but it's, you
know, affiliate legend like,

63
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,490
ah man, this is rough. You know,

64
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:58,390
it's crazy to see how deep into his
career he was still successful. Like,

65
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,590
I wrote a blog article about the
Kelly Pavlik fight cause I'm like,

66
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,210
I don't remember how
old he was at the time,

67
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,620
but everybody had
already written them off.

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,610
My brother and I were there like Publix
is going to beat the dog shit I've been

69
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,340
on.
And he gave him a fucking lesson lesson.

70
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,910
He put on a clinic where people have
to realize he was technically passed.

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,840
His fight is primary fucked up. Tito
Trinidad. It was 36 yeah, that's,

72
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,160
it was 36 and 2001 that was two weeks
after nine 11 that fight and he was 36

73
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:28,630
that how crazy is that? Yeah. What
was he when he fought Joe Smith?

74
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,630
50 50 maybe.

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,980
Maybe 51 definitely 50
crazy. So he was, he,

76
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,750
I say he lasted 15 years longer than,
than the average guy,

77
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,520
you know. Well how about when he came
back and boxed Roy Junior? Yeah. Well Roy,

78
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,730
when Roy beat him the first time it was
beaten him with all those reflexes and

79
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,020
then when the reflex is slid off,

80
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,390
clearly I'll with just
fundamentals. Yes, perfect.

81
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,680
Mccann's Roya didn't have them.
He didn't have them. Yeah,

82
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,030
just relying on what was once
there. Yeah, but it wasn't,

83
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:03,640
he was a shell of him for his,
of his former itself. Well,

84
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:07,750
it was also the Glen Johnson fight was a
scary knock out. He was on Queer Street.

85
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:07,930
Yeah.

86
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,490
Well he was just flatlined and astral
traveling after the got knocked out by

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,850
Tarver. Yeah. Then there was not that
much time in between those two fights. No,

88
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,360
it was just, it was the next
fight. Yeah. Yeah, and he and that,

89
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,810
those knockouts where you are,

90
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,860
you're out on your feet before you hit
the ground and your head hits the canvas,

91
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:31,480
which is two shots and he was stiffened
up. It was sad to watch. It was. It was.

92
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,940
That was really, I thought that
was going to be the end to me too.

93
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,570
And then he started fighting like
in Russia, sanctioned over there.

94
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,980
And he's a Russian citizen. Yes ma'am.
Bizarro world Russian pussy involved.

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,840
He's got to have some total
over there, man, to do that.

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,880
When you're talking about Larry Holmes.
I looked up his Wikipedia.

97
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:53,620
His last fight was in 2002
butter bean is 51 or so,

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,580
and he put it on butter bean
10 round fight. That's crazy.

99
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:03,460
And Corey Potter being can crack
that big motherfucker hit hard. Hard.

100
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,450
But Larry, just that snake, that snake and
I, you're not getting through that. Yeah.

101
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,380
Pop.
Every time he tries to come in and bunk.

102
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,900
I remember that when due to where those
golden Palestine was the first person he

103
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,770
did it and the Tito fight man. It was that
the first, yeah. Yeah. That was so weird.

104
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,840
Someone did it in the UFC too. They wore
that shit on their back. It's odd. Yeah.

105
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,880
Put it on your trunk. So you're
going to do it, I guess. Wow.

106
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,310
You don't get as much
money, but it's, it is.

107
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,490
I Know Bernard got 50 k to put on his
back and he bet on himself against Tito

108
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,450
real. Yeah. And you know, he was
a huge underdog. Everyone dial.

109
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,980
Everyone thought Tito was gonna whoop
his ass. Everyone. Everyone there wasn't.

110
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,880
You know,
I was jumping off my brother's couch.

111
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,300
Yeah. He fucked him up. Yeah, man.
Yeah. Bernard was a special athlete.

112
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:54,770
He really was absolutely special fight all
time. Great. For sure. Yeah, definitely.

113
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,633
Yeah.

114
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,330
And it was interesting because I used
to watch him when he was in his thirties

115
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,760
and he would complain about crooked
promoters and all these things.

116
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,600
And my thought was, man, it's too bad.
This guy like missed his prime. Right.

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,720
And then he did what he did and then
he did what he did after the after,

118
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,110
cause he got,

119
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,110
he was in jail for like strong arm robbery
and got out and Kinda like wallowed

120
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,040
in obscurity. And then his shot was
that Roy fight, you know, and I,

121
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,270
and we were like, Oh, you got your
shot. I guess that's it. Yeah.

122
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,880
It just got better and better with age.
Just show man.

123
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:27,740
It's like the rarest thing in anything.
