1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,580
Yeah, well everybody feels
like it's somebody else's job.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,820
Everybody feels like work like,
yeah. And everybody feels like, well,

3
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:07,720
you just got to get out
of that neighborhood. No,

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,840
that's what I was supposed to work.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,610
Roxanne Shawntay talked about reentry
vacation. She said, you know, she,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,530
she doesn't want to hear people keep
complaining about gentrification when the

7
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:23,190
kids that are leaving these neighborhoods,
whether they'd sing dance, rap or not,

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,010
or just Cokie good jobs and
Colby decent human beings.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,550
You should be reentering
your neighborhoods.

10
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:32,070
Who should be buying houses or pieces
of land near one of the most impressive

11
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:34,170
things, one of my favorite
players of John Stockton,

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,700
and I'll know if it's true or not,

13
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:39,390
but I read a story that he actually
bought a house right on the street he grew

14
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:42,930
up in. So an Aussie that he'd go
back essentially home with his kids.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,020
So they'd had some type of
normalization to their life. We,

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,100
we should be doing that.
You know, um, Tiana,

17
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:53,100
I have bought properties together in
the same neighborhoods we grew up in,

18
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,710
were developing things
like restaurants and stuff.

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,790
I like to see more athletes or rappers
become the merchant in business class,

20
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:04,380
net weight and I like to see people who
grew up in neighborhoods move back to

21
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:08,640
those neighborhoods they grew up in like
like the typical iconic American dream.

22
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,110
You know, you can build a, you know,

23
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,590
another 8,000 square feet in the back
of the a frame house if you want to,

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,920
but you shouldn't be going to 50 60
minutes outside the city and they

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,710
complaining about the blight of the
city because you took yourself away,

26
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,690
you took the talent
and the resources away.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
Do you think that everyone should feel
that way though? Or is it, I mean,

28
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,550
do you feel like you have to be committed
to the city that you grew up in or

29
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,730
couldn't you want to just get the fuck
out of there and go somewhere different?

30
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:36,120
It's nothing wrong with
getting the fuck out,

31
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,760
but you just think you should go back and
support it. Yeah, it's like I tell kids,

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,980
you know, in college and they say, Mike,
you know, what can we do? You know,

33
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,690
kids and college kids,
when you go speak at a college and say,

34
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,720
well what could we do? Kids want
to affect the world. Very easy.

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,850
Find a kid in high school,

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,940
tutor that kit and make sure to replace
you with this university or another.

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,680
I said, you're just please replanting
a scene. If you grow food, you know,

38
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,170
you don't grow the same land
you have to year after year.

39
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,780
Some you have to give that land a break,
retail it, you know what I'm saying?

40
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,170
And it was kind of like the neighborhood.

41
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,990
So you don't have to stay in the
same neighborhood your whole life.

42
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,540
You don't have to feel like I never
win anything or escaped anywhere.

43
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,350
But you do have to, don't sell
your mother's house, you know,

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,970
rent it to your cousin, you know,
let your younger assistant but don't,

45
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:15,930
don't sell your mother.

46
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,350
That piece of land was worked
for the blood to toil the soil.

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,880
It means something and it should. And,
and for working class people especially,

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,560
it keeps your neighborhood and communities
more like the ones that made you be a

49
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,320
good human being. You know? So
I think that there is something,

50
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,510
most people don't leave the town he grew
up in and moved to the other side or

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,940
they moved to the suburbs for most
people or most people marry somebody they

52
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,670
knew. You know what I'm saying?
My thing is make the best of it.

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,250
Don't let it keep becoming a worse.
A man named Mr John,

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,320
my wife and I own barbershops
or people don't know.

55
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,900
We own these things called
the shea washing room shops.

56
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,540
We have one at state farm arena
that when the Atlanta Hawks play,

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,850
we have our flagship
store on Edgewood Avenue.

58
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,010
Edgewood avenue was once an Auburn Avenue
when wants to centers of black Atlanta

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,330
in terms of commerce and retail and money,

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,700
Atlanta life insurance company with the,
are you guys Google?

61
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,890
Some of this stuff's is big time shit.
You know,

62
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,010
this isn't the old narrative of we've
never had nothing because that's not the

63
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,070
truth and it was a very rich
city for African Americans.

64
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,600
Still is on his street,
used to be owned by African Americans.

65
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,620
The storefronts in there, their
children after these people. Dot. Off,

66
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,640
sold the buildings off and sold it for
cheap. And I know this because many,

67
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,240
Mr John who runs the grocery store, they
are stopped me one day he said, you know,

68
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,074
Michael,

69
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,810
after we're gone and this neighborhood's
been gentrified and everything's

70
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,653
different,

71
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,050
they're going to come along and say
that white people stole this from us.

72
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,650
And he said, that's not true. He say,

73
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:46,480
the children or the people that were here
left and they never came back because

74
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,110
they didn't think what the parent's bill
was good enough. Oh man, to kill me.

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,620
Because that is snatches black
people, less Americans, period.

76
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,180
We have gotten to a point
where we are unappreciative,

77
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,650
we are entitled, and we don't think
what happened before us was good enough.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,070
So we don't treasure it. We don't
honor it. We don't reinvest in it.

79
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,600
That could be a farm in Milledgeville,
that could be a house in Adamsville,

80
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,810
but we have to do a better
job of appreciating ourselves,

81
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:17,500
appreciating our community and income
preciate now greater community and you

82
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:20,320
have to reenter.
You have to reenter fi day.

83
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,010
You have to be a part of
whatever gentrification
happens to make sure that your

84
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,340
stake is still there and net what you
care about from a morals and civil

85
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:31,540
perspective is represented there.
My uncle, my uncle John Blackman,

86
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,710
who's a huge influence on me dad
and had a five car garage where,

87
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,690
where he did transmissions and stuff
and I begged my aunt to sell it,

88
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,860
please, I don't want you, I know they're
going to come. The beltline is coming.

89
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,560
I was, but please sell it to me. I didn't
want my uncle's building, you know,

90
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:52,210
for to go to strangers and become, you
know, an apartment complex or something.

91
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,150
And I walked in your building, not
seen your building. And I said, wow,

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
I know what I'm gonna do with it now.

93
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,290
I've had it for like three years
and now it's just, I just had it,

94
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,570
but I didn't never knew what I
wanted to do. But you would like, Yo,

95
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,300
you need somewhere to go every day you're
building is impressive. I'm like, Yo,

96
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm just going to just make my bit, my
uncle's building, my office is right.

97
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,520
And I figured out a way to make
a lot of money off of it. I mean,

98
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,220
I've already made a lot of money,
which was me and leaving me to buy it.

99
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,330
But it's important to me that as his
neighborhood turns into hipster land,

100
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,000
cause it's definitely going to be,
she's going to be black hips,

101
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,390
going to be like chocolate hipster lands.

102
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,870
I just wanted to make sure that's there
still some chocolate working class in

103
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,730
there and sometimes they're going to
go buy coffee and there's going to be a

104
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:29,410
loud ass muscle car and lots of
marijuana smoke point out of it.

105
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,290
So they'll know that, you know,
my uncle's nephew still in town.
