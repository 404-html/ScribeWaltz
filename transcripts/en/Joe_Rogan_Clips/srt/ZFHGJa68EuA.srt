1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,920
Her low freak bitches saying
that marijuana is a dis,

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,800
like it's,

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:14,801
it's just a destructive fucking drug
that is almost as bad as heroin.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,570
He said that's it.
Was it today or yesterday?

5
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:20,400
I think it was either today or
yesterday that he said, I saw it.

6
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,460
It's hilarious that this guy
is in charge of anything.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,990
Only slightly less awful was his words
only slightly us off of the heroin.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,550
Someone is without a doubt,
if that's what he's expressing.

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,280
Someones without a doubt influencing that.
Like there's,

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,840
there's more than just his opinion
here. This is not these, when these,

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,220
they have these meetings when they're
discussing policy or the discussing how

12
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,180
they proceed.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,260
Like this isn't as simple as this one
wacky dude's opinion and they leave him

14
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,900
alone with his opinion. He has
ultimate power. There's no way.

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,940
There's a bunch of vested interests.

16
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,170
There's a bunch of people that have
tremendous amount of money at stake and

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,430
would lose money if marijuana was legal.
That is 100% why that guy's doing. Sure.

18
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:07,360
But I mean, he, he's, his personal
opinion towards weed has always been like,

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,620
he's like, he can't lie like that.
Like, that's just a fucking lie.

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,920
You don't have any data to show
that that's even remotely true.

21
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,750
Heroin kills fuck loads of people.
People, their bodies are ravaged by it.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,040
Pot doesn't do a goddamn thing to you.
It might make you a little loony. Yeah.

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,950
Just, I mean, like, you know,
it's not even comparable. No.

24
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:30,951
And if you might be schizophrenia exams
where they looked at all the population

25
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,450
and they said, you know, marijuana
contributes to schizophrenia.

26
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:36,150
And they were like, well, no, actually,
no. If you look at the number,

27
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:40,410
it's always 1% and it feels 1% of smoking
pot or non smoking pot. It's still,

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,760
the schizophrenia numbers have always
been around 1%. Yeah. I mean, like,

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,050
it could be exacerbated by marijuana, I'm
sure. But it's not, it doesn't cause it.

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,730
Yeah. I think, um, I don't,
I'm not a brain scientist, nor
are you, are you, you know,

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,060
I had, I've, I've dealt with
schizophrenia. People, you
know them, right? Yeah. Yeah.

32
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,070
I've known a few. It's, um,

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,310
I think it probably varies like
any other kind of mental illness.

34
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,360
But what pisses me off though more than
even like the personal angle of like I'm

35
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,820
a pot smoker and this affects
me personally. I mean,

36
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,470
that does get my goat a little bit,

37
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:14,730
but what really pisses me off
is that a Trump is mr jobs.

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,920
Yeah.
This industry,

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,720
this $7 billion recreational
marijuana industry is employing,

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,700
uh, like a hundred, 150 people. Yeah. Uh,

41
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,740
part time and full time that are
along some rung of the ladder of like,

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,900
oh, well, you know, either they're
working for the growers or there, uh,

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,550
doing the packaging are there
helping with the shipping.

44
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,510
So this is like a huge job creator.
It's a huge money maker.

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,520
This is what Trump ran on. Trump's
like, I'm the jobs president.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,670
I'm going to bring jobs back
if they go after this industry.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,120
That's the exact opposite of bringing jobs
back. That's shutting jobs down. Yeah.

48
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,390
What's shutting jobs down though,

49
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:01,660
with the kind of people that we really
want around the first place? I mean,

50
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,494
they can,

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,190
they can sort of surmise that people
that are running pot shops are probably

52
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:09,970
pretty left wing, you know,
pretty, pretty quickly. Sure.

53
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,060
And so you're making almost, you're
making more money for your opposition,

54
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,600
whereas the pharmaceutical companies,
they, they, they're nonpartisan.

55
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,830
Don't forget the alcohol industry
too. That's true. Both of them.

56
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,430
The prison unions, prison guard
unions. That's what's really crazy.

57
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,040
You find out that prison guard unions
have worked to try to keep marijuana

58
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,240
illegal and you're like,
wow.

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,020
Like what you're really saying is we want
to extract money by putting people in

60
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,280
cages and says,

61
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,770
you're really saying that's what you get
when you do a private prison industry.

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,320
It, I mean, I've done videos about
this fucking private prison industry.

63
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,540
It's crazy. And you know,
I'm always surprised by just
how tap it, the responses.

64
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,750
People are like, Eh, yeah,
whatever. You know, prisoners
who gives a shit. It's like,

65
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,330
yeah, but what about the fact that plenty
of people don't belong to be there?

66
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,320
What about the fact that these people
who run these prison industries sponsor

67
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:59,800
legislation to put more people in
jail in a country that already has the

68
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,670
disproportionately highest
prison population of any
country on the planet while

69
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:06,160
claiming to be the fucking
land of the free. Yeah,

70
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:09,480
we put a fuck load of people
in jail. Tons. They're not,

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,380
I mean it's not just being used for
terrorism and they're using it for this

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,100
through their drug war as well.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's, um,

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,310
the drug war is going to have to ramp
up if this marijuana legalization keeps

74
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,130
kicking in, they're going
to have to figure out some
other way to arrest people.

75
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,320
They have to keep the same jobs.
I mean,

76
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,480
they have a lot of jobs they're
going to have to justify, I mean,

77
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:30,481
Jeff sessions could come to the
pot shops like where I live and,

78
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,640
uh, I guess there's pot
shops around here too and uh,

79
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,970
and they could fucking read them.
They could shut them down. Yeah.

80
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:41,320
They could legally. Yeah, because
it's still illegal under federal law.

81
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,170
Obama chose not to do that. He chose
to respect the will of the states,

82
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:48,640
but the Trump administration is at
least signaling that it's not going to

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,340
because of sessions.
You think because of the point.

84
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,540
I don't think it's just
because of sessions.

85
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,830
I think sessions is where he is partially
because they want to do this crackdown.

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,030
Hmm. That's interesting. You might be
right. We'll have to find out about that,

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,210
but the crackdown is not going to go well.
It's a terrible idea.

88
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,670
You let the genie out of the bottle,
you gave people their freedom.

89
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,880
That will be the,
that'll be the death of a,

90
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,860
of the power of the Trump administration.

91
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,170
If they actually go through
with something so stupid.

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,770
It would be stupid economically as
well. Oh yeah. Would it would show,

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,510
I mean you want to talk
about transparency.

94
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,800
It will show really clearly
who your loyalty is to that.

95
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,440
It's not to the will of the people
that it's to these companies that are

96
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,410
benefiting from keeping marijuana
illegal. Period. That's it.

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,170
And then we'd have to figure
out a marijuana coalition.

98
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,210
We've got to figure out a way,

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,460
like there are fucking 100 million of us.
I guarantee you in this country,

100
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,080
100 million people that smoke pot,

101
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,890
that's a lot of fucking people and that
number's going to grow a third of the

102
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:48,580
country. It's, yeah. And it's going to
grow. The more things are people like,

103
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,610
well,
I really believe

104
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,790
you fucking idiot.
You fucking wins.

105
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,100
There's a lot of

106
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,250
fucking people. I might've made that
number up. I fucking, uh, I mean,

107
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,200
I believe it.

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,100
I believe it's probably at least close
because even when I was living down south

109
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,440
and I was hanging out with
conservatives who love Trump,

110
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,560
they smoked a little weed. Yeah.
They're smoking weed, not a little weed.

111
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,960
They're smoking weed like crazy fun.
It's fun to get high.

112
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,800
It's nothing wrong with it.

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,380
The only thing that's wrong with it is
the fact that it's been buttoned down

114
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,780
into our brain,
deep,

115
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,170
deep in our memory through propaganda
that it's bad for you. That's it.

116
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,300
If you looked at the actual
effects it has on you,

117
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,560
like we were talking about schizophrenia
and blaming marijuana on schizophrenia,

118
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,490
but it still seems across the board it'd
be 1% it's the same thing with dummies

119
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:37,670
and lazy people. When dummies and
lazy people find out about pot,

120
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,970
it ruins the idea of it for
other people. Oh, well look,

121
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,970
it's associated with his loud mouth dummy.
His loud mouth,

122
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,460
fucking lazy person never gets
anything done. He's always broke.

123
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:49,280
So he's asking for money. That's a
pothead. Potheads don't get shit done.

124
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,143
Don't be a pothead.

125
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,130
And then you get that in your head
and you're just run with it. Well,

126
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:52,964
there's plenty of like,

127
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,960
we know there's plenty of potheads that
are really industrious and hardworking.

128
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,470
You know,
a lot of them,

129
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,280
you can't attribute something that was
always part of someone's personality and

130
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:04,040
say, well, marijuana cause that. Exactly.

131
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,890
It doesn't totally change
the nature of a person.

132
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,550
It's not that powerful of a
fucking drug. Nor does coffee. No,

133
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,090
nor does alcohol nor do cigarettes
for that matter. Exactly. Well,

134
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,570
alcohol can change some people.
That's true. It was a bad example.

135
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,340
Canada justice system is crumbling
as cannabis rates continue. So,

136
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,290
um, there've been, they'd been
busted all these fucking pot places.

137
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:32,290
I thought you guys had your social
justice warrior president and uh,

138
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,090
everybody was going to get to pick
their own gender pronouns and now you're

139
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,310
rating pot places.

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Kaloga this 6,500 cases and provincial
court could be soon drop due to delays

141
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:47,330
including 38 for homicide or attempted
murderer. One terrible case last year,

142
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:50,780
a man named Kenneth Williamson was
convicted of raping a minor over a hundred

143
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:55,160
times, but because of lengthy delays
and taking his truck, his case to trial,

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,770
his conviction was overturned. Wait, was,

145
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,530
is that so they could
prosecute more marijuana? No,

146
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:03,820
this is just saying that they are there.
They're there.

147
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,980
They're system is in such crisis and this
marijuana case where they're arresting

148
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:10,820
all these people from marijuana,

149
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,920
it's insane because their justice system
is already in the crisis. So it says,

150
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,540
considering the justice system crisis,

151
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:21,140
cannabis should obviously be the lowest
priority for police and the courts.

152
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,980
But it's not,

153
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,550
not only your police launching more raids
against suspensory than ever before,

154
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:30,551
but ridiculous charges for small scale
cannabis crimes are continuing from coast

155
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,110
to coast.
So they,

156
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,430
they have a justice system that's so
broken that they can't even convict people

157
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:42,710
who raped miners a hundred times.
They can't take them to trial. I mean,

158
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,510
there is there,
but it's that broken.

159
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:49,511
But they're still trying to fucking
catch people for smoking weed and,

160
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,310
and just, uh, raiding
dispensaries and shit.

161
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,010
Like I had to get a waste of fucking time.
If I had to guess.

162
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,530
I would say it's some sort
of compartmentalism and
that like the drug people

163
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,540
aren't, they don't go after the other
crimes and they don't have to do with it,

164
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,930
you know, and then there's a
legal system that's backed up,

165
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,630
but to put more people
in the legal system,

166
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,780
just because you have to
somehow or another justify
the position that you're in.

167
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,490
A cop of a DEA cop, whatever they're
called up there, that's fucking crazy.

168
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,300
You got a broken system. You have,
uh, you're, you're preying on people.

169
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,700
You're locking people up. If
you, if you want to impress us,

170
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:28,090
then convict that fucking a rapist.
Don't, yeah, don't fucking, uh,

171
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,530
prosecute people who are smoking
weed for sure. And by the way,

172
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,720
what you're doing right
now seems like a crime.

173
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:38,190
You're locking people up in a cage for
a plant that everybody on the planet

174
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,600
knows is not bad for you.

175
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,460
So if you just decide that because of
some fucking bullshit thing that's written

176
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,120
on paper,

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,210
that you should be able to go against
all the science that's available today.

178
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,640
All the common sense and
the will of the people.

179
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,580
And you should be able to go into people's
houses, going to people's businesses,

180
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:57,810
arrest them, take all their money,
take all their pot. That's a crime.

181
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,710
That sounds like a crime.

182
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:03,711
It sounds like you're using your position
and you're using it to just mark one

183
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:08,040
up on the scoreboard. You know,
you, we got some convictions
today. Good solid ones.

184
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,750
A bunch of dopers caught us.

185
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:14,070
A bunch of dopers had to let
that crazed pedophile go,

186
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,100
but we got all the DoPay it dopers will
scourge of society to a hundred kids.

187
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,810
But you know what? He didn't, he didn't
fuck them over by giving him pot. Yeah.

188
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay.
Wasn't smoking no weed.

189
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,670
It's those kids are going to
remember what he did to them.

190
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,630
It's not going to damage
their memory. Yeah, like that
Goddamn part. I remember it.

191
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,900
So you remember it explicitly.
Jesus Christ. It's just,

192
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,800
I can't believe that in this day
and age that shit is still going on.

193
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,020
It just seems like,
and Canada,

194
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,700
I thought with this Trudeau guy was
going to be more progressive than ever,

195
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,060
which Canadians are complaining
about it like crazy and you know,

196
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:54,900
I've had Jordan Peterson on the podcast
and he hates what's going on now with

197
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:59,580
this push towards being as open minded
as possible with all these accepting of

198
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:03,300
the gender pronouns and that you're
going to have to start putting people,

199
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,280
you're going to have to start processing
cases through the human rights council

200
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,550
because if you don't use a
person's proper gender pronoun,

201
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,080
it could literally be considered a crime.

202
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,770
Like I think all that stuff on
the left when it goes way far,

203
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,020
it gets really crazy, but it's
probably a good thing to balance out.

204
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:22,920
That's tough on the right
and people figure out some
sort of comfortable medium.

205
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,700
Yeah, he's not being that
at all. He's not. If you,

206
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,500
if the president is
allowing this to go on,

207
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,130
he's not being this progressive president.
He's just not,

208
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,840
if he's only going to be progressive
towards Trans Gender Pronouns and whatever

209
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,680
other ridiculous laws that
they're swamped with, this is,

210
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:43,080
this is just a terrible precedent to set.

211
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Allowing them to lock people up for pot
in 2017 is a fucking criminal waste of

212
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:54,280
resources, a criminal waste
of manpower, a critic,

213
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,310
a criminal intrusion on the freedom of
those people that you're locking up a

214
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:03,460
criminal on the disruption that you're
putting into their lives and the money

215
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:07,320
that you're taking away from them
for, for trading economy as well. Yes.

216
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,750
And fucking your economy up and these
people were trading in something that is

217
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:14,980
very valuable to the community and to
the human beings that consume it. Yeah.

218
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:16,060
You know,
I'm a,

219
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,320
I consider myself a probably more
liberal than I am conservative,

220
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:25,321
but when I see the priorities
of liberals being identity,

221
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,420
politics, shit, gender pronouns and stuff,

222
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:33,190
and then so much of the real issues
like just get ignored like this. Yeah.

223
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,850
Uh,
that makes me hesitant to even say like,

224
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm a liberal or I'm more left wing and
right wing or whatever because I'm just

225
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:45,400
like, you're, your priorities are totally
fucked. They're totally out of order. Uh,

226
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,211
you know,

227
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:50,470
apparently in Canada they're fighting
all these fucking politically correct

228
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,120
identity politics battles, but they
can't deal with the, the pod issue.

229
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,900
They're gonna their police raids against
pot dispensaries are actually up and

230
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:03,880
they're trying to charge people with
petty fucking weed smoking crimes.

231
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,080
And this is a thing that people always
go on about. Like it's because it's pot,

232
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,870
it seems like it's not a big issue.
It's like it's not,

233
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,290
we've got bigger fish to fry
when you look at Tj. Okay.

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,260
I don't know if you've been paying
attention to the stock market. Okay. Tj,

235
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,200
do you know what my war in Afghanistan,
Tj? Yeah. Okay. We've got problems.

236
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,480
Real problems.
It was fucking pot thing.

237
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,480
You got damn potheads if it's off of
your pot, oh, what do I do? Whatever.

238
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,990
But it's not that,
this is what people have to realize.

239
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,000
It's about personal freedom.

240
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,830
It's about a person telling you what you
can do and enforcing it to the point of

241
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:38,350
putting you in a fucking cage.
And that thing,

242
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:43,351
which had been an accepted part of
civilization 4,000 of years and is today

243
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,890
accepted. It's an accepted part of
civilization, civilization right now.

244
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,050
But there's just these people that don't
engage in it, that don't understand it,

245
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,350
and that feel like they have the right to
go and lock people up for it. You know,

246
00:13:57,351 --> 00:14:00,220
when the Trump administration started
signaling that they were going to, uh,

247
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,980
take on weed or that they
were thinking about it,

248
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:07,690
at least that it was on the table,
like stupid at that point,

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,210
I was, I made a video where
I was, I was basically,

250
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:14,650
it was like making all the cases why
this is terrible. This is a bad idea. Uh,

251
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:18,160
you know, the, I made the
economics argument, I made
the personal freedom argument.

252
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,070
Um, I may, I get it.

253
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:23,260
I pointed out the tremendous amount of
revenue this is generating for the states

254
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,730
that have legalized it.

255
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,340
And a huge part of the
response was just like, yeah,

256
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,220
Oh yeah, of course he goes after Trump
when Trump goes after he's precious weed.

257
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,300
He cares. That's the only thing that
got them to care. It's like each chunky.

258
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,570
I made fucking so many cogent arguments
that hold water about the economic and

259
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,810
personal liberty ramifications
of something like this.

260
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,130
And all you want to focus on is my
personal usage of this fucking substance.

261
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,140
It's bullshit.
You Bet.

262
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:00,440
It's a good thing to talk about cause
it'll get you talking about it like right

263
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,930
now. Sure. It'll get
ya. It'll poke at you.

264
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,590
They know because they know that people
like you and I really do enjoy our

265
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,210
marijuana and when you try to take away
the pot, we really do get upset. Yeah.

266
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,250
I mean it was like kind of the like I
was kind of like on the give Trump a

267
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,160
chance bandwagon until they
started signaling this stuff.

268
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,920
So that's why really why I got shit.
It's a very,

269
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:23,921
very foolish thing to try to step in
in 2017 with all the signs and all the

270
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,700
information and the public opinion.

271
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,760
And to say that marijuana is
something that can get you locked up,

272
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,990
get you locked up, but it's almost
as bad as heroin. He's so stupid.

273
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,280
That's a silly man. That guy needs a pot
Brownie more than anything in this life.

274
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:40,190
He just needs a, uh, just a
quarter. Just give him a quarter.

275
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,190
Let him sit there and let him think about
his grandchildren and let them think

276
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:47,120
about fishing and let them think about
just napping in the sun and going to meet

277
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:50,060
the good Lord. A few years. You don't
have much time left motherfucker.

278
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:53,960
You want to ruin it for pod hands.
You're barely alive. Your hair's white.

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,810
Your posture is bad and
you're standing there lying.

280
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,350
You're lying on television about
heroin and pot being like really close.

281
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,540
That's a crazy person who doesn't know
what pot does. You're talking about pot.

282
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,380
You obviously have no idea what it's like.

283
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,830
It's like a person who's colorblind
describing some sort of a kaleidoscope.

284
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,240
You don't know what you're even
talking about. Like for a guy like him,

285
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,690
if you want to have a person who's
talking about individual experiences,

286
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,050
they should have had,

287
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,940
like if you're talking about someone
who's talking about the effects of a

288
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,120
chemical and whether or
not it should be legal,

289
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,960
they should have had some sort
of experience with that chemical.

290
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,750
They should know what it's doing.
They should understand it,

291
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,090
especially if it's safe.
Something like marijuana.

292
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,330
So if you had to talk about it and to
have these ridiculous, you, you can't,

293
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,320
you can't invest one evening
in a safe environment.

294
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:44,630
They'll do it in a laboratory
or a hospital somewhere,

295
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:47,960
pad up the rooms and give you
a pod cookie and then put,

296
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,580
put pink Floyd's the wall on just someone,

297
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,310
someone tell this fucking
guy what it really is.

298
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,190
Cause he's just talking out
of his ass. Yeah, I mean, uh,

299
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:01,640
I don't know if this is just apocryphal
or if they're, this is an actual story,

300
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:04,270
but I remember there being something
about him saying that he thought the,

301
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:08,660
the KKK, we're good guys until he found
out they smoked weed. That was, uh,

302
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,530
I think that was wrongly attributed
to him. And that not only that,

303
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,790
there has been evidence that he's
done many things for civil rights.

304
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,910
I had read that too,
but I think that's,

305
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,570
it just might be the case of people
being overzealous and trying to paint a

306
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,010
demean.
You could find things,

307
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm sure that you've said
or that I've sat with you.

308
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,690
Take them completely out of context.
You could paint a very different opinion.

309
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,650
Definitely. It's fucking very hard
to form an opinion of someone,

310
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,230
like a legitimate opinion of someone
without actually knowing them.

311
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,570
But you can have an opinion.

312
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,980
It's not that hard when they call and
say that that pod is nearly as dangerous

313
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,440
as heroin because that you did that
person snapchat, you're just like,

314
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:49,230
this person is either delusional
or is willfully deceptive. Right.

315
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:52,200
And the important part about
it is it's not just a person.

316
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,200
It's a person with an extreme amount
of power. Yeah. It's a person,

317
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:58,770
a very dangerous position of enforcing
laws. And you go, okay, well,

318
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:02,280
will you think that that's crazy.
That's not true. That's not true.

319
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,500
It just drives me nuts because I
think it helps people. I really does.

320
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,191
I really do.

321
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:13,191
I really do think it's probably one
of the best elements in terms of,

322
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,140
uh, a happy, healthy society,

323
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,410
staying grounded and being
like a little more kind. I get,

324
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,970
I think it gives you a certain percentage
more of kindness. Yeah. I mean, uh,

325
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,540
I've definitely seen it
make people more empathetic,

326
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,520
a more tolerant towards one another.

327
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,610
I've seen people who have
anxiety that it helps.

328
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,210
I've seen people who have anxiety that
it exacerbates their anxiety to the

329
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:37,440
edibles. Do. Yeah, for sure.

330
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,680
Like with a story I told about my brother
at the beginning of show, but for the,

331
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,760
for the,
by and large,

332
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:45,360
I know a lot of people with like bad
anxiety who smoke weed and it makes them

333
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:49,150
feel better. It makes them feel more
comfortable in social situations. Um,

334
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,500
stuff like that too, bro. It makes
you fucking talk about weed. Yeah.

335
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,470
How come you guys keep talking about weed?
I get it. You like weed enough already,

336
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,600
Bro. I can read that now to
read it in the comments there.

337
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:10,650
Yeah.
