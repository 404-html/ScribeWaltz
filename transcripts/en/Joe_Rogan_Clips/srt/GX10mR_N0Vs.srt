1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,620
I, uh, I'm a big fan of your
work. I've read much of your work.

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:08,160
I've seen many of your interviews
and videos online. And, uh,

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,980
one of the things that I really wanted
to talk to you about it I find quite

4
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:15,981
interesting is consciousness and your
belief that consciousness is not simply

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,290
calculation, but that there's
something more to it and what,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,970
what you think this more could possibly
be from a scientific perspective,

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:30,090
which is unusual because a lot of people
have some theories about consciousness,

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:34,830
but they're usually crazy
people like myself. Well,

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,550
I mean, we were all conscious and so
we may have theories about it. Yeah.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,290
But now the ideas came by a
somewhat round about route.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,790
Uh, I, I went to Cambridge
to do graduate work.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,740
It was mathematics. I was working on
pure mathematical subjects, Algebra,

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,070
geometry. But I thought, you
know, we've got three years.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,670
I'll spend some of the time going to
other talks that might be interesting.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,380
So I went to three talks particularly,
which had a big influence on me.

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,360
One was taught by Herman
Bondi with, uh, um,

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,070
general relativity cosmology,
wonderful tour.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,760
We're very sort of animated presentation,

19
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:18,300
the ad and then there
was a talk by Paul Dirac,

20
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:23,301
one of the founders of quantum mechanics
and HIStalk what he's completely

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,860
wonderful talk to
wonderful lectures as well,

22
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,270
but in a completely different style.

23
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:31,110
He was very quiet and precise in
what he said and everything. Anyway,

24
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:35,490
in the very first lecture he was talking
about the superposition principle in

25
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,151
quantum mechanics.

26
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:41,130
So if you have a particle and it could
be in one spot or it could be in another

27
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:44,880
spot, then you have all sorts of states
where it can be in both places at once.

28
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,430
That's sort of strange,

29
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,630
but you got to get used to that idea and
he illustrated with his speech a piece

30
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:56,130
of chalk and I think he broke it in two
to illustrate it could be in one spot or

31
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,150
in the other. And my mind sort
of wondered at that point,

32
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,060
I didn't know what I was thinking about,
but I wasn't concentrating.

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,630
And about a few minutes
later he'd finished,

34
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,690
his description is explanation and I
had some vague memory of something about

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,310
energy,
but I didn't understand what he said.

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,120
And I've been totally mystified
by this ever since. So I,

37
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,770
I suppose if I had heard what he said,

38
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:23,760
he would have said something to calm me
down and I sort of accepted in one way

39
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:28,200
or another. But as it was, it
seemed to me this was a major issue.

40
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,900
How on earth do you have things that
don't behave according to what quantum

41
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,230
mechanics says? Like cricket balls and
baseballs and things like that. Anyway,

42
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,370
that's two of the talks.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,410
The other course was a course
by a man called Stephen,

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,420
who talked on mathematical logic and he
explained things like girdle's theorem

45
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,870
and touring machines during machines
being the mathematical notion upon which

46
00:02:55,531 --> 00:03:00,220
modern computers are based or
computers basically. And uh,

47
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,070
uh, the thing about good will
stay. Let me see. I'd heard,

48
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,430
I used to have a colleague when I was
undergraduate in Percival who also became

49
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,280
a scientist's later on.
And we talked about, uh,

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,320
logic and you know, how you could make
this kind of mathematical systems,

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,480
which worked out logic.

52
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,780
And I'd heard about this girls and which
seemed to say that there were things in

53
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:33,220
mathematics that you just couldn't prove.
And I didn't like that idea,

54
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,830
but I,
when I heard the,

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,100
when I went to this course by Steen and
he explained what it really says and

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,180
what it says, it's suppose you've got a
method of proving things in mathematics.

57
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,030
And when I say things,
I mean things with numbers.

58
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,110
That one famous example is
fair Mars last year, um, uh,

59
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,430
there's the Gold Goldberg conjecture,

60
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,360
which isn't yet proved that they every
even number bigger than two is the sum of

61
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:04,150
two prime numbers.
This the sort of example of the thing,

62
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,150
it's just sort of mathematical
things about numbers,

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,840
which you can see what they mean.
Uh,

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,780
but it may be very difficult to
see whether it's true or untrue.

65
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,320
But the idea it often is in mathematics,

66
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,630
you've got a system of methods of proof.

67
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,350
And the key thing about these methods
of proof is that you can have a computer

68
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:30,310
check whether you've done it right.
So you, these rules, you know,

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,150
they could be adding in B,
it's the same as BNA and things like that.

70
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,560
And you, um, if you give

71
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,180
you say to the computer,
say, here's a theory,

72
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:48,181
I'm like Goldbar conjecture and you see
whether it can be proved and you say,

73
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,720
maybe I've got a proof and this follows
these steps and you give it to the

74
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,990
computer and it says, Yep,
you've done it right. It's true.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,260
Or maybe it will say you've
done it right and it's not true.

76
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,840
Or it may not see anything
but just go on forever.

77
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,330
But these are the sort of outcomes.

78
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:09,331
And the point about it is that if you
believe that these procedures do give you

79
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:14,620
a proof, in other words, that if
the algorithm says, yeah, it's true,

80
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,820
then you believe that it is true because
you've understood the, all the rules.

81
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:22,480
He looked at the first one,
so yeah, that's okay. You
look at the second one says,

82
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,150
mom. Oh yeah, I see. Okay, that's great.

83
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,230
And you go all the way down and as long
as you convinced all those rules work

84
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,710
and if it says yes, that's
something you believe. Okay,

85
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,190
now what girl shows as he
constructs a very specific sentence,

86
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:42,140
a statement which is a number
thing like like the fair,

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,550
most lost their arm or something.
I think about numbers, which

88
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,110
what he shows is if you trust this
algorithm for proving mathematical things,

89
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,980
then you can see by the way
it's constructed that it's true,

90
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,630
but you can also see by the way it's
constructed that it cannot be proved by

91
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,760
this procedure.
Now,

92
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:08,900
this was amazing to me because
it tells me that, okay,

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,370
you cannot formalize your understanding
in a scheme which you could put on a

94
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,830
computer that you see.

95
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:23,750
This statement which got will comes up
with is something you can see on the

96
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:28,751
basis of the same understanding that
allows you to trust the rules that it's

97
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:33,440
true, but that is not actually
derives bubble by the rules.

98
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,690
It you see, it's true by virtue
of your belief in the rules.

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,550
And this to me was amazing and
I thought, Golly, you know,

100
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,790
what's understanding,
what does it mean?

101
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,780
Is it something following rules?
This is an algorithm.

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,290
Well this more or less says it's not
an algorithm because whenever it was,

103
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,430
there will be something that you could
still see his true even though you don't

104
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,010
get it through the algorithm
that you had in the first place.

105
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,430
So this was a lot of
subtleties about this too,

106
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,110
which people argue about endlessly.

107
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,470
But it was pretty convincing to me that
the shows that we don't think when we

108
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:17,030
understand something that what's going
on in our heads is not an algorithm.

109
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,450
It's not following rules,
it's something else.

110
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,630
It's something that requires our conscious
appreciation of what we're thinking

111
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,624
about.

112
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,630
I'm thinking it's a conscious thing and
understanding is a conscious activity.

113
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,890
So I formed the view that conscious
activities, whatever they are,

114
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,200
not just that kind of thing,
but you know,

115
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,570
playing music or we're falling in love
or whatever these things might be on,

116
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,350
not computations. There's something
else going on. And then I thought,

117
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,820
because I like to think myself as a
scientist and I think that what's going in

118
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,840
our heads is according to the laws
of physics and these laws of physics,

119
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,960
um,
pretty good.

120
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,990
They seem to work well in the outside
world and so I believe that the laws that

121
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:10,550
work in our heads are the same as those
laws. So I began to think about it, well,

122
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:14,390
what about Newton's mechanics?
But you could put that on a computer.

123
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,890
What about Einstein's special relativity?
You could do that.

124
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,100
What about Maxwell's
was wonderful equations,

125
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,560
which tell you how less electricity and
magnetism operates and lights and the

126
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,980
radio waves and all these things.

127
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:31,730
That's all follows this beautiful set
of equations that Max will produced.

128
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,160
You can put that on a computer.
Okay.

129
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:38,480
Then you may have to worry
about approximations and
these depend on continuous

130
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,750
numbers rather than discreet things,
but I didn't think that's the answer.

131
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,861
Then I thought,

132
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:47,861
what about general relativity and Stein's
theory of gravity with cove space and

133
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:52,310
all that, where you were familiar
now with Lego, this detector,

134
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:57,311
which is detected black hole spiraling
into each other from distant galaxy and

135
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,510
how do we know that those signals
are black holes, but well,

136
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,740
because of the calculations,

137
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,730
people who put this thing on an algorithm
and you know what those signals look

138
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:08,250
like.
So Einstein's general relativity,

139
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,630
sure you can put that in a cubicle on the
computer. What about quantum mechanics?

140
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,780
Well, there's the famous
equation of Schrodinger,

141
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,720
which tells you how a
quantum state evolves.

142
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,070
You could put that on a computer too.
It's difficult in many ways.

143
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,140
There's many more parameters
you have to worry about,

144
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,570
but it's just as comfortable as
these other things. Well, you see,

145
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,280
I then remembered directs lecture.

146
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,480
You see and how it is that these things
that work in the quantum world don't

147
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:44,430
seem to work at the level
of classical big things.

148
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,080
And it all depends on this process of
what's called measurement in quantum

149
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:53,940
mechanics. And the measurement process
is something you learn how to do,

150
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,290
but it's not the Schrodinger equation.
It's something else. And Schroeder,

151
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:03,291
he himself was very intrigued by
this fact that his own equation,

152
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,070
it gives you nonsense and you put the
famous Schrodinger's cat where he produces

153
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:13,080
a situation in which the cat would
be dead and alive at the same time.

154
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,290
He produced that in example simply
to demonstrate that roughly speaking,

155
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,470
his equation gives you nonsense
under these circumstances.

156
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:27,471
So there's something else
and the something else goes
beyond our current quantum

157
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:28,554
mechanics.

158
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,060
And it tells you what happens when the
quantum state makes a decision between,

159
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,740
doesn't follow the Schrodinger and
does one thing or the other. No,

160
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,930
everybody knows that who does quantum
mechanics, but they think, oh,

161
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,480
it's what's called making a measurement
and you're allowed to do something

162
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,150
different.
But that didn't make sense to me.

163
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,120
And so I had the view that,
okay,

164
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,070
there is a big gap and our understanding
and if there's something in the world

165
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,820
which isn't something you could put
on a computer, that's where it is.

166
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,100
So the view,
I've held that for a long time and uh,

167
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,340
that there's something non computable,

168
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,350
something beyond computation involved
in our understandings of things.

169
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,780
So that's a view of health for ages.
I didn't do much with it.

170
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,090
I just held the view until,

171
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I think there was a radio talk between
Marvin Minsky and Edward Fred kin and

172
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:24,390
they were explaining about what computers
can do. And they were talking about,

173
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,950
okay,
you have a computer,

174
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,820
two computers talking to each other over
there and you walk up to the room and

175
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,380
the time you've walked up the room to the
computers, they have computed, commuted,

176
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,990
communicates with each other more thoughts
than the human race ever has done.

177
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,820
You see? And I thought, well,
I see where you're coming from,

178
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,560
but I don't think that's what's
happening in, in human communication.

179
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:50,700
Human understanding is something
different from what computers do.

180
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,680
And consciousness is the key thing.

181
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:57,730
Consciousness is something different
from computation. So I've held that view.

182
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,770
But then when I heard this talk by
Minsky and um, and Fred skin, I thought,

183
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,310
well,
I had ideas of writing a book some time.

184
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,550
In a long time in the future when I'm
retired, this is some while back, I said,

185
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,060
and I thought, well, maybe
this gives you the focus.

186
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,390
And so I wrote this book
called the emperor's new mind,

187
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,950
which was supposed to be
saying, well, you know, we,

188
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,550
everybody seems to be thinking one thing,
but yeah,

189
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,080
the little kid notices that the emperor
doesn't have any clothes. So it was the,

190
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,730
uh, that theme of that story,
which was the basis of the book.

191
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,770
So I say, okay, maybe a lots of people
think that all we're doing is computing,

192
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,720
but if you stand back and you say, well,
no, there's something else going on.

193
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,220
So that was the basis of my
thoughts about consciousness.

194
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,950
But I wrote this book thinking that by
the time I got to the end of the book,

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,670
you see, it was mostly about physics
and mathematics and things like that.

196
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,960
But I was really aiming for this thing
about what's going on in conscious

197
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:06,010
thinking. And I thought, well, I'll learn
a bit about neurophysiology and so on.

198
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,770
And by the time I get to
the end of the book, uh,

199
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,720
know pretty well what it could be.

200
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,340
I didn't got to the end of the book and
I just sort of tapered off rather than

201
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:19,450
with something a little bit unbelievable.
And that was the end. Now you see,

202
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:24,451
I hope that this book would stimulate
young people to get interested in science

203
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:27,490
and that sort of thing, that
mathematics. And that was fine.

204
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,930
And when the book was published,
I didn't get letters from young kids.

205
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:34,260
I got letters from old retired people who,

206
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,470
the ones who had the time to read my book.
Okay,

207
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,630
well that was a little disappointing,
but okay,

208
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm glad the old retired
people like my book.

209
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,330
But the other thing was I got a letter
from the Stuart Hameroff and this letter

210
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:49,930
said more or less,

211
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,100
I think you don't appreciate that there's
something else going on. Not Neurons.

212
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:54,911
I mean the neurons,

213
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:59,650
I could see you couldn't isolate
the quantum effects that the,

214
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,910
you get the what's called an environmental
decoherence will happen and you get

215
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,830
no way of keeping the quantum state to
the level that you need in this picture.

216
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,050
So I really,
I didn't have it,

217
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,970
but Stuart Hameroff pointed out to me
these little things called microtubules

218
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,420
and he'd built up a theory that
microtubules are absolutely fundamental.

219
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,181
The consciousness.

220
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,350
He had his own reasons for believing that
I had never heard of them at that time,

221
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,940
but then I checked up,
you know,

222
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:32,410
I get lots of letters from people who
maybe don't make sense sometimes the

223
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,560
letters and this one I thought,
well this is another one.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,230
I realized these microtubules are there
and they looked like just the kind of

225
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:46,231
thing that could well be supporting the
kind of level of quantum mechanics up to

226
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:51,811
a level where you could expect the
the quantum state to sort of collapse.

227
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,910
That's the terminology. People using
quantum mechanics microtubules,

228
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,310
they are inside brain neurons.
The R and D,

229
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,690
and this is a recent discovery for them.
They're actually in lots of cells.

230
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:05,300
You see, people often complain,
oh, they're in your liver too,

231
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:07,970
not just your brain and your
liver conscious and all that.

232
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,360
But this has to do with the organization
of them and the nature of them,

233
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:15,110
the particular kind of microtubules,
how they're, how they're arranged,

234
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,520
which is different in the brain.

235
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,070
How does it vary in the brain
compared to other cells?

236
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,910
I think one big difference, so they're
not Stewart emphasizes, there's so much,

237
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,710
there are two kinds of microtubules.

238
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,480
They're the ones who have a lattice
[inaudible] lattice and the a lattice ones

239
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,850
are the very symmetrical ones.

240
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:33,140
There are tubes and they look
the same all the way around.

241
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,730
They've got a very beautiful arrangement
of these proteins called Tubulin and

242
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,790
they make a very nice arrangement,

243
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,580
which is connected with Fibonacci
numbers and things like that.

244
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,090
So they look a bit like for cones,
but there were powerful. They're not,

245
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,980
they don't taper off. But, um,

246
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,960
the thing is in the brain,

247
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,250
I think most of microtubules are
probably what to call lattice ones.

248
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:59,630
And they're don't have so much symmetry.

249
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:04,610
They've got like a sort of seemed on the
one side and they're very important in

250
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:09,200
transporting some substances
around cells and so on.

251
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,260
And Microsoft was all sorts of things.
They don't just do what,

252
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,320
what Stuart and I think they
may be doing in the brain.

253
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,740
So the idea is that in the brain they're
organized differently and probably the

254
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,980
ones that are important have a lattice
ones, which are the very symmetrical ones.

255
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,800
And for a long time people
couldn't see the difference and um,

256
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,940
cause they look very similar.
Um,

257
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,420
and they may well be the ones that
happened to be in pyramidal cells as a

258
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:39,680
particular kind of cell. So, you know,

259
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:44,180
one of the things I'm interested in me
a lot is how it is that not all parts of

260
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:47,480
the brain are the same in this respect
is that you've got the cerebrum,

261
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:51,200
this is the part at the top and you know,
divided down the middle on that.

262
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,530
When you see brains, that's what you
normally see with the convolutions in,

263
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,383
in the,
in it,

264
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,480
but right underneath and at the back
there's a thing called the cerebellum,

265
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,290
which more it looks more like a,
like a ball of wool or something.

266
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,550
And the Cerebellum, I don't, it
may still be argument about this,

267
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:12,551
but it seems to be that it's completely
unconscious and it has comparable number

268
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:17,210
of neurons, far more connections
between neurons and the cerebrum.

269
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,820
And it's what takes control.

270
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,580
And maybe when you're driving your car
and you're thinking about something else

271
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:23,500
and you,
you don't,

272
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,830
you're not thinking what you're doing
because it's unconscious and the

273
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,680
unconscious control,
you know,

274
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,190
pianist is very expert and moves the
fingers around and plays a note with a

275
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:36,470
little finger. That pns
doesn't think, well,

276
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,200
I've got to move that muscle this way
and this mountain that way and so on.

277
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:39,920
And it's,

278
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,920
it's all controlled unconsciously in a
lot of this unconscious control is done

279
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:49,980
somewhere else in the cerebellum when
you, when you get really skilled. So, uh,

280
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,270
it seemed to me,
okay,

281
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:55,410
you've got different kinds of structures
different and it could well be that

282
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,550
these pyramidal cells,

283
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:01,350
which have a particular organization
of microtubules are the ones that were,

284
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:06,270
that consciousness is really coming,
coming to light mainly, I don't know.

285
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,110
There's a lot which is,

286
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:10,860
which is not known about this
controversial and all sorts of things,

287
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,030
but the cerebellum seems to be
different and organized differently.

288
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,620
So it's not just how many neurons,

289
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,250
how many connections are there because
there are more in the cerebellum.

290
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,830
So it's not that saying else.

291
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,620
Do they know this from observing the
brain through Fmr rye or something like

292
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,560
that during particular activities?
I don't know.

293
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:32,880
I would imagine partly just examining
it went from dead people and looking at

294
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,570
brains and trying to estimate how
many neurons their own it. Right.

295
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:39,860
But how would they know what, which
part? Partial, which is consciousness.

296
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,450
I don't know that they do know
that. Well I guess. But the co,

297
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,810
the Cerebellum,
there was a bit of an argument about that.

298
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,100
I thought whether it's
completely unconscious or not,

299
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,050
but it seems that actions that are
carried out by the Cerebellum, you don't,

300
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,430
you're not aware of what you're
doing. But I mean it's, you know,

301
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:03,540
if he had a tennis player who has to
think very carefully about where that w

302
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,590
with tilt the ball now the
control of what you're doing.

303
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,520
So the overall control,
it's probably done with the cerebrum,

304
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,880
but the cerebellum is
controlling the detailed motions,

305
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,190
how the fingers move and
all that kind of thing.

306
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,910
And then you'd make
sure that if you play a,

307
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,460
thinks it's going to hit the ball down,
down the line there. And then the,

308
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,840
the rest is done under the control
of an unconscious procedure.

309
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,080
I mean, I may be simplifying, but you're
saying, so you're saying that there's,

310
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,210
we don't totally understand,

311
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:39,810
but we know that there's different parts
of the brain that are responsible for

312
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:44,670
different activities and some activities
don't seem to be conscious. Yes, yes.

313
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,470
And I think it's probably the case.
No, I'm, I'm maybe, I don't know.

314
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,360
I shouldn't make a statement
and I don't really know.

315
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,080
But certainly there are lots of different
parts of the cerebrum which maybe,

316
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,490
which maybe not conscious too,

317
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,630
so I'm not saying that the whole thing
is capable of being conscious. It's,

318
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,850
they seem to be differences
in different parts.

319
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,120
But are you convinced that microtubules
are responsible for consciousness or its

320
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,350
primary theory?

321
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,780
I think they're the one of the
best candidates. I you see,

322
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,790
I don't think it's only microtia.
I Dunno.

323
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm not sure what Stuart
Hameroff sphere on this is.

324
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:27,810
He certainly thinks the microchip was
exceedingly important in consciousness and

325
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,700
I think he's right.
That's the feeling I get.

326
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,710
And he's done a lot of work on trying
to find a what? Anesthetic gases.

327
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,544
It's an important,

328
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,330
one of the important ways you can tell
things about conscious and most of it you

329
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:41,670
can't. It's just hearsay.
And what does it vary? It is,

330
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,860
but one of the important ways you can
tell something about consciousness is

331
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,510
turns it off in a reversible way.

332
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,330
In Stuart's job is,

333
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,400
do you know he's an anesthesiologist?
He puts people to sleep well.

334
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,480
I think he would complain if I say putting
it to sleep because under anesthetic

335
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,030
is actually different for sleep.

336
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,150
But you make them unconscious
in a reversible way. You
want to make sure thank,

337
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,850
you can wake them up again.
And a,

338
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,730
it's obviously a very skills thing,

339
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,360
but I guess a lot of his colleagues might
be a skilled at doing it, but don't.

340
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,680
They asked the questions about what
they're actually doing from the point of

341
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,690
view of the biology and
the physics and so on.

342
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,510
So still it was really
interested in that question.

343
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,670
Partly I think the thing is like,

344
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:32,671
oh my tosas cell division and he was very
struck by the way that the chromosomes

345
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:38,170
or lion lion up and that there's these
microtubules which pulling them and

346
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:42,910
they're really a big part in, in, in,
in the structure of cells and how they,

347
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,320
how they behave and so on. But
why they are consciousness. Well,

348
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,440
I guess it was an experience with,
with um,

349
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,470
putting people under anesthetics and the
fact that the gases which puts you to

350
00:21:56,171 --> 00:22:01,010
sleep. And there, again, I
shouldn't say to sleep, but
put you on the anesthetic. I,

351
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,400
I'm very unconnected chemically.

352
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:07,960
They're different kinds of things be yet
they still seem to have the same effect

353
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,800
and to understand what it is
that they affect is, you know,

354
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,080
there's a lot of his
interest is to do with that.

355
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,340
So just by putting someone unconscious
and registering what parts of the brain

356
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,630
are no longer active,

357
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,400
this is what they're using to sort of
reverse engineered by turning those parts

358
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:31,040
on. That's what enables
consciousness. Was this the, well,

359
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,600
I think it's probably a simplification
of what, what's going, but that's,

360
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:38,590
that's a good, uh, first first step. Yes.
