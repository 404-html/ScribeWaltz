1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello Freak bitches. Yeah,
I didn't think of it at all.

2
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:08,190
That way it's out of the
podcast is just fun. Yeah,

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,230
just something to do for a goof.
And I did it for years,

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,160
like irregularly before I
ever won of committing to it.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,550
But like every few weeks and then
palling around in the green room,

6
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,190
we would do in the green room and
Joey Diaz would always get mad.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,390
Shut that fucking thing off.
You guys were always fucking online.

8
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:31,010
You're fucking around online. Shut it off.
Joe Rogan. He would get mad. I'd be like,

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,844
people like it.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,440
You're wasting your fucking time on
the Internet. Yeah, I was relentless.

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,150
That's like the biggest
part of his lifetime now.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,750
His podcast is gigantic for him. Yeah.
Yeah. He just did it the other night.

13
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:48,120
He was so high. He
fucking gave me the, he,

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,910
I forgot where his studio was, so I
said send me the address again. So we,

15
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:56,200
since we had dress, I fucking pull up
on this dark road and I go to, I go,

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,380
oh he wants to suck fucking switch the
studio or something cause this isn't the

17
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:01,600
old one. It's like, all right,
what the fuck? It's a house.

18
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:04,450
I guess he's doing it in the back of
his house. I fucking ring the doorbell.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,920
It's his house. He was so high. He
gave me his fucking home address.

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,801
I'm texting him,

21
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:16,801
I'm out the front door and see a front
of the fucking streets and I walk in and

22
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,410
he's chewing down those.
What are they black start?

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,160
He's got a bong going. He's had
mushrooms. Least Siad is sitting there.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,980
His eyes are shut. His eyes are shut.
I don't know how he sees you handle it.

25
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,320
I don't know how he does it.
Leaks. Lee can't handle it.

26
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,580
You could look in his eyes sometimes,

27
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,930
like I've been on the show before
and when someone says something,

28
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,360
I always feel like we're
having a conversation and
someone says something like,

29
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,520
well, what do you mean by that?
Yeah, and then we're having a talk,

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,220
but if you say like Lee said something,
I go, well what does that mean?

31
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,870
And he was like,
lock up.

32
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:54,510
Like it's just way too
high to have this path.

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,800
He was talking about how
he was like,

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,390
it seems like audio is the thing of the
future. I go, what? What do you mean?

35
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,570
He goes, well, it just seems like people,

36
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,000
like they're always on their phones
while they're on TV or they're watching a

37
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,391
movie,

38
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:12,780
they're talking on their phone or they're
looking through their phone or they're

39
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,480
listening to things while they're
doing other things. Like what?

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,340
I'll get you wait, you're listening
to things while you're watching TV.

41
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,203
You're Wa what?

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,270
Who the fuck was playing with their
phone while they're watching TV?

43
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,970
And he's like
fucking paranoid.

44
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,280
He'll wash over him like a tidal wave
of my area that we've just poor guy.

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,180
Well because two,
Hi Joey makes him do everything he does.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,050
Not only Joey do that,
Joey's swaps edibles on them like lead,

47
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,610
try this.

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,610
It's only 50 milligrams and he'll take a
500 milligram pot and they'll put it in

49
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,350
the wrapper of a 50 and twist it back up.

50
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,500
It's mild cause mild like four of them.

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,760
And so it gives them enough to make
you reconsider your existence in the

52
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,410
universe while he's running.
The soundboard and he doesn't fuck up.

53
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,890
It's a good engineer. It's very
good. Yeah. Yeah. It's like,

54
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,420
I don't know if it's healthy to be
around Joey all the time like that.

55
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,590
Like he can be really danger. We'll
also Joey so good to him. You know,

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,940
they just have like a very,
very unique relationship man.

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,150
I mean that's a,
that's a God damn shell,

58
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,380
that relationship right
there because Joey's like a
father figure to him kind of.

59
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,450
Yeah.
And some insane way.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,980
Joey's a sweetheart as long
as you're on his side. Yeah.

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,160
But the worst place in the world
is a guy who's against Joey.

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,270
Right? Like Joey's what the
worst I've seen like God,
Joey have feuds with people.

63
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,040
Hmm. It is a horrible thing to
watch. Yeah. You know, like he,

64
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,050
cause he's so passionate about his
friendship with people that when someone

65
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,690
turns on him, like he's the, as,

66
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,380
as loving and is friendly
and is warm as he is. Like,

67
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,830
you know how he is like when he
sees you it's all hugs and you know,

68
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,830
it calls you up because
you Greg Fitzsimmons what's
going on. Yeah. That's it.

69
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,850
You guys had a good Dick. Yeah.
What you're doing dog. You know,

70
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,120
and like he loves you. I
love Joey. Like, I mean,

71
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,410
he's my family like 100%
but if you turn on him,

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,420
man, it's a fucking horror. I've
seen him go after people. It's very,

73
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:27,310
yeah, it's crazy. He's so like he's Cuban.

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,470
Yeah. No. And you know, he came up,

75
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,250
he had a really fucked up
situation going on growing up his,

76
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:37,540
he found his mom dead when he was
13 he was on acid. Yeah. I mean,

77
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,150
so he was raised by his friends,

78
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,700
family sucking a tit that night to Waze.
Yeah,

79
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:47,130
he was sucking some girls tid on
acid. Oh, fun. Mom. Dad. Yeah.

80
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,010
Jesus was symbolism in that, huh? Oh,

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,240
marijuana sagging and tit was like, oh,
I don't need anything better than this.

82
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,790
I still,
it's still my wife.

83
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,900
Thank God I could not have married a
woman that didn't have a nice tits. Oh,

84
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,210
there's a lot of women out there with
little tits that are angry at you right

85
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:08,020
now. Sorry. You're not
real women. I'm kidding.

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,230
I'm kidding.
But I couldn't have married one.

87
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,030
I respect you and I'll hang out with
you. I'll let you into my shows. Wow.

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,090
But I'm not going to marry you.

89
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:30,920
Okay.
