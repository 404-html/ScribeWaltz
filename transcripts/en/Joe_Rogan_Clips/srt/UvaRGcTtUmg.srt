1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,920
But you're definitely feeling
that tobacco, you're feel it's,

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:08,921
it's doing something to your system and
they say it actually has a cognitive

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,860
enhancing function that's similar
to nootropics and coffee as well.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,561
That'll like it.

5
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:19,260
It actually can make you perform better
in tests if you smoked cigarettes or if

6
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,170
you smoke a cigar.
And writers always say that like,

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,170
I know a lot of people who write like
writers for sitcoms and stuff like that.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,230
Those guys always smoke cigarettes when
they write and they say they can't write

9
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:32,330
without smoking. Steven King said
that it's like their weed. Yeah,

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,900
well it does have something going on
man, but it's instead of like, it's not,

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,620
it's to me it's more like
amped than it is creative.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,540
We'd is super creative.

13
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,330
Weed makes me think of thoughts
while I write them down on my,

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,990
I can't even claim that. That's not
even my thought. That's weeds thought.

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,093
You know what I mean?

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,780
Like I would have never just leave
me by myself with no drugs in a,

17
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,810
in a notebook. I would have never come
up with that idea. But the weeds like,

18
00:00:57,811 --> 00:00:58,770
hey man,
listen to this.

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,940
You know the weed weed
is way more of a uh,

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,360
like an idea steroid.
I believe it too.

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,660
I see people who don't smoke weed and they
write and I'm like who you're so brave

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,310
out there out there with no helmet you've
got no life preserver on and now it's

23
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:24,300
crazy legal everywhere. This amazing
this recreational weed in California.

24
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:27,960
It's insane. He just walked
nine states now. Yeah. Crazy.

25
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,160
I think 18 states have league illegal
medical and nine states have legal

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:35,940
recreational, nice juice.
It's mass. Yeah it's a wave.

27
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:39,120
It's going across the whole country.
It's changing everything and it's good.

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,180
And you know what the next wave is
MTMA MTMA therapy for PTSD patients has

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,510
unprecedented results.
Maps is involved in this,

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,280
what does it multiple,

31
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:54,660
the Multiple Disciplinary Association
for Psychedelic studies or something like

32
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:54,871
that.

33
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:59,871
Maps is a amazing a really above board
organization that is at the forefront of

34
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,400
legalization of psychedelics and of
psychedelic research and they'd been

35
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:10,290
involved in studies with soldiers and
they have amazing results with this stuff.

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,820
Mdm May just lets you forgive yourself
and lets you forget everything.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,820
It reprograms your brain had reprogram,

38
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,370
lets you forgive other people in
your life. It changes. It could.

39
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,960
One head of MDM,
MDM and Dma,

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,200
that always confuses me,
Molly and said it's a lot easier.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,320
One hint can change your taste
in music forever for ever.

42
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,570
I believe it because before aggregate it,

43
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:40,710
the first time I did it was 1997 and
before that, how was a DJ at this point?

44
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,110
And I couldn't stand tech.

45
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:49,111
Now I hated techno music so much and I
was a DJ and anytime a girl went on stage

46
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:53,160
and she was a tech Nigger, I'm like,
this is because I played drums for real.

47
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,760
So when you listen to techno and house,
it's like it.

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,650
That's the most basic dump.
Every song,

49
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,830
every fucking drum beat to Sam.

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,700
I couldn't accept it as a musician and
most musicians feel that way about tech

51
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,070
now.
And um,

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,800
I went to a birthday party at the key
club in Hollywood and I walk in and

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,760
upstairs is techno in downstairs in
the like little bottom club is hip hop.

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,090
And it was a birthday party and everyone
was downstairs and me and my buddy Rick,

55
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,750
we walk in and we're standing at the
edge of the techno Floyd and there's like

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,510
all these dudes just like
dancing by themselves. They're
just like mental cases,

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,160
right. And I was just standing
there looking at him going,

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,300
what the fuck is wrong with these people?
Oh my God.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,100
So I went downstairs or playing hip hop,

60
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,400
like that's what I want to hear at clubs.
I want to hear hip hop at a club.

61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,400
I want to dance with a girl,
not by myself, you know,

62
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,930
so I'm downstairs and then they start
passing around some Molly and some say we

63
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,360
want to do it and I'll never forget
that that first one was blue. I'm like,

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,620
I dunno, I dunno. So I took it,

65
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:58,450
me and my buddy both took it and it hit
us that that first hit just hits you

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,340
like a fucking ton of bricks.

67
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,890
We go upstairs and we're on the dance
floor dancing like morons, dude.

68
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,790
And we're looking at each other go, you
get it? I get it, I get it. I get it,

69
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,560
and from that point on, you got all
into trance. Yeah. From that point,

70
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,890
it wasn't just like that night.

71
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,450
It changed my musical
taste right in one hit,

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,370
and I had a friend at the club who
was a total rnb duty, hate a techno,

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,340
and he would talk shit.
When I played tech and I got one day,

74
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,160
you're going to do some modeling and
you're going to be all into technical as a

75
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,160
fog you. That'll never happen.
I can't stand this music.

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,580
He starts dating the raver check
like six months later at the club,

77
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,570
some raver check, he ends up at a
ray, he ends up dropping some Molly,

78
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,780
he starts coming in and bringing
all these new tech, no cds,

79
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:48,400
and he's all into full blown and the
trends in tech now, just one hint,

80
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,140
this is the real,
the real

81
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,720
problem. It's illegal. So
when you get it from someone,

82
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,500
you don't know what the fuck you getting.
That's the real problem with Molly.

83
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,850
This is a real problem with Mtma.
It's also the dosage.

84
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:59,190
You don't know what the dosage
is supposed to be. Look,

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,070
you can overdose on alcohol
and alcohol's everywhere,

86
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,330
but everybody knows what
the dose of alcohol is,

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,160
was you go to a bar and you get a shot
of Jack Daniels. You know what that is?

88
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,470
It's not like sometimes you
get a shot of Jack, Jen,

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,140
Jack Daniels in his Jack Daniels.
Sometimes you get it in,

90
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:18,141
it's super fucking moonshine is
15 times stronger and you die.

91
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,180
That's the problem with heroin.
Yes. A problem with a lot of things.

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,840
The real problem with MDM may
seems to be that it's illegal.

93
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,900
That's the real problem and what they're
finding is that there's great benefits

94
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:32,760
if it's used correctly. I
mean, anything can be abused,

95
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,970
but that doesn't mean we should make
it illegal and what they want to do.

96
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,590
I think their,
their timeline,

97
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:41,730
it's somewhere around
2021 making it legal for,

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,840
for therapy. It's going to change the
world. It's going to change everything.

99
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,290
It's going to change the way people feel
about the past is going to change the

100
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,880
way people interact with each other.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,070
You're going to know just
by people's behavior,

102
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,990
whether or not they've ever done it right.
You know where it comes from.

103
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,240
We're MTMA comes from the part of it,

104
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,380
the active ingredient that takes you
a, that just makes you plant, right?

105
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,430
Where's that planet?
It's in Thailand. Crazy.

106
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,810
Either Thailand or it's like, uh,
what's, uh, Cambodia in Cambodia.

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,950
It's like the bark,
like something about that,

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,310
like the root of a tree
trunk or something. Yes.

109
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,430
It has something to do with
the tree James pulling it up,

110
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,740
but it becomes very dangerous
for those people. Right?

111
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:26,330
Like all that the trafficking becomes
crazy. Yeah. There's they fuck up for us.

112
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:30,020
Like for us are being chopped down. I've
just, just for the people being murdered,

113
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,940
it's like, it's heavy duty
stuff for us. Um, I dunno,

114
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,800
I googled it and just look at
images and that's what popping up.

115
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,170
Maybe it was a place Mtma
Cambodia trees at Sassafras.

116
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay. Maybe that is Sassafras
and SEF. Rolly Sassafras. Yeah,

117
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,960
I guess it Sassafras Dude. It's a
whatever. Whatever that plan is.

118
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,910
They take the see if that just Google
vice, uh, the making of ecstasy.

119
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,470
Cause I'm pretty sure vice to
this. But could you go with
that please? I think, uh,

120
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,430
vice had a special on that.

121
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,520
I wonder what would happen if he just
ate it raw. I wonder, can you do that?

122
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,480
Um,
is there a special,

123
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,130
okay,

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,963
what does it say?

125
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,080
Okay.

126
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,760
The truth about ecstasy.
Yeah.

127
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:22,761
So is there some sort of a vice episode
where they grow this stuff anyway?

128
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,710
Um,

129
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,710
this should be something that's not
distributed by criminals were in ski masks

130
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:30,830
like you've seen in this video.

131
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,670
Should it be something distributed
by stores and they should be doctors?

132
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,441
And if you wanted it,

133
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,090
you could have a rave where you even
have medical centers in the rave.

134
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,200
We keep people from
overdosing. Yeah. When,

135
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,050
when they're the transitionary period
from people going from drugs being totally

136
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:49,430
illegal to some drugs having
massive benefits. Like if
you're, you go to a club,

137
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:52,780
right? And everyone there is, c'mon,
we're doing shots were doing shots,

138
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,850
the whole fucking bars getting wasted
and drunk. Everybody's fine with that.

139
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,690
But you're not fine with a club where
everybody does a small amount of ecstasy.

140
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,320
Well, why can't you do that? Well, that's
drugs. Well, the other one's drugs too.

141
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:06,650
He just used to those drugs.
Once we get past that hurdle,

142
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,680
and it might take a whole generation
before people get used to places where you

143
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:14,570
can go, one drug gets you
violent, one drug makes you
want to have sex, but listen,

144
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,630
you're not going to stop that drug.
Here's my point. It's a powerful,

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,410
really useful drug. People going to find
out about it. It's an amazing experience.

146
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,110
They're going to do it.
So what's the best way to handle that?

147
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,780
Best way to handle is make it safe,
make it legal,

148
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,590
make it regulated so they know what
actually is in each one of these fucking

149
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:34,550
pills and you're not getting it from
some pimp or some asshole or some fucking

150
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:38,300
crazy dude is stuffed in and a balloon
put it up as asshole and made it across

151
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:40,730
the border with it. You don't know where
the fuck you're getting this stuff.

152
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,230
All sorts of shit. All sorts of shit.
Amphetamines and all sorts of crazy shit,

153
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,660
and people die from it because they
don't know what the fuck is in there.

154
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,650
Here it is. Yeah. Um, okay.

155
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:56,100
It says a boy and load a, p. R.

156
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,160
E w p. H. E n. O. M. Trees.

157
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,880
Murray prove Phnom trees
and Cambodia and the,

158
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,120
they're found in
Cambodia's. Oh, Sassafras.

159
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,760
The factory has been set up
to distill Sassafras oil,

160
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,890
a process by boiling the roots and the
trunk of the exceptionally rare plant. Oh,

161
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,860
they're really rare trees
to, wow. How crazy is that?

162
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,170
How many of these fucking trees?
Or like in the middle of the rain forest?

163
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:19,870
So we don't know about.
