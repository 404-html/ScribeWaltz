1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,230
Yeah, no, I was looking at that. What's
that crazy lady's name? Laura Loomer.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,270
The lady jumping Nancy Pelosi's fence.
Oh yeah, she uh, camped out on her yard.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,220
You know what made me think like how
flux Nancy Polosi you own that house.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,030
Where's she getting all that cash?
Yeah. What's her net worth now?

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,220
A couple of hundred million. Really?
I forget to do what she in business.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,610
She came from a hardcore political
family in Baltimore, I think.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,360
And there's so much dirty money
she's been doing. She's, what?

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,170
100 million.
I was waiting on us.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,500
She's worth 100 million estimated,
but that's like,

10
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,310
I don't know if it's a one
of those online network.

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,240
Where does she get her money from?
Oh, you gotta be Shit. You know what?

12
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:48,150
Maybe she's good at Jack around
Jamie keeping her a per diem.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,080
Per Diem? Yeah. What do you mean what is
the, what's her national annual salary?

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,430
Well, she just started getting it for
this job. Wouldn't it be a 450 gram?

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,210
Wow. No, no, that's, that's
the net worth of five.

16
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,840
Which net worth or a median net worth
now this persons, okay. Congress person.

17
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,950
So it can't be anything
higher than an sis something.

18
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:15,951
So it's probably not more than 186 all
her good work she did with the Clinton

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,410
Foundation. Oh, speaker of the
house gets (220) 300-0200 grand.

20
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,550
She's where the hundred million dollars.
What in the holy fuck is that?

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,740
How has that, and she does have
a big wall around it. Please.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,290
Not enough to keep Laura.
Laura Loomer is not an athlete.

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,820
Steve's right over that son of a mess.

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,540
It's not like she's a par core
athletes. Fuck. Did she get over that?

25
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,470
You show up with some illegals,
illegal immigrants or whatever,

26
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,310
undocumented workers, whatever issues.
She chained herself to Twitter.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,270
I know she did that to that broads. That's
right. She's going hard for attention.

28
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,640
It's, it's very
interesting when these, uh,

29
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,670
these people just try so hard
to make it into the news. Yeah.

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,220
Well they're looking
for a contributor slot.

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,220
They're looking for on one
network or another. I think
that's what they're doing.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,480
You have to now a days. I think that that,
I think, at least my theory is anyway,

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,580
if you want to be a paid
contributor for a network, no,

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,630
it doesn't matter which network.
You'll got to stake out a position, uh,

35
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:15,360
that involve some crazy,
right?

36
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:19,020
You've got to be like you how they get
be all in for president Trump or you've

37
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,800
got gotta be all out. If you live in
the center, that ain't happening. Right.

38
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,000
Nobody wants to hear from anybody in the
middle because that Shit's not picking

39
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:31,510
up the ratings at all. So no one wants
reasonable middle right now. No. No.

40
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,580
The only time that I think reasonable
middle would ever work out as if the two

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,310
ends are so fucked up and they're
fighting so hard on the opposite end,

42
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,990
it's like someone's like, God, surely
he's got to be a reasonable middle.

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
And then someone comes along.

44
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,530
It's almost like the people
gotta be screaming for it,

45
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:50,940
but right now it doesn't seem like people
are screaming for centrist position.

46
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,190
It's like a war one trench
warfare. Right. I mean, that's,

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,560
that's the way it is with the government.
Shut down right now and I'll close.

48
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,890
He's sitting over here in the mud and
president Trump's sitting here in the mud

49
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,650
and nobody's given any ground
and they're just stare,

50
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:05,620
just occasionally taking a shot at
each other, throwing a hand grenade,

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,670
and nobody is making any, any
movement. So I, you know, again,

52
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,710
how do they shut the, or how do
they stop the shutdown? You can't,

53
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:17,890
if you're not talking, if you're not,
if there's, if there's no effort, you,

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,340
it's not going to happen. So everybody's
looking at this right now and thinking,

55
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,740
you know, where's it go? It's affecting
the markets. It makes us look like morons.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,310
Uh, I mean, not that others aren't.
I mean, look at, look at Britain,

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,760
right with the Brexit thing. Look at
France with the yellow vests. Look at the,

58
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,630
you know, Germany's having a tissue.
So you know, everybody's having some,

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,900
some problems, but you know, we
didn't need to add to the noise.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,220
John Stossel had an interesting video
that he put out where he's saying,

61
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,490
what this does actually highlight is
that there's a lot of things that the

62
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,211
government does.

63
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:52,150
It really should probably be privatized
and we wouldn't have these issues.

64
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,650
Does that, I mean, it Kinda
made sense to me, but I don't
know a lot. Yeah, no, I, I'm,

65
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,380
I'm a small government person. At the
end of the day, I think, you know,

66
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,800
there's certain things that we need
to rely on the government for a,

67
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,870
and one of them would be of course,
national security. Terrific. You know,

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,340
collection of federal taxes. Okay, fine.
That they're going to do that regardless,

69
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,130
but otherwise just stay out of my kitchen.
Right. Don't, don't, you know, and so,

70
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,850
and that's why I've always been surprised
me that the Republican's problem I got

71
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:18,730
with them is,
you know,

72
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:22,360
you can't sit around and argue for small
government and then try to tell people

73
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,750
what to do with their bodies or who can
get married and who can't get married.

74
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,920
Who the fuck cares? Right. Just don't,
don't hurt people. Be a good person.

75
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,050
Get on with it. I don't need to
celebrate your lifestyle, but just do it.

76
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,620
I really don't care. I don't expect
you to care about my lifestyle.

77
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,700
I don't care about yours.

78
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,240
But the Republicans have always stuck
their nose in this and your key.

79
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,960
You can't make that argument for, for
wanting small government and you know if,

80
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,450
if you just want to step into
people's bedrooms all the time,

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,400
it doesn't make any sense.

82
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,720
And I think the only reason why they do
it is because it gets people excited.

83
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,400
They get to run to, to, to vote for them.

84
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,890
I think when they take these positions,

85
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,010
it's not like these are really having an
effect on their lives or at some moral

86
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,920
stand that they must take
because God wants them to do it.

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,420
I think they do it because they
think that it's going to get,

88
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,670
it's going to shift the pole one way
or another and it's going to get people

89
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,330
excited about them possibly making some
sort of a difference that they feel is

90
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,780
going to significantly
affect their position. But
do you ever get to the point,

91
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,940
I mean I don't know whether
that's going to happen,

92
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:26,320
but you would think that you've got the
people on the hard right in the hard

93
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:28,840
left. They're not going to shift.
Right. That's not going to happen.

94
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,920
You're not going to move those people.

95
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:33,910
So like everybody always talks about
decisions are made by that small group in

96
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,440
the center. So at what point did
the group in the center find it?

97
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,790
Put their hands up and go, you
guys are all fucked up. Right?

98
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,470
How about a third party that's legitimate,

99
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,310
not a libertarian party because
that's hasn't been working out. Um,

100
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,930
but something that creates a little bit
of a different dynamic and we're never

101
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:53,980
going to get term limits. So that's, you
know, tilting at windmills but maybe,

102
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,460
you know, maybe we get that multiparty
thing going that uh, again. Okay.

103
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,500
[inaudible] it's pie
in the sky. Well, crap.

104
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,420
Closest we ever got to it was Ross Perot,
right? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah,

105
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,860
he was,
it was a piece of work,

106
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,360
but we took out a whole,
he took a block of time,

107
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:13,790
I believe it was a half an
hour on national television.

108
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,490
He bought the time to explain
how you're getting fucked. Yeah.

109
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,690
And explained taxes and explain all these
different things and, and people like,

110
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:28,190
wait, what? That's how it works. It's good
TV. If I can go back and find it. It's,

111
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,950
it's Ross Perot was good TV. I'll
show you what I'm doing here. Yeah,

112
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,560
I see. That's all that's all
fucked up. And here's Reagan. Fuck.
