1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,960
Lady gentleman, black helicopters
have been spotted. Yeah.

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:06,720
Nobody balls harder than them.
Yeah. It's pretty out of control.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,730
Every week goes Ferrari's, Bentley's
Lamborghinis. There's like ridiculous.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,300
There's cars that I feel like it
would be ridiculous to show up.

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,220
Why about one of those Bentley's that
they have or one of those Bugattis rather

6
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,150
than they have as a police car for sure.
It's in Santa Ana.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,660
Two and a half million bucks. Yeah. So
much. I think flug mother has like six.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,290
He has so many. He's hilarious. His
building habits are hilarious. I love him.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,770
And he's got like a whole fleet of list
in white. He's like white is right.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,830
I got a bunch of two though.
Man. Does gang or cars? Oh Man.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,120
You owe that money to the IRS.

12
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,510
Wanted to just give him a few
thoughts because he went so deep.

13
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:50,400
So how much does he owe? Well, uh,
it's more than you want to pay.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,540
It's in the 20 plus million dollar
range. It's a lot of money, man.

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,920
But it's not something that he's
been, uh, it's not like deception.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,270
No, it's just neglect to, to pick
black. And it's also like, I think,

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,120
and there is like a truth to this,
he makes so much money.

18
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,360
There's probably a point when they're
like, hey, it's time to pay your taxes.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,130
And you go like, all right,
here's a check for $25 million.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,190
That's an incredible amount of
money. And then they go, that's true,

21
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:21,600
but you owe 50 more. And he's just
like, that's, that can't be right.

22
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,610
I've got $25 million. Yeah. Like
what are you talking about man?

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,300
He's bought over a hundred luxury cars
and the same dealer and always pays and

24
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:35,000
cat oh areas. I love it. 15
million worth of car congratulated.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,890
She doesn't drive. I like it.
Good. You could sell those.

26
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,260
They're worth a lot of money. He can get
that money to, you know, it's um, it's,

27
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,040
it's just, it's, it's,

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,640
he's really interesting in the amount
of money that is able to generate,

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,010
you know, he's figured out
some pretty incredible shit.

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,180
He's a great villain to man.
Oh,

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,730
he's just brilliant at it and he's
just a brilliant defensive boxer. Oh,

32
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,190
skill wise.
Off the charts off the truck.

33
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:04,191
We're saying that guy should get more
credit for what he does as a skilled

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,420
businessman and psychological warrior.

35
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,940
Like he should get a lot more credit for
it. Yeah, I think so too. I think it's,

36
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,520
it's arguable that,
you know,

37
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,760
he's enjoying it and he let enjoys
playing the villain role and enjoys like

38
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,950
flashed on the money and if
he is really enjoying it,

39
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:23,850
like don't you love that and respect that,
that fucking thing. What is that car?

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,050
That thing looks amazing.
My new 4.4 what is it?

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,460
A CCX XR. Is that a con of Sig?
Yeah. I didn't say that cone.

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,410
That's a word that I've never said. I
Amy me. I can't say it. I love him too,

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,530
that he starts his post with the amount,

44
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,030
like to remind people that my new car.
Yeah, my new four point $8 million car.

45
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
You think you say that Koeneke Sig
Koenigsegg clinics coincide coding,

46
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,930
coding, coding, cone Ne Koenigsegg.

47
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,910
Jesus Christ. Koenigsegg CC.
That's a ridiculous name.

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,080
Change the name. The car is dope. You're
working same correction. I think so.

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,900
Yeah. Working during this fight. Oh yeah.

50
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm in d c both still working during this
fight. You were headed already. Me Too.

51
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,400
I already booked way in advance.
Now it's my dad's birthday.

52
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:19,780
I'm going to a big birthday celebration
and I tried to avoid finding out what

53
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:24,340
happened and then watching. No, it depends
man. It's I we haven't, I don't know.

54
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,470
I'm going to gauge also his
interest in it. You know?

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,680
I always try to get home before I find
out anything or watch it before I find

56
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,490
out anything and I always fail to do
so. You always think, can I give it?

57
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,120
I give any temptation it happened. I know
how to, I know it's hard. I go online.

58
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,090
Let me check real quick.
Yeah. Am I worthwhile?

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,020
Like what if they tell me it's a
five round boring decision, you know,

60
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,890
have a title fight on.
This one's going to be 12 rounds boxing.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,940
I know it's going to be, it's exciting
event. It's one of those like you,

62
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,920
you'll remember like the excitement
to tune in. So I think we,

63
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:58,360
we were going to want to watch it.
You know Conor McGregor is a magic person.

64
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,410
Yeah.

65
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,410
Like legitimately I to get this many
people so hyped up about this fight.

66
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,530
Yeah. It's not just about
his performances, his fights.

67
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,400
It's also about like wanting to believe
that there's a dude who could pull it

68
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,460
all off. Yeah. It's like a magic person.

69
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,430
Do you feel like in the lead up to
the fight, like as we get closer,

70
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,440
your opinion on it has changed at all? Oh
yeah. I'm a sucker for a good hype job,

71
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:26,800
dude. That's why I'm a good
hype man. Right, right. Yeah.

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,620
I'm a sucker for believing
all that stupid shit.

73
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:38,840
Okay.
