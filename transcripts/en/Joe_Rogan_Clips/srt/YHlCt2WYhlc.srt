And available right now. Everlast
Whitey Ford House of Payne. You.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,390
Yes sir. How are you sir? How are
you doing man? See your brothers.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,860
Because the minute you going to Vegas
this weekend for the fights. Yeah man,

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,270
we got a little party the night before.

5
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:17,271
We were doing a little show
at the Brooklyn Bowl with
my buddy evidence and cell

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,380
phones. You don't, the way
I would put the headphones,

7
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,000
I feel like I'm alone here with the
headphones on it. There we go. Here we go.

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,730
Now we're on the same team. Now
we're locked in. Um, does this out?

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,120
This is out right? Yeah, it came out about
three weeks ago, something like that.

10
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:33,290
Maybe a month. Beautiful. I've been
in Europe for the home. Lunch is torn.

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:38,291
So this is like everything Everlast
presents Whitey Ford's house of pain.

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,020
Yeah. It's, it's, you know,
it's everything in the toolbox
I brought to this record.

13
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,810
So that's Kinda where the title
came from. Just, you know,

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,840
it's been eight years since
my last real studio album, so

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,330
I figured, hey, maybe this
could be the last one. I hope
not. Buttons, just like I,

16
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:57,810
you know, I mean like, you know, that my
story is like, you know, with the family,

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,410
I dedicate a lot more of my time to the
family than I used, you know? Yeah. Um,

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,250
just cause of some of the, you
know, um, extra issues we deal with,

19
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:08,400
which everything is wonderful and
great. Now, you know, and dude,

20
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,540
I'm 30 pounds lighter than the
last time I was here. I honestly,

21
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:16,920
it started here because I put,
I purposely came here that day.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,750
It was the first time, if you remember,
it just, it was wild garden and gun,

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,620
a thousand podcasts
since that day. But, uh,

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,500
it was the first time I had come out
and they started talking about anything

25
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:30,470
like, you know, that was going on in my
life in a public way. And uh, you know,

26
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:30,910
and I,

27
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,910
I got a lot off my chest that day and I
also planned that day to put myself in a

28
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,930
position to hold myself
accountable by this, by stating I,

29
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,810
I don't feel good about
the way I look right now.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,690
And I reached out for like,
theoretically for help, you know,

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,230
and I got an incredible response from
the podcast audience and my own fans.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,290
I mean, I got offered from
everybody everywhere how to do this,

33
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:59,610
that and the other. Um, didn't really
need that because within my own circle,

34
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:03,510
some people stepped up and I also did it
to hold myself accountable to put it in

35
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,780
the universe. Like I've thrown
it out there now. Like I,

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,390
I put it up there on the wall
and, and, and stamped it and said,

37
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,940
here's what I want out of life right now.
And you know,

38
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:15,870
there's nobody stopping me but me and at
sometimes some of the things I used to,

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,010
I used to get on and see
you talking about the,

40
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,430
I'm not letting this inner
bitch kicked my ass today.

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,210
And I just started taking things like
that to heart, you know? And again,

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,110
after you change,

43
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:29,370
what did you do different that we started
talking about it last time. Therapy,

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,940
you know what I mean has helped a lot for
me because of this, you know, the, the,

45
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:34,770
the added pressures are family faces.

46
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,820
With my oldest daughter having
cystic fibrosis, you know,

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,930
it just for a long time it
was just learning how to
live life with it, you know?

48
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:46,290
And that got heavy. There was some
real dark heavy moments, you know,

49
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,960
scary moments for her in the
hospital. You know, so we,

50
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,220
I mean as a human or you know,

51
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:55,221
you have this baby and you're just trying
to figure out how to not screw it up

52
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:59,830
with a normal health situation,
you know, this is this thing.

53
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,970
So it took a long time for me to come
to terms. At first I got really angry,

54
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,870
I got into some real, you know,
Lieutenant Dan war with God kind of stuff,

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,670
you know, at the top of the
sail boat flip, you know,
as I was there all the way.

56
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,560
And it got to a point where I almost,

57
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,960
I was that I almost got locked up for
trying to fight a cop that was, you know,

58
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,290
trying to just talk to me about something,
you know, and I just lost. I was,

59
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,124
I had no,

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,970
I had so much anger over so
much that I wasn't dealing with.

61
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,380
And then I found a guy that just
really got me therapists and, and it,

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,890
it began the, the, the, the ball
rolling of understanding how to,

63
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,140
how to cope with a lot of that stuff,
you know? Wow. So, um, as far as like,

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,410
first of all, you look really good.
They thanks, your face looks great,

65
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:48,250
your skin looks good. I'm taking a lot
better care of myself. It looks like it.

66
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,730
Thank you. What are you doing different
as far as like how you eat or,

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm just eating cleaner, you know,
and just trying not to, you know, uh,

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
to be more aware of what's in the food
and listening to meet and stuff. You know,

69
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm still part of the whole commercial
meat system though. I long to, to,

70
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,560
to get it to a situation where I'm hunting
and doing things like that. It's just,

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,220
we had talked about that for a while.
You want her to try hunting pigs to hone.

72
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:13,360
Right. I asked you what would be the
best starting point and you were like,

73
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,190
you know, they got bore up there.
Well to hone and I know some guys and,

74
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:20,680
and I actually contacted them and I, you
know, I just, again, this light so busy,

75
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,830
it's not just this, it's the, it's
the added stress of like, you know,

76
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,630
I have a wife that when I go on the road,

77
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:29,350
she's the sole handled her of these
problems. You know what I mean?

78
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,160
And so that these things, you know,
pile on you guilt and this, you know,

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,340
stress and all this, you
know? Yeah. And, um, so yeah,

80
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,400
it's just between that and when I'm home,
I just invest myself. I want to be home.

81
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,440
I want to do as much as I
can to lift that weight.

82
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,410
So like I get caught up by the things,
all the things I want to do,

83
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,050
I can't do all the time, you know
what I mean? But it started again.

84
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,430
Now I'm taking care of myself.

85
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,670
Like I'm actually just about to start
Jujitsu again, you know, which I'm, yeah.

86
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,750
Because I forever,

87
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,080
I was so goddamn fat in the middle of the
hip escapes where like, you know, every,

88
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,600
I was hurting my back or my neck.
Every other time I tried to do,

89
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,940
I just quit because it was
getting, you know, I mean,

90
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,320
I mean I wasn't super advanced.

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,780
I was probably pretty close to
getting a blue belt. You know,

92
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,550
I was about a year in, on like four
lessons a week with just the private,

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,910
I was with mark as Vanessa said,
Beverly Hills Jujitsu for awhile.

94
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,780
So now I'm just looking to see
what I want to do. You know,

95
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,120
I've talked to Eddie a few times,
I'm talking to a few other guys.

96
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,400
Cron has thrown my way.

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
Doing any exercise at
all besides that cardio,

98
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,000
not much weights or anything like that.
Just, you know, keeping it moving.

99
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,930
I two hours, two hours
on stage tonight. Right.

100
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,920
It's good to do something first.
Uh,

101
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,460
I feel like I always
tell people like Jujitsu,

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,280
so grueling that I think a why,

103
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,880
I mean you could just jump in and you
will get in shape through Jujitsu,

104
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,910
but a good thing to do is like find a
place that teaches you kettlebells and

105
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,020
take some kettlebell classes and just,

106
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,140
just get your body strong
enough that it can.

107
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,590
I remember one of the things Marcus
used to do brought Marcus used to run me

108
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,720
around the gym for 30 minutes
before we could even start a lesson.

109
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,800
Like I literally had to Puke
for the first like month. Yeah.

110
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:04,220
That's that old school way a lot.

111
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:07,010
And then it would take so long
that he would be like, all right,

112
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,680
you're past the puke and thing you
ran and what I mean, but it was like,

113
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,750
at first I would like literally
be run till I was puke.

114
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:17,330
And then the crazy part about it is this
15 minutes after you felt great when

115
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:20,040
you were doing the last thing. So
it was, and I'll work. Yeah, those,

116
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,280
there's the old school guys, that's how
they used to do it. They used to, um,

117
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,880
like all the old school
Carlson Gracie classes,

118
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,010
you'd have a grueling physical workout,
first hip escape, push ups, sit ups,

119
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,840
body weight squats,
all this different stuff.

120
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,530
There's a good thought process behind
that. Not just that it gets you in shape,

121
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:40,850
but also that you learn how to do Jiu
Jitsu when you're tired so that you learn

122
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:43,860
how to just use technique and
not use like physical strength.

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,150
You're almost having no choice
but to relax. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,430
There's a people that
disagree with that though.

125
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:53,900
They think you learn technique when
you're fresh in it, like sits and better,

126
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,560
but it's just two different
schools of thought, you know?
I don't think he either.

127
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,220
One is right.

128
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,300
It's definitely good to understand
what it's like to be tired and how to,

129
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:06,530
how to train and how to, how to push
yourself when you're tired. Sure. Yeah.

130
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm excited.
I'm really looking forward to it.

131
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:11,570
Like I just started talking about
it like about two weeks ago.

132
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:14,240
Really getting back, well, that's
a lot of weight to lose, man.

133
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,230
That's a big accomplishment. I've got
15 to go to really to hit my goal. Yeah.

134
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,910
Hold it be to 25 to 25.
Good weight. Yeah. Um,

135
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,010
are you taking vitamins or supplements
or anything along those lines?

136
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,670
Like a daily, um, but I, you know,

137
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,820
I have restrictions because I take blood
thinners and stuff cause it's titanium

138
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:32,654
heart valve I have,

139
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,700
I have to have a vitamin that's devoid
of a vitamin K because that's what makes

140
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,420
your blood clot.

141
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,900
So I like a lot of things like a lot of
the juicing things and like things like

142
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,010
that.
When you want to go on a juice cleanse,

143
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,690
I can't do it cause it's like a lot of
it's Kale based and like Kale is a heavy

144
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:48,021
green.

145
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:52,120
Whether it's high in vitamin K it'll
totally like screw up my blood chemistry,

146
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,020
you know, cause I'm going
the other direction with
blood thinners. Jesus Christ,

147
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,410
I have to otherwise like a clock could
hit like stick to that titanium valve,

148
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,480
break off and wind up in my brain,
you know what I mean?

149
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:06,560
And then Tom stroked out and that's
the last thing we need. Fuck yeah.

150
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,690
I remember when you put the microphone
up to your heart and you can hear that.

151
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,880
Yeah.
I would say I'm so,

152
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:14,150
so like when I'm in here I've keep
feeling like you can hear it anyway.

153
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,180
It's like all through this, I hear
it. 20 this white noise to me,

154
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,160
if I want to hear it,
I can hear,

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,140
I can take my pulse like this just
by telling you, wow. Two, three.

156
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,680
You could feel it.
I can hear it in my own skull.

157
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,740
Like I could hear it in my
bones, I can hear it. It's in me.

158
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,050
How long is that good for ever? Forever.
Forever. As long as I take care of him.

159
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:35,310
I was, I mean it's been
20 years. Literally in,

160
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,230
in 2018 it happened. 90 or [inaudible]
98. Wow. And, um, I just get, you know,

161
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,830
as long as I keep the thin, the blood
thinners going and, and you know,

162
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,230
that get checked in, you know, two
times, three times a year, you know,

163
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,910
and then the blood thinners it because
if you got a clot it would somehow or

164
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:53,320
another get stuck in that val
clock could like, or, or you know,

165
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,120
it's a titanium valves, the clock could
actually form on it that the metal,

166
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,320
like it could the book, if
it's the blood's too sticky
into co has too much clod,

167
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:05,220
he could stick to the bow then break off
and then wind up in your brain. Whoa.

168
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,070
You know? So what does do avoid
blood clots in general? Yeah.

169
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,360
What's the difference between
that and the RECO regular valve?

170
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,640
What would happen with a regular oven?

171
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,490
The other choice would have been a pig
valve and those are good for about 15

172
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,300
years. Like they usually open
you up again? Yeah, I would
have had to have it done.

173
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,400
I'd probably be do. Yeah. I probably right
now too, like I'd be like, go here I go.

174
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,530
Yeah. Yeah. They do that for older people
is what they do. Could like, you know,

175
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,320
when you get into your sixties they,
you know,

176
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,130
really explore that because they don't
think you're going to be around 50 more

177
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,250
rice, you know, they just say,
well here, just for now. Yeah,

178
00:09:37,251 --> 00:09:41,550
so it was called a saint Jude's
St Jude's artificial valve.

179
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,980
Powerful medical technology. Eddie Bravo
has got a titanium disk in his back now.

180
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,820
Yeah. He just had a surgery this right?
Yeah. His back moves around. Great.

181
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,910
It like he was fully compressed
whether it was like nothing left.

182
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,290
It was basically bone on bone.

183
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:59,370
He was in pain all the time and they just
opened them up and put a fake valve in

184
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:02,160
there. That's crazy. Were
fake desk rather in there,

185
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,900
but it's articulating so like moves
around like a regular desk. Like he's his,

186
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,260
it doesn't, it's not like he's fused.
Even if you're seeing people that are off.

187
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,800
I have a friend that got that
down. Yeah, they're super stiff.

188
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,180
Like wherever it is is basically locked
down. There's no movement to it anymore,

189
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,570
but Eddie's is actually,
it moves like a real disk.

190
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,110
It shit that's going to be coming down
the pipeline. It's going to be crazy, man.

191
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,330
Yeah. I mean, I know people
with fake everything.

192
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:31,860
I know people with fake hips and fake
knees and what's fake? Heart valves.

193
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,160
Heart valves. Yeah. Yeah.
It's amazing. I mean.
