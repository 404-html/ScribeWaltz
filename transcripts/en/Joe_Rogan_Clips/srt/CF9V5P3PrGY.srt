1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,580
Well you can say people of color,
the same words just twisted around dude,

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:05,960
I had a um,
it's messed up.

3
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:10,820
It's like you can just be like labeled
a racist or sexist or whatever for like

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:13,800
saying like the Oh yeah,
yeah, it's wild. Um,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,360
I had 23 and me DNA
tests done and the lows,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,860
they're pretty good and I was hoping
if I was, if I was more than 10% black,

7
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:26,300
I was going to start dropping n bombs,
but a 1.6,

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,370
so 1.6 1.6% African pretty strong.
It's all Dick.

9
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,850
And I thought,

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,300
well when they did that thing about
Elizabeth Warren or I did find out what

11
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,350
percentage she is,
uh,

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,030
Elizabeth Warren who claim to be
native American and she did a test,

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,840
she's like one,
one,

14
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,440
100th of what I am.
Like,

15
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:53,600
it's literally like her saying she's,
yeah,

16
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:58,601
her saying she's and a native American
is literally like me saying I'm African

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,750
American,
but I have more of a claim.

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,180
I have far more like more than
I think some some insane number,

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,430
like a factor of more African in me
that she has native American and I'm not

20
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:20,300
even remotely native Americans are
not remotely African rather. Yeah,

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,900
I'm 1.6% I have 1.6% African in me and
she has like some fucking really stupid

22
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,090
number.
What is the dumb,

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,350
it's like 0.01 I don't even know
how to make sense of all that stuff

24
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,040
she had.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,040
That was how it happened was a Harvard
researcher looked into it and gave a

26
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:43,910
number that was very vague.

27
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:48,911
That would be like one and
512th two one and 1020 fourth

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,920
something like that. That sucks
dude. It's so crazy socks.

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,540
That's the thing like something I Google,
it gives a shit,

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,390
but she got into Harvard because of this,

31
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:04,470
which she claimed she was
native American when she got in.

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,260
That was claiming that she was a
minor one was Harvard, right? Correct.

33
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,640
I'm being honest with that. What
was it? Cambridge, whatever.

34
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:16,140
The university is showing him some
university by claiming that she was native

35
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,480
American, so she got a special
scholarship because of that.

36
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,440
The whole man literally lasted like
me going to Morehouse and saying,

37
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:26,550
I'm African American,
except I have a far better claim.

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,070
You have a much higher percentage,
much higher.

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,450
That's so crazy. Wild. Meanwhile,

40
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:37,590
she's so nuts like because Trump was
always calling her Pocahontas and Trump

41
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,160
said that of shit.
How is it that you can't,

42
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,760
if you said the wrong thing on your
podcasts, people will be up in arms,

43
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,280
but it's unreasoned. The president can
say whatever the hell he wants to say.

44
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,850
He's making fun of her shit ever
tending to be a native American.

45
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,400
He was joking about heart.

46
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:55,530
She's not really native American and he
called her Pocahontas and he said if she

47
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:58,260
took a DNA test and showed
that she was native American,

48
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,080
he would donate $1 million to a
charity of her choice. So she,

49
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:07,081
after this fucking test that basically
showed she has these smallest measurable

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,710
possibility,

51
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,170
native American in her
was requiring him to pay.

52
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,240
You should pay Harvard for what?

53
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,370
You fucking the money
back built from them.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,350
Where at school that she go to trying
to find the actual thing it seems,

55
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,960
I think she actually got a job at Harvard.
Not,

56
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,060
didn't go there for your education.
Oh,

57
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,260
she got a job there and because of trying
to find out, okay, we'll figure it out.

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,630
But that's hilarious.

59
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,670
I the I the idea that that is something
you can lean on is so god damn crazy.

60
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,480
Listen, you're a white
lady. I'm a white guy.

61
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,780
Shut the fuck up. Okay.
You're not, there's no,

62
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,100
there's not a part of you that has been
discriminated against because of the

63
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,310
fact that you're native American. It
just doesn't exist. It's not true.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,940
It's just us. So fascinating to
me. Oh, people love to be a victim.

65
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,290
They'd love to say,
you know,

66
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,380
it was my life growing up was hard
because I'm one 150000th native American

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,950
busy. Crazy. And where does it
stop? Like is it, is it, is it,

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,620
is it cool to say that if you're 2% or
10% or 50% like where is it? Where is it?

69
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,670
That's what I'm saying. At 1.6% I really
don't feel like it could drop n bombs.

70
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:29,650
Right?
10 it's not 10% like I'm mostly Italian.

71
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm like three quarters Italian so
I can call someone a Guinea Guinea,

72
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,040
no problem. But get the times, don't give
a fuck if you call them guineas. Yeah.

73
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,933
Like,
okay.

74
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,270
Like just know Bailey is no
good slurs for Italians work.

75
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,710
You know, they've successfully
integrated into society.

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,840
But when my grandfather
used to tell me about,

77
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:54,010
he came over here when he was a boy from
Italy and he would tell me about how

78
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:58,050
bad it was about how much they were
discriminated against. You know, I'm just,

79
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,870
it was, it was hardcore. I mean they
were treated a lot of the same way.

80
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:06,160
Racist People Treat Mexicans today. And
Irish, same thing. Same thing. Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,070
And that's,
my background is Italian and Irish mostly,

82
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,600
but someone got fucked by a black
person somewhere, somewhere.

83
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,580
1.6% I don't know how
many generations there.

84
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,160
I guess the claim is that she used her
claim that she's native American to get a

85
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:25,630
job. Yes. Not, not to get it out to
go into school, get a job at Harvard,

86
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,080
at one at Harvard, one at
Pennsylvania. So she did it twice.

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,440
Give that money back, bitch. I love the
DNA test though. I love the DNA test.

88
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,750
It just proves it. We're all
like something. We're all a
bunch of shit like, yeah.

89
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,660
You know what I mean?
I'm like 30 things.
