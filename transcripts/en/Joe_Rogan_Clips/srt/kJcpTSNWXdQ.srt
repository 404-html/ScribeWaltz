1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,320
You know what the best ones, like
all of them. Most of my friends,

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:08,050
we all got busted for drinking
and driving. The best one
was a buddy of mine. Uh,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,400
they read his, who's like, you know,
approximately four in the morning,

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,600
we noticed a Maroon VW, Fox blowing
its horn trying to pass on the right.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,870
We pulled the defendant over,
uh,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,580
after repeatedly asking the defendant to
stay in the car. He got out of the car,

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,590
threw his keys at my feet and uh,
repeatedly stated, lock me up.

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:29,424
I'm fucked.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,120
And this was funny was my buddy was a
good look can guy and though the judge was

10
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:45,470
a, was a woman and when the
guy read that, you know,

11
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:48,530
lock me up, I'm fucked up. And he wasn't
the brightest guy and he just kind of,

12
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,710
when he went like, oh, he's like put his
head down like that. And he was, you know,

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,650
a little pound puppy fucking
looking dude. And uh, she, uh, she,

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,020
she gave him like a lighter sentence and
cause he was good looking. I think so,

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,270
yeah. Plays in. It gets why ugly
people are complain so much. Like

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,830
they won't take the time to develop
a fucking personality. Right?

17
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:15,880
Some jokes do it. The rest of us have
to do like I don't get mad at Brad Pitt.

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,430
You know I haven't me fucking cause he's
fucking beautiful. I'm a fucking bald,

19
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:22,264
redheaded mail.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,250
I know where I am in the pecking order
and some of these fucking people who are

21
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:32,251
complaining right now who are mad that
beautiful people get treated differently.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,190
I understand racially speaking, but you're
not going to do the beautiful thing.

23
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,970
And then, then there's another thing
they tried to say. Well Society tries to,

24
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,700
you know, they're the ones that
fucking did like, you know,

25
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,800
like I love when like there's
a supermodel, like the dude,

26
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,610
this is like an impossible standard
of beauty to try and live up to. Yeah,

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,590
yeah, yeah. That's why she's on the
cover of a magazine. She's that level.

28
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:54,250
Beautiful.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,140
And you're going to try and sit there
and tell me that that was learned. Well,

30
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:03,910
here's the thing that's only women because
when you see Jason Mamoa playing aqua

31
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,823
man,

32
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,680
you don't hear men say that's
an impossible standard of
beauty that we have to,

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,430
no, I just make fun of it. It's fucking
stupid that tries to, hang on sir.

34
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:15,843
Okay.

35
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,040
I don't care how much you can kick my ass.
That is the dumbest shoes.

36
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,810
Me On a fucking serial box.
It's a trident.

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,500
For years they had a problem like with
aqua man. It's like he's in the ocean.

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,060
Human beings are on earth like, what do
we like? I have to see that fucking movie.

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,690
What are they going to be? Is it going
to be like Japanese people like fitting?

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,950
He's busy going to save sharp. He
goes under water. Is that a skin?

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,330
Well, the bumps. What is that? Is that a
suit? It doesn't water get in the gloves.

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,290
I think that that have to be
all one piece, right? Yeah.

43
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,140
You'd be annoying as shit is any worse
than water and your gloves will look.

44
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,150
It looks like it catches
them like a water catcher,

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,260
like not just like water gets in
the gloves. It's like a funnel.

46
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,020
He looks like a stripper at a Bachelorette
party. Does a good why she pays

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,970
money. You got a good one.
God dieted down for that. Um,

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,270
yes he did and he got all the ABS.
So he's B's better than I am.

49
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,880
Always this button that says this
is the fall look for one. Yep.

50
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,780
This is when he's in the Black Sea.
You know what I mean?

51
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:18,070
He wants to fucking gets cold. Yeah.
Did you see what's going on in the UK?

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,140
The UK is banned advertisements that
a feature, a unobtainable bodies.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,750
There's a racist tweeted recently. The
way they eat fish and chips over there.

54
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,800
This can be most of advertising.
Well they had these ads for summer bodies.

55
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:36,640
You know, you see a girl in a bikini
and they're now making it illegal.

56
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,840
Why can't you aspire to that?

57
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,860
Like I look at that aqua man guy that
makes me want to go to the gym. I know.

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,960
Oh you know he's got a full head of hair
look like you've got to make me feel

59
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,350
better.

60
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,130
It's because the people that complain
who are the people that complain and the

61
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,290
people that complain to the people that
don't want to work to be that lady,

62
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,900
they don't want to work to get that
kind of a body and they want to,

63
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,610
they just want to not see it.
They don't want any it.

64
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,660
They don't want to go to the subway
and see a body that they never,

65
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,530
yeah,
I saw it.

66
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,200
I saw an actress complaining one time
cause the studio total that she needed to

67
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:10,970
lose 15 pounds and like you
can't drop 15 to star in a movie.

68
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:14,900
I mean what,
what carrot can they specifically carrots,

69
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,340
some veggies in your diet.

70
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,640
What are they have to dangle in front
of you to go to the fucking gym?

71
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:21,800
Like the rest of us, like I
literally like, cause I always say,

72
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:24,260
oh guys not to deal with that.
It's like yeah we do. Of course.

73
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,040
Yes we do like how to deal with that
to gain 20 pounds to forget about him.

74
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,140
If just having five
lines in a fucking movie.

75
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,160
If I am north of 171 72 pounds,
the fucking tweets,

76
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:37,610
I get a Billy booze bag.
Hey Billy Bitch tits,

77
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,460
hey fat,
freckles,

78
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:44,630
all of this shit that I get like I know
like they sit there and they like it.

79
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,480
They had like a,

80
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,220
they're acting like like fucking preteens
where everything is just everything's

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,130
about them and the whole fucking world
gives us shit celebrities with their

82
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,980
fucking political views as the funniest
thing ever. It's like all you're,

83
00:04:57,981 --> 00:05:02,000
you're not, you're not making anybody
changed their mind politically.

84
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,610
I think I need a FAC and
speak up. It's like, no,

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,800
you can't have the
spotlight on you enough.

86
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,070
That's all you're doing because all
you're doing with that bullshit is you.

87
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:10,341
First of all,

88
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:13,040
you're alienating half the fucking people
that are going to go see whatever the

89
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,990
fuck you're in.
And then secondly,

90
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,850
you're just getting on the radar of
lunatics in white vans with two seats that

91
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:22,610
are looking up how to fucking
build pipe bombs like that. That's,

92
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,870
that's the fallout.

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,700
It's like the jerk when he goes to the
average run of the mill, son of a bitch.

94
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:29,870
He had already picked Steve Martin.

95
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,100
The idea that a girl shouldn't
be asked to lose weight,

96
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,610
to look hot for a movie is fucking crazy
because that's what you're playing.

97
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,930
You're playing a hot woman

98
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,000
and there's part of the job and there's
millions to everybody's in shape.

99
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,980
I remember fucking CNI.
He's still a bit about this.

100
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,380
I saw a Ben Stiller in,

101
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,040
in meet the Fockers or something.

102
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,710
There was a scene where he had to
have his shirt off in the pool.

103
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:55,340
He had fucking abs and a
comedy. Yeah. Cause that's,

104
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:58,250
cause you was seeing the influence
for the fucking Internet.

105
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,970
You know what I mean? It goes just like,
you know, he, he gets in your head,

106
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,450
people just fucking trash and you like,
I already knew I was unsightly,

107
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:09,620
but I didn't realize how many things that
people didn't enjoy about until I got

108
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:14,240
on the Internet. I was like, wow, I never
noticed that about myself. So, um, yeah.

109
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:18,260
I don't have 'em. Look if somebody really
has like a fucking eating disorder,

110
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,330
you know, I feel like fucking obese.
I have sympathy for those people.

111
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,400
But you 15 pounds, 20 pounds overweight,
I mean fucking and you know it.

112
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,210
Did he drink some fucking smoothies?

113
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,780
These women that are playing these
roles have to understand first of all,

114
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,540
that part of the reason why you got that
role is not just because of your acting

115
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,510
ability, but also because you're
pretty, you have a beautiful face.

116
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,140
You were born with it. You didn't even
work at it. And then on top of that,

117
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,270
you're supposed to be playing a
beautiful person in the movie.

118
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,740
They would like you to not be fat.

119
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,840
Well, it also, discrimination is millions
of dollars at stake. There could be lost.

120
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,960
So I always feel like your job is Amy,
if you look like me,

121
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,560
is to show up on time knowing your lines
in the best possible shape you could

122
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,440
get yourself in that. That's the role
that's I even if I'm just fucking,

123
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,700
what about your Artie Lange?
What if you're already laying in,

124
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:05,450
you're supposed to play the guy that
smoking cigarettes and you're the brother

125
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,440
in law that's drunk all the time,
then your job is to look that way.

126
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,450
You just slipped away.

127
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,480
Her job is looking at the hot
woman that everybody wants to fuck.

128
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,850
If they're telling you you
have to lose weight and you're,

129
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,820
you're a beautiful woman, it's because
they want to make you more attractive.

130
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,770
It's,
there's not like discrimination.

131
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,480
There's a reason they want
a better product because we
want to make money. Yeah.

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,750
They wanted to try and make
them a better product. And uh,

133
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,970
I'll tell you nothing to like really
that those both male and female,

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,210
like those beautiful people at that level,
it's like they're fucking aliens.

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,340
Like I, I've done a couple of movies. I
did a movie one time and I remember, uh,

136
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:38,941
it was a scene,

137
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:42,570
we were in a car and the star of the
movie was holding onto the steering wheel.

138
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,710
And I was like, I never thought
this ever about a woman. I was like,

139
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,480
her forearms are gorgeous.

140
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,810
I was looking at me like, I was
like, those forearms are perfect,

141
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,380
but I didn't make me when I
went to Stockholm, Sweden,

142
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,150
how beautiful the people were there.

143
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:02,700
I was walking down the street pointing
at guys with my wife, go knit,

144
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,370
look at that guy, look at
that. That fucking guy,

145
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:07,550
like he's like an accountant
walking down the street.

146
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,300
Like does he know if he
fucking came over here?

147
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,960
He'd be starring in movies and
that's not all a Sweden by the way.

148
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:15,690
That's like just when you're in Stockholm,
that's like their Manhattan.

149
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,360
So all the beautiful fucking people.
But I mean I went to a couple of,

150
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,560
I went to this magnet,

151
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:23,460
played in a but like a a magazine or
something like that when I was over there.

152
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,450
And the woman behind the counter
was like a fucking 11 here,

153
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,920
but she was working at a magazine stand.
So that was her energy. Like, hey,

154
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:35,190
how are you doing?
I'm working in magazines.

155
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,760
Then my dream hasn't come true yet.
And you just looking at him like you,

156
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:42,700
you could sign with the WHO's
that big a modeling agency. Yeah.

157
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,180
Like that all like Cindy Crawford

158
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,690
and all of them are worth back in the
day, the Vikings, it's viking blood.

159
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,450
They the best looking people.
They,

160
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:53,630
they went over there and
raped and pillaged and all
that good DNA is left there.

161
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,250
They cut the best.
They kept him alive.

162
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,320
Killed everybody else. Oh,
is that what happened? Yeah.
I don't know what happened.

163
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,860
That's why they're so big. Beautiful.
Oh yeah. No, this super small.

164
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,930
That's one of the funniest things happen
when you go over to the, to like, uh, the,

165
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,490
uh,
what do they call those?

166
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,730
The Nordic and then Scandinavia's
within the Nordic countries.

167
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,670
I always have to remind myself that like,
you go over there,

168
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,990
it was the funniest fucking shit
cause he's so god damn tall.

169
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,520
They would be kids almost my height,
whose voices hadn't changed yet.

170
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,190
And they had the mentality of
like an 11 year old they'd make,

171
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,270
he said they was speaking that
I did hide it. He aged out.

172
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,610
If you're talking voice and change that.

173
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,810
And I was just sitting there laughing my
ass off. Go. These are like fucking, yeah,

174
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:41,580
they like, everybody was like,
uh, like six, three, six, four,

175
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,370
six, five like rail thin with
their fucking European pants.
