1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,880
Is that they're promoting all the kindness
promoting on the fall once a day and

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:07,060
my five year olds, okay, but
what I'm saying is kindness.

3
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:10,270
Unless you're a right wing person.
Now, if you think on the right,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,530
then they want to attack you,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,680
then they want to do want to demonize
you and if they could shut you down and

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:18,970
silence you and find some
sort of a bullshit excuse to
do so. And a lot of cases,

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:22,870
it seems like some folks lean in that
direction and this is where it gets

8
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:25,750
dangerous because you can't,
it's like if someone says, Hey,

9
00:00:25,751 --> 00:00:28,780
if I knew how to fight, I'd run in front
of Pizza. I just fuck everybody up. Well,

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,500
you'd be dead in a year because eventually
people are going to kick your ass and

11
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:36,500
kill you. You can't just beat people
up. Well yeah, one on one basis,

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,500
but it's the everybody
gangs up against you.

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,260
It's that childhood childish mentality.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,130
I'll just knock this person out and
nothing else will happen. Like that's not,

15
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,610
you know, you're setting a whole thing
in motion. When you silence someone,

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,500
you're setting a whole thing in motion.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
And this is something
that we're all learning.

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,340
This is what we have
to come to grips with.

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,450
Social media has only been around
for a really short amount of time.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,710
It's only been around in this kind
of form for 10 plus years and we're,

21
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:06,340
we're figuring it out and these people
that think that they can just silence

22
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:11,020
people and shut people down without
it having a bad effect on all of us.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,670
It's not right. It's not right. Well,
I appreciate you should be a path,

24
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,660
one of the empty spaces. Good. Eddie,

25
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:21,661
what do you think should be done about
the denial of the reign of terror of

26
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:24,160
censorship and said,
middling going on?

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,330
Uh, I don't know. Shit. You know,

28
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:34,690
all I know is that it seems that
the right is being censored a lot.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,230
And when you look at the left and
how they've been acting, I mean,

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,730
they're acting like psychopaths,
like pick, you know,

31
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:46,910
putting signs up for late term
abortions and all that shit.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,180
They're pushing that.
There's people pushing that AOC there.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,970
It's, it's like someone who's trying
to get fired. You know when you're,

34
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,320
you have a job when you want to get fired.

35
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,290
I'm just telling you a four on the floor
who runs whole CIA squad and he said,

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,420
what do you think Alex?
It's like they want to lose.

37
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:10,630
What's the cyop but I don't know.
That's, it seems like they're trying to,

38
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,700
it's so bad.
It's so bad.

39
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:15,850
How much of that is influenced by people
that are trying to fuck with the whole

40
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:20,680
system? Imagine if this is like
stage five Russian influence.

41
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,230
Just get people to support later.

42
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,140
Like figure out a way to get people
to support super late term abortions.

43
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,230
Figuring out a way to get
people to Support Trans
Women competing as women with

44
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:36,190
no hormone replacement on one high school
were like some 25 year old dude's like

45
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:40,120
18 year old girls. He takes all the,
all the titles like now guys haven't,

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,130
you know, it's hilarious. It's hilarious.

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,800
Imagine if your daughter was up for a
scholarship and she had to compete against

48
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,880
some six foot five man who identified
as a woman wanted to play basketball.

49
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,350
I feel a, if you've, if you've
committed a crime, if you're a felon,

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,880
you can't chop your dick off.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,530
I like the Japanese model.
They hey,

52
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,900
because I don't care if you're a trans
or you're dude, once people went,

53
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,920
I don't literally, I'm a libertarian,
don't act like I'm trying to suppress you.

54
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,160
But the Japanese said, Hey, uh,

55
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,910
you don't get the Trans destination unless
you chop the Johnson and the way goes

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,430
off and it's like, hey, you
get, taxpayers will pay for it.

57
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:19,180
You get that vagina bill and then you sit
there and do it. Leave like, you know,

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,450
I think there's a lot of people
that are legitimately trance.

59
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,300
That's not the problem.

60
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,740
The problem is them wanting to compete
as women and Martina Navratilova it just

61
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,230
caught a rash of shit cause she
was talking about it, you know,

62
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,400
to the famous tennis star,

63
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,310
she's talking about it that women are
breaking all these records and right after

64
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,750
she said that these kids, number one
and two were transgender. That one,

65
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:42,160
the girls high school track
meet and it's just, you know,

66
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,660
at a certain point of time you gotta
go, you gotta stop doing this. This is,

67
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:47,890
we're talking about combat as somebody
because they think they're another sex.

68
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,560
I sat in the same timeline,

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,720
I watched like bike races and running
races and soccer and, and high jumping.

70
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,900
It's a dude. Like he thought just
like this is, you're bigger than me.

71
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:03,070
They were like these six foot, $4, he was
soldiers were kicked my house. Oh Lord.

72
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,920
And the girl or like, I mean
that's, that's been a little
less man. Yeah, there's a,

73
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,450
there's some nonsense going on.

74
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,360
There's some people that are legit and
then there's some people that are just

75
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,440
legitimately crazy.

76
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,860
I mean there's like with everything in
life is people that are legitimately

77
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,420
trans and there's people that have no
man wants to see himself as a woman in a

78
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,390
lodge. Lodger neck shows
the Kimball's that happens,
that's their issue, whatever.

79
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,310
Or vice versa.
But like,

80
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm going to watch NFL and like
we're supposed to like, you know,

81
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:35,920
like they had a women's NFL and it's
all guys and they say they're women.

82
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,910
It was like a thing. And even when last
year where the guy comes in with tattoos,

83
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:42,220
a big beard and it was
in the police report,

84
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:47,070
the guy had like a foot long cock
and he goes, do a cervix jam.

85
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,670
What kind of police report is this?
And the, the nurse said, Oh sir, uh,

86
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,140
I don't see a vagina.
And it was in the report.

87
00:04:56,141 --> 00:05:00,670
The man had a foot long dick.
So she's supposed to mentally yoga.

88
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:04,840
Okay, well let me check all this and
decide that you've got all this. I mean,

89
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,490
it's just like,
it's mental illness man.

90
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,510
It's not that I hate somebody that
feels that they're a woman or a man or

91
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,670
whatever. That's the lie that like, Oh,

92
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,030
you need to accept this or you hate
ever imagine if all this ridiculous

93
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,370
propaganda really was like the very,

94
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:23,080
very highest level Russian
meme farm propaganda.

95
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,350
And this is why the people,
that could totally be a thing,

96
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,740
this the most posthumously leftist.

97
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,880
Even things like these babies being
resuscitated and then killed like that.

98
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:36,310
People wouldn't freak out when they
heard a guy talk about that kind of shit.

99
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:41,320
Imagine if this is all just designed to
make everybody go fucking crazy. Joe.

100
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,420
I wish it was the governor saying it
and then doing it and there's just one

101
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,910
point we're going to this transmission.
What is the end game?

102
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,130
What is the end game? Alex? We're told as
humanities, bad Humana's wrecking things,

103
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,490
but the very environmentalist groups
that doing this are all like weird

104
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,930
transhumanist,
anti human.

105
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,790
I'm old transhumanists if I really get
life extension but it's all at Oh you

106
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,260
die,
your upload to a machine.

107
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm just saying anything you see
the big corporate media promoting,

108
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,140
they don't know what they're doing. I've
been around them, I've talked to them.

109
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,590
They don't know. I don't think
I know. I don't think Joe knows.

110
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,490
I don't think Eddie knows,

111
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,570
but I think in the spectrum of like
one to a hundred we're in the 95th

112
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,920
percentile.
If we're really being woke.
