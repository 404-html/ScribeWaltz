1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,380
What possessed you to want
to swim around the entire UK?

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,960
How many thousands of
miles is that? Yeah. Uh,

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,850
2000 miles altogether to a
thousand miles of swimming. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,190
Yeah.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

5
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:17,580
And then half way round I realized
how big Great Britain was. But you,

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:22,581
you've done some long swims before
but not like nothing even remotely.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,500
Like what's the longest swim you
did before this? I did. Um, I,

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,400
this is a bit of a
strange story. I did. Um,

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,710
I tried to swim between Saint Lucia
Martinique to Caribbean islands. Um,

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,300
it's only 40 kilometers
from point to point. And,

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,310
and for charity I was trying to swim,
uh,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,670
from point to point with a hundred
pound tree attached to my trunks. Um,

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,600
so I was pulling the hunch of Pantry,
a six foot waves crashing down and,

14
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:48,900
and I actually didn't make
it from point to point.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,250
I was like five kilometers from the end.
And when I didn't make it,

16
00:00:53,251 --> 00:00:54,660
I decided to swing back the other way.

17
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,580
So I ended up swimming over a hundred
kilometers with a hundred pound tree.

18
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,500
Took me 32 hours, but still
didn't make it. So, so what,

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,480
what went wrong where you didn't make
it? Tides currents, you know, and,

20
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:11,640
and I use get swept away. Yeah. Yeah. And
it's usually attached to a tree. Right?

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,390
How big was this tree? A. So a
hundred pounds. But I mean it floats,

22
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,530
but it was more of the drag.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,310
So if there's any influence from tidal
currents and it's pulling you in one

24
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,890
direction, I mean, I was basically
going to Miss Martinique,

25
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:26,010
so I know I was heading to Cuba,
you know, somewhere like that.

26
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:29,970
And then on the way back down, and they
turned to me again and they said like,

27
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,110
you're going to miss St Lucia,

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,030
you're going to end up in whatever's
further south than Saint Lucia. Um,

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,920
and I think I realized this as physically
fit as you are. Um, the ocean just,

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,450
just doesn't care, doesn't care. And
so after that, this was last year,

31
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:49,870
this was November last year. Um, kind
of felt I had unfinished business with,

32
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,790
with the ocean and came,
but came back to England,

33
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,870
a rung up from friends of mine at the
Royal Marines. I said, guys, look,

34
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:00,780
this is going to sound so
strange. I said, but I just,

35
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,830
I need to get out of my system.

36
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,540
I just need to see how far I can swim
in 48 hours. So I swan 40 hours. Um,

37
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,210
I can't remember. It wasn't, yeah, I
think it was 160 kilometers, something,

38
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,230
something like that. And I finished
and I had basically trench foot.

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,070
So where your, your, your feet
and your hands are. So kind of,

40
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,400
I've got so much water in. This one was
going moldy, you know, he's like, yeah.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,640
So I had transferred, I'm sort of
sitting there, nursing, nursing my feet,

42
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,030
and one of the, one of the offices, uh,

43
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:29,910
a good friend of mine and they came over
and they just said, they went, you know,

44
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:33,960
real English, Royal Marine.
They said, you'll boy. And I
said, yes. And they said, oh,

45
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,390
what do you, what are you
training for? And I said, uh, Oh,

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,420
I'm training for a potentially attempting
the world's longest current neutral

47
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,910
swim.
And then just paused and he,

48
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:46,740
he sits his cup of tea and he
looked me up and down. He just goes,

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,080
that just sounds a bit lame. I was like,
okay, what would you want me to do?

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,810
And he pauses and he says,
you just need a manner.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,920
We need to man up and swim around Great
Britain. I was like, Whoa, I can't, I,

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,320
I couldn't say no once the [inaudible]
said, why don't you swim with me, bitch,

53
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,170
did you do it mother fucker?

54
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,570
That's a crazy thing for someone
to be asking you to do. Now I know.

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,000
So I said, fine. Once the idea
stuck with me, I mean, you know,

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,980
we've got this real history and heritage
of a British eccentric explorers.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,870
And for me growing up,
there's a story of Captain Web.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,360
So the first guy to swim
across the English Channel,

59
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,420
and for those who don't know English
Channel, uh, you know, the tides,

60
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,090
they believe what? We're too
strong. The water was too cold.

61
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,240
They said you just can't make it across.
The English Channel isn't possible.

62
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,120
But captain web refuse to listen.

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,420
And 1875 August across
the English Channel.

64
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,470
And this is the part I love on a diet
of beef broth and brandy in a woolen

65
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,710
wetsuit.
He swam,

66
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:49,660
I think it was 23 hours breaststroke
with his head out of the water because,

67
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:53,560
and I quote,
front crawl was ungentlemanly like and,

68
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,900
and there was that element that I just
thought, that's amazing. Front crawl,

69
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,870
what is the front crossbar?
So, so basically that's
front the regular one. Yeah.

70
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:06,120
But way back in 1875 it was like, no,
that's Sarah's and gentlemanly. Yeah,

71
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,650
it was the movement itself themselves.
Yeah.

72
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:10,960
It was still being developed as
a technique. Whereas, you know,

73
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,290
if you are a gentleman and you were a
swimmer, you swim breaststroke, you know,

74
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,140
exactly. Head out of the water the whole
time, the whole way. 23 hours. And again,

75
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,260
like th the, the, the support boat we're
saying, you know, get out. You're not,

76
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:25,210
you're not going to make, you're not
gonna make it. And he just refused.

77
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,700
And 23 hours. So you know, that's
part of a night swim as well.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,460
Had out the water just all the way.
Why Brandy?

79
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:35,590
Is he getting fucked up or just a little
bit of branding, you know, I don't know,

80
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,390
maybe it might have been
a bit of Dutch courage,

81
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,720
but I think there was certainly back
then sports nutrition isn't what it is

82
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,630
today.
So I think there was an element,

83
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:46,720
he was even like a lubing himself up in
goose fat, you know, this is way back,

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,640
make them soft, slicker, slicker.

85
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,570
And I think there was an element
of warmth for that was the,

86
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,550
certainly the belief, right? So
it was the Tour de France guys,

87
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:58,510
didn't they drink wine? That was like a
big thing back in the day. Way Back. Yeah.

88
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:01,000
I mean it wasn't too long ago.
Me and Jamie was just, just,

89
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,520
just talking now about football
back in England. And it wasn't till,

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,400
you know too long ago, I don't,
maybe a hundred years ago.

91
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,700
They used to just keep brandy in the
dressing room in case you needed to warm

92
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,360
yourself up real and out. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

93
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,670
So they play soccer drunk there.
Yeah.

94
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:20,660
Kind of just slope with a
little bit something. Exactly.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,610
All in turn it over. Wow.
Wow. And I think, you know,

96
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:27,700
people don't understand that it's taken,
you know,

97
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,830
people like captain web maybe me to a
smaller extent to just raise the bar,

98
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,400
push the boundaries and,
and you know,

99
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,550
you've seen that I think our generation
have seen that. Um, with the UFC,

100
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:42,340
with mixed martial arts,
that has evolved so fast.

101
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,490
I'm always remember Forrest Griffin
used to kind of a likened himself to the

102
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:49,300
basketball players just shooting three
pointers with the ball between the legs.

103
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,360
And that always resonated with
me because I was like, yeah,

104
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:57,361
the evolution that we've seen and what
sort of Bruce Lee had the foresight to

105
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:02,330
predict is amazing. And I think in
a, in a much, much, much smaller way,

106
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,570
again, to go back to sort of
British athletes and adventurers.

107
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,730
Roger Bannister in a first night's wonder,

108
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,130
a four minute mile and
people said couldn't be done.

109
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,520
And he was a medical student at the time
leading physicians that he can't do it.

110
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:17,600
Your lungs will explode, your legs will
fall off, all sorts. Um, but no, he says,

111
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:17,990
you know,

112
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,990
Oxford laced up his trainers and ran a
four minute mile similar right now to

113
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,710
what I think we're seeing with Kip Shogi,
you know, and the two hour marathon.

114
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,860
And so that's why, and again,
in a much, much smaller way,

115
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,130
when I had that conversation about
swimming around Great Britain,

116
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,760
everybody said it can't be
done. Yes, it's 2000 miles.

117
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:42,650
But there's giant whirlpools in Scotland's
called the Chorea Vecan Penland firth

118
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,870
renowned around the world.
If you get that wrong,

119
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,530
you'll disappear in backwards at 10 knots.
You,

120
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,010
there's no way you're swimming against
that and 10 knots, that's a dolphin speed.

121
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,900
She's, yeah. So what is 10 knots in miles
per hour? Basically 10 miles per hour.

122
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,150
10 miles per hour backwards as you're
trying to go forwards basically. Yeah.

123
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:05,300
Penn inverse of the top of Scotland,
the currents that go across there.

124
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,210
So it's running at a good clip, but yo,
yeah. Yeah. I mean we got it good. We, we,

125
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:12,690
we managed to basically
predict it so well that I,

126
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,700
I think that was probably my top speed,
which I did 8.7 knots.

127
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,250
It's 8.7 miles per hour. I was basically
cruising along the top, which is wow,

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,930
was just like a dolphin.
So you were having the waves behind you,

129
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,280
pushing you almost.

130
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,820
And see now that's what's interesting
because I had the tides and currents with

131
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:32,150
me, not necessarily the way I said
it wrong and when you get bit,

132
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,240
but actually you made a good point in
terms of when you get Windover tide.

133
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,670
So if you've got 10 knots going this way,

134
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,430
but he even got a little bit of
wind and waves going this way,

135
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,420
it can get choppy again.
And again,

136
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,450
sort of looking at west Scotland,
Windover tide,

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,870
you can get 40 knots coming
straight down the barrel,

138
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:55,280
but you're trying to swim with the tide.
Yeah.

139
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,280
The wind is coming at you,
but the tide is going the opposite.

140
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,520
And as you can imagine
that, oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.

141
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,040
So how do you predict this,
this,

142
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,660
this tide that you have to
get right? Yeah, I mean, it's,

143
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,740
it's in completely in theory.

144
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,700
And this is what I realized when I sat
down and we started sort of plotting the

145
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,330
great, what does this called again? What
is the issue that will push you back? Oh,

146
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,530
just the title. Yes. What
is it called? That area. Oh,
you say you got to get right.

147
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,510
Oh, so Penn Unferth pending earth
or the panel and for Pendleton for,

148
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,160
yeah. Yeah. And that's that,
like I said, renowned around
the world. But, but equally,

149
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,350
if you imagine the shape of Great Britain,

150
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,280
there's all sorts of kind of compression
where the water would just come rushing

151
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:40,840
through. And as well as the panel
and firth, you can get, you know,

152
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,640
six knots around whales.
There's an island called Scoma.

153
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,840
And if you get that right,
you are disappearing, you
know, and you're winning,

154
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,640
you get it wrong again, you're
going backwards. And for mile,

155
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,400
for me to do a continuous stage swim,
if I'm going backwards,

156
00:08:56,401 --> 00:09:00,060
I've got to start where I was
going backwards. So for me,

157
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,020
getting every single tied right. And
that's while so for the team were amazing.

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,030
There was uh,
uh,

159
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,090
the Captain Matt was just incredible
that every night the homework,

160
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,740
are we okay here? No. Do
we crash? All right folks,

161
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,100
if you're listening or watching,
we had a little technical difficulty,

162
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,530
so this is not streaming
live will be uploaded later.

163
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,570
We were just going over how
you predicted you had to end,

164
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:28,770
your team had to predict how the tide
was coming because if it went wrong you'd

165
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:32,180
get pushed backwards at like 10 miles
an hour. Yeah. Basically. And the,

166
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,380
and this is the thing,
I think with the great British swim,

167
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:38,700
we were kind of taking swimming as
most people understand it and we were,

168
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,810
we were removing it and putting it
in an arena that was so different.

169
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:44,880
So I think that's why it was,

170
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,690
it did so well kind of online as well
as the community around it because

171
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,910
obviously swimmers were interested,
but you know,

172
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:54,720
surface started to get involved because
they understood the waves. Um, sailors,

173
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,480
fisherman, you know, all sorts of
people started to say, you know,

174
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,890
sometimes in Great Britain it's not
safe to take a boat around the top of

175
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:05,700
Scotland in it, for instance,
nevermind a swimmer. Um, so that's,

176
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:10,320
that's why it was amazing that, that
on the entire series it became, uh,

177
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,530
a melting pot and exchange
of ideas because nobody
knew how to get a human body

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,370
around the coast of Great Britain.
It wasn't just about swimming and,

179
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,520
and that was what was really
cool. How do, how do they know,

180
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,220
like when the tides are
going one way or the other,

181
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,000
how do they predict that tied
to so predictable? So in theory,

182
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,230
they change every six hours. So in
theory, when we sat down and we looked,

183
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,420
and we know that if you do six
hours on six hours off for 157 days,

184
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,890
you'll make it around the coast of
Great Britain. You know? And, and,

185
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,050
and that was the theory.

186
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:46,170
So you do this by phasic sleep
and you swim for 12 hours a day.

187
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:51,120
But that's all theory. There's times when,
as I mentioned, a giant whirlpools or,

188
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,710
or the tides might not necessarily,

189
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,330
if you imagine sort of that's Great
Britain there the tides out necessarily go

190
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,010
always like this or they're
not that predictable.

191
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,210
Sometimes if there's kind of like this,
like that's kind of whales,

192
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,040
they're the tides will do this.

193
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,430
So you're doing all these different
things that people are not going to see

194
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,320
instead of listening to it on audio.
So just try to just describe it. Right.

195
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,860
It's a basically rather than the is just
going up and down and working with you.

196
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,090
Sometimes they cross cross.
Yeah.

197
00:11:19,091 --> 00:11:22,650
So you'll just kind of getting slapped
across the face. My tides essentially.

198
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,480
And it's not just helping you,

199
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,800
you're going to basically zigzag all
the way up the coast of Great Britain.

200
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,810
So it was predictable as tides are.

201
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,840
We found those so much stuff that
when we're out there we were like, oh,

202
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,710
it wasn't meant to do that. Or a giant
whirlpool wasn't meant to be there,

203
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,480
you know? But it is an, and
that was what was pretty, yeah,

204
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,270
pretty sketchy. It, sometimes you
need that when we were out there,

205
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,160
if it whirlpool just decides to appear.
You've got you,

206
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,120
there's not really enough time to say,
oh hang on, that wasn't on the map.

207
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,700
Can we look at that? Can we speak to
the Met Office and talk about, you know,

208
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:56,530
weather reports? No, you just, you,

209
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:59,500
I've had to swim through it or try and
get out there as quick as you could.

210
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,230
So when you encounter something
like that and you get stuck,

211
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:06,190
do you pull out of the water and try
back again later at the same location?

212
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,730
You do. But quite often if it was
there, it's still going to be there.

213
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,650
So it's just, it is what it is. Yeah.

214
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,170
So sometimes there's this notion and
perhaps the best example of this, um,

215
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,090
I mentioned for, it's called
the Chorea Vecan. So, uh,

216
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,980
sort of west coast of Scotland and
it's a giant whirlpool. And, and Matt,

217
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:26,030
the captain turned to me and
said, look Ross, you know,

218
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,990
I need you to swim and I need
you to swim hard. You know,

219
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:31,490
you need to spend six hours. You just
need to be clear of this whirlpool. Um,

220
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:35,290
so as we were swimming past it, I set
my watch and some hard for six hours,

221
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,190
but about three hours in,
um,

222
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,950
I got stung by jellyfish and I've
been stung by jellyfish a lot before.

223
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,010
He's just, you know, it's painful,
but it was, it was bearable. Um,

224
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:49,360
but this one particular
jellyfish, it just, it was
searing into my skin. It just,

225
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:52,600
it wouldn't stop throbbing.
And so I carried on swimming,

226
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,360
three hours passed and
it was just unbearable.

227
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:58,570
So I popped my head up and I looked at
Matt, the captain from the boat. I said,

228
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:01,730
ma'am, I'm so sorry I've been stung.
You know, I'm going to have to stop. Um,

229
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,310
I've been stung by jellyfish pitch.
The pain's just not going away. And as,

230
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,930
as I said that to him, he looked
down at me and he said, yeah, I know,

231
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,000
cause the tentacles still
wrapped around your face.

232
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,560
So I'd basically been swimming for three
hours with a jellyfish on your case,

233
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,820
wearing a jellyfish.
It wrapped into my goggles.

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So I took my gold unpeeled this
fat tentacle threw it away.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,160
Um, and then like I said, I'll
show you in a minute. I'll ever,

236
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,100
there was a picture where my,

237
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,120
my face sorta change shape and the
goggles wouldn't fit on my face anymore

238
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:38,380
because my eye sockets were so
swelled. Um, but I knew that again,

239
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,550
for all of this happening,

240
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,850
the Cory of Eq and the giant Walpole
was still to my left. So Matt was like,

241
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,290
you still need to swim.
You still need to sue them.

242
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,190
So I ended up paying the goggles over
my face and to try and get them to seal,

243
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,770
I just punched them into my face.

244
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,910
So you just had these perfect
ring and then I managed,
you're sore. Swollen. Yeah.

245
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:58,900
So you're a push them through the
swelling basically. Yeah. John.

246
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,860
So you swim. Um, I made another hour.
We got clear the Cory of Atkins.

247
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,390
We managed to clear this giant whirlpool.
I collapse onto the boat and, um,

248
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,840
and this is the thing, it was at that
point that I collapsed exhausted face.

249
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:14,950
Now a different shape to when I
started that particular swim. And, um,

250
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,910
and the team looked at me and they saw
how bad I was, how being an upper was,

251
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,090
but they also knew that,
that the sea just doesn't care.

252
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,450
And in six hours the tide was going to
change and I'm not going to have to do

253
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,500
that all over again.

254
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,050
And it was that kind of brutal
lesson from nature that,

255
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,580
that from a sports science background,
I'm interested in, you know, Rehab, rest,

256
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,890
recovery, nutrition
strategies, all of this.

257
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,870
But with swimming around Great Britain,

258
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,890
it very quickly became apparent
that the sea just doesn't care.

259
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,550
It just doesn't care that you
need to rehab your shoulders.

260
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:51,500
It doesn't care that the ligaments and
tendons in your shoulders are hurting.

261
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,800
You might get impingement from
swimming too much in none of this.

262
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,830
And that's why it went from swimming as
I understood it and how a lot of people

263
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:04,970
understand it to something completely
like surviving basically in the water.

264
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,710
So you're swimming schedule would be six
hours on and then you would try to rest.

265
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,660
When would you eat, uh, during the
swims or, or between Erin? The swims?

266
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah. Yes. Uh, quite often just, you know,

267
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:21,650
throwing bananas at me and
just multi bananas basically.

268
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,330
Yeah. Yeah. Just so deep and I
need to eat. And while you're
in the water. Yeah. Wow.

269
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,790
Yeah. Cause cause again going back to what
we were talking about with the pen and

270
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,220
firth, you could get out and
you could get on the boat,

271
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,980
but sometimes in a really good tide,

272
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,090
if you are just in the water,
you could be making four knots.

273
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,050
You don't have to swim.

274
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,060
But if you get in the freezing cold
water Scotland and you are quite happy to

275
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:46,280
getting hit in the face by 10th
cause you can still make four knots.

276
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,440
And so that's why so often it became
about something different than swimming.

277
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:56,360
It was just, it was just mental for
tutors, physical fortitude. It was um,

278
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,340
basically, I always remember actually
the first day of autumn, um, I got up,

279
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,590
it was two o'clock,
so it was a nighttime,

280
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,690
two o'clock in the morning and I left my
wetsuit out to dry and I had to scrape.

281
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,310
It's just a thin layer of ice off the
wet wetsuit before I could fit it.

282
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,020
But if I didn't, if I didn't get in and
I didn't spray it that, that, that way,

283
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,960
then that would have been,
you know,

284
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,330
15 miles potentially that
we would have missed out on.

285
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,030
And if you miss those 15 miles,

286
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,900
that the window of opportunity to swim
around Great Britain because of the

287
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,860
British summer being notoriously
unpredictable and quite short. Um,

288
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,420
we wouldn't have made it round because
even towards the end there was two storms,

289
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,330
a store Mallarme and
storm Cali Allien Callum,

290
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,650
who kind of stopped us for those two
days where we couldn't swim because you

291
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,860
just couldn't swim in a storm. It
wasn't safe. So when you were swimming,

292
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:49,340
this was all during the summer?
Yeah, yeah. Uh, for the autumn.

293
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,630
And then we finished November the fourth,

294
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:55,130
which was going into the winter as well.
And you started what month? Uh, June.

295
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:59,880
The first. So for, since June you've
been swimming? Yeah, basically.

296
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,970
God Damn Man.
