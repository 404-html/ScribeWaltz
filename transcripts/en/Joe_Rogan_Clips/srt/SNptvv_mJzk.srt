1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Zest. Chad Johnson. He always eats
Mcdonald's and he's doing it. Yeah.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,470
While he's working out right here.
Yeah. Yeah Dude, you can do that. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,600
It's all in how much you exercise
with them. Now that's not easy.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,650
Obviously he's eating
healthy food on top of that,

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,670
but if he feels like fucking off and
getting a big Mac, he could do that.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,970
And there's no, no performance
benefits, right? Nope. No penalty.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,260
You can do it. So when Floyd
does that, he is doing that.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,620
He really is eating that nuts. Is Chad
still working out? Yeah, he does. He do.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,050
Just for Jack Exercise, just for fun.
He fucking loves it. 22 miles an hour.

10
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,860
It's his comedy. What does he do
these days? So what he'll do is,

11
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,790
I mean he'll like play guys and
like play guys and FIFA online.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,450
He's a great follow on Twitter. It's
hilarious. Oh yeah. I follow them.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,770
It's like hit like a girl.

14
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:50,250
We'll post a picture and then he'll
say what's wrong with the picture?

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,930
She'll be smoking high and be like, yeah,
but your shades at $30. Like, you know,

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,220
don't put so much money into your outfit
when the blinds in your house or $30.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,780
Like he'll just nitpick a little things
like, dude, he's hilarious. But his, um,

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,370
my guesstimation is, um, this is his
comedy. Like remember you're saying? Yeah.

19
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:14,190
Yeah. He used to sleep at the arena
or at least at, at the stadium.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,710
He, when he played, he was obsessed
with it. He loved the sport.

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,520
He was talking about fighting Anderson
Silva at one time. No, no, no. He's crazy.

22
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,520
He's talking about finance,
football player,

23
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,710
coffee Anderson when he was in his prime.

24
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,440
I think he has martial arts skill though.

25
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:36,441
I'm not bullshitting south by is actually
he's got for him hitting the pads are

26
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:40,500
hitting the bag. Yeah. Cause I think
he has real martial arts skill,

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,300
like legit martial arts.
But that's the question.

28
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:46,350
It's like when are these elite athletes
going to enter MMA? Damn. Well they are,

29
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,590
but in small, who's the
small numbers? Well,

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,830
Jon Jones is absolutely an elite athlete,
but he's got a 20 inch vertical.

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,593
Uh,

32
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,670
yeah, how elite he did.
He's got small calves,

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,880
but the fact that he has all small cows
allows him to be six foot four and 205

34
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:07,190
pounds. Right. You're saying he
was bottom heavy. He'd be two 50.

35
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,810
He'd be a different way, which she could
be, by the way. He could be a heavyweight.

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,550
He could bulk up and go up to heavyweight,

37
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,880
but he's got like weird calf
genetics is calves are tiny. Right.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,370
The thing is you don't have to jump that
much in MMA and he can hit you in the

39
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:24,880
face with a flying knee.
But the,

40
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,120
what he knows how to do and what he can
do physically in terms of his wrestling

41
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,170
and his ability to close the distance
and smash guys at time. People,

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,920
he's an elite athlete. I think he
could, he could have done that.

43
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:39,710
He's his two brothers play NFL.
Here he is.

44
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,790
It's Chad sparring a little
bit. He's in blue, right? Yeah.

45
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,770
Still can't be touched. He
says, well, he's a southpaw, so

46
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,110
let's see this
stay away from Anderson Silva,

47
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:02,410
so he's full. Okay, let's
good. Good habits. Good head
movement. Yeah, for sure.

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,040
I liked the way he moves
hands down over ridiculous.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,940
So he does the duty sparring though.
We don't know shit about him.

50
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,630
That guy might be
terrible. Yeah. You know,

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,830
I mean the guy didn't want
to try to go to the body.

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,940
He didn't duck in and when someone's
moving their head around like that just

53
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:22,720
smashed the ribs. You go right after this
gloss of the arms. Yeah. Hit those arms.

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,350
So they tried to do with Floyd
man. Yeah. Good luck. Good luck.

55
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,280
Flaws in the game that no
flaws. The flaws. One thing,

56
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,870
it's like we were talking about with Ben
Aspirin that when a guy's a super elite

57
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:35,704
wrestler,

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,410
you think you're going to do something
but he knows you think you're going to do

59
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,530
something. So he does it. You
do what you were going to do,

60
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,120
he anticipates what you're going to do.

61
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,750
He has an answer to that and then you
have to regroup and he's already moving on

62
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,900
to step three.
It's just too many steps ahead of you.

63
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,020
Can there be a guy like with him
that you don't engage on the ground?

64
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:57,580
Like you just kind of Jab,
stay on the outside. God. Yeah,

65
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:59,600
for sure. Look, Robbie Lawler, uh,

66
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,420
almost took Ben Aspirin out in his last
fight and it was Ben's mental toughness

67
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,860
and his ability to endure punishment.

68
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,180
Most guys would have probably gone
unconscious there. Yeah, but style bender,

69
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,930
like a guy style bender would be one of
the worst fucking nightmares for a guy

70
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:17,830
like Ben ask him cause he's super
difficult to take down and on the feet.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,240
He's not going to do anything stupid.

72
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,060
You're going to move forward and try to
grab ahold of the thing and you're just

73
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,980
gonna eat knuckle sandwich after knuckle
sandwich and he's going to slowly chop

74
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:30,620
at your legs. Wack. Yeah. And you're going
to feel that low calf kick and black.

75
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,860
You're going to feel the
inside of your thigh. Shit.

76
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,810
You gonna try to walk off the pain.

77
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,110
You'll switch stances cause
it starts to hurt whack.

78
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,950
He didn't recognize
he's switching stances.

79
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,380
He attacks the other leg now both
your legs are fucked up. Yeah,

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,400
he comes down the middle with a need
of the solar plexus. Now you're hurt.

81
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,300
Try to play it off.

82
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,310
It's just a matter of doing his
game in his instyle vendors game.

83
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,390
His game is keep the fight standing,
fuck you up.

84
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,370
And then Ben aspirins, it's grab a hold of
you. Fuck you up. Drag it to the ground.

85
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,040
Fuck you up.
It's a matter of like who,

86
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,750
who's better at the weak aspect
of the other person's game, right?

87
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,650
Yeah. Yeah. How can I take
advantage? Yeah. It's so crazy.

88
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,780
And no one could be
the best at everything.

89
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,370
So some MMA math is a notoriously
difficult thing to do.

90
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:25,810
Like say, say if, uh, if Jamie beats me,

91
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,060
but I beat you, but you beat
Jamie. Yeah. Like that happens.

92
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:34,180
But that's MMA. Math. It's crazy.
Always say that with like, you know,

93
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,060
styles make fights,
but it doesn't work with Floyd.

94
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,440
See Him boxing that styles
make fights only goes so far.

95
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,940
With MMA it's,

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,650
it's because of the sports more
comprehensive because there's more skills,

97
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,740
there's more different things happening
in football. Compare to basketball.

98
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,690
Maybe it's like there's more,

99
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,450
there's more tools that can be used in
here that can offset what's going on it.

100
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,170
Basketball, the warriors are going to
beat any team four to seven games. It,

101
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:05,210
that's just going to happen. I don't
know shit about basketball or football,

102
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,950
so I'm just guessing.
You can be a superstar.

103
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,450
Like there's no one position in football
date can change the game. There's

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,390
no, I think at quarterback silver
overrated. And to be honest with you,

105
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,000
I think the most important positions,
authentic defensive line, well,

106
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,650
I'm always amazed at Tom Brady's
body, how regular it is. Super,

107
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,880
super regs, super regular,
but they get it. That whole,
that team gets it. They like,

108
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,060
like I think Tom Brady's like 15th
highest paid quarterback in the league.

109
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,540
It's like, right. But if you look
at elite athletes body, right?

110
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,980
I want to see a dude is
built like Kamar Uzman. Yes,

111
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,790
the UFC welterweight champion.
Yeah. That's an elite.
You look at him, I go, oh,

112
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,220
he's not in the lead athlete.
Looks like a UFC champion.

113
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,160
He's not an elite athlete. When you hit
well, greatest quarterback of all time,

114
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,350
whoa. Where is, see this guy
without a shirt on your father.

115
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,650
You know what?
It looks like a Tom Tom Brady.

116
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,100
Tom Brady looks like. Oh yeah. I mean,

117
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:08,390
what makes that guy so special as things
like sometimes you know something's

118
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,030
going on. Yeah. He's up
here and I think, you know,

119
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,610
he's got a lot of it up here and
he works hard. It's like, you know,

120
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,770
sometimes the greatest aren't that great
picture of him next to Kamara Uzman

121
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,550
you don't know what it is.

122
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,300
It's like sometimes having all the
natural tools is a to your detriment is

123
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,610
looking at that. Yeah Bro. Come on sample.
Yeah, like a leopard. Yeah, he's ready.

124
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah. Ben aspirins similar to,
yeah, he's got a little muffins.

125
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,900
He's got a little muffin.
Ben aspirins got even worse.

126
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,540
Pull up a picture of Sam
down in wait Ben Aspirin.

127
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,200
Cause he doesn't want to and he's got
it like that. I don't give a fuck.

128
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,203
He's,

129
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,930
he feels like he's so much better as a
wrestler that everybody else is fucked.

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,340
Give, give me an image. Yeah, go
to his abdomen looking at that.

131
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,960
I mean, he's got abs underneath that, uh,

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,420
that's from one FC.
He looks even worse now.

133
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,590
Yet winning. Yeah. There he goes.

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,320
I mean that is not, that's Tom Brady,
man, the ideal male combat body.

135
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,800
You would think that's not what
the ideal combat body looks like.

136
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,610
But he'll fuck shit up. This is a
picture of him with [inaudible] there,

137
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,010
but he's got a shirt on. Yeah.
Ooh, Swan is insane. Lucky for him.

138
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,200
But like this is just some guys that like,
okay,

139
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,030
Francis and Ghana is a perfect example.

140
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,240
Some guys look like a destroyer.

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,190
They just look like a destroyer in
Ghana was like six [inaudible] five,

142
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,170
200, maybe more than 65, six guys. Like I
think you were saying earlier about the,

143
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,330
about the uh, Jujitsu, right? Like, and
it's not just in, in this, as in anything.

144
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,190
It's like sometimes the guys with all
the natural ability, they don't have the,

145
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,530
the work ethic to be the greatest because
it comes so easy. You know, it's like,

146
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,081
like we,

147
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:07,081
we all know comics that are like so funny
hanging out and they're okay on stage

148
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,460
and it's, I think it's be, as
comedy comes so easy to them,

149
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,610
they don't hit the gym. You know
what I mean? Like, maybe it's,

150
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,170
you need that like Jordan, almost like
sociopathic approach to it. You know,

151
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,410
where like, like we were having this
conversation earlier is like, Huh?

152
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,940
Like do you think Jordan's happy?
I don't think he's happy.

153
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,500
I remember when he was
inducted, abducted, abducted,

154
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,910
inducted into the hall of fame.

155
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,940
I think you've got to tell him he was an
abducted in plain sight. And I was like,

156
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,680
Bro, this guy, fuck

157
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,210
he is the goat.

158
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,360
Do you remember when he was inducted
into the hall of fame and he was talking

159
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,640
about writers, he's talking
shit about writers. Fuck yeah.

160
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,440
He wasn't thanking his coaches and his
teammates and it's been an amazing ride

161
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,030
and I feel so blessed and fortunate.
No,

162
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,750
he's still like in fuck you remember
when you said that? Fuck you.

163
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,480
1993 your sports illustrated issue.

164
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:08,430
You said buy shoes look shitty.
Well he has his furnace race.

165
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,120
Some people have, some people need
that as a furnace. Like they need that,

166
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,040
that competitive drive, you
know? And like, I feel like,

167
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,140
I feel like that happens when you
don't derive joy from what you do.

168
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,490
You know, like you derive joy
from that outcome. You're,

169
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,320
you're obsessed with outcome.
You know, like at least for me,

170
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,050
everything before was outcome, right? It
was like, I'm good if, if I get a special,

171
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:39,960
I'm good if I'm doing these
things or I'm good if I kill.

172
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,490
And the second I wa I was stripped of
the opportunity to do those things.

173
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,670
I actually found like I loved creating
more and then whatever the outcome was

174
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:55,110
was extra. Does that make sense?
Right. I think it's a happier path.

175
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,550
I think so too.

176
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,850
But I don't know if it's the path to
greatness as much as the path of the

177
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:05,850
psychopath, especially when
it comes to competitive sport.

178
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:09,540
Hundred percent something
about the best athletes.

179
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,760
They all miserable. How they, they
have a fucking self-loathing. They,

180
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:18,960
and they also have an ego and they have
this, this anger towards the competition.

181
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,400
Like if you beat them,

182
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,720
they would say that if you beat Jordan
and it came pool fucking hate you for

183
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:28,650
playing again. Yeah, but it
needs it. He's, he operates on,

184
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm not good enough, and if
I beat you, then he goes,
all right. I was good enough.

185
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,700
I don't even know if it's that he thinks
he's not good enough is that he knows

186
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,520
he can get you don't quit,
motherfucker. I'm going to get you.

187
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,820
But why does he need to get you?
I Dunno.

188
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,210
He needs to because it's like he needs
to confirm something maybe. Right.

189
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:49,410
I need to confer. It's constant
confirmation. I need to confirm,

190
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,070
confirm, confirm where it's like, not
that he doesn't believe he's great,

191
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,380
that he wants to confirm it constantly.
It's, it's his little shadow of a doubt.

192
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,110
Yeah. I'm great. I'm great.
He's walking around, I'm great,

193
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,260
and there's a little voice in his head is
going, hey, you might not be that great.

194
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,610
How about when he played baseball?

195
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,430
That motherfucker want to prove you're
the hardest thing in sports hitting a

196
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:10,180
baseball.
It's the hardest fucking thing.

197
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,700
And he just jumped from basketball to
baseball and was people act like he was

198
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,790
trash.
He wasn't even that bad.

199
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,670
Okay.

200
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,620
He hit like two 50
no,

201
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,100
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

202
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,830
Baseball card I'm looking at
says he was three Oh two at that.

203
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,670
Maybe what it might be for that's for
nine one 85 out of six 15 at bats, bro.

204
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,970
Talking about the hardest thing in
sports is hitting a fucking basement.

205
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,650
The fact that he,

206
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,910
I mean there's a bunch of rumors and why
he even went into baseball first place,

207
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:49,911
but like that it's that cycles
in Campbelltown gambling.

208
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,620
Some people say, you know, there's,

209
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,170
there's a bunch of different things I
don't want to put out there cause I don't

210
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:59,580
know. But like it's one of those,
I think there is a balance man.

211
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:03,360
I think that you could,
I think if you truly love what you do,

212
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,170
like if you love the creative aspect
and then you have high standards for

213
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:10,590
yourself, then you can achieve both. Yeah.

214
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,640
I think that achieving
quote unquote greatness,

215
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,960
um, and living with misery, I
don't think that's worth it.

216
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,510
No, I don't think that's
where the, for you,

217
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,180
it's like you got one shot at
this man like this, this life man,

218
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:25,590
like you got one shot at it,

219
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,640
try to figure it the fuck out and it
takes time to figure the fuck out.

220
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:33,060
But it's one of those things you
can't even really explain to people,

221
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:36,890
but if you can, I'm approaching this point
in my life where like, yeah, I think I,

222
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,680
I get it.
