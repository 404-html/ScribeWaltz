1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,760
There's that and there's also the,
the looming specter of the mass shooter.

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:09,990
It's just so fucking common these days.
It seems like every three or four months,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,500
there's a new instance how
many times per cent happened.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,180
Perception is a bitch,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,800
but the reality is the absolute
reality is they have happened.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,850
They are horrific and there's more of
them here than anywhere else in the world.

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,580
That's reality.
But here's the hall was another good.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,510
So when you say that you're talking
about the develop world. Correct,

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,920
because that's usually the
caveat they like to play with it.

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,900
There's no mass shootings
in the undeveloped world is
people don't just go into

11
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,500
a fucking mall and shoot people
up with winches. It's rare.

12
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:49,130
Very rare the people take it happens
more than people realize and just doesn't

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,480
get reported on about it. How many
people die in Chicago on the weekend?

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,780
Over a weekend. It doesn't get reported.
That's true. But then we live in America.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,660
We through complete access
to information that is true,

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,260
but it's a different kind of violence
because it's people that are actively

17
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,500
trying to get people that are actively
trying to get them. It's gang violence,

18
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,760
whereas school shootings are complete.
Innocent school shootings are the worst,

19
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:10,941
right?

20
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:15,260
Because it's a child and some fucking
psycho decides to make the most noise

21
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,330
possible by going into a
school and shooting it up.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,950
That's the scariest and the worst
for most people from owning.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,650
When you think about gang violence,
you say, well, that's violent.

24
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,090
It's terrible that people got shot,

25
00:01:26,091 --> 00:01:28,040
but it's people that are trying
to shoot each other. All right,

26
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:32,650
so then when I tell you that the remaining
homicides in this country right at

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,490
30,000 number that I gave you annually,
over 80% of that is gang violence.

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,270
Okay.

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,750
That's crazy to think about
leaving. Yeah, I believe you,

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,290
but it's when you see Sandy Hook,
when you see Parkland,

31
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,280
when you see any that the shooting in
Colorado, Aurora in the movie theater,

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,390
when you see these mass shootings,
these are what terrify people. Yeah.

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,020
People are not necessarily terrified
of the gang violence in Chicago.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,360
You know what?

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,220
I'm going to Chicago in a couple of
months and not one fucking person has

36
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,310
brought up, hey man, it plays a war zone.
Everybody's like, oh, I love Chicago.

37
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,490
You're going to get deep dish pizza like
nobody gives a fuck. Is that what it is

38
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,200
and no, I'm not going to the south
side there. See, that's the thing.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,250
I just went to Chicago. It was just in
Chicago. Paul was here and they were like,

40
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:18,770
well, you locked and loaded. Did you
wear a vest? Yes, I'm dead serious.

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,260
I got all those questions. What?
I said I was going to Chicago.

42
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:24,950
Those are the first things people told
me. Now, granted I did go to south side.

43
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:29,240
I did. Yeah, we did. Well, you nervous
when you're walking around? I was nervous.

44
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm not superman, man, so
when you're walking around,

45
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,310
he's strapped a not in Chicago
because it's illegal for me to be.

46
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,600
That's what's crazy is that Chicago has
really strict gun laws and that they

47
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:42,500
don't work at all. I was driving down the
road where there were like six, seven,

48
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,530
eight dudes who jumped in front of the
car when we drove that because we didn't

49
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:49,730
look like we belonged there.
And I'm positive every
single one of them had a gun.

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,480
They jumped in front of the car.
Well they didn't like the little lob,

51
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,070
their bodies in front of the
car. But you know, you look,

52
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:58,120
you see a call this unfamiliar to
drive it down the side streets.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,070
So they try to stop you. Uh,
they didn't try to stop me,

54
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,130
I think just trying to figure out who
the hell we were or they were just trying

55
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:07,750
to service. Ah, yeah. Ah,
so it's Kinda one of those
things, right. But then again,

56
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,480
when you're driving around,
you're driving down the side street,

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,370
south side Chicago, but go pros on
the car. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah.

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,710
Right, right. So you
kind of have that. Um,

59
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,930
so we all agree that the gun violence,

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,080
especially in terms of mass shootings
is one of the biggest problems that we

61
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:29,850
have in terms of like a horrific
public image problem. Right? It's, uh,

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,270
it's, it's something that you see
in the, in every I'm, when I'm,

63
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:36,660
when I say public image, I should, what
I should, I should re re phrase that.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,270
What I mean is like public
perception problem. Like you,

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,280
you see it and it's just death and
violence and children and innocence and we

66
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,650
as,

67
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,650
as people I think consider the death
of innocence to be one of the most

68
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:55,650
egregious in horrific deaths. Absolutely.
I think we both agree on. Absolutely. So,

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,700
so that's 100% across the board.
I think with any decent person,

70
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,200
these mass shootings are horrific.

71
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,480
I think in my opinion the,
the,

72
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,240
the number one aspect of the argument
that's not being discussed is the mental

73
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:10,350
health aspect of it.

74
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,830
Are you opposed to more
screening of people to get guns?

75
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,220
Yes and no. Yes and no. Yeah. Okay.
Yes. And that in an ideal world,

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,650
if we could minority report
it and figure it out,

77
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,970
who do you mean minority report?

78
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:28,000
I mean just like check to see if they're
on metal, mental health medication.

79
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,280
But I mean we, we currently have,
we'll see it. Here's the thing.

80
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,230
This slippery slope with that too.
So what,

81
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,200
what constitutes somebody being on mental
health medication that's prohibitive,

82
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,980
right?
What if I,

83
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,980
what if I deal with anxiety if I'm on
Xanax prescribed cause that prevent me

84
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,750
from owning a firearm.
It's a good question.

85
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,570
In California for the longest
time they were trying to make it,

86
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:48,060
if he had a medical marijuana
card you could no firearm.

87
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:49,380
I think they were doing that federally.

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,640
I think that there was a federal thing
that if you had a legal medical marijuana

89
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:57,290
card that they were trying to prevent
people they were trying to prevent both

90
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:57,660
from,

91
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,500
they were trying to try to cripple the
medical marijuana industry because they

92
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,070
knew that people want it done.
Because to be honest, it's,

93
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,270
it's intellectually dishonest.
If I can,

94
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:10,440
if I can go to the store with a
gun on me and buy alcohol, right?

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,830
Like, and you know me, I'm the,
I don't even smoke. Right, right.

96
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,480
But let's just be honest
about it. Like alcohol, weed,

97
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,650
I mean I think utilizing that as a
prohibitive means to own a firearm.

98
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,930
I think it's, that is true. But
if you were under the influence,

99
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,840
some of the Shit I got in this studio.
No, no, no. You'd be super paranoid.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,170
I didn't under a gun and say I
didn't say under the influence.

101
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:38,500
I said if I cause all the,
all the marijuana card does
is allow you to buy it.

102
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,900
No 100% but I'm saying that is an issue.

103
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,470
If you're under the influence and you have
a gun, right? Yeah. But I'm allowed to.

104
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,140
I, but I have you go to my house right
now, I have all types of whiskeys at home.

105
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,990
Right? Yeah. Baby. But if you're under
the influence, right? Yeah. But yeah, no,

106
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,400
I can't, I can't carry a firearm
and drunk. Right. You can't,

107
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,750
you shouldn't be drunk with a gun. You
shouldn't be high as fuck with the gun.

108
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,060
Neither one of those are good ideas
and nor should you be driving. Right.

109
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,030
Nor should you be driving.
So should you be on Xanax with a gun?

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
That's a question I don't know the
answer to because I've never had Xanax.

111
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,310
Exactly. Me Neither. I
don't know what it's like,

112
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,870
but I do know that there's been people
that have killed people when they were on

113
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:18,770
Xanax. And you know, that guy in
Vegas does the shooter in Vegas.

114
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,320
That guy was on anti anxiety
medication. I didn't know that. Um,

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,930
Chris Cornell was on antiemetic anti
anxiety medication when he killed himself.

116
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,620
Um, look, it's got a profound effect
on some individuals and it's not,

117
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,810
it's not uniform the way it affects you.
It might change with different,

118
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,790
totally different. It's a
different thing. I know,

119
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,800
I know tons of people who are on it.
Yeah, I do as well. And they respond,

120
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,250
like you said, they respond to it
differently and I know tons of people on,

121
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:49,440
or it will also drink while they're on
it, which you're not supposed to do. Yeah.

122
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,410
And that, that's not good
either. Yeah. With them with,

123
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,550
so screening with the screening component,
right.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,790
You gotta be careful because
what it then does, it's like,

125
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,290
it becomes a de facto way of preventing
people to own firearms arbitrarily.

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,780
Right. So it was like,
oh, well you have anxiety.

127
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:09,050
Or even even somebody who was
maybe dealing with PTSD, right?

128
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,720
Not everybody dealing with
PTSD as a potential murderous,

129
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,920
ravenous hundred percent person who just
going to go out and kill people. Um,

130
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,010
so with the screening component,
that's why I say yes or no. Right?

131
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,220
If you can find a way,
if you can find a way to establish a scar,

132
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,200
a mental screening, but even then,
no, because there's, there's a,

133
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:29,600
there's a due process
aspect to it as well, right?

134
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,640
So you can't prevent me from owning and
you can't prevent me from exercising a

135
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,120
right. If I haven't done something to
absolve myself from being able to do that

136
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:42,050
legally. Right. Okay. So what if they
come to your house and you've got,

137
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,230
let's say you've got like a cork board
up and you've got all these pictures of

138
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:53,231
schools and fucking arrows pointing to
the emergency exits and plans of how to

139
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:58,781
block things off and then pictures of
Jodie foster and pictures of serial

140
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:03,280
killers up everywhere and you're on anti
anxiety medications and the cops talked

141
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,700
to you and your fucking squirrely is
hell, you haven't done anything now. Yeah.

142
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,330
[inaudible] then if you can't arrest me,
arrest can't. If you can't arrest me for,

143
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,990
for, for crime or possibly attempting
to cause like, like in Italy,

144
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,740
like the legal standard is like taking
substantial act to commit a crime even

145
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,480
though you don't do it.
That's attempted. Right.

146
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,650
Did you hear about the kid that got kicked
out of school? Um, what was the school?

147
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,730
He was an agent. Kid died, his hair
blonde, started collecting bullets,

148
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,890
got a semiautomatic rifle.
His friends started freaking
out. They called the cops.

149
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,310
Cops came to visit him. He bought another
rifle and I believe they deported him.

150
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,720
They deported them for reasons not
having to do with the firearms.

151
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,330
They deported him for reasons that he
wasn't actually going to climb anymore on

152
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,131
a green card or visa.

153
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:49,520
I believe the way the sheriff's were
framing it was they deported him because

154
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:52,310
they wanted this fucking psycho out of
the country and they think that they

155
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,920
might've prevented a crime. They
probably did, but they still had,

156
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,720
they still had to establish a
legal basis for deporting him.

157
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,890
All they had was that, that
he didn't go to class. Yeah,

158
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,560
I mean that's something you've done.
I've done. Yeah. I mean everybody,

159
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,690
but then again, he wasn't a citizen.
Right. So, and that was, that was the,

160
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,090
that was a requirement for him to
continue to be here. But it was really,

161
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,220
it was kind of like how I got like
Al Capone, you know, like God,

162
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,670
I could Capone my tax evasion by way
of, you know. Right, right, right.

163
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,360
But he really had guns
and was acting crazy.

164
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,240
And that's why the kids that
were friends with them called,

165
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,620
and that's why they acted and they
just found that loophole. Yeah.

166
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,580
So what do you do with someone like
that? Other than that, I mean, this guy,

167
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,950
we had something. What if
this kid was still going to
school? I mean, it, it'd be,

168
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,830
it'd be pretty bad. Pretty bad.
But, but then again, we still,

169
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,920
we still have our laws for
a reason, right? We have,

170
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,650
we have our inherent rights for a reason.

171
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:50,610
We have to do process for a reason
because if we didn't have those right,

172
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,730
anyone could just come up and
say, man, you know what I saw?

173
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,850
I saw calling on the war
on Instagram the other day,

174
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,110
he posted a picture of a gun,
didn't,

175
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,020
he was like cursing people out
because they're making fun of them.

176
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,370
The water he was drinking.
And so, you know what?

177
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:04,260
Somebody needs to go check on
him and make sure he's okay.

178
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,170
And it's my monies to go and take his
guns away from him. Right. You've got to,

179
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,490
there's got to be due process. I
appreciate that. And I agree with you and,

180
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,860
and it's,
it's unfortunate in that

181
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,210
some people may slip through the cracks,
but,

182
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,770
but I can't arrest someone for something
that they haven't done yet. Right.

183
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,310
You just, you just can't. Well, I agree.
And so that's where we are right now.

184
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,560
So then, so then that, now we're
getting to the complexities, the hard,

185
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,620
the hard questions, right? What do we do?

186
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:35,190
How do we put something in place to
catch the people who do happen to fall

187
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,840
between the cracks, right? So then you
go, okay, try to keep, oh, sorry. Yeah,

188
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,490
I'm moving. I don't know if you
seen materials. I'm like hydro,

189
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,600
um, the complexities. Yeah.
It's, it's a very complex issue,

190
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,200
which is why we're not largely not having
it and we're having it here because no

191
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:56,340
one wants to have this conversation on
the national scene because it's hard and

192
00:10:56,341 --> 00:11:00,130
it doesn't make for great sound bite
and it doesn't make for good TV. Hmm.
