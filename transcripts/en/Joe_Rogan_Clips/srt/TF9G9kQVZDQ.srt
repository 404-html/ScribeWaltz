1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,340
They, it's hard to swim with somebody,
you know that as well as anybody.

2
00:00:03,341 --> 00:00:04,230
You saved somebody.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,420
Yeah, I was in Costa Rica and uh,
we were down at this g this water,

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,980
it was the biggest
waterfall I've ever seen.

5
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:14,610
It was like hundreds of feet high
and it landed in this lagoon,

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,840
this round lagoon. And the water,
they told you don't go near the water.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,750
And so there's these Japanese
girls sitting on the edge.

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:26,520
They got their feet in and then one of
them like jumps in and the water fucking

9
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:30,720
sucks her down immediately.
And I dove owl, I have,

10
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:34,290
I have a lifeguarding to Greg
from when I was stoned and 16.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,700
And so I dove into the water and I grabbed
her and luckily I was checking them

12
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:43,110
out because they were these
beautiful Japanese. So I
had my eyes on them. And uh,

13
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,830
so I dive in and I grabbed, I grabbed
her and I pulled it to the surface.

14
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,440
I do the cross arm carry and
I've pulled out, I pull her out.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,710
And you know what she did just turned,
turned to her friends.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,340
They all like console there. Nobody said
thank you. I fucking saved her life.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,360
So anyway. Wow. So there was these kids
and a three. You are jumping these lady.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,280
How rude. How bad? A little
[inaudible] Japanese,

19
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,060
Japanese. I think she was Japanese. No,
no, they were Japanese. Japanese, yeah.

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,340
She probably thought you were a lifeguard.
Yeah.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,470
Probably thought that's what
happened. Yeah. And then I,

22
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:17,130
and then I left and I'm with my family
and uh, they didn't see it happen,

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,120
so I was so fucking bummed.
Then we get to the parking lot and uh,

24
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,410
there's this busload of kids from some
school and they had seen the whole thing

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,410
and they started chanting hero to me.
Oh,

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,290
what do you fucking see
what's happening right now?

27
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,700
That's gotta be a great feeling. Even if
they didn't say thank you, you saved him.

28
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,650
Well, I, it's what I do. It's my job
superhero. You ever save anybody's life?

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,670
No, I don't think so. Not, not directly.

30
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,240
Maybe you did this podcast.
Probably did.

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,450
I bet there's people that
have been suicidal that
heard this and the cheer them

32
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,700
up. I bet it ruined a few
people too. Let's be honest.

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,730
I do. Don't listen to me. I'm a fucking
idiot. What are you listening to me?

34
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,610
Because if people say I changed
their life, I was like, okay,

35
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,390
if I accept it on the positive, then I
have to accept it on the negative too.

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,910
That's right. No, no. You did
it. You did the whole thing.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,970
You might've heard I said some
shit that you you enjoyed.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,990
I'm very happy for that and I talked to
some people that brought you some great

39
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,870
information. I'm very happy for that
too. We're all in this together.

40
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,580
I'm on saving anybody. Yeah, you save
yourself. Don't listen to me. Yeah,

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,640
call a hotline. Don't listen to me.
Don't take yoga. Don't even do it.

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,970
Don't take it. Don't want
us to me. I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about.

43
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,810
Don't pick up archery.
What the fuck do you want to do?

44
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,280
You want to shoot arrows at things? Fuck
out your carbs. Eat some fucking carbs.

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,890
Don't do Jujitsu. You're going to
get hurt. You want to get hurt.

46
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,870
You're a 40 year old man. We try to choke
people for stop it. Don't listen to me.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,280
Don't eat elk. Go get a burger, but
we had an actual American hamburger.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,970
Don't eat mushrooms. Get outta here. Going
to close your mind off. Break your head.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,021
They're going to break your head.

50
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:05,220
What have you go crazy like that guy from
pink Floyd? Huh? What if you go crazy?

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
What if you never come back.
