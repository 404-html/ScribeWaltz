1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,610
It's one of those things like the
walking on coals to absolutely.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,840
I've done a number of times, I'm sure,
but if you, as long as it's cold,

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,970
you know this then that Coles are
not a very good conductor of heat,

4
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,420
which is why you don't Cook on Friday.
She took on that bullshit. Be caught. Yes.

5
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:17,040
I'll tell you what my experience
was. I, the first time I tried it,

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,930
uh, I was with a group of
maybe 40 people and it was a,

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,930
the standard length of the
walk was about 12 feet.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,360
It was a hot fire was mesquite
and it was in my yard in Tucson.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,540
And the guy came in,

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,220
it was early in the days of firewalking
and he had this long four hour thing to

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:40,140
get people ready. Uh, I was not in
the right mental state when I did it.

12
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,590
And my experience was it felt fucking hot.
And,

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,140
and when it got to the end of it,
the,

14
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:49,590
it condensed down to like a number
of points that really burned.

15
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:53,610
And I had blisters the next day. And
most people that have walked that night,

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,160
it looked like they were not
in the right mental state.

17
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:59,360
But I saw a few people who
strolled across it that looked,

18
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,320
they were in some
interesting altered state.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,680
So I wanted to try it again next time
I did it, I shouldn't have done it.

20
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,740
I was with a guy who was a real jerk
who thought himself as a, you know,

21
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,990
he's a self styled guru,
small group.

22
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:14,991
It was a shorter maybe eight foot cooler
bed of coals and I got significant

23
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:18,060
burns from that.
So like an annoying guru.

24
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:21,680
So it's really annoying saying no idea
what she'll still idea what he was doing.

25
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,720
Like this guy's a jerk off and then you're
getting annoyed so you're out of your

26
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,230
mindset. Right. And I burned my feet so
I said I'm not going to do this again.

27
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:32,310
And then a friend of mine was doing some
intensive workshop with Tony Robbins

28
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,550
and so Christ and it was
going to end the last day.

29
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:39,240
They were going to do try to set a
record for the longest firewalk done in

30
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:42,210
America. So he wanted me to come
up. So I went up there, I thought,

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm going to watch,
I'm not going to do it.

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,030
So it was a 40 foot bed of
coals and it was a really odd,

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,690
and he had like a troupe of
African drummers and people
are dancing and drumming.

34
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:55,830
It was like midnight and people were
getting in line to walk and I said,

35
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,470
I'm not going to do this and I can be by
family self, you know, going up there.

36
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,140
And I was right there and he taps me
on the shoulder and says, you're ready.

37
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,370
It felt like walking
through crunchy croutons.

38
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,250
There was no sensation of heat.
I walked slowly.

39
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,760
I kind of wiggled my feet and the
things and when I got to the end of it,

40
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,830
I felt so high. It was like on acid.
I had energy rushes through my body.

41
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,390
I had nothing on my feet.
So on a much shorter cooler walk,

42
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,500
those coals conducted just fine.
And uh, you know, when this one,

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,450
it's a mind body thing. It's not
about the connectivity of the coal.

44
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:32,770
Tony Robbins hitting you with some
fun gazey, Kohl's. It was hot.

45
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,510
I mean you could barely get at the edge
of the thing. Men, the heat was amazing.

46
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,180
You know the Tony Robbins one,

47
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,600
it's what's really interesting is
recently they've developed this issue with

48
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,900
people trying to take selfies while
they're walking across the coals burning

49
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,734
their feet.

50
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,910
It's become a significant issue because
it didn't happen till like within the

51
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:52,320
last one.
I've never heard of that.

52
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,260
I think that would get you right
out of the proper state. Yeah,

53
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,650
there was a big article about it that's
pretty big article about these people

54
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:02,620
really their feet up a well deserved.

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,360
You really think that you have the ability
to mitigate the amount of effect that

56
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,480
fire and Cole hot coals. I don't have
any proof of, this is my intuition.

57
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:17,800
I think what happens if your mind
is out of the way you can take,

58
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,660
you can absorb energy and let it flow
through your body rather than getting

59
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,570
blocked in the tissues
where it causes damage.

60
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:29,800
And I've seen this in other situations
as well and I think the problem is

61
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,390
ordinarily our mind is in the way of
that and does not let the body freely do

62
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,224
that.

63
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,190
And I think that applies to things
like getting hit really hard, uh,

64
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,740
heat getting hit really hard.
How, what do you mean? Getting,

65
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,830
letting someone hit you as hard as they
can with something that would cause

66
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:52,390
damage and that doesn't, oh, that's crazy.
No it's not. I've experienced it. Yeah,

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,650
I'm sure you have.

68
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,010
But are there a real scientific studies
that show that nobody's studied it?

69
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,650
I'd love to study it. Nobody's
studied fire walking, you know,

70
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,100
the usual scientific explanation.

71
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,390
It's like we probably shouldn't talk about
this until they do do studies because

72
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,080
it seems so simple to do these studies
and I'm not fine if for a second.

73
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,680
I think if I hit somebody they're going
to, it's kind of fucking hurt right.

74
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,630
If you get Deontay wilder to punch you.

75
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:18,610
I don't give a fuck how much Tony Robbins
talks to you in common experience. Uh,

76
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:23,230
drunks involved in car accidents don't
get injured. Okay, but do you know why?

77
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,090
Because they're totally relaxed.
Yes,

78
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:28,360
but that has nothing to do with some
altered state of consciousness is not

79
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,150
allowing the injury to actually matter.

80
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,100
Mind is out of the way and
their body is totally relaxed.

81
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,680
So it does the tension of falling.

82
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,610
You hurt yourself because you're defending
yourself. You're right. Right. You,

83
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,690
your body is better off
giving in to the whole,

84
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,870
I'm saying it's the same thing
with the fire, but it can't be,

85
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,270
that's a different thing
cause you're not tense.

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,030
It's on this surface of your skin, which
is causing the he, no, I think you're,

87
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,900
you're tense in your nervous system,
which is not letting,

88
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,840
not able to absorb that
thermal energy and Brown.

89
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,540
We're going to do some studies on a
burn. You, I'm going to burn you anytime.

90
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,500
We'll try it. Buy It. It just,
I think there's certainly,

91
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:11,650
you can mitigate the sensation of pain.

92
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,180
I don't believe that you can do anything
about the actual physiological change

93
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:20,020
to a hot piece of metal interacting
with the tissue of your skin.

94
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:23,530
I just think they'll like the steak
does not know it's being cooked.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,940
It's just getting cooked. You're going to
get cooked. You are a meat. I just don't,

96
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,210
I don't buy that. I'll show you
some of these studies on hypnosis.

97
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,480
There's doctors right now going,
yes. You tell him Joe Rogan,

98
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:39,010
this is nonsense. Well, I believe
that hypnosis, I do believe that,

99
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,780
but I absolutely believe you can achieve
different states of mind where you feel

100
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:47,110
things differently.
Your, your concentration,

101
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,980
your relaxation is in a different state.
Your mind set is in a different state.

102
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,120
I do not believe that you can change
the physiological nature of your body's

103
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,990
ability to absorb punishment
like a punch kick.
