When you look back at
emerging social media,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,580
like we go all the way back to my space,
right?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,390
My space.
You got Tom,

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,110
Tom was sitting there and you're
in your top eight and you know,

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,520
people would like post music that they
liked and it was never a political,

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,430
it was very often very surface.

7
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:26,020
And for comics it was a great
way to promote shows and it was,

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,920
it was an interesting way
to see things but it was,

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,910
it was like the like the seed
that became Twitter or Facebook or

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,850
it was one of them. I
think we, at least for us,

11
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:42,530
like we got more of our roots from
AOL instant messenger and Icq,

12
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,010
ICQ cause it was,
you know,

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,340
you remember the status message where
you said like I'm in a meeting or I'm

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,770
listening to this music or I'm
watching a movie right now.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,240
That was the inspiration. And what we
took from that was being able to, like,

16
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:58,360
if you could do that from anywhere,
not bound to a desk,

17
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:00,650
but you could do that from anywhere and
you could do it from your phone and you

18
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:05,250
could just be roaming around and say,
you know, I'm at, I'm at Joe Rogan's, um,

19
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,270
studio right now. That is
cool. I don't need my computer.

20
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm not bound to this chain, to this
desk. I can, I can do it from anywhere.

21
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,310
And then the other aspect of, of,
into messenger was of course chat.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,020
So one of the things that the
status would do is you might,

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,160
you might say like,
you know,

24
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm listening to Kendrick Lamar right now
and I might hit you up on chat and say,

25
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:27,770
what do you,
what do you think of the new album?

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,140
But now it's all public so
everyone can see it. That's,

27
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,490
that's the biggest difference. And that's,
that to me is what Twitter is it, Mike?

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,960
My space was,
it was profiles and you know,

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,950
people organized around
these profiles and uh,

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,090
this network that develop between
people. And that is Facebook, Facebook,

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,420
Facebook optimized the hell out of that.

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,720
And they scaled the world.
We,

33
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,050
we were something very
different. We, you know, we,

34
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,550
we started with that simple status and
then people wanted to talk about it and

35
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:06,740
we, we decided that it should
be on the same surface.

36
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:10,640
It shouldn't be subservient
to the, to the, to the status.

37
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:14,900
It should be part of that flow.
And that's what makes Twitter so fluid.
