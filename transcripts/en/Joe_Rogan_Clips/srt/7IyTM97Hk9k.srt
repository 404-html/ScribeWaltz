1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,160
It's amazing how many Kim Kardashian
clones exists now. I mean,

3
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:10,800
and even in her own family,
I don't know all the names of them,

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,120
but one of the younger ones she,

5
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:13,860
it's like she went to the
plastic surgeon and she was like,

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,580
I want to look like Kim,
and they just give her the same face.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,980
What the fuck is up with them?

8
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,210
The thing is the most disgusting thing
where they're taking fat stuff and an

9
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,310
into their ass and they
developed this diaper,

10
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,520
but I mean there's a lot of people
out there with diaper button.

11
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,080
I met a girl the other
day that had diaper,

12
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,050
but she was at the comedy store and
I couldn't look away. I was like,

13
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:38,450
what is happening to her? But because I
knew it wasn't real. I knew she had. Okay,

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,180
spindly legs. Yeah, the skinny
legs and then the, well girl,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,980
if a girl has a big like hips and
the right are art crumb comics.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,660
Do you remember our chrome comics
now our comments are chrome.

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,010
There was a great documentary called
crumb and it's about this guy who was just

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:58,011
like really eccentric perverted cartoonist
from the 1970s and he would always

19
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:04,050
draw these women with these
enormous legs and enormous, but,

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,820
but they weren't fat. They
were just voluptuous. They
will know it was. You got to,

21
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,821
it's past voluptuous into
like super athlete DNA.

22
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,220
Like if you could get that girl,
make some male babies with it,

23
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:19,680
you would have a fucking
ultimate warrior like that.

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,210
See that woman like they are perfect.
How to have fun with a strong girl.

25
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,900
And you see our chrome, that's actually
him. Ronnie Coleman legs. Yeah.

26
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,400
That's actually him with his boner. Cause
he was as a really frail, Dorky guy.

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,090
And he's got this image of this
woman who just looks like a tank.

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,980
She says he's giant muscle legs and,
and big boobs,

29
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,770
but not like ridiculous stripper boobs,

30
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:48,360
but more like just Super Alpha Dna.
Female boobs.

31
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,310
Yeah. He was a freaky guy. Like, look
at him. He's got soccer. I mean that's,

32
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,830
that's who he was. Like who
they want above that, Jamie,
the one to the right. Yeah,

33
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:00,270
right. They're like, oh my
goodness, is what he used to draw.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,720
He was always drawing this enormous,
powerful women.

35
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,720
This guy was definitely into
getting dominated. Oh yeah.

36
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,190
He would just shove his whole head
and their pussy or something. Sure.

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,180
Like look at him.
He had him riding one.

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,030
I guess he's supposed to be having sex
with her and this guy definitely noted in

39
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:18,430
like two seconds. Yeah. Oh man,
look, he's choking them in these car.

40
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,740
Like he's always choking them.

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,000
Like you literally couldn't have an art
crumb today that looks like it looks

42
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,570
kind of like a woody Allen
too. Oh yeah, sure. Yeah.

43
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,070
Well see if you could find a
video of him are crumb. Uh,

44
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,090
the documentary is fascinating because
I think he wound up moving to France or

45
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:40,740
something like that. I think
you want to leaving America. Um,

46
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,890
but there's, there's actually,
if you go to video, you'll,

47
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,760
you'll find there's video of him.
But that was the guy.

48
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:52,140
He's a really fascinating guy.
That's not him.

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,520
It looks just like him on the
right. Not In the right. Oh,

50
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,980
that's not definitely not the right guy.
He wants him on the left. Does that him?

51
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,720
Um, oh, there it is. Oh
yeah. He just looks odd.

52
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,290
It just cause you just holding up that
picture and maybe it's also because I'm

53
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,920
looking at him now as an older man.
Um,

54
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,510
the lot of the video
that I'd seen was him.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,650
It bothers me to look at him and think
like, that guy has a strong sex drive.

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,740
Like, oh, that's the, yeah, he might not,

57
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:24,160
he might just save it up for every couple
of weeks and they draw one of those

58
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:28,480
cartoons and beat off to it or
find a cow suitable. Exactly.

59
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,450
Pay Somebody to sit on his face. A
strange, strange character though.

60
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,880
It doesn't matter Jamie.
It's all good. What's up?

61
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:37,120
I'll say it looks like he
did Fritz the cat too. Yeah.
Yeah, he did. Fritz the cat,

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,950
he did a lot of a pretty famous, uh, uh,

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,230
animated or cartoon
comic book Type Things,

64
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,190
but they were all at cartoonish
features. Everybody was weird. Yeah.

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,970
And you think Kim has now made that,
that that's the no, but that standards,

66
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,080
this is like a real, like that those
women's acids that are crumb drew,

67
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,520
I'm not justifying his stuff,

68
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,130
but they were freak gene DNA specimen,

69
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,470
like those women at giant thighs and
giant acids and that's who they were.

70
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,030
Whereas with Kim, she's got
those spindly not, yeah,

71
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:14,830
like her bud is this digital,
it's a surgical creation.

72
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,390
Like there's pictures of her that
are online that make it look good,

73
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,620
but they're all photo shopped.

74
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,250
And we found out about that because she
got Paparazzi when she was in Mexico.

75
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,940
They caught her on the beach and that
was the one that they were showing right

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,500
there on that way. It gets
worse than that way. Grocer,

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,640
they caught her wandering around the
beach and they took photos of her,

78
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,290
like real Paparazzi photos.

79
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,250
She would have fake Paparazzi photos
where she would hire Paparazzi,

80
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,041
take photos of her,

81
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,300
and then she would Photoshop a mob and
they made it look like everything was in

82
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:47,320
place. But it's not, yeah,
it's, it's a disaster.

83
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:51,730
This is what it really looks like.
Yeah. Yeah. So is that it? Okay.

84
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:56,590
So if the legs match the ass, I'd,
I'd be totally fine with that.

85
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:58,980
But even that acid is a distortion.

86
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,990
There's so much going
on there because you,

87
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,320
you're not supposed to have
that much fat in one place.

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,340
It was a girl has an ass like that has
legs to match it. That's what I'm saying.

89
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,270
If the legs match the ass,
I like it. But the legs,

90
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,190
the legs throw it off cause little,
little twig legs and then you got the S.

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,870
It's just not just a larger message.

92
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:23,950
It's like those guys that shoot
synthol until the muscles muscles,

93
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,070
it's the same thing. Like you're
not, that's not a real ass.

94
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,250
Like I know they'll synthol
muscles are not real moms there.

95
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:34,600
So obviously fake, but yeah, cause the
legs don't bend the legs mashed it.

96
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,470
I'd be like, that's nice. Yeah. But it
wouldn't match it. It's just not possible.

97
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,020
And I've seen some where
somewhere matches. Yeah, but
not like that. It's just,

98
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:49,080
it's the whole thing is a disaster. It's
just, have you ever watched the poor guy,

99
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,130
his face. He's like, I'm
nailing this shit. Yeah, I got
this shit on lock. Oh my God,

100
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,680
this guy, he does. I mean,

101
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:01,260
these guys wind up getting
horrible infections too.
Sometimes they've, they, well,

102
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,330
this gang green and shit, they say that
there's an actual thing. Oh my God.

103
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,270
You say ha. You see, they say how
there's an actual thing called bigorexia.

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,630
Like there's Anorexia and there's bigger
X. Body dysmorphia is exists with a,

105
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,730
I mean,
there's,

106
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,300
there's people that have body dysmorphia
in terms of their facial features.

107
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:18,950
They just can't stop tweaking their nose.

108
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,930
Okay.
