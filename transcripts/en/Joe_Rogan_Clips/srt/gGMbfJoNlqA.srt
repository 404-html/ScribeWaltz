1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,660
You're a funny guy. Yeah. But outside of
that, I, I'm not lacking in confidence,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,230
but leaving my house is like
I said, uh, uh, quite uh,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,950
what I'm saying is like,
by whose definition is enlightenment?

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:15,360
Because like say if you wanted to go to
a concert or you wanted to go to a great

5
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:18,570
movie, what an enlightened
person. Enjoy a great movie.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,190
I would think my version of an
enlightened person. What in fact,

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,040
enjoy a great movie. I, I've
been enlightened to the concert.

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,630
I saw James Brown when he first
got out of prison and I found that,

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,660
that that performance that he gave was
the most enlightened performance I'd ever

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:40,740
seen. Was this when he was in the car
chase, was that that prison? Yeah,

11
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,090
it was the way it was the last prison he
shot at cops because I believe so. Yeah.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,640
That one was someone else used his
bathroom, right? Isn't that what happened?

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,880
Someone took a shit. Don't know. I know
that he got in trouble with the cops,

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,910
but maybe it was that, I
don't know. That's a big deal.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,640
But to someone using this tool during,
is that a,

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,050
he had gotten out of prison and just
the idea that James Brown was in prison.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,350
I think maybe I remembering
this incorrectly,

18
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:12,210
but I think someone used his toilet and
then he got mad at that person and shot

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:15,660
at something like either
shot the wall or something.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,700
I don't remember that story, but I assume
that you're looking it up right now.

21
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,490
So we'll find out. Like he was in a high
speed chase. They shot his tires out.

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,820
They shut. I remember it this way.
Show something in a car though maybe.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,670
I'm pretty sure they shot his tires out
and he was driving around on my rims.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,630
He had to him and doing a lot of blower
or something, make him that agitated,

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,560
you know what I mean? No normal human
Doug. And we're talking about James Brown.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,030
Is that agitated? I mean, who gets
that? And he was fucking phenomenal.

27
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,140
When it's you.
Who's young to state chase?

28
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:52,740
I went up to 85 miles an
hour and fall 14 cars.

29
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,660
He said he didn't stop because
he feared for his life though.

30
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,970
I don't try to see why it
started and I don't see that.

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,910
I feel like that that's what started it.
He was,

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,890
he fired off a gun because someone used
his toilet, by the way, a two stage chase.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,810
I'm guessing he lived near the border.

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,160
Probably live in one of
those wacky states. We live
it. We live in Georgia. Oh,

35
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:15,060
okay. Well maybe he's like
Georgia, Florida. Yeah. It
could be close to each other.

36
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,290
Georgia, Florida line. It's not a
band. It is, right. It doesn't know.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,410
Wheeler Walker make fun of them.

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,150
Failed a a Beta pullover.
That's all it is,

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,940
but I'm pretty sure that's why
they were pulling them over.

40
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,540
I think they were going after him.
I'm, I might be wrong about that.

41
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,660
Maybe that maybe I'm confusing him with.
Okay.

42
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,040
Chuck Berry was the one who was filming
people going to the bathroom. Right.

43
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,430
I think he, he liked to go in the piece
like the PN ladies. I'm pretty sure.

44
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:47,640
Interesting. I'm pretty
sure, interesting, genuine.

45
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:50,810
When I enjoy James Brown's music,
I'm not thinking about his car.

46
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,950
Thinking about his other side.
You know your story. Oh really?

47
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,470
Oh, here it goes. Yeah. Okay.

48
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,040
He carrying a deadly weapon in a public
gathering and attempt to flee Perise

49
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,460
driving under the influence of drugs.
Okay.

50
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,780
He reportedly stormed into the insurance
company next to his office waving a

51
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,600
shotgun and complaining that strangers
we using his bathroom as time reported is

52
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,200
Tad. That's it for six
miles. There you go.

53
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,310
Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,090
Years later this episode would
frame the 2014 j brown bio pic.

55
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,750
Okay.
80 get on up.

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,750
I'm guessing that I saw him after
this cause it was right after that.

57
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,680
It would be,

58
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,260
it would be late eighties early
nineties Jesus Christ. He did six years.

59
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,050
Yeah, he was in there for
a while. Six fucking years.
How about just sober him up?

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,210
He was on PCP. They gave him a year
for each mile. He drove on his Mac.

61
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,730
Rumors of a PCP habit already surfaced
by the time his erratic behavior came to

62
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,810
a head in September. Wow. Pcps a tricky,

63
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:02,980
we sang in the prison
choir. I bet he did. Shit.

64
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,800
Imagine you'd go to jail for like
stealing the car and you're fucking,

65
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:09,820
Sally is James Brown. Like, hey
buddy, what do you want to do?

66
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,950
That's something that's a hell of a
story. Yeah. Help him write some songs,

67
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,040
you know, get on up. Yeah.
Did you ever see, um,

68
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,670
when he opened up for,
um,

69
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,810
the Mohammed Ali fight with George
Foreman documentary? Holy Shit.

70
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,060
Was that incredible? That was
incredible. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah.

71
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,210
He had so much power. There was something
about him, man. He would get on deck.

72
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,760
It was just power.
Give you an idea.

73
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:40,450
How much power prince wished for
that power yet? Well, prince had it,

74
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,440
but he had another way. Never way,
but prince looked up at Howard.

75
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,840
Didn't know James Brown was ridiculous.
All I looked up to it. Yeah.

76
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,170
I don't have any musical talent.

77
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:54,730
It just tells you what a waste all of
this was because Elvis had that power and

78
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:55,564
he didn't use it.

79
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,770
He had it early on and then he could
never dance like James Brown though.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,220
Or if he did, he never showed
it. It would be different.

81
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,050
It's a different kind of power. If
he just took an harness. Here it is.

82
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:10,180
Look at this.
Look at his dress too.

83
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,490
Just looking at the fucking
pants and the Shelia's. God Damn.

84
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,720
Drop it down doing splits. I know. No,
he was not human. And by the way, he,

85
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,530
he's not even really flexible enough
to do a full split and yet he's still

86
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,450
dropping down on stage.
You know,

87
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:29,320
he was wearing a turtle neck
that night and I said to him,

88
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:33,310
cut that baby out.
Let's leave a little bit.

89
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,690
Let's put your initials on there.
I think that that was done in advance.

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,160
What was the girls was hanging
around with James Brown. Yeah.

91
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,100
Look at these giant ass band.
I don't envy those people.

92
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,970
Do you know when you see people
with bands, Torin, all those people,

93
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,940
all those working pieces have
to fall into place. Yeah.
