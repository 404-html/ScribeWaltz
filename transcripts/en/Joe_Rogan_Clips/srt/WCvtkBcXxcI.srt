1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello Freak bitches.
You know Tony cut a bunch of weight.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,480
He figured it out with Tony was like
three pounds over like a couple days out.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,800
Yeah, but like two weeks before Tony
goes down, he has it down to us.

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,970
He's a soldier dude. I mean,
but they don't fuck them.
But it also, if you're Dana,

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,000
you, you need more weight
classes cause it's fucking your,

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,100
your your business up because
it could be, I mean, yeah,

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,360
we can't put any money on them.
You can congress never going to find him.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,800
He's not fighting Tony next. Tony
don't want to find him. Like, dude,

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,200
you came and mason away. Barboza
maybe who's going to five? Our buzzer,

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,090
a hib eat is, it could be a Bentley.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,790
He's got according to and he's got a new
nutritionist and the nutritionist has

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,120
got him on point. Look, it's a discipline
issue. It's got to keep the Tiramisu,

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,530
Tiramisu. I don't give a fuck if, you
know, it's definitely a discipline issue,

14
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:52,920
but it's also a psychological issue. Do
you think Tony is going to fight? Conor,

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,640
you think that's going down?
I asked Conner make us host.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,320
Conor made that post to Tony.

17
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,710
You know when you recently today he
made an instrument the GTA pose. Yeah.

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,100
Grand theft auto with him holding a
gun. Driving a boat. Cause Tony did it.

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,490
Cause Tony had at first, right? Well
Tony was talking shit about him.

20
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,190
He called the mcnugget and all that stuff.
Tony postings to shit.

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,810
But didn't Tony originally posted the
GTA a meme and then Connor responded with

22
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:20,200
his or vice versa. I think
it's vice versa. I think
Connor went out. Tony, look,

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,050
Connor smart, he realizes it. Tony's
a unusual eccentric character. Yeah,

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,573
you wrote Tony.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,110
Conor is an unusual like has
got a bag of cash in the back.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,170
Connors and unusual Accenture care. Tony's
and unusual Accenture character too.

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,183
And Tony,

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,460
Tony has the longest winning streak
in the UFC 155 pound division.

29
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:45,480
He is the interim champion and he's
the logical first one. 10 in a row.

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,780
For God sakes, in the toughest division
in the world. He's a bad motherfucker.

31
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,960
No doubt. Here's the problem at champion.
Here's the problem with that, and I,

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,410
I 100% think Connor
has to fight Tony next.

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,590
If you want to be taken serious and
your legacy, you have to fight Tony.

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,240
But if you're talking, if you're
Connor's business decision makers,

35
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,550
you're going look at Tony's
draw for paper view though.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,160
It's can tough for us to
sell this thing. Well, yes,

37
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:13,161
but not with Connor Connor cells like
fucking crazy and controversies Tony cells

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,760
because Tony's a legit threat.
Connor versus my mom sells.

39
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,470
But Connor versus a legit threat cells
like Connor fighting, someone sells.

40
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,100
But controversies. Illegit threat is where
it gets interesting as the big fight.

41
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,160
That's the big fussy. All I, I
agree. It's only Julio. You kidding?

42
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:33,120
He's arrived everybody. He's a
character. Yeah, but Eddie, that's right.

43
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,680
But the pay per view numbers were fucking
terrible. Awful. They're terrible. Well,

44
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,660
well, you know, but don't get me
wrong, it takes two to tango. It does.

45
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,970
Not to Connor, but you can release isn't
the biggest name on a planet. He said,

46
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,350
everybody respects him in the game
because they know he's a beast.

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,260
He's coming up, fucking people up,
choking people out left and right.

48
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,080
They know he's a beast,
but the world really didn't know him yet.

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,210
You know what I mean?
The world doesn't know either of them.

50
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,860
And there was a lot of cultural learning.
Now the world knows Tony.

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
There was a lot of controversy and Kevin's
Tony for sure the whole world doesn't

52
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,530
know Tony,
but the MMA world now is Tony for sure.

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,500
But the regular people with the
people that you need to get ahold of,

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,230
nor to really buy paper views
because the world knows nay.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,550
And that's where the businessman
does WMS go, well let's do Nate,

56
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,590
which if you look at any poll, I did
a pull air Hawaii to pull him junkie.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,850
Everyone goes, no, Tony
first and the fucking fight.

58
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,540
You're talking hundreds of thousands
of votes. People go, Tony Ferguson,

59
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,850
the next fight, but is going,
yeah, put the money's over here.

60
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,950
But the nae fights not going anywhere.

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,240
And how long are you gonna let Connor
play this kind of weird makeup,

62
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,980
a fight game thing with Nate.

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,480
Nate made 4 million bucks over two
fights and he don't give a fuck.

64
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,630
He's like, pay me. You got to pay me.

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,410
He's going to pay for what you're,
you've lost for the last seven.

66
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,950
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But he
beat Conner and then the second fight,

67
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,670
he arguably had a draw with Connor,
but he lost.

68
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,130
He lost a decision based on
a couple of people's opinion,

69
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,100
but I think if you went to all that
matters, Joe, but it doesn't matter.

70
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,260
It doesn't.
Public opinion means a lot.

71
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,140
If you went online and you ask
people who you think won that fight,

72
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,170
I bet you would get very close
to 50 50 Nate versus Connor.

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,300
Doesn't matter when Lassi man does matter
in terms of how you sell the fight.

74
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,120
It doesn't because to sell the
fight, if, if Nate would have won,

75
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:22,360
if those three people and having a
winning, you don't have a third fight

76
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,250
fight after he beat twice in a
row after we beat Eddie Alvarez,

77
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:31,540
you absolutely could have a third fight.

78
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,680
He absolutely especially beat them
twice. That's not true. Not True.

79
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:38,170
Especially if he beat
him by the same decision.

80
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,020
If the had the exact same fight
and Nate one that decision,

81
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,360
which was entirely feasible,
right?

82
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,570
The second fight was so close that you
could easily have given it to Nate.

83
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,460
If Nate wins that second fight, she's
build them twice in a row. You know,

84
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,770
think the, after Connor knocks
out Eddie Alvarez, the way he did,

85
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,570
if Connor fought Alvarez knocked him out,

86
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,870
you don't think you could sell a third
fight because it was so god damn razor

87
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,290
close. God. Oh,

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,030
and to I guess here you're looking at
the numbers and they see the problem with

89
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:08,500
decisions is these decisions are
solidified by three people that oftentimes

90
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,640
don't even have a fucking background in
MMA. Correct. Judges off all the time.

91
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,230
That doesn't mean a lot to me.

92
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,780
What it means a lot to me
is how close to fight was.

93
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,570
That's what means a lot to me.
If a guy goes over to see me,

94
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,660
touch somebody on the trilogy, what do
we Jamie and cards from that fight? Yeah.

95
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,291
47,

96
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,850
47484740840 seven that's his
fucking close as it gets.

97
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,590
It's a majority decision. One guy
scored it a draw, Glenn Trowbridge.

98
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:37,050
I do not remember what I thought,
whether I thought it was uh, uh,

99
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,290
went to Connor or went to, you know what?
I don't think I've watched it again.

100
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,070
I'm pretty sure I only watched that
fight when I was a close fucking fight.

101
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,690
Super Razor close.

102
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,810
We've seen decisions like in fights
that weren't as close go to the other,

103
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,920
but no one got robbed in that fight.
I wouldn't say Nate got robbed.

104
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,710
I say that it's a controversial decision
because anytime you have a majority

105
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:03,170
decision,
there's some controversy to it.

106
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,060
But my point is you could easily
sell that fight. Even if Connor,

107
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,540
even if needed one. I think
there's other sites, bigger fights.

108
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,580
If you know what is, what do you, what
does a bigger fight if Nate fought Conor,

109
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:20,030
you don't, you think there's a bigger
fight than that? If you're saying,

110
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,980
hold on Joe,
what are you trying to fight you?

111
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:26,240
So you're saying if Nate beat him twice,
the third fights can be the big fight.

112
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:29,780
Right now you see this beat him stuff.
It's the same exact fight. Okay.

113
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,060
The same exact fight takes place.
God Damn Man,

114
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,660
when they lose the same exact fight,
the same exact fight,

115
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,380
those three random fucking people,
they decide, you know what,

116
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:44,381
this 47 47 I'm going to go 48
47 Diaz and then the 48 47 goes.

117
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:49,880
You know what? I think it's the opposite.
I think it's 48 [inaudible] world.

118
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not a make believe world cause it's
entirely feasible that that could ever

119
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,730
happen and Tony has Christ
and you listening to me,

120
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,060
it's entirely possible that that could
have happened in the exact same fight.

121
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,180
It's still the same fight.
The see the fight was very close.

122
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,200
Those guys were rivals, man in Nate
choked him the fuck out and the correct.

123
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,000
Right.
That's always going to be there.

124
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,540
So even if Connor like got real close,

125
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:15,620
Connor's such a superstar that if he
lost a close decision, the second fight,

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,780
you get absolutely.
Make an argument for third fight.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,710
Especially with one or two spectacular
performances like the Eddie Alvarez.

128
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:25,820
So if we're going off that we can do
any fight. Let's, let's do Josie Aldo.

129
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,760
He could say, Oh that was a freak
accident. 13 seconds. Let's run that back.

130
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,480
That's a huge driver
for sure.

131
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:33,920
And then that's when Eddie Alvarez back,

132
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,410
if you'd be just the
thing about [inaudible],

133
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,080
he beat the shit out of Eddie
Alvarez and then knocked them out.

134
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:43,400
Eddie was never in that fight. All the
spring Chatman is back cause he did,

135
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:46,550
he took it on a six week, six
day notice. Sound a bad idea.

136
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:51,250
But Chad signed at one 45. You know
what I'm saying? You saying like why?

137
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,770
I don't understand what you're saying. I'm
just saying and uh, the, the Nate fight,

138
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,060
it could've gone either way, but that it
didn't happen. So you can make any color,

139
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,150
any fights can be big, but winning and
losing does matter than today to the,

140
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,850
to the general population, it
does matter. It does matter.

141
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,210
But when the fights are the exact same,
you could easily see the,

142
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:10,550
the decision go one way or
the other. Like, you know,

143
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,220
there's fights that you've watched
where you say, you know what,

144
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:15,410
the guy got the decision, but
man, I don't agree with it.

145
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,190
You just said that with Musashi for
sure. Man, that happens all the time.

146
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,580
That's part of the game. I look at that.
If I, if I look at a fight like that,

147
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,200
I absolutely want to see that fight again.

148
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,760
I don't care if one guy got a decision
from three people that don't agree with.

149
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,713
That's fine.

150
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,480
I guess we're kind of saying the same
thing I'm saying Amy fight Conor does is

151
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,120
going to be big. Well, the heat, any
fight context, then you can be big,

152
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,840
but I think we both agree that the big
money's in the Nate Diaz fight correct.

153
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,470
And fight to do the big money
would be in the Nate Diaz fight.

154
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,990
Even if they beat him in the second fight.
I really don't think so.

155
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,530
I disagree with you than I do because
I think Conor is a giant superstar.

156
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,350
He's not going to be less of a superstar
and I think Nate would be a bigger star.

157
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,060
How many times he kind of
leans towards more money.

158
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,230
If Nate beat him in the second fight,
I think Holly,

159
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,860
I think Nate would be a bigger star.

160
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,340
Tony and Conor is about his biggest fight.

161
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,600
You can get in the lightweight division.

162
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,250
Tony in UFC history in UFC history,
Tony against Connor,

163
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,200
and that's like Duran vs Leonard.
I don't think it's the biggest fight,

164
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,690
but I think it's,
it's up there.

165
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,350
It's what the among the best
lightweight a unification.

166
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,900
Connor's coming off of the
Floyd Mayweather hired. People
know. Let's say if Nate,

167
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,820
first of all, any before you rip my
head off, I agree. Tony and Conor,

168
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,840
100% he's a star in our world,
in the pot,

169
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:40,190
in the big world. He's
not. He's a star. Two Star,

170
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,870
let's say,
may hold on a second.

171
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,180
You think you can go to the gas
station right now and go, hey man,

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,630
who's Tony Ferguson? It depends on
the guy who's there. They'll know

173
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,110
WWE shirt,
shirt on and off.

174
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,460
You go to the average person
and asked them who Nate Diaz is.

175
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,970
Way more people going to know who he
is. Then Tony, now, now hear me out.

176
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:07,230
Joe Floyd Mayweather.
There's a still a bigger name.

177
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,060
Then they could do that.

178
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,700
They could do a rematch and have
another bid five bigger than Kukui,

179
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:15,090
but I'm talking about for the UFC.
Fuck everyone outside the UFC.

180
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,450
UFC has millions and millions of funding.
It's a bigger name all over the world.

181
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,890
All over the world. There's
the, he has the interim belt.

182
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,380
He has to fight him. I
know there's a discussion,

183
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,320
right? As in terms of like as
a purist, correct. But Joe,

184
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,060
what if this was another fight? Ufc
Fan? I'm right. As your average UFC fan,

185
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,690
what if Nate fought Barboza
or Khabib and beat them?

186
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:43,290
Think how big that Nate fight would be
with Connor. Then that's a big if though,

187
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,080
the problem with that is Nate's lost.
We're talking about it. If world,

188
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:48,320
right now we're talking,
we're not, or loss of time up,

189
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,090
but we're not right now because we're
talking about what the pieces are in play

190
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,490
right now. Like what? Wait, what
do we have right in front of,

191
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,970
so we're going to do right now. So
if you're doing it right now, well,

192
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:59,190
if you're going by what
the fans have voted,

193
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,590
Tony would be the fight
that the pure SWOT,

194
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,560
but this is the fans that
listen to Ariel Helwani or you.

195
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,710
These are hardcore people.
In order to make money,

196
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,100
you have to get those people and then
you've got to get the people who know it

197
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:14,460
peripherally. Well then Nate Diaz, we
Pauline [inaudible] the next fight,

198
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,830
they don't even know Polly melon out. How
dare you? They don't until he fights it.

199
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:24,550
Unless Connor fights in boxing. That's
what I'm saying. Yeah, but I mean, well,

200
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,010
if taken all that out of context,
Nate is the bigger fight.

201
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,940
No matter how we paint this picture.
The re the fight you should do.

202
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,820
Is Tony though, do you think that
Paulie Malignaggi versus Connor,

203
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,520
Tony New sunglasses,

204
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,330
do you think that Pauline mile and
algae versus Connor is a bigger fight in

205
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:46,080
boxing then Nate versus Connor is an MMA?

206
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,770
I think whatever Connor does is, is
big. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

207
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,020
I think Nate versus Connor is bigger in
MMA then Paulie versus Connor is boxing.

208
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,950
Yeah.
Because,

209
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,550
because Paulie's not like
a Floyd Mayweather where
he's going to get all those

210
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:06,550
boxing fans. Paul was good and
he's a big names on showtime,

211
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,670
but he's not Floyd
Mayweather. The big, yeah,

212
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,210
the whole Nate fricking fan base.
You have to Connor fan base,

213
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,480
then you have dubby WME behind
that with the hype machine.

214
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,670
They've severely lightened that.
What a sanctions on weed. Yeah, but,

215
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,200
but if you're WME, you're going, what are
we going to make the [inaudible] knife?

216
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:29,650
You're WME. If you're commerce
business planners, you're going,

217
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,580
how do we make the most money?
It's a McGregor promotion in boxing.

218
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,710
We're gonna make more money doing that.
Fighting Polly.

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,130
And it's safer than fighting
Nate. We're fighting Tony. True.

220
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,100
But if Connor loses two
in a row and boxing,

221
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,940
that's the most severely
diminishes his star in Him.

222
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,580
It may come watch MMA and by the way,
they'll strip him of his belt.

223
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,210
If he fights another, we got a strip
up. They ain't doing shit to him.

224
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,530
He does USC. Who's going to do
it? He does whatever he wants.

225
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,170
He might find it heavyweight if
you want to do that. I can do shit.

226
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:03,760
To me it's too much of a drawl. But
Tony or Nate, is it dangerous fight?

227
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,310
Either fight, is it Tony? Tony, Tony,

228
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:08,200
and Nate are more dangerous
than fighting poly.

229
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,330
One of the did his own GTA post.
What does it say?

230
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,910
Does it say anything? There's no
comment. I don't think monument.

231
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,110
What does that count? Yeah, just that.

232
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:31,920
Okay.
