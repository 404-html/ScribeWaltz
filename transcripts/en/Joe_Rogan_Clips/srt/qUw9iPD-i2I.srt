1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,890
The joe rogan experience. I've been
doing, uh, rose and my trainer. Oh yeah.

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:08,770
I do that too. That he wrote down
a thousand meter row and I'm like,

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:11,890
what's a good time? So we looked
up the top times. I'm like,

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,780
I think I'm top 300 in the
world right now. A bit, you
know, I got to do some work.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,980
It was a big guy. There's big difference
between top 300 in the top hundred. Yeah,

6
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:24,130
but dude, you're top 300 in the world
with a row. With a rail. Yeah, look it up.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,100
That's pretty fucking sweet.
It's all right. I mean,

8
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:31,900
it's a row machine on the top 85
million. I mean, no, you're the hold up.

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,920
You're the, hold on, hold on. Let's just,
I would that, that was the humble brag,

10
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:37,900
but let's just be serious there.
You're the,

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,830
you're the hardest kicker ever on
that Goddamn UFC machine. Well,

12
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:45,950
I call it the Francis Machine. Well, I,
there's a video of me doing 152 right?

13
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:46,391
Right now.

14
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:49,900
You only see the one that me kicking it
and with my jeans on and that what got

15
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:54,580
to one 35 stretchy jeans. Yeah. Then
a barbell jeans, basically pds. PDS,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,800
like sweatpants, man. So dude burned me,
burned me from the audience, and he goes,

17
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:03,400
hey man, how long did it take you
to paint on those genes? And I went,

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,080
oh my goodness sir.
He just scorched me.

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,830
Theo van did me dirty, brought weird
clown on each other, clarify each other.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,390
I said, you look like an extra
from the waterboy setting. He goes,

21
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,810
he goes, don't fuck. I've probably cause
I think he goes, Bro, you look like you.

22
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:25,320
You look like you work at Nordstrom's
rack and you're a mechanic. I was like,

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,220
fuck. He talking about, he's so thing,

24
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,790
but that fucking pants man. These
pants or the shit, these are different.

25
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,040
These right now I have on there similar,
they're called Mott and bow is a no,

26
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,250
those are good company. Yeah.
Those are like legit jeans.

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,830
They'd like more feel like
jeans where the barbell jeans,

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,770
they look like jeans to touch them
and I go, hey, what's going on here?

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,780
Like sweat sweatpants on son.
That's at a good company to Jacob,

30
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,700
but just so bind you up a little bit more
if you were trying to kick somebody's

31
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,050
a little bit more. So what did you do?
The record setting. Kid barbell jeans.

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,900
This is the all day I did the record on.
This is the record one.

33
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,490
I see that dos Anjos rump. Let's
see, you saw my, he'll run in men.

34
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,670
My ass is way bigger. A lot of people
have been complimented me on it.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,350
Nothing wrong with it. I don't like that
fat belly though. I'm so fat right now.

36
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,870
You are not fat for me.
One 52

37
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,120
and what's the hardest? No, I'm
definitely fatter than I usually am.

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,360
I been cheating on my died way too much.
