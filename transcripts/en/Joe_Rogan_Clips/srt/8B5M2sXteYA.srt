1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,470
overpopulation of wild animals
is handled in one of two ways.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,300
Either you introduced predators or
you manage them with hunting. Um,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,140
there's a place in Maui,
in Maui where they are,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,390
um, the Maui has no
predators, you know, and,

6
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:27,010
but they also have a bunch of wild game
that was brought in for King Kamehameha,

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,030
I think it was in the 18 hundreds. They
brought it in. Um, I'm not sure when,

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,970
but there's tons of axis deer on,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,440
on Maui and on Lanai and on Molokai
and a couple of different islands.

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:39,701
And,
uh,

11
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:43,270
one of the things they've started doing
is they were trying to figure out how to

12
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:45,100
eradicate them from this area.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,780
So a bunch of hunters got together and
they're hunting these axis deer and then

14
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:54,490
giving the meat to poor people, like
making it free for them. And it's a,

15
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,140
it's a really cool program,

16
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:01,141
but that's another sort of situation
where you kind of have to hunt.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,530
There's no other,

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,150
unless you're just going to poison them
or you're going to somehow or another

19
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:11,200
capture them all and neuter and spay
a certain amount of them every month,

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,810
there's really no other way to handle it.
Yeah.

21
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:15,700
And I think that's a big misconception.

22
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,980
Like people that don't educate
themselves about hunting,

23
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:19,240
they're just like hunting is bad,

24
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,580
killing animals is bad and
they'd get on this bandwagon,

25
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,680
but they don't have enough
information about it. Yeah. Um,

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,040
and I think people confuse trophy hunting,
you know,

27
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:30,400
with like they see Cecil the lion
and everyone goes after, okay.

28
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:33,790
It's hunting is the, is the problem. But,
you know, trophy hunting is the problem.

29
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,590
But the hunters that hunt for food
and that hunt to you know, help the,

30
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:42,260
uh, the sort of environmental
impacts that they're having.

31
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,900
Like people don't like snow geese. I
don't know if you know much about Snowden,

32
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,570
read that article that you
retweeted actually. Yeah.

33
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:50,710
They like a nat Geo article
that I, that I posted. You know,

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,120
these birds fly in flocks of like 20,

35
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:56,450
30,000 birds and they land in a
farmer's field and they eat everything.

36
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,810
Everything and they destroy it. And
you know, like 10, 15 years ago,

37
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:04,540
these populations of birds, they
weren't like they are now. So, um, well,

38
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,220
large scale agriculture is
also responsible for the
boom and the population of,

39
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,680
of deer deer in,
in America,

40
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,640
particularly like in the Midwest
where all the farms are. It's,

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,880
what is it a fucking coincidence that
there's all the deer where all the farms

42
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:21,760
are? No, it's not. My
good friend Doug, during,

43
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:24,550
he has a big ass farm in Wisconsin,

44
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,030
beautiful place in the driftless area.
Do you know what that is?

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,900
It's where the glaciers didn't
pass through. So it's not flat.

46
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,160
It all these hills and it's very beautiful
and lakes, it's phenomenal place.

47
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,720
But essentially he's got the
deer that he hunts and that,

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,220
that he and his friends hunt on
his property. They're farm animals,

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,180
they're eating corn,
they're just eating greens.

50
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,910
They mean he grows corn and he's a farmer.
So he grows all this corn.

51
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,020
The deer are eating all this corn
and they're fucking delicious, man.

52
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,350
They're huge. So huge. And
they're so, they're so good.

53
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:03,950
But there's a reality to
a population control. No.

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,760
In Wisconsin, they get it because
they're around them everyday.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,270
They're hitting them with their cars. They
see them everywhere. They look. There's,

56
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,350
this is not like the idealistic view of
someone who lives in a city street and

57
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,930
Toronto and is driving around their bike
looking for signs that are criticizing

58
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,320
Kale or whatever the fuck they're doing.

59
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,210
They're not in the real natural
world that these animals are percent,

60
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,610
they don't get it. They don't
understand. Uh, you know,

61
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:33,790
they live in their bubble and you know,
nothing they don't understand.

62
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,250
Is it a hunter's actually,
you know, we have to buy tags.

63
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,210
We have to buy or licenses.

64
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,170
There were rules and laws that we have
to follow and those fees actually pay for

65
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,250
the wildlife conservation.
And I,

66
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm pretty sure it's the
same in the states as well,

67
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:47,570
from at least talking to
my friends. And it is, yes,

68
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,590
it Pitman Robertson Act and they don't
understand 11% of all the proceeds from

69
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,050
hunting gear go to wildlife conservation.

70
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,780
And that turns out to be
billions and billions of dollars.

71
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,790
It's far more than any
other conservation group,

72
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,820
far more than any wildlife
conservation group.

73
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,930
Our animal activist group and no one
contributes more to conservation than

74
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,520
hunting.
No one cause we want it.

75
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,960
We want it to be there for our kids and
their kids and it's, it's nature. It's,

76
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:17,410
it's how the world is supposed to be.

77
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,540
It's also this contradictory
thing that seems,

78
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:24,220
it seems like it doesn't make sense, but
we love the wildlife. I love the animals.

79
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,830
Just because you eat them
doesn't mean you don't love them,

80
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,220
but you recognize them as,
this is a weird way to look at it,

81
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:35,110
but it is a renewable resource. Right,
and it is also a magical beautiful thing.

82
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,820
Just because of that doesn't mean you
shouldn't eat it. Yeah. I mean it's this,

83
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,830
this disconnect that people have with
the wild I think is a real part of it.

84
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:45,730
A real part of the problem.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,680
Good luck finding a Vegan in Alaska know
there's not a whole lot of them that

86
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:55,180
live out in the bush that are vegans,
salmon and they're eating. You can,

87
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,170
you can bring in vegetables. I
mean, I'm sure there are some,

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,060
I'm just talking shit. But
the reality is, if you are,

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,180
if you're embedded in that world,
you understand it and you appreciate it.

90
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,970
And it's very humbling. I mean, killing
an animal is very humbling. I mean,

91
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:12,400
it sounds like just somewhat as an
animal lover, that sounds fucking crazy.

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,940
It's hard. It's also really hard. Like
when I see a deer come out, I hunt with a,

93
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,620
with a bow crossbow, and I see a
deer come out. It's, I'm trembling.

94
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,710
I have the hair on my
back of standing up there,

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,220
these beautiful majestic creatures
and I'm going to kill it. And it's,

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,880
it's really, really difficult. And I
don't think that people understand that,

97
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,770
that don't hunt in and then
haven't killed an animal.

98
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:37,600
They don't understand the respect and
the amount of effort that goes into that.

99
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:47,850
Okay.
