1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
What questions you want to ask
me about Anthony? Bordain well,

2
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:07,380
I wanted to talk to you about suicidal
thoughts because you are out of the

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,570
people that didn't kill themselves
with you are a lot, huh?

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,610
The one who knows the most about it
and you've experienced depression,

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,030
you know, and when I wasn't
close with Anthony Bourdain,

6
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,760
but I really liked him a lot
when I'm with you once. Yeah.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,850
And when I hung out with him, I
really enjoyed it. I did a show,

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,130
we did an episode of his show in Montana
and we went camping together and got

9
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:35,280
fucked up by a campfire. Yeah, it was
great. We had a great, great old time.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,140
It was really fun.
But I was stunned when that happened.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,540
And uh,
I mean I don't,

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,840
I just wanted to know like
when you were at your worst,

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,420
when you were having like
really shitty feelings,

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,570
like what could have been anything that
someone could have done that could've

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,680
helped you? Oh yeah. I
think about this too.

16
00:00:55,681 --> 00:01:00,120
I lost a friend to suicide
and it was like, yeah,

17
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:04,380
you want to stop because like what,
what, what could give done, right. Yeah.

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,850
I mean sometimes just all follow
me into a therapist that fuck,

19
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,100
I couldn't afford. I mean I've told
you this before, I probably on here.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,410
That was like a physical thing to do,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,160
but just getting me to go to accept
like that maybe it'll work well, I,

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,500
I knew when I was talking to you, that
is a hard thing for you to talk about.

23
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:27,480
So if you're bringing it up,
it's a real, real issue. Yeah.
Yeah. It's, you're stoic.

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,100
Yeah. You're, you're not,
you don't complain about
that with my negative stuff,

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,450
he's done. So I remember we were playing
pool and I was like, what's matter?

26
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:37,670
Like there's something going on,

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,730
like you just seem like just unhappy or,

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,240
and so once we got you into
that psychiatrist and then dude,

29
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:49,220
you popped out of that thing, like a
fucking spraying pills. Yeah. Neat.

30
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,080
You went running. Like anybody
who thinks that pills are all bad,

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,470
I don't think anything's all anything.
Yeah.

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,270
I think I know the black and white
problem where there are people,

33
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:59,250
like I talked to Ben, she won, it seems
like there are over prescribing pills.

34
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,800
I'm like, they worked for me
and he's like, well, I probably
didn't. I'm like, no, no,

35
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,540
no. Just because you think
they're over prescribing,

36
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,350
it doesn't mean they should never
prescribed they're stuffed. It works.

37
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:11,220
And sometimes it works enough for you to
just change your way of looking at the

38
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:16,221
world and change a reality and then you
eventually weaned yourself off of them,

39
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,270
which is really interesting.
Well,

40
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:23,250
it's a sprain of the brain
muscle is what's happened. Um,

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,640
I don't, it's not like a
physical like pull like that. Um,

42
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,430
but that's really what it is.
Just a sprain. And so like
until you get off it, uh,

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,860
to get on a cast, if some way it's
going to be real hard for it to heal.

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,600
[inaudible] you know,
this is like so far this metaphor works.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,160
No, that does help. I stop.

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,030
But I think it works in the most
effective cases like yours of medication.

47
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,550
So these pills act as a cast.

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,420
And then at some point you're healed
and you don't need them anymore.

49
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,860
But the problem is,

50
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:57,300
the only way to really know is if you
just get off it and run on it and then

51
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,470
you're like, oh fuck, I'm still hurt.

52
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,840
And during that get off and run
on a time is when you're suicidal.

53
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:06,040
Thoughts shoot up if they were going to.
So when they do wean you off,

54
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,640
they're like, you need to keep up
with me. Like any salt you get,

55
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,280
you need to call me immediately.
You can do right back on.

56
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:17,281
Like what was interesting with you is
you are weaning off coincided with huge

57
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:23,160
success in your career. Yeah, I got
off him. I know where I got off on,

58
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,730
it was my second apartment in New York,

59
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,750
so this was three and a half years ago,

60
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,640
four years ago maybe around there.

61
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,600
This is not happening is already on
comedy central. It's things are going,

62
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,690
things are going good. Your tours,
kicking ass, everything's great.

63
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,770
And then you released my first
hour and then my second hour. Yeah.

64
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
And you were a legit success.
He'll blow up. Was getting,

65
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,150
you were on billboards.
So beyond that I was,

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,910
I mean more importantly was I was
a working comic. I was like, oh,

67
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,550
I can make a real living at
this now for the first time.

68
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:59,320
So that was like the best part. Yeah.
And that hadn't been going on very long.

69
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,390
Right? Well, it was a hot, it's a fucking,
people don't know. People don't know.

70
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,920
It's a fucking crazy struggle.

71
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,270
The struggle from open mic
or too successful working
comedian and everybody's

72
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:13,060
different, everybody's got their own
weirdness that they have to overcome,

73
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,720
but it's a long ass bloody
struggle by the way.

74
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,660
That's why I hate this infighting
and comedy. It's terrible.

75
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,080
And it's like you're doing this
wrong. You're Dong of just said, guys,

76
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,940
we're all up against the
most monumental odds.

77
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,050
So you write safety safe show jokes
and this guy writes Dick Jokes.

78
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,100
It's like whatever. That's just like
predispositions, but like it's hard.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,120
We're all in the same boat.
Yeah. Anyway. Yeah, I agree man.

80
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,340
And that dot.
It didn't,

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,920
it's very rarely been the case in the
history of comedy that everybody kind of

82
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,840
got along and just accepted the fact that
everybody does things differently and

83
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:49,300
not make, not, don't make
a big deal out of it. Yeah.

84
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,440
We'd have to have factions inside of r
one. You want to have a safe space show?

85
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,170
I get it. Yeah. People don't want
to hear shit like that. It's okay.

86
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,250
Have you ever been a show Black Knight?
And that's fine to have everything.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,350
Everyone's defensive.
Oh my.

88
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,950
Everyone wants to hold their ground and
stand up for their position on things.

89
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,000
It's like, okay, you're going to be fine.
Everyone's going to, because we've just,

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,940
it's the best time to be time every
just kick ass. Just keep writing.

91
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,150
Just go out there and do it. Um,
yeah. And then it got better.

92
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,270
But a lot of that was it the focus
I was able to get because of these,

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,960
it was rent. Uh, no, nope, not Wellbutrin.

94
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,200
I try Wellbutrin.
The problem is some of these pills,

95
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,060
like the side effects are not worth it.
So what I tell people,

96
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,700
like someone had a problem
once, a fucking anxiety, um,

97
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,280
use of, I don't care about this
shit Nikki stuff and um, and uh,

98
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,170
he's right now planning
on bombing embassy. Um,

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,220
and it was like he didn't want to go on
it cause he was afraid it would make him

100
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,310
like a Zombie and I'm like okay,
if it does just go back off it,

101
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,190
you don't have to commit forever.
Right. You know what I mean?

102
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,450
Just see what the effects are. So on I
think Wellbutrin, uh, I couldn't come.

103
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,250
Oh it was fresh.
I,

104
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,710
I wouldn't even say it was any sort of
psychopath or anything cause I didn't

105
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:04,040
know about that as a side effect until
that was happening with my girlfriend at

106
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,680
the time. And I was like, what the
fuck? It was like three times in a row.

107
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:10,010
I was like, I just couldn't come. And then
she was like, oh maybe it's those pills.

108
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm like, why? Really? And then I looked,
I was like, oh yeah, fucking annoying.

109
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,970
It's an annoying thing.
That's super annoying.

110
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,060
There was this one called rem or Ron,

111
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,740
think about like how many circuits there
are so much in there and they'll think

112
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,500
it's something that gets in there
and fixes this because I can't,

113
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:31,520
I'm gonna take that away. You
edit your own computer. My God,

114
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,370
I'm like taking those.
It's almost like you edit your own op.

115
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,920
Remember we went to u have a, a PC. You
can get into dos fragment do shit. Yeah.

116
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,770
That's almost like what you're doing.
So the side effect on run run,

117
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,440
these side effects don't
hit everybody the same.

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,380
And what's you're looking to fill in?
Isn't it all the same?

119
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:50,810
So don't just get with somebody else
gets you got to talk to a therapist.

120
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,450
But like Rem Ron gave me hyper Phasia oh.

121
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,910
Which is the inability to be feel full.

122
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,250
So they said expect to gain
15% of your body weight. Uh,

123
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,620
and I could eat dude,
if I got high,

124
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,500
I could eat like eight
plates of Spaghetti. I mean,

125
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,740
I would eat out my whole
apartment. Holy Shit. Everything.

126
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:10,970
It got to the point where I was like,
well,

127
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,270
I got one big left and peanut butter
and some a little bit of Cheerio's and

128
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:18,410
fucking let's do this. Hey was, it was
glorious, but that it wasn't helping me.

129
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,070
That was a problem.

130
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,740
That was a side effect because I
was thin then I could've dealt with,

131
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,500
I can be 15 pounds overweight
instead of 10 pounds underweight,

132
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,840
but like it didn't help
me mentally. Mm. Fuck.

133
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,940
Um, and then I finally got on one to
sit for me. That was like, it worked.

134
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,320
I was like, boom, I'm out. I get
it. I'm free now a little bit. Um,

135
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,530
but low blood pressure.
So sometimes I stayed up,

136
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,800
I got to hold onto something and like,
it's not fucking faint,

137
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,410
but barely ever happens.
Totally worth it.

138
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,990
And that still happens now when I get
high. But like do you get like dizzy,

139
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,900
lightheaded? Yeah. I stand up. I'm
like, hold on, you got to get real high.

140
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:00,260
Went for that to happen
or early or something like
that. Or if I'm getting sick,

141
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,270
that'll happen.
But I used to get that in high school too.

142
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,210
I think I'm already predisposed to it,
but they made it a little worse. Not,

143
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,600
not a big deal though. So I finally
found the one that worked for me,

144
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,860
but it's hard and if you're not having it,

145
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:14,120
your brain is lying to you or it's giving
you a version of reality that's like,

146
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,891
I mean,

147
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:20,450
I saw this last night coming home from
the airport from Burbank airport and some

148
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,070
lady picks up an Uber,

149
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,130
picked up a guy on the wrong side
of the fence and she was, sorry,

150
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,810
it's my first time here.
But like,

151
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,750
it's one of those little fences you
can just step over almost, you know?

152
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,020
And he's like, well, everyone else is
going on here. Which is like, yeah, sorry.

153
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,670
It's my first time at the Burbank airport.
I can,

154
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,190
and you can't get a walk 10 seconds to
where it's an opening and he's lying.

155
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:40,430
He's like, pop the trunk, pop the
trunk place. And I'm like, Oh,

156
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:42,470
you're cranky from flying.
I know what that is.

157
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,350
And so your version of this reality is,

158
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,890
this is a way worse thing than it really
is. Steve Simone who never gets upset,

159
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:52,200
which was like, I no big deal. I'll just
come around and then it's over. Yeah.

160
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,800
It's the same thing we've talked to
Fitzsimmons like you can just not punch

161
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,750
somebody and then forget about
it, but you know, if you're,

162
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,370
if you're thinking that
angrily all the time,

163
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,670
it's really affects you and this shit
makes you think the worst of everything.

164
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,020
Wow. It's like, yeah,

165
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:12,021
no matter what it is a little worse
than it should be an interesting way of

166
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,130
looking at it.
Yeah.

167
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:18,090
And it just gets tiring after awhile and
the suicidal thoughts start happening

168
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:21,240
when you're like,
I can't do this anymore.

169
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,810
You know, it's effort. It's mental
effort to just like, oh, it just keeps,

170
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,900
it's like you've got to rock
on you that you're pulling up,

171
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,650
pushing off you at all times and
you just need the game to be over.

172
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,370
You just need a sleep.
The Yvonne used to have a bit about,

173
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,290
I think he probably didn't have
special or something by now,

174
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,700
but it was like if you want that
deep sleep, that deep sleep,

175
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,460
like that's what it is,
where you just want to sleep forever.

176
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,520
You just weighed down by it
all the time. Yeah. It's like,

177
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:51,870
you know how they used to like,
um,

178
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,710
get people to give false confessions
by just keeping them awake for like 30

179
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,650
straight hours until they eventually,
like they don't know how to say no.

180
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,710
The fine I did it and stuff they did
didn't do, they weren't anywhere near it,

181
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,350
but they're just saying, yes, I
murdered somebody, let me sleep.

182
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,040
It's just a version of that, you
know, where you're just like,

183
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,000
he's just so sick of it.
After a while

184
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,980
I will tell you that they have read
about it and they say the people who talk

185
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:21,150
about suicide or sort of different, the
people who are thinking about it quietly,

186
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,220
quietly is weight way more
often to commit it. Um,

187
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,330
I think they say the people talking
about it as a way to seek help.

188
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,410
So what can you do it, the question
was what could you do to help people?

189
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,260
Is there anything that anybody
could have done? You know,

190
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,050
it used to make me mad when you told me
just get out of bed to some exercise.

191
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,540
I was like, you don't get it. You don't
get it. I definitely don't get it. Yeah.

192
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,240
Shandra understood at once. She was
like talking about that. She was like,

193
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,390
he doesn't understand. You can't even go
to your fridge. Like exercises. Not even,

194
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,900
it's just so far from like no way I
could couldn't even get out of bed.

195
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,040
What do you think was,

196
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,830
you were also taking Propecia then it
had anything to do with it because that's

197
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:08,970
one of the side event
I'm for sure might have.

198
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,730
I mean it was right around then and
I think, I'm trying to think, um,

199
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,800
if I was quitting right then on it
and switch into the fucking spread,

200
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,370
um, come on. Stem cell research.

201
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,420
But I think it was either on it or,
or, or getting off it. Yeah, for sure.

202
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,110
For sure. Could have had something to
do with that. Yeah, I think so too.

203
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,940
It was also, um, uh, live in girl.

204
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,900
I mean there was so many things right
around that. So all it takes is a sprain.

205
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,970
So like here's the weird thing.

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,210
Let's say you lost your job and that
sends you into depression. It's not,

207
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:45,260
that is not related to something.
A lot of times it will be related,

208
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,720
something a mom dies, dad dies.
But let's say the job situation,

209
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:52,290
because you can change this, right? Your
Dad dies, you'll never get them back.

210
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,220
You know, feels bad. And so like it
should feel bad. You lose your job,

211
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,910
you're going to depression, but now you
get a better job. You know what I mean?

212
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,390
Not that you will, but let's just
say you did the depression remains.

213
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,960
The causes of depression
is necessarily gone.

214
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,840
You're doing better than the
thing that made you depressed,

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,780
but you're still depressed
because that brain is sprained.

216
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,100
So you need a way to fight it.
And pills don't work for everybody,

217
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,520
so it's fucking disheartening.
And getting the right people.

218
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,190
I had a therapist say, well, I was like,
this, this one, pills not work. It's like,

219
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,030
wow, I don't know what to tell Ya. And I
was like, and in my head I was just like,

220
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,640
okay, I accept it all. Work
up the courage eventually,

221
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,860
and that'll be the end of it. I was like,
well, how am I going to fight you on it?

222
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,160
I don't want to fight this in the
first place. It's not going to work.

223
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,540
How she was the worst, what was it
like to get pulled out of the clouds?

224
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,810
Like when the pills that
pills started working, working

225
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,660
at first it,
it's like you don't trust that it's gone.

226
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,080
It's like right when the hiccups leave,

227
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,930
you still feel like you're
the hiccups, right? You know,

228
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,000
but like a way longer version of that.

229
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,990
And then what happens where it is you
start to miss it because it became so much

230
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:10,090
of your reality and who you were that
like it's this thing that's been pulled

231
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:14,440
away from you. A part of you is gone.
Hmm. So it's weird that you're like,

232
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,790
miss this horrible way of being,
um,

233
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,210
because you had to figure out a way
to like make a positive at this.

234
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,970
And you see this a lot in like PC culture,

235
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,320
we start sort of bragging about your
victimization or that things have happened

236
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:29,501
to you,

237
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:34,270
but like it's a way to stand out and be
a special that you ended up propping the,

238
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,950
the, the negative up instead of instead
of saying, yeah, that was Shitty,

239
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,030
you know, you started almost
like bragging about it, right?

240
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
So you start feeling like,
well at least I'm different.

241
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,090
So that can prop you up a little.

242
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,270
At least I'm unique in this thing of
like it doesn't seem like anyone else is

243
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:55,810
having these suicidal
thoughts, you know? Um,

244
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,110
it's almost like if you're
only the only one to do a band,

245
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,320
you feel better than if everyone else
into that same band. The band is,

246
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,280
the album is the album,

247
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,990
but you like it more because you're the
only one noticing your own uniqueness.

248
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:12,130
It's like, so maybe it was that, I'm not
really sure, but when I was out of it,

249
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:16,090
that was missing it a little bit and then
followed by a fear that it's going to

250
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:19,210
come back because regular d,
okay, that's a terrible word.

251
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:22,270
Depression because it also means
just, I'm depressed today. Right.

252
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,770
Clinical depression is
different, but overlaps, you
know, it doesn't just go away.

253
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,040
Right. If I'm depressed
because I'm cranky, I got to
tell myself, don't be cranky.

254
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,520
Say Five things. You're thankful for you.
She'll be out of it. Get some sunshine,

255
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:38,260
you're fine. This is like deeper. So
like then when you do get depressed,

256
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:40,180
like let's just say I
haven't been outside all day.

257
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:43,750
It's been raining for two straight days,
you know, he just a little like blue.

258
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,860
You're like, oh fuck,
is it back? You know?

259
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,170
And then when it's gone
in a day like Oh God,

260
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,740
but when it's like two days like
fuck fuck, fuck, don't come back.

261
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,680
Wow. Yeah. But the the,

262
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:01,180
so a bear like a bad weather day
could set it off a little bit. No,

263
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:04,710
that just gives like the normal depression
that everybody gets right at. That's,

264
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,300
I think I really should be two separate
terms. Feeling blue fill and blue,

265
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,330
which you, you get. He hadn't
been on stage in four days.

266
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:12,730
I feel a little blue if I,
if I,

267
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,070
I don't know if I can get my
underwear out all day too.

268
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,520
I can't live in Vancouver. Yeah, exactly.
Yeah. Those people get depressed.

269
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:20,810
You don't get outside Seattle.

270
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,110
They don't get outside while they get
outside where they get rained on. Yeah.

271
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,060
So it's just like he just feeling down.

272
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,880
I remember when Duncan and I were filming
something up there and we were doing

273
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,240
that big foot and we were talking to
this guy who was a cop who was like the

274
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:36,620
security guy for the set and
uh, he was like, dude, it
fucking wears on you. He was,

275
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,390
he was at the end of the rainy season.
It was just starting to get warm again.

276
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,260
Wears on that in New York. My first
New York went to was this one and it,

277
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,800
it wasn't so much middle of March
for, I was like, whatever I could,

278
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,860
I could take it. I took the winter, it
was middle of April where I'm like, uh,

279
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,290
Knopf already I put in the
three or four months. Oh,

280
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,230
so the question is the want though. What
the thing is, you could do what you want.

281
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,460
You could leave.
I could leave.

282
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,740
I went skiing a lot of the
16 days of skiing this year.

283
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,600
When did that around like road dates.

284
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,470
That's what's crazy about like somewhere
like Denver. Like it's sunny, sunny.

285
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,820
It's great. It's great. So much better
when it's sunny. It's cold out, but it's,

286
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,933
it's sunny.

287
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,280
Like if you have to pick warm and
cloudy all the time or cold and sunny.

288
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:23,330
I take cold and sunny all day long.
Yeah, for sure. All Day long. Sunny,

289
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:27,290
sunny skiing outside of the sun when it's
like, oh, it's good. It's 25 degrees.

290
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,230
But it's just, you don't even
walking around. Yeah, it's brisk out.

291
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,230
But look how pretty the sky is.
Blue,

292
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,940
blue sky and fluffy clouds. Did you
know Anthony Bordain was, was depressed?

293
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,900
No, I heard with him a little.
It was a mixture of mixing drugs,

294
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,590
mixing pills and alcohol
could have the hammer. I bow,

295
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:48,500
I believe he was on some
sort of malaria medication,

296
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,720
which is dangerous if some people,
um, violent people get violent.

297
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,580
I've seen people on malaria medication
while they were drinking. And, uh,

298
00:16:57,581 --> 00:17:01,910
I had a hold the guy back from attacking
or a quarter or at least worried about

299
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,610
him attacking a report on.
So it was a friend of mine.

300
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,770
It was a very kind friend
of mine who I would,

301
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:11,771
I don't think we'd ever in normal
life attack a person physically.

302
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
And it seemed like he was about to,
it makes you think not even normal.

303
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,540
He was squirrely. Um, it was, he had
to go to Africa. If he had, he had, um,

304
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,370
visit somewhere in Africa and he had to
take these pills and some of them have

305
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,730
violent reactions to people. You're not
supposed to drink on them, first of all.

306
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,090
And he was drinking. It's
mixing. Yeah. And you know,

307
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,380
if that's what he was doing
and he's mixing that with
alcohol, who fucking knows?

308
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,850
So that could have happened
with board anywhere.

309
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,410
It might not have been
long term depression,

310
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,070
but I know there's studies on people
who have got a concussion in football

311
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,130
practice and then hung themselves
at night. Oh yeah. No history of it,

312
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,590
but right then everything. I mean, it's
almost like you're on psychedelics.

313
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,680
This new reality is real.
It feels real.

314
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,680
So I, the question is, is there something
you could've done? I don't know.

315
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,870
I don't know what the right,
I've thought about it.

316
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,810
I don't know what the right thing is.
Cause you, you push away people's help.

317
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,843
Right?

318
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,940
I saw somebody posted on Facebook once
where it was like one of the worst things

319
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:11,220
about depression is everybody going
to see, I've been through that too.

320
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,920
It's like if now I'm not even unique,
you know,

321
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,660
give me my props for my
individual substance.

322
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,590
So then it's like you want to help
by somebody who's saying, yeah,

323
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,880
I've been through this, but it's like,
it's not even helping them, but like

324
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,200
who the fuck knows what they're feeling?
Right.

325
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,290
That's the other thing about a person's
feelings, what they're feeling.

326
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:35,280
It's very personal. It's almost
impossible to describe. Oh, by the way,

327
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,170
I had moderate depression.

328
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,790
That's where the therapist said what
you saw was moderate depression. Jesus,

329
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,800
I don't know what severe depression
looks like. Jesus. So I don't know, man.

330
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,180
I don't know.
I lost somebody to,

331
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:53,060
and I don't know if I could have said
something to her or like, you know,

332
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:56,850
um, Anthony liked to drink.
He drank a lot. Yeah. And uh,

333
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,570
watching him over the last four years,
like you could see that he's,

334
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,520
he'd seemed like he had been
living a hard life. You know,

335
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,770
he looked like it on television too.
You've been living a hard life. I mean,

336
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:14,520
he was out there hitting it,
traveling from country to country,

337
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:19,320
constantly drinking constantly.
Alcohol's a depressant. It just is.

338
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,880
If you drink alcohol all the time,

339
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,430
you're not going to come out of it with
a sunny disposition as the present.

340
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,480
It is a depressant. I mean,
you can definitely do it
and pull it off. And we do.

341
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,230
And you know,

342
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,780
occasionally you'll have a couple of
drinks and then the next day you won't.

343
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,590
But if you're doing that all the time,
if you're doing it every day,

344
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,970
five days a week,

345
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,480
a lot of people use that because it's
a short term relief from depression,

346
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,350
longterm depressant.

347
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,320
So a lot of people use alcoholism
to cover up the depression.

348
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:44,250
And then they get clean.

349
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,890
Suddenly all the shit they're supposed
to have been dealing with is now still

350
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:51,210
there and not being covered
up by alcohol. Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,350
Fun that comes with a couple of drinks.
The, there's a fuck. Absolutely. It's fun.

352
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,680
Fuck it. Let's stop worrying. Yeah. It
would spend how addicted to it. I can't,

353
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,630
I wish I could do that with
cigarettes when everybody's smoking,

354
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,250
but I'll go right back to a pack. So
do you, do you, do you think like,

355
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,770
fuck, what could I have done? No,

356
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,310
because I wasn't close enough to them
and I wasn't there. If I was there,

357
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,450
I would be tortured by it.
Yeah.

358
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,530
If I was there and I was hanging out
with them and it happened in [inaudible]

359
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,490
tomorrow and then I would
have been tortured. Yeah.
That would then with anybody,

360
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,563
you know,

361
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,920
it's such a crazy decision to make the
decision to just stop living when so many

362
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,850
people loved you and you have
this crazy life that, uh,

363
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,020
it's the most bravest thing to me.
Yeah. I can't imagine something. It's,

364
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,090
that's the only thing that held me back
is just the lack of courage to be like,

365
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:47,010
just do it and it's like your DNA is
telling you, but stop and think about you.

366
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,720
What you've from not doing that
you become wildly successful. Yeah.

367
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,720
And way happier and you're
having a great fucking time.

368
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,810
I have the architect of my own happiness
and his fucking, I'm doing it well

369
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,820
doing it the way you're supposed
to do it, but you're, you know,

370
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,760
you've been doing it like this
for several years now and if you,

371
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,260
I guess it really doesn't matter in
the end, but if you end your own life,

372
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,330
you would have never
experienced all this true.

373
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,460
But if you had to go back and do it again,

374
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,550
it's interesting you were
at like a tipping point man,

375
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,430
you're this weird tipping point and
you just went that way and you're free.

376
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,000
Just took a while. It was
definitely a struggle. But you,

377
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:27,970
you were free I find
when talking to comics,

378
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,920
other comics because now I
feel a little guilty, you know,

379
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,980
for success around around people that
are also quite funny who don't have it.

380
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,830
And what I found is that it's,

381
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:42,250
you get this frustrating point run around
eight nine 10 12 years of comedy where

382
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:47,251
like your skills have gotten better
and your monetary career has not gotten

383
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:48,664
better.
Seo,

384
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,240
artistic careers booming and then
you're just not even making a living.

385
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,720
And it's the most frustrating cause
like I'm finally good at open mic level.

386
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,560
Like, or make a good joke that's a window
and sewn. I made a good joke tonight,

387
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:03,940
this week or one time this month,
you know? But like they are,

388
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:06,700
it's like I'm doing so well on
stage. I'm killing. Why am I,

389
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,570
why am I still working this day job?
Why am I not even ever on TV? Why am I,

390
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,310
you know,
it's real frustrating.

391
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,070
It might've been around that time too
or just getting frustrated with like,

392
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,730
you know, I was less hacky
but also just not succeeding.

393
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,920
Is it interesting how the Internet's
changed everything or for,

394
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,960
you can support people so much easier.
Before it was like you had the man show,

395
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,250
you could hire a writer and that's it.

396
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,890
That's the only help you could
do for someone. Yeah. You know,

397
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,850
take a couple people on the road with
you, but then now it's like, Hey,

398
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,520
go watch this guy show, hey,
this guy's got into special. Hey,

399
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:46,060
check out so and so's got a new book.
You know, changes everything. Yeah.

400
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,940
And people are going, it's literally no
skin off your back. Yeah. It's like, well,

401
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,200
it's great. You're
actually, it's good. Like I,

402
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:56,080
if Tom Papa asked me to
promote something he's doing,

403
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,840
I want people to go see him.
It's good. It's good for me.

404
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,830
I want him to do good because I like
listening to him. I like watching them,

405
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,250
so I want them to make more
comedy. Oh yeah. Then you went,

406
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,290
because I get to see you more.
I got to get to sell out comedy.

407
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,360
Good person gets to stay in it. Not
that he needs us, but it also will,

408
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:16,840
like with Tom, when you tell people
about someone who's really funny,

409
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:20,310
whether it's you or whoever it
is, then they trust you. They go,

410
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,180
I want to see that guy.
He's a fucking Lexus.

411
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,240
They know that you're telling the truth.
Like if I tell him, Hey Joey Diaz,

412
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,680
the funniest guy that's ever lived and
you go see him at the Ice House one night

413
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,580
and come out of it, you,
you're bleeding from your,

414
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,020
your internal bruising for laughing.

415
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,940
I love guaranteeing people on Twitter
or whatever. It's like, you don't know.

416
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,930
I guarantee you will have a great night.
There's someone who's an awesome comic.

417
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,050
Just, just, there's no like,
well my friend. It's like,
just, they'll be great. Yeah.

418
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,570
There's, there's people that you could do
that with, but yeah, there was, you know,

419
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,360
before it was like you got on the
tonight show, you know, he did.

420
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:55,400
So that was an actual time that I
let her man, people talked about,

421
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:58,610
you had to build up places,
you had to travel to places all the time.

422
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:01,190
So those people would come
back every time they came back.

423
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,370
You better have some new shit, dude,
I really got to think about it.

424
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,900
I have like when you start saying that
depression of paypal, like what can you,

425
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,140
what can I do? Anybody do? Is
there anything anybody can do?

426
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,930
It's like just a little bit
like being there for you.

427
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,550
Sometimes it's helpful.
Just be like, hey man,

428
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,410
you're just your good friend.
I know you're going through something,

429
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:24,740
but just know that I like you just like
a little bit and don't require anything

430
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,950
of them, but I guess everybody
be different too, but like,

431
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,710
I don't know, don't know. Everybody's
on a different trip. That's the thing.

432
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:36,050
It's like no one knows
what anyone is feeling.

433
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,900
Telling someone to get over it
is not the way to do it. That's,

434
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,050
that ain't going to help.
The tough love thing.

435
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:45,920
It's like that doesn't work.
That works for fucking nothing.

436
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,040
I don't know what it works for, but not
that it works for lazy people. Yeah,

437
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:52,040
exactly. I don't think it works for them.
I don't even think it works for them.

438
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,800
I think that gets people
to move sometimes,

439
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,750
but it doesn't change the way they
think about what they're doing.

440
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:59,930
They just get forced into doing it.
You know? It's like the argument,

441
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,000
well actually not like that when
I was going to say, but it's,

442
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,250
it's you,

443
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,610
you want them to act and so they act
because of force of your your will. Right.

444
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,870
Trying to scare them into it. Yeah. But
if you inspire someone and say to him,

445
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:16,730
listen,
I know you're looking at it this way,

446
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,030
but this is why this is going to
hurt you by approaching it this way.

447
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,320
You're going to do the same thing.

448
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,930
But instead of approaching it the
way you're approaching it, stop.

449
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,990
And just for a shift of perspective,
think about it in a positive way.

450
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,780
Like you could do that to people and
sometimes you can actually shift the way

451
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:32,300
they look at something because a lot of
times it's the way you're approaching

452
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:33,770
something that's pissing you off about it.

453
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,250
And the way to get through sometimes to
people is not to tell them this is the

454
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:38,084
way you should do it.

455
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,470
But just to paint the picture and let
them make their own decision. Yeah.

456
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,160
To be like, oh, so you're happy
when you're run? Yeah. Okay.
Is it, is it warm out? Oh,

457
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,550
it is. Okay. I don't know. You're less
happening. You don't run. Alright. Well,

458
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,220
it was like, instead of be like, you got
to get out there and run. I, you know,

459
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,330
I have kids raising kids.

460
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:59,870
One of the things that I learned that
works really good is anytime they do

461
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:03,100
anything, I tell them I fucked
up way worse than you. I
don't use the word fucked.

462
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:08,070
All right? And I said, whatever you've
done, I've messed up way more like I,

463
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:10,580
everybody messes.
Don't worry about it.

464
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:14,570
This is a part of being a kid and I'm
super proud of you for admitting that you

465
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:17,990
made a mistake or that you did this. This
is great because this is how you learn.

466
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:19,160
You're not supposed to know everything.

467
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,530
You're eight years old or
you're 10 years old. You're,

468
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,630
you're supposed to be learning,

469
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,660
learning about life and those people
who are supposed to be talking about

470
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:29,420
various things you encounter. You don't
supposed to already know everything.

471
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,770
You're a little kid.
This is great.

472
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,560
So we learned something that we don't
want to do anymore. This is great.

473
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,780
This is an awesome opportunity.
And nobody,

474
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,660
I wished somebody talked to me like
that and I will tell them that too.

475
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,930
I go cause I get called stupid
and yelled at or whatever.

476
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:43,260
Whatever the fuck it was
when I did something.

477
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:45,630
This is how people talk to kids
back then they didn't, you know,

478
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,080
it's not even anybody's fault.
Someone does something dumb. You know,

479
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:52,710
in the 1960s or something like that. They
threw things at them. You know, like my,

480
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,350
my parents were telling me about things
flying across the room at them, you know,

481
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,590
like people stop,
they just fucking that little,

482
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,460
the kids were animals back then
too. You know, people are different.

483
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,340
Yeah. Yeah. So it might be that
like something that helped me,

484
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,230
I don't know if people are listening
are going through it or whatever,

485
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:13,950
but like some things that have helped
that I was able to take was I had one

486
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:15,690
therapist said one good
thing where he's like,

487
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,780
imagine the good things out
of the depression. Yeah.

488
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,950
Instead of looking at it as only
negative, um, what's it helped you with?

489
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,990
And then I was like, Ooh, I'm
going to try that. And it was like,

490
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,830
I'm looking at my standup material more
realistically and darker and that's

491
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:32,820
actually helpful on stage.
He's like, all right, cool.

492
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,160
That's one good thing out of this.
And then it just like sort of,

493
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,390
it might just help you like it's not
all bad. Adjust the way you approach it.

494
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,050
Yeah. Another thing was say five
things and just in the shower,

495
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,640
whenever you do shower, say five things
out loud that you were thankful for.

496
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,100
Doesn't have to be monumental stuff.
Just like it's 75 today. That's good. Um,

497
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,810
I got a new bar soap. That's cool. Um, uh,

498
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:01,290
my friend John, you know, whatever,
Brian, I like him. That's cool.

499
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,750
A lot of have that in my life.
Just five things to say it out loud.

500
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:07,740
And then after a while some of that
that ended up affecting my mood. Hmm.

501
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,980
You know where instead of,
cause that was the problem was the focus.

502
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,010
I don't know if I ever told you this
thought it was a negative thing. Yeah.

503
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:18,000
So it'd be like a 75 degree day. This is
the example I use 75 degrees and sunny.

504
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,710
It's fucking every day in La,
you know? And I would be like,

505
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,240
instead of going like this is fucking Rad,

506
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:28,680
it's February 12th and I am
fucking in shorts, this is great.

507
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,410
Instead of focusing in that, I
would focus on like fuck, I got,

508
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,440
I got my car has no gas,
I got to fucking go get gas.

509
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,320
I hate having to fucking get gas.
You got to pull over.

510
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,670
And so then I'm only focusing on
this fucking one minute chore,

511
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,320
but I have to do instead of on all
the good stuff. And so you just focus.

512
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,570
It just makes you focus on this
negative and he's just like,

513
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:49,741
can't pull out of it.

514
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:54,741
So anything you can do to like shift
the focus to the positive is helpful.
