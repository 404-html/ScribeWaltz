1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,530
However,
1911,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,430
the last of the Yani Indians
issue was discovered in Oroville.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,750
I can't believe I remember all this in
Oroville, California, northern California.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,940
And there was a bounty
on Indians back then.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,590
You could shoot a man Indian and
get 25 bucks. You should 1911. Yup.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,450
They had bounties on them. Instead of
shooting this, Yani does last Indian,

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,810
they called the local sheriff and Nate
took issue into custody and they called,

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,680
uh, some scientists and uh, uh,

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Pelon theologists I'm from
California University by the name of,

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,820
uh, Saxton Pope. And Saxton
pope came and studied each.

11
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:52,260
She as a, as a aboriginal
last pope, a pope and young.

12
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,590
That's right.
And then he contacted his buddy art young,

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,220
who also studied in that genre and they
discovered EEG and they were fascinated

14
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:06,951
by his stealthy awareness of the
wilderness in his archery control with his

15
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:12,210
funny little style of shooting the bull
with his thumb and getting close and

16
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,240
doing,
uh,

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
ice cold river bathing before the hunt
to cleanse himself to be worthy of the

18
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,124
beast.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,340
So Fred bear witnessed the film that
Pope and young eventually made of them

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,850
becoming consumed with the
mystical flight of the Arrow.

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,980
Now this was in the twenties and thirties,

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,520
and they put a newsreel out when all
over the country and showed this newsreel

23
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,820
of hunting with the bone Arrow by Saxton
Pope and art young shooting grizzly

24
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:42,650
bears in Yosemite and going to Africa
fill in lines full of arrows because they

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,060
weren't really as good as he,
she.

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,460
So they'd fling a lot arrows and
these animals pretty relaxed,

27
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,890
almost tame because they'd never
been hunted like that before.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,970
And so Fred bear come from
Pennsylvania around that time, um,

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,580
to work at the Fomo company,

30
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:01,581
a building cabinets for the new radio
they just invented and the wood dashboards

31
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:06,420
for the Ford Motor Company.
And he was also making bows a handmade.

32
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:11,421
You would an or Osage orange bows in his
little archery shop with Nels grumbly.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,460
I can't believe I
remembered Nell's grumbling,

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,200
one of the greatest boy years of all time.

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,350
So my dad got the archery bug because
Fred defied the trend of easier hunting,

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,980
easier, long range. You didn't have to be
very stealthy shooted here at 500 yards.

37
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,880
They don't even know you're there.

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,960
I have to do is be a discipline Marchmen
which is a discipline and a great

39
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,340
accomplishment unto itself.

40
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,840
And it was a new challenge for
long range ballistic capability.

41
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,160
Will Pope and young and
a handful Fred bear,

42
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,870
Nell's grumbly went and saw
this newsreel of these guys,

43
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,760
these doctors, these, uh,

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,080
professors hunting all of the world with
these handmade bows and fed was already

45
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,900
into it and he was,
how be damn this,

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,050
I didn't realize you could do that.

47
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,270
And so now people after seeing the pope
and young newsreel started asking Fred

48
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,350
to make bows and it spits spreads.
So we started the bear archery company,

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,810
late twenties,
early thirties.

50
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,950
And he moved to Graylin up in the northern
part of Michigan with a wilderness

51
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,750
was,
and they had cut down all the trees.

52
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,340
So there was this new growth of ideal
wildlife habitat because not many animals

53
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,960
can live in an old growth
forest and our tool.

54
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,340
But you need low level escape sanctuary
in browse that the animals can access.

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,530
And so Fred was now promoting our tree
in Michigan, one, all the, uh, uh,

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,070
national field archery championship
championships along with an Marston.

57
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,413
It's awesome.

58
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,420
And so my dad was a follower because
he'd come back from World War II and he

59
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:49,960
needed that escape.

60
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,100
He needed that cleansing to
get away from that horror,

61
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,480
which is why they never talked about it.
And so we go up north every year,

62
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,150
October 1st, the Nugen family
and the Ford station wagon.

63
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,070
And I have my little bone
Arrow with the suction cups.

64
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,050
And I shoot stuffed animals off the couch.

65
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,950
But my dad would walk the woods with his
real bow and we'd stop at this little,

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,210
uh, brick shack that said, bear
archery. And I had no idea.

67
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,170
And so I was already into bows and arrows
shooting all the time. I was obsessed.

68
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,340
I was an downriver every day. No baseball,
no football, no hockey, bows and arrows,

69
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,450
bows, murals, critters.

70
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,980
I think I had the songbird world's
slam by the time I was eight. And, uh,

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,700
and so now I'm meeting this tall,
lanky gentleman named Fred Bear.

72
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,930
And it didn't register with me until I
started seeing him on the cover of true

73
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:38,230
magazine and sporting magazines and,

74
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,030
and life magazine with a Grizzly bear
and an elephant and a tiger and a lion in

75
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:46,450
the newsreels. And I'm going, I'm shooting
river rats, which is so thrilling.

76
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,510
I can't even describe it. And
here's this long, lanky, tall,

77
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:54,511
lanky guy that was building bows in this
Russ rustic shop in northern Michigan

78
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,740
on my way to my favorite thing in life,

79
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,240
October 1st opening day of archery season
as a six, seven, eight year old boy.

80
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,990
And we'd have chocolate milk and
Cherry Pie with this Fred bear guy.

81
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,700
Now it's registering. This is the
Chuck Berry of [inaudible]. This is it.

82
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,630
This is the guy.

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,280
So I became a namerd with him and he
was kind to me and he'd show me stuff,

84
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,170
but I got to hang out with them as I grew.

85
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,280
By the time I was 16 we moved to Chicago,
was my dad got transferred,

86
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:24,340
but I got to visit with Fred bear
at least every other October.

87
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,880
Never hunted with them. And I
am now. I started Amboy. Dukes.

88
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,300
I had already had a great band when the
battle of the bands and Michigan with

89
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:33,610
the Lord's, we opened up for the Supremes
and the Beau Brummels at Cobo Hall. Wow.

90
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,190
And so now I'm in Chicago shooting
my bow and Arrow all the time.

91
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,770
Started the Amboy dukes
playing like a madman,

92
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,790
graduated in 67 went back to Michigan
that two years later and immediately went

93
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:45,100
up to grading.
We're now,

94
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:50,101
there's this huge cathedral bear archery
had Fred bear is like that dude is like

95
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:56,530
the sporting dude because he taught
the long range marksman that there's an

96
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,364
intimacy,

97
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,370
there's a a better learning process in
more important lesson to not kill the

98
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:08,681
animal but to understand your relationship
with the animal and to try to use

99
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,410
those God given gifts.

100
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:17,411
I mentioned a moment ago to penetrate
the otherwise impenetrable defense system

101
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:23,360
of game cause they are
sneaky, elusive, crafty.

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,570
God made them to get away from
guitar players with sharp sticks.

103
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,350
And so this caught on because people go,
you know,

104
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,760
I killed my deer every year with my 30 30
now with the 30 out six and Roy breath,

105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,030
whether it be long range,

106
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,510
I wonder if I'm a bad ass enough to get
close to a deer with a bow and arrow.

107
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,230
So it caught on like wildfire
and they made the first,

108
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,840
Fred got the first legal
season in Michigan,

109
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,040
the Alagan state park on November 1st,

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,210
1947 where George Nichols,

111
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:56,930
my buddy got the first legal buck in
Michigan with the bone Arrow on that

112
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,740
morning. And so I knew these are the guys
who hang with, these are the founders.

113
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,800
These were the you were,
I was at the Concord bridge of our tree.

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,310
And so Fred had embraced me and it was
real suspicious of the long haired hippy

115
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:13,940
looking, you know, rocking
Maniac Motor City Madman.

116
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,490
But all of his friends would
not, no, he's not into drugs.

117
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,800
He's in fact he's anti and he's always
promoting our trash out my bone arrow on

118
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,310
stage forever. Now it should. Flaming
Arrows at skulls and a big illegal,

119
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,850
I think it was a felony, a
big Turkey vulture. I had
stopped, but it looked great.

120
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:32,030
Backlit, you know, and I'd shoot
that fucker off this amps at night.

121
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,920
People didn't know whether
to shit or go blind

122
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,400
is is wild man screen the bird lands.
We

123
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,520
make it all this outrageous racket.

124
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,910
I come up with a bow and
Arrow and a flaming Arrow
and blow up a Turkey vulture.

125
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,560
What more do you want?
And so Fred got

126
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,300
pass the insanity of the
fear factor of rock and roll.

127
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,560
And he finally admitted to me, he said,
every sporting good show I go to Ted,

128
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,331
all the young people,

129
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,450
anybody under 30 all they want
to know is if I know Ted Nugent,

130
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,000
because that was the first
time they ever saw bone arrow.

131
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,380
And they read my you my
interviews about the, the spirit,

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,960
the cleansing of escaping the insanity
of whatever your job description might

133
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,850
be. Mine beaten, maniacal rock and roll.

134
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,230
I need to shut the fuck up,

135
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,580
take a deep breath,
get my bone arrow,

136
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,420
letting my guitars breed
head back to the woods.

137
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,260
And live and and remember who I am and
what I'm here for and I never killed a

138
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:43,820
deer. I was a little too uppity and we
didn't know what we were doing back then.

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,740
You have too uppity, you think? What
do you mean? I just, I'm high energy.

140
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,810
So you had to, I do. I write
about too loud. I mean,

141
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,070
I could walk.
I learned from,

142
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,410
I learned walk toe first and I learned
to go around anything you instead of

143
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,890
stepping over and to stay in the shadows.
So I knew of the maneuvers,

144
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,210
but coming out of a tour and played 350
nights a year and then you get a couple

145
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,890
of days off during November
and you get the bone arrow.

146
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,830
It's hard to go from that
to total silence. Yes.

147
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,610
But you know what Joe, what? I've
mastered it. Well, I know. Yeah.

148
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,603
I finally,

149
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,920
I mean I did buy it and you might have
six long time by the 60s I don't know

150
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:29,700
about masters. You'll never master
it, but I have mastered transition.

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,400
What do you say when people like that?

152
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,200
One of the arguments about hunting that
people bring up is why would you use in

153
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:38,360
a bow and Arrow bow and
arrows not as effective. If
you wanted to kill something,

154
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,203
you should use a gun.

155
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,900
There's people that don't hunt that think
that hunting should only be one thing

156
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,820
and it should only be
killing the animal from me.

157
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,950
Whereas I think that someone who hunts
definitely kills the animal from me.

158
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,120
There's more,

159
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,680
there's more to the whole thing and do
you ever seen me expound on that fun

160
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,380
sport meet trophy.

161
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,140
You can't hunt without having
fun or you won't do it.

162
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,060
It's fun to challenge yourself.

163
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,730
It's fun to get up into those aren't
able to have a problem with that word.

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,140
They can kiss my ass if it wasn't fun.
None of us would do it.

165
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,650
I understand your, your your take
on it, they can kiss, kiss your ass,

166
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,240
but you, it means something to
you. It's not as simple as like,

167
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,074
fuck you,

168
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,110
this is just how I'm going to do deep fun
is being the greatest basketball three

169
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,550
point shooter. Isn't it fun? It must
be discipline. He went. But it's,

170
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,090
it's always fun.

171
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,770
It's because it's invigorating and the
bow hunting is more invigorating because

172
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:39,030
it's so difficult. So disorder
lining, possible fun sport.

173
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,750
Why don't think sport hunting is good?
You shouldn't have sport.

174
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,000
How can you hot without sport?
Well,

175
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,670
don't you think that there's just
too many of these words are poisoned.

176
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,960
There's like trophy hunting by eight
at term. Can't hunt without a trophy.

177
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,690
You know what I have on my wall to
my northern cabin. You're going to,

178
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,120
you already are inclined to love me,

179
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:58,880
but now really going to say
you're going for you to,

180
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:01,630
but fuck me right here on the whoa.
That's not love.

181
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,030
Well it's a metaphorically speaking.
That is for some of my buddies. Anyhow,

182
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,010
so I'm the wall of my cabin in
northern Michigan is my first kill.

183
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:15,990
November 15th, 1969 with my dad's
pre 67 bottles. Stuck button. Buck.

184
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,590
Do you hear the story? Yeah. And I
took it to the taxidermist and I said,

185
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:23,250
I want this mind when he said here to
mount this, you'll, yeah, no buck button.

186
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:26,820
Button. Buck is a font of the year with
the, has little buttons on his forehead,

187
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,960
which is illegal deer with a doe tag.
And I had that year and I said,

188
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,310
it's a buck feel.
You have to feel on the head,

189
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,750
make sure it is a buck is it's such
a little guy and it's illegal dear.

190
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,150
And it's a delicious deer
there. Deer, the years of fun.

191
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,850
That's why we have this hunting
season in the fall because now they're

192
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,100
independent. They're not there
have been weaned. They're,

193
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,520
they're independent animals. In
fact, the, the button bucks are,

194
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,300
they're acids get kicked by their
mother to throw him out of the herd,

195
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,880
get the hell out of the way for more
breeding, which is what I do. And uh,

196
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,250
and so I have that button buck mounted.
Well,

197
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,960
who's going to tell me
that's not a trophy?

198
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,630
Tha Tha Tha Tha experiences the
memories, the clothes, the bullets,

199
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:09,430
the day, the sunrise, the crows,
the sandhill cranes, the birds,

200
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,430
the movement,
the anticipation.

201
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,920
And I got backstraps, I had
fun, ultimate discipline,

202
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:22,600
challenge, sport, ultimate
meet, ultimate protein,

203
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:26,570
the purest, most organic before
it was even hip. And if you,

204
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,390
I dare you to tell me that button.
Buck is not a trophy. I got,

205
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,900
I have wood chucks mounted.
I got a shot.

206
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:38,260
I would chuck in the eye with my grandson.
I have,

207
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,850
I have squirrels. Mud. He's always a
trophy. Mounted a squirrel. I sure I'm,

208
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm the squirrels czar. Um, you know,
when you, when you first started out,

209
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,450
you killed that first squirrel.
That's exciting stuff.
