1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,510
This is something that
everyone contemplates, like
what makes you conscious?

2
00:00:04,511 --> 00:00:08,530
What is the soul? Is that a real thing?
What is, what is your consciousness?

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,520
Is it's simply just your own biology
trying to calculate your environment and

4
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:15,730
looking out for its best interests and
trying to procreate and move forward with

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,160
the,
the genes that had has,

6
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:22,780
or is it something almost
mystical or far more complicated?

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,540
Maybe even instead of the word
mystical might be tainted,

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,440
maybe something far more complex than
we're currently able to understand.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,150
I think to some extent I would he agree
to it because it's suddenly different.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,510
I need to have some internal
perception of the external world and,

11
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,910
and be able to think abstractly
and all these things.

12
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,390
It's surely different from way a baseball
runs through the air and what makes it

13
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,690
spin and and different than
every other conscious animal.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,210
I'm not so sure about that. So I think the
difference isn't that big real. I mean,

15
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:01,720
okay, we, you know, we
use language to a degree.

16
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:04,870
I mean some animals use
language to some kind of degree.

17
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,530
There's a huge difference in degree.
I'd agree with that.

18
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,510
But whether it's a difference in kind,
I'm not at all. Sure. Um, you know,

19
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:18,511
you watch these nature movies
and I remember seeing one
about elephants and this

20
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:23,610
was about how the elephants were,
there was a,

21
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:27,250
there were always led by a
female elephant, and that's
not relevant to the story,

22
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:31,620
but they were trying to go from a to B,
I don't know maybe what it was. And they,

23
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,460
there's a whole herd of
them then we doing that.

24
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:38,320
But then at a certain point they made
a detour and they went off to a place

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,000
where the leader of the elephant herd,
her sister had died.

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,130
And the, the bones tusks, I
suppose with their bones. Anyway,

27
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,910
we're there and the elephants pick
them up, handed them around and,

28
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:55,120
and seem to caress them
and move them around.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,310
And then they went back and joined to the,
the route that they were.

30
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,600
Now what does that tell us?
There's something going on,

31
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:06,601
which is not just some
machine behaving like a robot.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,440
There's some, some feelings there
that we can appreciate. I mean,

33
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:13,720
another one I remember was one with these,
uh,

34
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,260
hunt African hunting dogs
and the dogs you see there,

35
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:22,450
there's a route where some antelopes we
tend to go net to go across the river.

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,440
And when they got to the point where
the crossfit and that slow down and,

37
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,280
and make their way to get across now
these hunting dogs, you could see them,

38
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,240
I think it was taken from the air and
they would go along towards this place

39
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,940
where the river was and then
they would break into two.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,070
So half of them would
go one way towards the,

41
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,260
and they will hide just where the river
starts and the other half would go and

42
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:45,130
chase the antelopes.

43
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,890
They'd gone back and make an awful
noise chasing them right there.

44
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,670
And then the other ones were pants on
them. I mean there's something there,

45
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,480
which is, you know, there'd been
working it out between themselves.

46
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:59,740
How to do as commute
communication of some kind. Yes.

47
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,330
And I think there is, what would
you call understanding. Okay.

48
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,950
It's a more primitive level and then
human understanding. But nevertheless,

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,380
there was something, there's
no sort of clean dividing
line in my view. It's, it's,

50
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:18,700
it's pretty continuous. Yeah. And this
exists in wolves as well, so very,

51
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,701
very similar behavior and they do seem
to have not just verbal but nonverbal

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,271
communication.

53
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,350
They seemed to have some understanding
of what the task is and what their roles

54
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,490
are in the task.

55
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,440
And even though there's not as many
variables maybe as human life there,

56
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:39,580
there definitely seems to be a conscious
awareness of, first of all, their,

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,230
their position in the hierarchy of
the tribe of the pack reminiscing,

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,760
but also their,
what their objective is this,

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,510
this is not a selfish objective.

60
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:54,460
It's a group objective and they operate
as a group and they do move like those

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,750
African dogs you were talking about.
Yeah, no, it's fascinating. Love. Yeah.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,970
And there's a lot of indication that uh,
my certainty,

63
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,580
chimps and elephants and things
and dolphins, we know about them,

64
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,430
but I imagine it guys quiet file down.
I should think.

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,260
How much have you studied a Octopi?
They're fascinating. Yes. No I haven't.

66
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,050
There's a new book about them, which I
haven't gotten the chance to read yet.

67
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,090
I wanted to read it. I think
they're, they're highly
intelligent. Yes, yes. Yeah.

68
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,150
I've only different really paying
attention to them for a few years.

69
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:29,470
I have a good friend. My Friend Remy
Warren was doing a television show, um,

70
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,060
called Apex Predator.

71
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:36,061
We studied the way different animals
hunted and he started studying the way

72
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:41,290
octopus and um, uh, cuddle fish
and all these different, yeah,

73
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,930
different,
uh,

74
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,560
Octopi and w the way they could adapt
to their environment by changing their

75
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,450
actual,
they'll not just the look,

76
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:53,830
but the texture of their skin
instantaneously and how this is not really

77
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:58,510
understood how the, not only how they
do it, but how they know what they're,

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,170
what's below them, what
they're copying. Yes.

79
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,710
That they somehow or another can figure
out how to blend in almost perfectly

80
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,600
with their environment.
It's amazing, isn't it?

81
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,350
They also can open jars and
Lincoln climb out of tanks.

82
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,630
There was one guy had a,

83
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,660
he had a camera on his tank because he
had two tanks and one of them had very

84
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:20,380
expensive tropical fish.

85
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,710
And the other one had his octopus and
he was trying to figure out what was

86
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,660
happening to his expensive tropical fish.

87
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:29,770
We put a camera on it and the
octopus was climbing out of the tank,

88
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,880
walking across the ground, climbing into
the other tank, killing one of the fish,

89
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,590
eating it, and then going back into
his tank. Yes. Yeah, that's heavy.

90
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,990
Well, there's one I saw, but I think
I heard the description or I read it.

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,710
I think I read it about some experiments
on testing the intelligence of

92
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,890
octopuses though,
and they had a digital thing.

93
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:54,130
They had to pull the chain and then
open the door and getting food out,

94
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,760
and this octopus was thinking, damn, I'm
going to fed out with this thing and say,

95
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:58,810
Yank the chain.

96
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,230
It came right off and then it rose to
the top and started squirting all the

97
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:07,210
people in their white coats.
So I know that was pretty good.

98
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:10,210
You know, there's something else going
on than just there is something going on.

99
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:10,870
Absolutely.
