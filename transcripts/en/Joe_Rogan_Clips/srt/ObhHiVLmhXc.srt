1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,210
The joe rogan experience,
if you always like that.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,900
I was reading something really interesting
where they were saying that they are

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,950
are fucking up the brand because they've
put them into discount stores that

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,100
they're trying to raise the sails and
by raising the sales they put them in a

5
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,290
discount stores.
By putting them in the discount stores,

6
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:19,660
they're going to change the
way people look at the brand.

7
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,690
It's not going to be worth as much.
That's probably very realistic, man.

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,190
That's very interesting.

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,570
Weird people think so weird and know
like if you saw a pair of Nike's at a

10
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,920
discount store, would you like
Google folk? Nokia were like,

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,240
and what that what that means zero to me.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,830
Yeah. No, and they hit mean in Nike has
a outlet stores, which is like discount.

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,540
Yes. You know, so that's, that's kind
of weird, but it is true about how,

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,340
I mean the other one is like that big
baller brand there basically attempting to

15
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,900
compete in the apparel

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,970
world. Lavar Ball, right? Yeah.

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,300
That's the guy that got in that crazy
thing because his son was arrested in

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,190
China for shoplifting the China. He
was in China. Yeah, he was shoplifting.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,870
And then Trump says he got 'em out and
the dad says he didn't get them out.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,260
Yeah, it's that, that's him then.
And then the dad is, you know,

21
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:09,094
Trump's calling the data.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,810
What happened? That trumps, I mean
well that guy is very brash Lavar ball.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,740
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,890
But I mean I think you know that guy
knows what he's doing man. As far as,

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,050
as far as PR,
definitely.

26
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,050
He knows he's going to say some wild
shit and he knows people are going to be

27
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,240
like, oh my God, what did he say?

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,470
And then he knows that that
gets him more press and like it,

29
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:34,190
it kind of just feeds itself and people
act like he believed the fucking crazy

30
00:01:34,191 --> 00:01:36,740
shit that asshole just said. And
he's like, yeah, that's what I do.

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,550
And that's why you keep putting me on
the show like Trump when he was running

32
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:44,450
for prom 100% it's the same school
of thought. And now though that guy,

33
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,640
so he has a son named Lonzo plays
for the Lakers. Who's a first round,

34
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,230
first round draft pick, like
a, a top tier player from Ucla.

35
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,850
Then his other son was two more sons.
One of them was on Ucla team this year,

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,900
got arrested for shoplifting in China.
If he hadn't been released,

37
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:05,540
if it wasn't high politically,
you know, highly publicized thing.

38
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,390
He definitely could have gone
to jail for a while in China.

39
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,940
They don't fuck around,
you know, so, but anyways,

40
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:16,210
when he got out and came back Lavar
pulled him from like from school,

41
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
from Ucla and also pulled his 16 year
old son at a high school and flew them to

42
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,600
Lithuania where they're now playing.

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,910
Both of them were playing professional
basketball in Lithuania and professional

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,570
professional class quotes.
Jamie did the air quotes.

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,720
It's got to be in big air quotes for sure.
Well, I mean there's definitely some,

46
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,020
some good players that come out
of there, but it's like, um,

47
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,830
I mean it is a circus over there. If you
see like how it was when they arrived,

48
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,910
it was like, it's like some, it's
crazy. The reception, you know,

49
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,430
what is he trying to do now?
He's trying to start some new league.

50
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,720
He's trying to do a couple things.

51
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:58,721
He started a brand big baller brand and
they know that's like ball and beaten

52
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,270
and came out with these shoes.
They're basically $500 retail sneakers.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
And if you're like, that's
expensive. He's like,

54
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,880
cause you're not a big baller bitch.
That's why not.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,850
That's like what are they like made by
a real organization? Well Adidas, no,

56
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,300
no, no, no, no. They're not made by
definitely not any. And by the way,

57
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,230
the sun that's in the MBA
turned down real money,

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,960
like real fucking money
because he was like, I the,

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:29,100
the father demanded that you basically
pay to develop this brand from the big

60
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,290
uh, apparel. And the guy's like,

61
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,890
give us like a billion dollar contract
and like develop this brand. What?

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,940
And they were like, no, we're
not doing that. And he's like,

63
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,630
well then we're not even gonna talk to
you about endorsing my science. Seriously.

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,170
100% yes.
Then now he's had like,

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,200
there's so much a conversation about
the brand that he's definitely elevated.

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,290
Like the awareness of it. What? We
don't know what nobody knows is like,

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,310
to what level are they actually selling
this apparel? You know, like are they,

68
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,880
because they have everything, they
have shirts and shoes they're getting,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,440
they just got it rated an
f by the better business.

70
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:12,880
Right around their shoes are not the ones
they sold the previous sold a bunch of

71
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:15,790
shoes and there's like the
ones that people are getting
are not what they bought.

72
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,210
So people are pissed. There's no
way to return or the fun. Yeah.

73
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,980
Great fun to or exchange them.
Yeah.

74
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,660
And they're just telling
people they're literally,

75
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,910
I think I read that the customer
service people told you, you, oh,

76
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:29,050
you must be a brook baller then.
Yeah. You're not satisfied. Yeah.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,550
That's literally what it, oh my God.
But he's also, I mean he's, so anyways,

78
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,820
he stays, he's about, he
took these kids to Lithuania,

79
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,560
they're going to play basketball.
He's like,

80
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,250
he basically says they're going to be on
the Lakers when my three sons are going

81
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,670
to be Lakers. Right. So,

82
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:47,671
and we have no idea really realistically
whether the two younger sons even have,

83
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,260
we don't know. To be fair, whether they're
going to be MBA quality players yet,

84
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,010
you know, like the clearly one
is the one is on the Lakers,

85
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,280
but so we don't know if that's going
to pan out in any way, shape or form.

86
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,520
He also talked about developing a league
for like kids that are coming out of

87
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:11,491
high school that don't want
to go to college and play
in a league where they get

88
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,460
paid like a salary, you
know, a reasonable salary,

89
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,020
which is, uh, an an idea that a
lot of people think is fascinating.

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,070
I don't know logistically whether
he could pull that off. You know,

91
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:27,100
that's kind of a, I got to know
for sure. Right? I mean, but,

92
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,760
but the idea is one that people have
talked about for years because college

93
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:33,070
athletes generate a lot of revenue

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,790
[inaudible].
