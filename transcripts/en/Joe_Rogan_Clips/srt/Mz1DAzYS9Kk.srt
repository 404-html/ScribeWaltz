1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,080
Just not too misleading.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,700
There's a mathematical theorem
called the hairy dog theorem.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,120
Hairy dog theory. Yes. I mean, that's
just a jocular terminology, right?

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,270
But you think of something
which is topologically a sphere,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,820
that means you see it,
you imagine a dog shape,

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,230
but you could sort of move it around with
a piece of plasticine until it looked

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,540
like a sphere. It doesn't
have holes in it. Okay.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,370
Forget about his digestive system.
You see,

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,450
you're thinking about the surface
outside and then you're out.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,570
The problem is you try to comb the hair
on the dog all the way around and the

11
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:38,310
theorem says there's got to be somewhere
with the hair doesn't lie flat and you

12
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,031
tried it on a sphere.

13
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,990
There's gotta be a point where with the
hair makes a kind of singular point.

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,330
So it's a bit like that. You have no idea
where the singularity is, but you know,

15
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:52,950
from general, top logical reasons
that there's got to be one somewhere.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,570
And that was the tour of
argument that I produced. And uh,

17
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,000
I guess a lot of people,

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,700
it'd be trouble because they
never seen this kind of argument.

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,220
And a lot of people picked up on it
and particular Stephen Hawking and uh,

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,660
it became for a while, uh,
many people working on it,

21
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,550
I guess it's not so popular now because
probably will run out of theorems.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,020
The idea of a singularity is
when you see something like a,

23
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:29,910
a Quasar or the,
the center of a galaxy.

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,260
Um, and we were talking a lot of black
hole. When you say a singularity, what,

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,690
what exactly are you, do
you mean by that? Well,

26
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:42,691
the normal expectation is that you have
a place like in the middle of the up and

27
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,210
Amazon,
that dust cloud,

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,130
that a point there where the
density becomes infinite.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,400
And so the curvature of
space time becomes infinite.

30
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,850
So you have a place where the equations
and run away and they go to infinity and

31
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,570
you say, well, something's gone wrong.

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,500
But maybe initially it was in
these very symmetrical cases,

33
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:09,501
but what you could show by these indirect
arguments that somewhere somebody has

34
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,494
got to go wrong.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,680
You can't continue the equations of
Einstein and they got stuck to the place

36
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:21,330
where they go in from it.
Or what in detail happens.
The theorems don't tell you.

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,740
They just say that something goes wrong
and that's what we call the singularity

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,750
and if a black hole is larger or smaller,
the singularity remains constant.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,990
It remains in in there.
It's remains in there,

40
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,460
but it's not measurable in terms of its
actual size or whether you can measure

41
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,390
size very well cause it's size.
I said that's an intriguing question.

42
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,910
You might say the size is going to zero.

43
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,970
It could be quite
complicated in irregular,

44
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,870
not like the original Avenova
slide or one of my soldiers.

45
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,650
Even then the point is the wrong point
of view, but let's not go into that.

46
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,590
Now if there is something about
the structure of these things,

47
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:03,360
you can say they're not all the same.
No. Then the singularity is in Arlington,

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,270
but the black holes are not all the same.
They're not all the same, but the this,

49
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,740
one of the strange things about black
holes is that if you let them settle down,

50
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,510
they're not all the same to begin with,

51
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,020
but there are not many different
things they can settled into.

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,640
They can have rotation.

53
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,641
They can have a certain mass and the
mass translates into the size of the

54
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,630
diameter of the hole.

55
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,140
And you've also got a rotation so they
can rotate these sweatshirt found the non

56
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,550
wrote anyone's and it was Roy occur
in Australia and who first produced a

57
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:40,640
solution for a rotating
black hole rotating. Yes,

58
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:41,620
a rotating one.

59
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,040
But then you see the remarkable thing
is that's what they settled down too.

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,330
So there are good theorem this which
tell you that the general black hole to

61
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,270
very complicated,

62
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,980
fairly rapidly will settle down and
become one of these care solutions.

63
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,180
The rotating black hole.

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,350
I remember when I first saw
that documentary and I saw the,

65
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,030
when they were discussing the,

66
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,590
the shape of these galaxies and that
the center of it had this super massive

67
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,830
black hole that was slowly
devouring the galaxy. It's,

68
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,850
it is an unbelievably beautiful yet
simultaneously terrifying idea is that

69
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:21,181
there's this infinite power in the
center of infinite mass that's absorbing

70
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,650
slowly but surely everything around it.
But it's not an infinite mass.

71
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:30,550
The mass is quite well defined and
there's not an infinite, but yeah,

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,890
always a good question.
I mean if you wait forever,

73
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,810
how much of the mass actually gets
swallowed by the black hole? You see,

74
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:41,200
I think the, the pictures to think not
just the one galaxy, but the cluster.

75
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:47,170
UCR Galaxy has this 4 million solar mass
black hole and we are on a collision

76
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:52,360
course with the Andromeda galaxy
and I don't know how long,

77
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,930
but many book some time in the
future. Yes. The black holes,

78
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,960
we'll probably spiral into each
other and there'll be one big one.

79
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,730
So it's definable mass,

80
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:05,170
but in infinite density and
that this point, which were,

81
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,430
they were speculating that this could
possibly in the center of the supermassive

82
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:13,840
black holes, if you could go through that,
there would be another universe. Well,

83
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,840
speculations, a nice romantic
thought. It's more woo woo,

84
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,780
I'm afraid. So also good though. Yes,

85
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,890
I know it's a shame for science fiction
because it makes a nice thing that we

86
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,190
try to make things more complicated than
they are because they're so complicated

87
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:33,910
as it is dark matter for instance,
it,

88
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,440
it boggles the mind that we don't
really totally understand what 90 plus

89
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:43,000
percent. Well, that's a good question.
And what does that stuff, well,

90
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,100
do you want me to tell you
my theory? Yes, please.

91
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,000
Why do you see it's part of a story which,
um,

92
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,760
I don't know about 15 years ago,
I must have years of passing back.

93
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,480
I don't remember how long ago
now. So I had this idea, you see,

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,790
the universe as a whole is expanding now,

95
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,600
um,
early in the this century.

96
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,820
Don't ask me dates again.
Um, some people by observing

97
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:19,010
supernova saw exposing sauce very,
very far away.

98
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,140
They found out that the university is
actually accelerating and it's expansion.

99
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,670
And some people found this very
mysterious. On the other hand,

100
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:33,671
it's in all the cosmology books
because there is that expectation.

101
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,690
You see, in 1915 I signed,
produced his general theory.

102
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,020
In 1917 he introduced what's
called the cosmological constant.

103
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,080
So you think of a,
it was called lambda,

104
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,530
you think of a v shape turned upside down,
which is Amanda.

105
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,290
And he introduced this term for the
wrong reason because at that time people

106
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,650
weren't, there was some indication
in the universe was expanding,

107
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,770
but not very clear. An Einstein, uh,

108
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,830
I guess maybe didn't know I
didn't believe it. And this,

109
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,070
the couples observations hadn't yet
come to make a convincing case of the

110
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:16,670
expansion. So I sign, I thought,
well maybe the universe is static.

111
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,760
It's kind of philosophically nice to think
that it's sitting there all the time.

112
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,150
And he couldn't make it do that.
Uh,

113
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,560
so he had to introduce this term
called the cosmological constant.

114
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,870
And he did that.

115
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:34,871
And then not while very much longer
after this Hobo showed that the universe

116
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,820
does seem to be expanding.

117
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,460
And Einstein regarded this lambda
term as his biggest blunder,

118
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,250
which is an irony because it turns
out that this term is probably the

119
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:52,760
explanation for the expansion
of the universe that we now see.

120
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,010
So it's what people call dark energy.

121
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,940
I don't like the term very
much cause it's neither dark,

122
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:02,870
no proper energy in any clear sense.
But still that was not worry about that.

123
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,190
Right. It's a, it's a, it's
an odd term. Yes. I think so.

124
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,830
It's a little confusing cause
there's dark matter as well,

125
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:11,100
which is quite different.
You know, should,

126
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,020
it must be confused with the
dark energy as it's called,

127
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,080
of the cosmological constant,
which as far as we can tell,

128
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,740
it is completely consistent
with the observations.

129
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,020
It's a positive number,
very small,

130
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,860
but seems to be producing this expansion.

131
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,140
And I'm quite happy with that viewpoint
because it leads to a picture,

132
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:38,060
which I've been trying to plug for
a while now, maybe up to 15 years.

133
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:42,080
I can't remember. Um, the idea,

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,690
I know it's hard to explain,
but let me try.

135
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,340
It came about because I was worrying about
the remote future and I was thinking,

136
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,340
okay, when these black holes around this
fall in all the stars and they're just

137
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:01,080
sitting around, and what's the
most next exciting thing happening?

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,560
Well, the hawking evaporation,
they're going to radiate away.

139
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,940
Stephen Hawking showed that black holes
had this temperature is extremely cold.

140
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:12,270
I mean,
these enormous ones are absurdly cold,

141
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,070
much colder than anything
made on the earth. And uh,

142
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,440
but when the universe expands
and expands and expands,

143
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,340
it gets colder than the black holes.
And so those black holes get,

144
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:27,150
become the hottest, hottest things
around. And so they radiate away very,

145
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:31,920
very slowly. This hawking
radiation and that carries energy.

146
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:36,000
And so they shrink and shrink and the
shrink and finally they disappear with a

147
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,090
pop. I said pop is probably
a pretty big explosion, but,

148
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,660
but I'm not that big from a
cosmological astrophysical scale.

149
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,740
So the disappear,

150
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,130
well it maybe been pretty boring when
you're sitting around waiting for the

151
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,490
black hole and go pop. But
afterwards, that's really boring.

152
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,790
So this was a picture I thought off
and being rather depressed by it,

153
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,630
thinking that stats are that fate.

154
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,570
You see the feed of all the
interesting things happening.

155
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,080
Ultimate fate is this
unbelievably boring final state.

156
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,610
Okay, this is an emotional argument,
but giving me a bit of leeway.

157
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,670
So I began to think,
well,

158
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:18,750
it's not going to be us who are going to
be bored because we're not going to be

159
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,810
around the main things that we'll
be around. We'll be photons.

160
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,680
And it's pretty hard to Bora
photon for two very good reasons.

161
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,560
One is it probably doesn't have
conscious experiences. Not that sure. So,

162
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,960
but the other is more of the science
point that that they don't measure time

163
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,850
because the photon has no mass.

164
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,320
It travels at the speed of light
and what the way relativity works,

165
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,870
it means that clocks stopped if you like.

166
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,050
So if it had experiences with the moment
of its creation would be one moment and

167
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:52,890
the next moment would be infinity.

168
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,760
And so they're just zip out to
infinity without noticing thing.

169
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,910
Now she had been doing
work on this kind of thing,

170
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:03,510
thinking more about
gravitational radiation and
how you measure it's energy and

171
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,780
things like that.
And it was a very useful picture too.

172
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,580
Squashed down infinity.
A useful thing to think about here,

173
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,780
if you see these pictures by the
Dutch artist Mc Escher. Yeah.

174
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,330
And there are those which
are called circle limits,

175
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,530
and there's a very famous one with angels
and devils interlocking and they get

176
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,870
all crowded up onto
the edge and they want,

177
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:29,010
you've got to think about is that this
is a kind of geometry called hyperbolic

178
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:29,790
geometry,

179
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,350
and the angels and devils live in that
geometry and the ones right close to the

180
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:38,480
edge think they're the same size and
same shape as the ones in the middle. Oh,

181
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,350
you got it. Great. Yeah.

182
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,860
And so the idea is that if you look at
it from the angels and devils point of

183
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:52,110
view, that's infinity, that
boundary. But from our point of view,

184
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,990
we can look at,
and we have what's called a conformal map.

185
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,060
That picture is a conformal map,

186
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,070
but that means is that little
shapes are quite consistently drawn,

187
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,450
but there can be big or small and you
don't care about whether they're big or

188
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:12,400
they're small. Small shapes are
accurate or angles if you like,

189
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:15,610
her correctly drawn.
So it's what's called a conformal map.

190
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,330
And that can form a map,
describes infinity.

191
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,930
Now you can do the same thing to
the universe. When I say do it, um,

192
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,010
you can imagine it where
this remote future,

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,630
you can squash it down
just like in the ash,

194
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,680
a picture to a finite boundary.

195
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,960
And as far as the things with no mass,

196
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,540
they don't have a way of
measuring how big or small it is.

197
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,080
The Maxwell equations don't know
the scales, they don't care.

198
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,610
It's that work just as well for smaller,

199
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,520
so big and you can stretch it in
someplace and squash it somewhere else.

200
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,400
As long as the stretching
and squashing is isotropic.

201
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,500
So just as much one way as the other way,

202
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,280
which means more or less that you keep
what I call the light cones there.

203
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,360
And it's not going to details here,
but it means that if you have

204
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,280
things without mass and most
particularly the photons,

205
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,850
then that boundary is
just like anywhere else.

206
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,040
And the photons go zipping up to it.

207
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,450
And so you might think they've got to
have somewhere to go, okay, well that's,

208
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,120
you don't have to think that.
But that was the point of view I had.

209
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,390
The photons need to need
somewhere to enter it in a way.

210
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,110
But then where does it go?
But then there's the other picture,

211
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,330
which is the opposite.
Then there's the big bang.

212
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,450
Now you can do a similar
sort of trick there,

213
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:34,350
which is stretching it out and making
it into a boundary and that can be done

214
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,410
too. I played around with these ideas
for a long time and the standards,

215
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,600
cosmology and models you can do it with,

216
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,860
but the more complicated cosmology
models you might have one,

217
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:47,560
which a very complicated,
big bang.

218
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,960
The general ones don't
look like that at all,

219
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,260
so you need to condition which tells
you that the big bang was a very special

220
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,980
kind that it was.

221
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,520
It's all tied up with this thing called
the second law of thermodynamics and it

222
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:03,910
all ties together with physics in a way
which perhaps we don't have time to talk

223
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,720
about,

224
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,720
but it seemed to me a really good idea
to have the condition on the big bang

225
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,570
that you could continue it
in the same way I should say.

226
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,500
The idea of doing this was a
former student of mine, Paul Todd,

227
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:22,030
who was a colleague of mine and
he used this continuum conform.

228
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,120
What continuation is,

229
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,700
is a nice way of saying what the condition
is on the big bang to give you what

230
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,780
you want. But that's a huge
condition, but it nevertheless,

231
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:34,930
it's what starts our universe off in,

232
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:39,910
in a very special state,
which is what we live off in a way.

233
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:43,270
It's the second law of thermodynamics
and needs that to get going anyway.

234
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,850
I don't know if you want to
worry about that, but anyway,

235
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:50,851
the point was that it looks as though
it's a good condition on the big bang,

236
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,940
but it also should be
conformally. Uh, like a boundary,

237
00:14:55,941 --> 00:15:00,200
which if you had no mass,
you wouldn't notice it. Okay.

238
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,690
You've got particles with mass
running around near the Big Bang,

239
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,780
but as you get closer and closer
and closer to the energy goes up,

240
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,350
the temperature goes.
Zuni, zooming up these,

241
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:13,351
zipping around at such a speed that the
energy of their motion is much bigger

242
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,970
than the equals MC squared mass.

243
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,760
Einstein's mass,

244
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,540
the energy in the mass
is a certain amount,

245
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,620
but when they get so hot,
you can forget about the mass.

246
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:33,070
So they like photons behave
like particles without mass,

247
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,950
and so they're just interested
in the conformal geometry.

248
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,110
So the crazy idea I had,

249
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,670
not just on the stretch out of the
big Vangie swatched on the infinity,

250
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,360
but maybe our big bang was a squash
down infinity of a previous Ian.

251
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,520
So I'm saying our Ian
began with a big bang,

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,470
ended up with this exponential expansion.
There was another one before us.

253
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:04,190
They will be another one Ostriss. There
was another one before that and so on.

254
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,500
So it's an infinite cycle of big bangs.

255
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,710
That's the picture and constant expansion
to the point where there's no more

256
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,410
energy and then somehow or another,
a big bang comes out of that. Yes,

257
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:14,680
that's right. Well, that's the
tricky part that people have trouble.

258
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,960
It's universally accepted that
the big bang was an event.

259
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,340
There's no a pretty well universally
theories that are attractive.

260
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,950
I would say nothing terribly popular.

261
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,510
There are certain ideas which say you
can continue into the before the Big Bang

262
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,370
Paul Steinhauser and what
are they thinking? It's it's,

263
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,610
it has things in common with my
model but it's not quite the same.

264
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,490
And you see it still is,

265
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,510
he there wasn't right not
long after Einstein produces
theory and this Alexandra

266
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,140
Friedman who was a Russian mathematical
physicist and he produced the first

267
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:58,070
cousin cause mammalogy mammals and one
of these was a one which has sort of

268
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,020
bounces and big bang.

269
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:03,130
It expands and contracts again
and it bounces and contract.

270
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:04,640
And so that was the one of his models.

271
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,570
The only trouble is if you put
irregularities into these models,

272
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,470
you get black holes and these black holes
could pull McCook and incredible mess

273
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:16,400
at the end. And that doesn't join onto
a nice smooth, big bang. The next one.

274
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,590
So you have trouble with those models,

275
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:22,200
but still people take these
things seriously. And as I
say, Steinhardt and tour,

276
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,390
I kind of a model which is like that.
So these are the things to think about.

277
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,850
My own view is that they don't take into
account the, the, the black hole problem,

278
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,740
which is that,
uh,

279
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,270
my one gets rid of that because the
black holes all evaporate away by hawking

280
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:42,650
evaporation. And uh, so it forms a model.

281
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,930
I used to give talks about
this feeling quite happy.

282
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,370
Nobody would ever prove it wrong
so I can go on and talking loud.

283
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,480
That's a no,
I wasn't quite happy with that.

284
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:53,850
And I thought maybe you could
see signals coming through.

285
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:58,470
So I had one idea about that, but more
recently, and this is only just this year,

286
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,700
um,
I have to polish colleagues.

287
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,120
That's a Christoph Meisner and Pav on
your rough ski and there is a Korean who

288
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:12,180
works in New York or Daniel an and we,

289
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,650
the four of us have a paper,

290
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:18,651
which I think today or tomorrow will be
the new improved version of this paper

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,430
should be on the archive. And
this, the title of the paper is,

292
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:27,240
are we seeing hawking
points in the CMB sky?

293
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,770
Now what's a hawking point?
He said it talks about the black holes.

294
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,430
See in the previous aeon two hours,
assuming it's more or less like ours,

295
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,130
they will be black holes in
clusters of galaxies. Huge,

296
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:41,670
enormous ones swallowing up pretty well.
The whole cluster.

297
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,970
And what happens to the energy
in those black holes? Well,

298
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:48,660
it goes out in hawking
radiation and it takes an age,

299
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,850
ages and ages and ages,
maybe 10 to a hundred year,

300
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:57,060
Google years or something,
ages and ages,

301
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,070
but all that energy in the picture
comes up basically one point.

302
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,420
Think of that as your picture and right
at the very edge you see that an awful

303
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:11,421
lot of angels and devils squashed together
there so that the entire radiation

304
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:15,840
from that single black hole will
be squashed into that little point.

305
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,920
And where on the other
side, what do we see? Well,

306
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:24,300
there will be a big release of energy at
that point and that's what we call the

307
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,270
hawking point and it spreads out.

308
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,600
You see what we see in the
cosmic microwave background.

309
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:35,601
This is radiation coming from all
directions and this radiation doesn't come

310
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,860
from the big bang.
Exactly.

311
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,460
It comes from 380,000
years after the big bang.

312
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:45,240
So there's a sort of last scattering
surface where the photons which are trying

313
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:48,510
to get out [inaudible] finally can escape.

314
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,660
And we see them now that spread out from
the hawking point to what you see and

315
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,770
the cosmic microwave background in the
last scattering surface is something of

316
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,260
the diameter of about eight
times the diameter of the moon.

317
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,870
No bigger,
no smaller.

318
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,990
Now you wouldn't see the whole thing
because our past cone, where were we?

319
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,360
What we see it cut across it.
We don't see the whole thing,

320
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,440
but we see probably most of it.
So you could urge,

321
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,440
imagine something from about four
to eight times the moon's diameter,

322
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,060
which is a small region
which is highly energetic,

323
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,080
more energetic in the middle and it
tapers off as you go to the edge.

324
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,640
And we seem to see these things,
the analysis that um,

325
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,750
that the polls,

326
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,140
they have the techniques and
the actual analyzing the data.

327
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:49,420
This is the Planck satellite data
who's done by Daniel [inaudible].

328
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,020
And then we look at the data and we seem
to see an effect which see what you do

329
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,300
is you, we've got only one universe.
That's what to complain about.

330
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,890
So how do you know if
something's real or not?

331
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,830
What you make zillions of fake universes
and you compare this with them and

332
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:08,710
there's a lot of technique
about how you do this. But um,

333
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,740
Daniel first did a thousand of these
fakes and they were sort of two sizes of

334
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,010
these.

335
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,040
You look at these rings to see whether
the temperature goes out from the outside

336
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,370
to the middle.
And there were two sizes,

337
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,990
both within the size of I'd say
about four degrees across the sky.

338
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,510
And um, there was no evidence
of him at all in the simulation.

339
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:34,060
So this is a real effect.
Okay.

340
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:36,640
Then people were skeptical of
this for one reason or another.

341
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,560
So Daniel did another,

342
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,650
well 10,000 altogether and you cage
Nunnelly they or to which do what,

343
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:48,310
two or three to be precise where you
see this effect in the simulations.

344
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,910
But if you work out the probability
that this is a real effect,

345
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,940
you come up with a confidence level
of 99.98% that this is a real effect.

346
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,330
So we're waiting to see
what people say about this.
