1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,750
Hello Freak bitches. I've,
I mean, I did. I did one,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,780
I did Jimmy Fallon once seeding the Jimmy
Fallon and every organization wanting

3
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:15,910
to get me, what'd you say?
I was doing a joke, uh,

4
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:20,680
of singing. We were singing these
funny songs about who let the dogs out.

5
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,580
And so we took who let the dogs out
and put it in like a, um, like a,

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,750
like a Vaudeville or show tune who left
the dogs or whatever it was. Right.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,250
But beginning of that,

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,900
I sort of ad libbed like I was watching
these dogs and they were coming towards

9
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,550
me and I was wondering,
you know,

10
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:38,980
who let them out and there was
a pit bull there and you know,

11
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:42,250
you have to be careful because pit bulls
can be contained, curious, you know,

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,500
and then I go into the song,
the pit bull community,

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,340
it was like Jamie Foxx session
pitbull Seamus, you pit bull shit.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,630
And then there was another thing
where Jimmy Fallon was doing, um,

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,320
was doing some type of, uh, he was saying
what was going to be in the next show.

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,700
And I was doing a bad version of signing,

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,500
which I actually know how to sign,

18
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,450
but I was doing a bad
version of sign language.

19
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,850
I know sounding like we'll talk
more about it later, you know,

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,810
all those types of different things.
But as I was doing it as a joke,

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,110
I didn't know that the person that he
was talking about happened to be deaf.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,313
Okay.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,730
Oh No. Oh my God. And so then, you know,
so it was just all of these things.

24
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:30,450
And I tried to tell people, I said,
hey, listen, we never mean anything bad.

25
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,230
We poke fun, but we're not, we don't
mean anything bad, but you can't just,

26
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,460
you know, he can't, you can't kill us.
I, and I cause I to keep doing what I do,

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,800
you know? So it's, it's getting tougher.

28
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,540
Well, it's just what we were
talking about, about social media,

29
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,330
about people commenting on things
that you can't read the comments.

30
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:49,900
There's just too many people and people
are always looking for something to be

31
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,620
recreationally outraged that
in the comments to get that
ass through the comment,

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,200
comment and hit you right where
you are sometimes good. Damn.

33
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,620
This motherfucker's right.
Well it's good to though a little bit.

34
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,450
You went there right?
When they're actually right.

35
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,360
Like someone could say something
ridiculous about you and you know it's

36
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:07,450
ridiculous. It doesn't mean anything,
but if it's got a hint of truth,

37
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,450
but when somebody says
something about your teeth, you,

38
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,660
you kind of look in the mirror. I don't
understand it. Like I'm fucking, I got,

39
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:19,260
but I got somebody hit me with the donkey,
then you know it's fucking donkey.

40
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,970
I was like, ah. I start
talking like, yeah,

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,350
I didn't know if I give it a so you know,
but I tell people all the time,

42
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,030
don't read the comments.
That's the book.

43
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:30,840
Don't read the comments because it will
make you start to change the way you do

44
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:34,170
things. If I read all the comments,
I never tell another joke. Yeah.

45
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,900
If I read all the comments, I'll
never try another, you know,

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,400
I got a movie that we just a shot for
little or nothing called all star weekend

47
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:46,260
and the jokes are like all
the way out there, you know,
and I got everybody in it,

48
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,410
you know, and we're all taking
all played different characters.

49
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:52,590
Like I play a white
racist white racist cop.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,630
And how do you do that?

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:58,050
Awesome. I'll show it to you. I'll
grab it, I'll grab the thing, show tea.

52
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,330
But it's a, uh, Robert
Downey jr he plays a Mexican,

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,590
a Gerard Butler plays a Russian
who loves gymnastics. Uh,

54
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,890
Benicio del Toro plays this crazy
tattoo artist and we're all, you know,

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,220
we're all doing our thing.
So it's like if you read the comments,

56
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,790
that'll make you tuck that in. But this
is some brilliant and, and it's, it's,

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,390
it's a cool little thing to, it's, it's
called a all star weekend for a reason.

58
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,340
It's about two guys.
One guy loves Steph curry,

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,580
the other guy loves Lebron James and all
they're trying to do is get to the all

60
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,120
star game.

61
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,670
And it's sort of like this whole journey
of running into all these people.

62
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:31,120
So it's dope. But it is some things
where it's like, Ooh, you know,

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,250
you can see there's going to be some,
some shit gone.

64
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,670
But Robert Downey jr just from
tropic thunder, think about that.

65
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,180
You could never do that anymore. You
cannot blackface anymore. You know what?

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,890
I'll say this, people have to
understand where it comes from.

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,540
There are real people that did it
really mean you harm like outside of us.

68
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,620
I mean there's some real people
who really don't fucking like you.

69
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,360
Whatever you are, whether you're black,
you're white, you're straight, you're gay,

70
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:55,841
whatever it is.

71
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,040
There's some people who really don't
with the entertainment and it's easy.

72
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,110
We're easy.
Targets were easy.

73
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,230
It's easy for you to jump on Robert Downey
jr or Jamie fives or Joe because it's

74
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:11,380
easy. You know, when it's
real things, which you know,

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,310
whether it's politics or whether it's
whatever. A lot of times we, we SORTA,

76
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,600
we're not ready for that fight, but
it's easy to sort of pick the comedian.

77
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,990
I called Robert. I said, listen, I need
you to play a Mexican. He says, dude,

78
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,210
here's the deal. Sure, sure. Why not?
Fuck it. Sure. Of course, no Mexican,

79
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,640
whatever.
But then he texts back and said,

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,340
I'm nervous to play the
Mexican. And I said, well shit,

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,130
you played the black dude and you killed
that shit. We're just all, you know,

82
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,130
we gotta be able to do character.

83
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:46,510
What kind of blow back did you get
from playing the black dude? None.

84
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,660
Because we first go for the
wire too though. It was like,

85
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,010
what year was tropic thunder? I feel like
I was like 10 years ago. It was wow. But,

86
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:58,260
but, but here's the thing,
we fuck with Robert Downey
jr like that's my guy, right?

87
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,650
Like I did his birthday party and my
first joke was how dare you take all of

88
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,210
these roles from black people, you know?
Anyway, everybody's laughing. Have we got,

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,990
so it's Sorta like the entertainers,
man. We sh we, you got to give us room.

90
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,620
You know what I'm saying? Like to
play any, I'll show you when I,

91
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,370
when I to take that room, you got to
take it. You can't worry about it.

92
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:19,540
I saw the Chappelle
somewhere. It was like, no.

93
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,720
They would ask him about his jokes and
he was like, Yo man, look, you know,

94
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,100
people have said we're a shit.

95
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:26,560
And I think he said something about Donald
Trump's saying grab them by the Pussy

96
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,680
or some shit, whatever. But it was
true. It was like the one thing

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,670
that you look at what happened
with politics this year,

98
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,850
people sort of stripped away a lot
of things. You know what I'm saying?

99
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:41,000
Regardless of what you
believed in, uh, who,

100
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,900
whatever person you voted for,

101
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,960
it was a lot of things that
we'll sorta addressed about,

102
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:49,960
like maybe we're playing
things a little too close.

103
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,190
Like some of those politicians were
afraid to say what Donald Trump was saying

104
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,660
and they ended up being left in the dust
because people were a little like, whoa.

105
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,370
Well,
he's,

106
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,280
he's got a point in the sense of we're
playing things a little too close.

107
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,600
Okay.
