1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,550
The joe rogan experience. Well, if
you're going to do Sam Tripoli's podcast,

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,630
tin foil hat,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,320
just understand that it's a different
kind of conspiracy theory podcasts.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,790
It's like his big foot psychic,
like those kinds of questions

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,780
and expect to get a
contact high from the room.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,510
I just wanted to ask you about that George
Saint Pierre stuff with you or foes?

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,910
I think it's head trauma.
Yeah. Yeah. Or did he,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,780
did he have sex with those hot green
check? Maybe did, but if I had a gas,

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,380
the way he was describing things is
very similar to the way people describe

10
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,500
things when they've experienced
success of head trauma. Really? Yeah,

11
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:40,740
because he missed his time.
He's memory's not, not good.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,490
Like he'll get home and then he'll have
groceries that he bought and left in his

13
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:45,810
trunk and not even realize it.

14
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,120
And it'll go out to his trunk
and the rotten and he's like,

15
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,290
I don't even remember going to
this door. Wow. The alien he's got,

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,570
I think he's got this idea that this,
these glitches in his mind,

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,100
it's not a fucking coincidence that
the guy got punched in the head.

18
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:04,740
I think they did a stat
before the Bisping fight.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,920
I think it was more than 800 times.
Wow.

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,150
You got hit in the head and his UFC
career, forget about all the gym training.

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,970
Forget about all the other stuff.
Right.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,500
And forget about the fights outside of
the UFC that he had before he got into

23
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,710
the UFC when he was in Tko remember?
Yeah.

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,310
So he's experienced a lot of head trauma.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,800
One of the symptoms of head trauma
is memory loss issues and mean. Um,

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,990
and Hendricks hit him hard
a lot. Yes, he did. Yeah.

27
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,490
And he's only one guy that hit him hard.
I mean,

28
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:36,540
a lot of guys hit him hard that Sarah
scrambled is fucking brain and a lot of

29
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,840
guys hit him hard. And that's
just outside of sparring. I mean,

30
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:43,290
that's us outside of everything else that
he's done sparring with Rory Mcdonald

31
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,210
and Wonderboy and all the other
guys that he had to spar with. Yeah.

32
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,530
I think that's most likely what it is.

33
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,280
People who have been,
who've experienced a lot of head trauma.

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,090
That's one of the real
problems with it is. Um, um,

35
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,930
what does, what does the dude from
the Chicago bears, the famous guy,

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,310
the fucking quarterback from the bears?
Yes.

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,590
Mcmahon was on the cover of sports
illustrated talking about it,

38
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,820
but he'll be in the middle of his, um,
his living room holding these keys.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,340
He had no idea how it's keys got in his
hand, doesn't know where he's going. Wow.

40
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,870
Where am I going? Like, why am I standing
there holding my keys? You just forget.

41
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,710
Stop. Scary. Yeah, there's
really scared actions. Well,

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,660
that's why it's been so impressive
that you, with your long fight career,

43
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:28,080
you kickbox do box.
Do you know you had a lot of MMA fights?

44
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,080
I think I learned early on with the
kickboxing and boxing and I looked at the

45
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:34,590
older guys and listen to them talk
and went, I don't want to be that guy.

46
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,270
So I started paying
attention to the defense.

47
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:40,410
I started watching films on great
boxers with great defense, footwork,

48
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,840
head movement, you know, all that
sort of stuff. And just, and I,

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,400
and it was the key. I never got
hit with anything I didn't see.

50
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,660
I think you have sturdy jeans too.
You've got them. Croatian gene helps.

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,460
I'm sure it helps. So I'm, I, I'm the
smallest correlation on the planet.

52
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,210
When you run into the Croatians are all
huge, like Steve Cro, cop type characters,

53
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,010
steep

54
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,160
Emile [inaudible] choose a bear of a
human being. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Super.

55
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,450
But that's just, have you ever seen the
Olympic water polo team from Croatia? No.

56
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,960
Can scariest dudes on the planet.
Third of all, massive six,

57
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,610
eight guys that just will drown you.

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,780
Okay.
