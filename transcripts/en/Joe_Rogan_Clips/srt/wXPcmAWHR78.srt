1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,880
You know what to keep, what
concerns me is, uh, this,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,430
the rise of people that think
that everyone owes them something.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,280
Sure. You know, that's,
that's, that's the weird one.

4
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,100
Like we were talking about AOC who,
you know,

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,630
she seems like a nice girls cause looking
woman. She's young, she's got energy,

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,720
she wants to do good things.
She wants to do some good ones.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,580
But I saw the one thing that said
give money to people who are unable or

8
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,390
unwilling to work. Yeah. That's the
saw that, and I'm like going to work.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,030
Well it's not in, they pulled that
out. They pulled that part out.

10
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:36,290
The unwilling park in her unable to work
makes total sense. You know, we would,

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,890
as a community,
we should take care of the people.

12
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:41,070
Most of the people that are now in
comedy or unable to work, most of us,

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,380
most of us, yes. This is
the only thing we can do.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,940
But her thing was a weird one because
that, that thing, unwilling to work.

15
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:50,510
It's like, hey, hey, hey. He just,

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,730
he just crossed over into
crazy town like this is,

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,280
but that means that crazy town was always
in the back. You always had that. Yeah.

18
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,880
When you put that on paper.
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,880
That means this is something
that's been discussed,

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,530
like part of the appeal and she just,

21
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,710
I don't know how influential she wasn't
getting Amazon to drop out in New York,

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,360
but I live in Queens, so
everyone is paranoid. Amazon
was coming. That was a Bagel.

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,260
I, no carbs, no good. But I was in a
Bagel shop. I gave up dairy two weeks ago,

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,960
turning it around, trying to get
around. I was in a Bagel shop.

25
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,330
It was paranoid about Amazon.
Amazon's gonna come,

26
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,620
we're all going to get priced
out of our little shoe box.

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,550
Is it we live in or the,
some of the people that own
those shoe boxes were like,

28
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,690
I'm a millionaire now because
Amazon's coming and the,

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,680
but here's the thing,

30
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,420
it's hard to have a rational discussion
about inequality right now because in a

31
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,060
place like New York City,
it's so expensive to live.

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,440
And the reason for that is that it's a
destination for like foreign capital.

33
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,810
So essentially a lot of the
buildings in New York City,

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,750
foreign people buy apartments,
they don't live in them.

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,770
They use it to like launder money and
they buy them not even under their real

36
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,011
name.

37
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:57,330
They buy them under the name of a Shell
Corp like an LLC and then they have like

38
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,770
these investments and it really
makes everything insanely expensive.

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,820
That's what's making everything.

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,490
That's what's making a lot of real
estate in New York City. Expensive.

41
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,080
What do you what like
what if you got to get us,

42
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,960
what percentage of like expensive
apartments are owned by, I'll tell you,

43
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:14,961
between 2008 and 2014 I
think 50% of apartments going
into contract were cause I

44
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:15,871
do a shell,
but I,

45
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:19,260
I used to be a double decker tour guide
in New York City and so I do a show,

46
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,050
like a funny comedy show where I take,
I sell tickets,

47
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,700
I put people on a tour bus and then
we'd go around to these buildings,

48
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,990
just scream at these buildings.
It's fun. It should be illegal,

49
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,650
but it's fun and,
and no one cares because they're not home.

50
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,110
Because there somewhere,
I mean if Hillary,

51
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,860
if you look at who owns these buildings
is a guy who like is maybe a guy who

52
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:40,440
owns a mining company and he
poisoned to river in Zambia.

53
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,140
The a lot of these guys who are doing
things they shouldn't be doing and they

54
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,980
want to stash their money in real estate.
London is insane.

55
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:51,540
It's more expensive than New York
because London is all essentially shell

56
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,520
corporations. You know these phantom
buyers buying up real estate in London,

57
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,980
in New York, so you have people in New
York that know the system is fucked.

58
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,590
They know the markets being
artificially manipulated.

59
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,740
Bloomberg thought it was great. Bloomberg
is, we want all the billionaires.

60
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,840
He said it. That was his
quote. We want all of the bay.

61
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,410
It's like some of those billionaires
have done things that would make you,

62
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,850
would keep you up at night.
They've numbers like bring them in.

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,670
They eat shrimp and steak.
They've got a Peter Luger's.

64
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,170
We love him as a businessman,
right? That's the thing.

65
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,560
So people get fed up with this and
dude, and when I was, had my tour bus,

66
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,680
people would get on from regular places
like Pennsylvania and I would just point

67
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:33,150
and go 10 million, 20 million, 30 million.

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,140
These people just shift
uncomfortably in their seats.

69
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,050
Like what the Hell's going on
here? This is the, you know,

70
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,850
I saw Trump getting elected during those
tours because I'm like $100 million and

71
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,660
they're like sitting there like, what?
I can't afford a knee operation. Well,

72
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:50,110
the idea that Trump's not a part
of that as he listen in his bit,

73
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,490
his building was a huge destination.
Russians love his building. They love it.

74
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:57,820
They love a brand name. They love
the plaza, they love his building.

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,090
And a lot of interesting
characters lived in Trump tower.

76
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,740
Didn't they take the Trump tower name
off of it in New York? Yeah. Wasn't, no,

77
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,890
it was one of the buildings where the,

78
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:10,570
the people that own the co op
decided to take the name off of it.

79
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,580
Maybe there's a lot of shitty like Trump
nursing homes to live in in New York.

80
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,790
Oh yes. Nursing homes. You know those
elderly people getting beaten. It's hard,

81
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,550
Joe, you know, they're getting
fleeced. The beaten. You go by,

82
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:28,330
you see like Trump pavilion.
It's like a Soviet era architecture.

83
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,320
Horrible like old age home that's been
there since the 70s and I'm like, man,

84
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,090
I feel for the people in there,

85
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,510
the screams of must other than New York
condo votes to remove Trump from name.

86
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,140
Yeah,
New York City condominium on Thursday,

87
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,450
we removed president Trump's
name from the buildings facade.

88
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,770
The second time at four months,

89
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,780
his name has been removed
from a condo in the city.

90
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:55,110
55% of Trump plays condo owners at
120 Riverside Boulevard in Manhattan.

91
00:04:55,961 --> 00:05:00,370
Voted in favor of removing the large
sign above the front door. The buildings.

92
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,590
I mean that crazy. Who Cares? These are
self important people, but when care is,

93
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:09,570
they're worried about their secure.
Oh, that's a good point. Yeah.

94
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,460
I think if you try to sell it and it's
Trump place and you know you're going to

95
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:17,620
eliminate 50% of your buyers dictators
that are buying those apartments,

96
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,810
I think it's great. They die. Maybe they
don't. Maybe they're like, you know,

97
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,240
this is probably, we'll probably go down
the street to this no name building,

98
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,320
we'll be better off. But a lot of
his condos were sold to, you know,

99
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,980
Mafia and you know, the Russian business
guys, and he's always hide that,

100
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,840
you know,
he did deals.

101
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,380
It was his firm located in Trump tower
called Bay rock financial, which was a,

102
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,260
it was headed by this guy, Felix Sader.
Felix Sater was a guy that the FBI, uh,

103
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,770
convicted in like a Russian
pump and dump stock scam.

104
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,860
And he worked in Trump tower with Trump.

105
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,730
Like he worked very closely with
Trump and Felix had like informed,

106
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,120
I think on the Russian mob for the
feds and the feds kind of let him earn.

107
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,690
And so Trump has had this of
shady connections forever. Wow.

108
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,620
And I don't know if that
means that he's ness.

109
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,980
I don't think he's an asset or
of Putin or anything like that.

110
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,060
I don't believe that. I think that's
kind of just, you know, I think it's,

111
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,600
a lot of people would like to
believe that, but he's a shady guy.

112
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,370
So if you have all these people pouring
over his business deals for the last 50

113
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,840
years,
it can't be good.
