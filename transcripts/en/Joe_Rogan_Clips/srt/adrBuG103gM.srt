1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,023
Now,

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,860
what did you wear in terms of like a base
layer and we was there concerned about

3
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:08,320
you sweating while you're
pulling all that weight,

4
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,750
especially initially
when it was 375 pounds.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,960
Yeah. So you know, one of the
famous lines that, you know,

6
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:17,860
people who have been in the
polar environments will say
is if you sweat, you die.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,970
Um,
and you know,

8
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,940
it's maybe a little bit of hyperbole
but it's not far from the truth,

9
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:25,780
which is you start sweating and
you stop for even 30 seconds.

10
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,880
You're clothes are literally
freezing to your body.

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,160
And so it was this crazy kind of kind of
balance of being able to pull this sled,

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,820
get your heart rate elevated enough to
keep your body warm but not too warm that

13
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:39,670
you were sweating.
And so any second I would start sweating,

14
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:43,150
I would strip layers off. So there was
times, especially when there was no wind,

15
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,630
it's still be ambient temperature minus
20 minus 25 but I would just have like a

16
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:51,400
thin gore tex jacket on and
one base layer. That's it.
I mean, we were in Marino.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,940
I Marino actually itches my skin,
although it's really good, but for me,

18
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:58,060
I'm a little bit allergic to it.
Um, so I work synthetic fabric.

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,090
Did they have a synthetic that completely
mimics Marino in terms of the way it,

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,960
when it's moist,
you still stay warm?

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,950
Yeah. So mark, Marina, I honestly, Marino
is amazing fabric for that reason. Um,

22
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:09,580
unfortunately for me, like
I said, it just gets weird.

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,200
Tastes my skin.
So funny that you could suffer,

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,880
can't have clothes on,
maybe feel that.

25
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,400
Uh, no, but, uh, so I used a
synthetic, but it's causing me,

26
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,950
are you using like w w what I was using,

27
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:25,980
mountain hardware base layers
and then actually my outer layer,

28
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:29,160
so is this Norwegian company called
Bergen's of Norway. They don't sponsor me,

29
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,870
but they actually,
believe it or not,

30
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:33,570
the Norwegians know a thing or two
about being in the polar environment.

31
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:37,020
And so they've designed a really good
jacket and pant that sexually really

32
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:41,310
breathable and really good. And then I
suit sewed a for rough, uh, onto the edge.

33
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:46,170
So a wolf, a wolf, uh, s, uh, for
rough on the outer side of the hood.

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,820
I think it's Wolffia. Wolfer will for
thought you were saying Whoa, whoa.

35
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,490
And I was like, it sounds like wolf,
you know more about this than me.

36
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,020
I'm not the output. All of
know your audience. I have not,

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,580
I have not a big hunter
myself. I've never, never had
had done that, a lot of that.

38
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,220
But uh, yeah, that's a wolfer

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,900
well, they, they know how to
survive in the cold. Yeah, exactly.

40
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,160
So the base layer is a synthetic. What
is the material that it's made out of?

41
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,580
The base layer is, yeah, to think it's a
synthetic. I'm like a poly polypropylene

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,020
so that when it sweats, it
dries quickly. Is it your idea?

43
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,440
Yeah. So it sweats. It dries quickly,
but the idea was just to not get it wet,

44
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,350
so basically stripped down
as much as possible. Um,

45
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,620
but like literally I'd go from that and
then of course I needed to eat and drink

46
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,730
every, whatever, 30 minutes
or whatever, actually more
like every hour. So I'd stop.

47
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,660
So I'd stop in the front of my sled.
I had a huge puffy down jacket,

48
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,810
like a massive like Michelin man,
huge puffy down jacket.

49
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:40,860
So even if you're stopping for a minute
to drink water before even trying to do

50
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:45,120
that, boom, put the big jacket on because
that's how cold or how cold you can get

51
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,740
immediately from stopping.
I mean,

52
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:48,660
it's just so much colder
than when pulling the sled.

53
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,310
Your heart rate stays up
and keeps you pretty warm.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
I would imagine like your,

55
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,560
your hands and your feet to that would
be a real issue, right? The small digits.

56
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,830
Yeah. I mean, you know, frostbites
real for sure. Um, hands of the gloves.

57
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,560
That's why some of this stuff I was doing
in the training of get my hands with a

58
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,740
dexterity. You know, you'd have to tie all
these knots with big gloves, mittens on.

59
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,980
You can't take your gloves off for
any sizable period of time. Uh,

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:10,210
if you look back on a lot of my photos,

61
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:13,330
I've actually got tape on my face
over across my nose and my cheeks.

62
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,530
And that's because I started getting
tiny little bits of frostbite on the

63
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,730
bottoms of my nose and on,

64
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:23,530
on my cheeks because I'd wear a full
face mask buff everything but even tiny

65
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,040
little, you know, one, you know,

66
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,110
needle prick of wind on
your face throughout the day
and that cold it's going to

67
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,500
turn into a cold injury. And so I started
getting a few cold injuries on my face.

68
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,750
Nothing, you know, too bad
you're looking at Greece,

69
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,200
your face up or anything like
mostly the, the tape. Um,

70
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,380
and then so I had a little bit of like
Vaseline or like chapstick type of stuff

71
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,290
on some of the batteries.

72
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,240
The one thing actually that I
did that I'd never done before,

73
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,740
we'd actually worked when
I was a tip that I got,

74
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:51,250
which was my fingers started cracking
really, really bad from the cold.

75
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,040
And so they were like really
painful and I actually was pouring,

76
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,300
putting super glue into all of those.
Basically little micro cuts on my fingers,

77
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,120
which when someone told me that
as a trick, I was like, really?

78
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,520
But turns out it's actually
a really good trick.

79
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:07,500
So that's kind of super gluing these
cuts on my fingers back together. Um,

80
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:09,890
and that actually worked reasonably
well. I'll things kids. I mean,

81
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:14,500
I was all things considered is
the operative word, but yeah. Wow.

82
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,760
So you're wearing the, what
about your eyes? So I'm wearing,

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,080
I'm wearing a goggles. Um, but
you know, funny enough, you know,

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,760
I had a couple of, uh, you know, fancier,
nicer ski goggles with me. Um, but yeah,

85
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:32,380
there's the tape on my face right
there. Uh, but, uh, but yeah, it's like,

86
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,270
that's actually just
like the normal KT tape,

87
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,550
like a physio tape that you'd
see like athletes wearing.

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,130
And I just had it in my repair kit.
It wasn't meant for this purpose,

89
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:39,521
but I was like,

90
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:43,960
what do I have that I could put on my
face to block it a little bit better? Um,

91
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,200
but I had those goggles on
some of the time, but actual,

92
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,570
the goggle that I wore the most was one
that you would might use for motocross.

93
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,050
Um,

94
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,940
because it has like a plastic face mask
over the front of it cause the wind when

95
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,880
it was blowing,
it would just kind of blow around.

96
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,590
So sometimes I had this flea stripped
over my face, but it blow too much. Um,

97
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,730
and so I had this more plastic face
mass gas. So that's, that's the,

98
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,570
that's when you could see lookout
frozen. It's frozen. It is on the inside.

99
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh my God, man. There. And then
like this neoprene mask underneath.

100
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:17,770
So I had like double faced back double
tape, like anything to just, you know,

101
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,320
keep me,
keep me warm.

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,160
Suspected that it was so high
above sea level there. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:27,700
So you've got whatever it is,
9,000, 300 feet at the South Pole.

104
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:32,380
So it's basically just like
elevated ground, but it
seems flat. Right. But yeah,

105
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,580
I started at sea level,

106
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,150
so I'm not only add like how much are
you going uphill all the way to the south

107
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,160
coast for the first 40 sub days,

108
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,200
I pulled that sled up hill completely,
so it was,

109
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,410
think freaks me out.
