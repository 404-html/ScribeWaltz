1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,840
Did you see the Outer Co Colby?
Covington? No. What did he do?

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,780
What he said about John Jones?
I don't even want to hear
it. No. Okay. We shouldn't,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,970
I mean you could, you could bring it
up if you want to, but it was talking,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,680
it was a, it was, uh, like a, a text
like this just about John Johnson,

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,460
how a piece of shit is
now.

6
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:23,520
I was even surprised when I saw
it myself, you know, I was like,

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,830
is this right or wrong?
I don't know.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,940
Jon Jones going to be in front
of you one day. Gotta be careful.

9
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,390
Watch your fucking words.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,910
You gonna get slapped in the face by a
guy can kill you with his hands. That's a,

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,000
that's a bad move. I, I get
what Colby is doing. I mean,

12
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,430
he's making a lot of noise and
trying to do business, you know,

13
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,091
and if you fight him,

14
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,610
you going to make a lot of money because
a lot of people gonna come to see him

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,050
get his ass kicked,
you know?

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,790
You know he ain't going to find out that
he's not probably on, on the, on the,

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,100
on the popper list is probably on the,
I want you to see,

18
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,430
I want to see you get knocked out list.
He's in a dangerous situation right now.

19
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,030
He's gonna Fight Dos Anjos. Yeah. How
failed though? San Joses Brazilian.

20
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:03,420
He talked crazy shit about Brazil
and they were gonna fight in Brazil.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,640
You can move the fight in Chicago.

22
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,620
Which Colby thank the baby Jesus exec.
I would say the same thing.

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,400
You don't want to be fighting Hofeld does
on Joe's. You don't really want to me,

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,310
you'd only want back close to president.
Right. And I feel credible coming from,

25
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,640
you don't even want to be close to
him. No, I would not go. If I was him,

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,800
he'd probably go anyway,
man. He doesn't give a fuck.

27
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,720
He'll go off the money's right.
I'm sure he would,

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,890
but dos Santos right now at
welterweight I think is a murderer.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,540
He's a fucking killer at welterweight
because for him that cut down to 55 was

30
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,840
just too big, too big. And
now he's a big guy. He's big,

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,330
but it's just too much of a
cot to draining on his body.

32
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,000
And then you see the way he beat Robbie
Lawler in his last fight. You're like,

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,190
Holy Shit.
Goes through Neil Magni,

34
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:47,410
Robbie Lawler and you'd look at how
good he looks at me. One seven. Yeah.

35
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,480
It's a good fight. It's a good
fight. Is a very good food. Yeah.

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,740
It's a really good fight.
Particularly stand up.

37
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:56,780
He has a big advantage I think over Colby.
Standup. What does he do? Called beam,

38
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,690
but it says wrestler. It's a rest.
He's a restaurant. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

39
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,280
it's standup is good. I mean, he
beat Damien Maia. I beat him up.

40
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,620
But I feel like my, uh, is uh, you know,
I mean my was coming off of that very,

41
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,540
very hard fight against Tyron Woodley.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,590
Five hard rounds got beat up
and then he's going to go five.

43
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,330
Or I think he went
three rounds with Colby,

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,430
but I just don't think
he's the same guy anymore.

45
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:21,390
I think he's 41 I think my very long time,

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,530
long days being in the game
for a very long time. Yeah.
And I think, uh, those long,

47
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:28,860
hard five round war, it's like you
did with takes a toll on you. Yeah.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,410
It takes a toll on not taking
anything away from Colby,

49
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,650
but I think also think Colby
style is probably tailored,

50
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:38,490
married for a guy like Maya. Yeah.
You know, wrestling very strong.

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,190
What you usually see, like your breasts
and Gans Brazilian Jujitsu guys.

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,180
Yeah.
