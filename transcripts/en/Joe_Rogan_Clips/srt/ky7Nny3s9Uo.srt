00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,950
Hello Freak bitches because I've hung
out with you a lot since it's been three

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:07,670
years. We've lost, I've been
hot though. It was weird.

3
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:08,760
We're trying to figure it out.
We're like,

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:13,650
why does it not feel like three wheels
three years now since were since I

5
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:17,100
couldn't come in for awhile
and I explained this to you
on the phone and when we

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:22,080
hung out a couple of times my mother was
passing from Alzheimer's and then when

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:24,610
she did pass it was like I was
emotionally incapable. If I would have,

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,860
cal couldn't even have said those words,

9
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:29,100
I would have been a blubbering idiot
on your show. Sure, sure. And you know,

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,080
you know, whatever. Some
people might've been like,

11
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:35,220
hey that would have been great radio.
I mean you were the one that said, hey,

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,710
get your shit together. You know what I
mean? Cause I wanted to come here and be,

13
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:39,360
hey,
be able to tell if I said it like that.

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,020
That would be like Joe k shit together.
So your mom's dead Bro.

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,860
It's us talking. You know
what I mean? That's how I
said it. I know what you mean.

16
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,440
But it would be more like,
you know, I went to, it was a,

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,450
the last four years probably started
probably last right before I stopped.

18
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,000
The last time I came on the show there
was like a big law suit over jump around

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,030
that I actually wound up winning, but like
if froze money that I depend on Brian,

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,340
like mailbox money,
we call that those checks.

21
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,160
It just kind of come in and
then you're jumping around.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,430
It's been really good to me to jump around
is one of my favorite hip hop's 25th

23
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:18,440
anniversary this year, the whole
first album. So, but point being out,

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,450
when I first started hanging out with you,
because I was such a fan of that song,

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,400
I was like,
I can't believe I know this dude.

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,140
I remember you were weirded out
when I lit a joint in the club and,

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,860
and you were like, what are you
doing? I was like, what do you mean?

28
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:30,060
What am I doing?
I'm lying to join.

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,550
Everlast goes, he goes, you want
to get high? I go, fuck and,

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,160
and I go where you want to
go? He goes, go. He goes, Yo,

31
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:46,070
we ain't going nowhere,
but it looks to me like sideways,

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,610
like go splurge Shit right in
the club. And I was like, oh,

33
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,930
this is hilarious.

34
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,110
Wasn't that that same night
that you performed on stage
and there was a bunch of

35
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,060
musicians and it never worked together
on stage. Dave Navarro dated Camp Freddy.

36
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,300
They had like a man or they just did a
bunch of covers and I remember being a

37
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,270
fucked up and they weren't
calling me a bunch of times.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,960
Nobody ever leaves his nails right there
like three or four times before I'm on.

39
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:17,430
What was it like to what is like,
yeah, that's true. This is a fucking,

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,110
that's us all. We're barbecue.
There we go. Like, God,

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,450
I can't see my eyes.

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,470
That's exactly the spot we were
smoking a joint in too, right?

43
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,950
It's exactly where it was bad.

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,500
I just never remember you looking at
me sideways and go and go, oh fuck up.

45
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,930
Go what? The hide in the bathroom
and smoke a joint. Fuck on here.

46
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,070
I took way too good for that bullshit.
Especially in Vegas.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,310
If any place in the world you're
going to be over outlandish tipper,

48
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,300
be there because you'll get away
with murder. Almost literally

49
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,390
the valets, we'll say like, all right Yo,
the cops are on their way. You put it,

50
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:59,040
get the fuck out. I'm sure they
want to keep them checks coming.

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,890
Cops are coming with you like it or not.
Imagine being a Carbon Vegas,

52
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,010
Jesus Christ. How regardless how
many people they have down there,

53
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,140
Robin casinos and shit.

54
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Crazy movie style heist heads with masks
on and machine guns and shit taking

55
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,150
over casinos. But um, oh,

56
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,510
I was talking about so that I
was like so much money got froze.

57
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,980
So I was having plus my ass crazy heart
like on the road trying to make up the

58
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,120
difference for awhile.

59
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,450
And then my mother started going way
downhill Kinda fast over two years,

60
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,090
you know, it was like dealing with that
is anybody going through that is is,

61
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,580
you know, gets, I mean there's a
lot of things that go on in my life.

62
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,160
They're getting my heart
sent out to those people.

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,870
Watching somebody you love just
disappear. It was tough, man.

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,510
That was effective. Right. It changes your
perspective. You realize that this is,

65
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,680
this is how it ends. I had a lot of guilt
involved because with a kid with CF,

66
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:54,500
I couldn't have my mom and home with a
nurse and any infections that she could,

67
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,280
she was getting lung infections all
the time. So I had her in a home,

68
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:00,370
a really beautiful home.
They took a magnificent care of my mother.

69
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,000
But there was a lot of guilt. I
was, I was fricking for a while,

70
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,870
like with a lot of darkness that I
was swimming through. And as that guy,

71
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,450
he's just wasn't good for me to
come through. And then, you know,

72
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:14,290
and then after cheap has, and Layla is
just been like a learning, you know,

73
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,750
I'm only just me and my wife now,
it's,

74
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,420
she's seven years old and I think,

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,790
I'm not saying we got anything licked or
co, but like the life we have to live,

76
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,150
we've been able to figure out
with her cystic fibrosis. Yes.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,550
With the cystic fibrosis. Oh
cause it's all, I mean it's heavy.

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,780
There's a lot of shit you got to worry
about infections and any common cold

79
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:42,520
because senator the hot, it's like so
much pressure on a person to to do that.

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,380
It's, it's, it's my wife and I like, you
know, I won't fucking make it funny. We,

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,810
we've been very close to
the brink a few times,

82
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,540
but we've finally gotten to a
stage where it was like, Nah,

83
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,250
none of that's gonna break us.
You know what I mean?

84
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:58,300
We're good and we're good and we're good
in this life and theirs and we accept

85
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,830
where we are and we're going to
make sure this, this young lady is,

86
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,380
is going to make it does beautiful as
deep and as far into this life as she can.

87
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,500
You know? And it's been some medical
innovations to right. Having,

88
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,090
they're working on some
stuff, man. There's a,

89
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,230
there's a couple of drugs that aren't
quite for her yet because this drug has,

90
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,820
in the, on the DNA level of the
chain, there's, there's mutations.

91
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,590
Layla has two different mutations.

92
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:25,591
One's called the Dell Delta f five
five Oh eight I believe it isn't.

93
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,620
You've got me high in a little drunk
care, but no, no, no. People know.

94
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,970
People who know know it's easy to
find out. She has the most calm.

95
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,090
That's the most common one,
like the Delta five Oh eight,

96
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,840
and then she has this other weird
kind of offshoot one. There's one.

97
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,050
Some people have a dub dealt
what they call a double delta.

98
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,440
There's a drug right now that's really
working well for the people with the

99
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,530
Double Delta.
They're starting to experiment it on,

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,230
on it for people with the single.

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,210
Now does she have to be on a special
diet like uh oh the only diet we did,

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,760
we just need her to, she needs to do,
they have a problem gaining weight.

103
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,860
Cystic fibrosis, they um, uh,
they don't process fats properly.

104
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,120
They have to take enzymes with
everything they eat. So gaining weights,

105
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,250
a real serious issue. Um,
Laila actually has a g tube,

106
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,940
a feeding tube that she gets sick,
shake the protein shakes a day,

107
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:15,470
pumped into her stomach. Oh
Wow. Um, she again, if you're,

108
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,640
my daughter very rarely is down
about this. She'll have her moments,

109
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:24,090
don't get me wrong, where it's like
frustration and anger overheard, but it's,

110
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,200
this is life. She's never known anything
else. So it's like at the same time,

111
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,220
like we post a lot about it. We've, we
made a decision. Layla has her own page.

112
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,890
People are free to try and follow it.
If my wife will approve you,

113
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:35,900
if you can get by the security clearance.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,940
Her thing is Layla l a I.
L a beauty oh nine.

115
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,670
She wanted her own page because we start,

116
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,840
I've never posted anything
without asking her. Right.

117
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,580
Even when she was like barely able
to understand, I tried to be like,

118
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:53,330
can I post this picture? A lot of people
will see it and she'll say, okay daddy.

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,810
And now she might, you
know, she's sharp. And uh,

120
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,030
about a year or so ago she was like,
I want my own Instagram page.

121
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,510
I want to share my life,
like cystic fibrosis with people.

122
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,970
And so she's doing that and we,

123
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,700
this is may actually a cystic
fibrosis awareness month.

124
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:11,030
So we've been posting and she happened
to be in the hospital the last 10 days.

125
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,970
She's home right now.
Recovering. Um, cello pneumonia.

126
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:18,620
Do an article on a cystic fibrosis
treatment. And what was that? Oh,

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
that was a while ago. I don't
know. But my wife and I are RF.

128
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,290
I did it involve CBDS.

129
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,670
I don't remember because I read a semi
things and we're investigating some stuff

130
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:32,180
on that level right now because there
are a lot of good things going along with

131
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,020
this because it's one of them.

132
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,470
It's one of the best anti inflammatories
there are when no side effects and all

133
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,720
kinds of stuff.
We're not using it on my daughter yet,

134
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:41,600
but we're investigating like
what kind of uses there are you,

135
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,170
I forget I'm going to have
to go back through my emails
or whatnot. And so she's,

136
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,590
I remember you did send me something,

137
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,620
I don't remember if it was cbds
or stem cells or some shit,

138
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,710
but I just saw level now there are
a lot of levels they're working on,

139
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,200
on the stem cell level there.

140
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,180
There's a lot of things going on where
it's like if they can create correct

141
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,450
things on a cellular level, at
some point it's going to be, yeah,

142
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,520
there's never going to be a cure.
It's a genetic disease.

143
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,250
So you can't say cure in that sense.
You know what I mean?

144
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,270
Like the way it works is my w two p,
the two people that are,

145
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,180
that fathered a child have to
each have the gene. All right.

146
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:14,360
So me and my wife are known as what,
what are known as carriers,

147
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,540
which we never knew cause we searched
our whole history after we found out.

148
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,470
Nobody in my family's ever, ever
had this. Nobody in her family ever,

149
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,170
ever had this.
But we're known as what's carriers.

150
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,960
So when we got together
and we had a child,

151
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,040
there's a one in four chance that
child's going to have cystic fibrosis.

152
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,570
There's a two and four chance they're
going to be a carrier. Oh Wow.

153
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,260
There's a one in four chance.
They have no nothing at all,

154
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,560
which is our other daughter Sadie. So
we kind of represent the whole spectrum.

155
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,970
Yeah. Like our family, you know,
Layla, her mom and me and Sadie. Um,

156
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,440
which is another reason I go, I'm not
having six kids cause I love being a dad,

157
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:55,250
but it's like two cystic fibrosis
children in the same household.

158
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,210
Even in a lot of people do it.

159
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,910
It's hard because they pass
infections and it's very, as you be,

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,350
I can't even imagine how
the people with multiple,

161
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,560
two or three kids with
cystic fibrosis pull it off.

162
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,540
I hats off because I know what it's like.
We're just one that's kind of the, um,

163
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,740
of not just t must be
changing you as a person.

164
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,670
Like think about like how
much more compassionate this
is made you and how much

165
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:25,110
more appreciative of how I've had to
also accept and learn how to deal with a

166
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:28,260
lot of anger. Yeah. A lot
of anger. Like, um, uh, I,

167
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,810
I consider myself a pretty
spiritual person. Like I said,

168
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,270
I've explored a lot of religions.
Um,

169
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,040
I find religions confining, you know,
I mean, I believe in a greater power,

170
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,430
greater high, whatever, something bigger
than us. I kind of believe in that,

171
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,760
you know,

172
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,760
whether you want to call it God or
just are connected collective energy,

173
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,100
you what I mean, whatever it might
be, somewhere in between their lives,

174
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,290
something greater than us.
Um,

175
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,230
I felt for another reason the
last three years is, is um,

176
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,920
what's the captain's name
in, uh, in Forrest Gump?

177
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,080
Captain Ed or no, Captain. Whoa. The
captain, Captain Dan, Lieutenant Dan.

178
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,910
I,
for the last couple of years,

179
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:13,020
I'm Lieutenant Dan on the top of that
fucking sailboat. Like, fuck you,

180
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,110
that this is what you're going to do to
this little kid. You know what I mean?

181
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,840
Watching my child suffer. You
know what I mean? There's greater,

182
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,200
there's huge injustices in the world.
And, and let me tell you another thing,

183
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,410
having to take my daughter to
children's hospitals all the time,

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,330
I see people that have it worse.
Do you know what I mean? Angela,

185
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,660
do you not know? I'm a huge fan. I don't
know him personally, but I'm a huge fan.

186
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,810
He's a great dude. But one of the things
he said to me that I'll never forget,

187
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,330
he was uh,
talking about the secret.

188
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,570
Do you remember when the
secret was this big movie,

189
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,410
the book traction and people are going
to manifest their own destiny and they

190
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,310
were going to make it happen.

191
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,050
And everything in your life you created
in your mind. And he was like, fuck you.

192
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,760
You're telling a young sick
kid that she made that herself.

193
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,650
She made that he, she made herself have
leukemia. She made herself have cancer.

194
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,850
You're telling me that fuck you. Fuck you.
And when he said that, I was like, wow,

195
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:08,790
I never thought about it that way.
But he's totally right.

196
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,210
That's exactly what it is. Like
you can't, that's ridiculous.

197
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:16,230
You're dealing with a bunch of people
that have become successful and told you

198
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:17,730
why.
Cause I saw it happening.

199
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,040
What about the people that saw
it happen and it didn't happen?

200
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,410
This is bullshit or a far greater
number by the law. It's a part of life.

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,290
It's not the whole key
to manufacturing a life.

202
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,390
It's an excellent like ha being
a positive person, being healthy,

203
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,320
having a good vision and focus.
All those things are contributing factors.

204
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:41,520
But kids that are sick or the monkey
wrench in any idea that we've created our

205
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:46,080
own reality, I don't, but you can't
make a baby responsible for cancer.

206
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,640
That's crazy. You also can't make
a god responsible for like, uh,

207
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:54,040
God has a plan, you know? No one,
sometimes there's a fucking plan.

208
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Sometimes there's a glitch in the goddamn
matrix and you just got to deal with

209
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:03,670
it. You know, you got to handle it. And,
and the more important thing for me,

210
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,610
that second most important
thing in my life,

211
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,890
other than keeping Layla
as healthy as possible,

212
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,010
as making sure she knows that,
you know,

213
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:15,790
she can still achieve
and all that she can.

214
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,060
She's at an age now where like,
she kinda, and I, you know,

215
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,570
I'm not trying to have her hate me
in 10 years if she ever hears this,

216
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,620
like we're giving up her business,

217
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:27,940
but she's in a stage right now where
she's very resentful of, she is,

218
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:31,900
she expresses it well. She'll say, she'll
say, I hate this. I hate that I have this.

219
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,510
I just want to be normal.
I just want to have a normal life.

220
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,490
And it fucking rips your heart out man.
But you can't. You have to say, hey, hey,

221
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,500
you are normal. This is your life.
Your life is normal. It's like Carla,

222
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:47,050
I'm a big Car Lyn guy, you know, mean.
I know you're studied student of it,

223
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,130
but it's like he had his routine where
it's like about being homemade or all

224
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:54,440
natural. He's like, everything's
fucking all natural, right.

225
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,860
No matter what you do with it,
it's all fucking Nashville.

226
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,560
And that's kind of how I tried to approach
it. Whether it's like you are normal,

227
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,160
this is your normal life. You're not
any better or worse or you know, I mean,

228
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,960
you have to, there's, there's
fights. People fight that
you don't even see Layla.

229
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,690
You know what I mean? That you don't
understand. Yours is obvious years.

230
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,450
Is he right here in front of you to fight?
Some people are going to fight demons.

231
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:17,860
They'll never meet. Yeah. This is
a phrase on that, uh, what is it?

232
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:21,550
Comparison is the enemy of happiness.
Thank you.

233
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,850
I'm fucking going to use that,
Joe. Thank you. That's uh,

234
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,590
I'm gonna look it up and I'm going to
find out. Find out whose quote that was.

235
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,150
Comparison is the enemy of happiness.
I really liked that. That's it.

236
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,730
That's a very useful,
the inspiration sentence.

237
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,860
You should get inspiration
from other people,

238
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,100
but comparison is not really healthy.
Who Was it?

239
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,820
A State or Roosevelt said comparison
is the thief of joy. Oh, there you go.

240
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:49,300
Perfect. That's so eloquis
probably me. I probably fucked up,

241
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,100
but that's even better. God Damn
Theodore Roosevelt. You bad motherfucker.

242
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,470
He was a bad ass mother fucker.
Right?

243
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:58,480
And without charging up the hill
and San Juan and all that shit, man,

244
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,380
comparisons about the first is
Theodore. The other one was, well,

245
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:07,240
this is the guy that made the, he, he
set aside, um, the national parks system.

246
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,540
He set aside like Theodore Roosevelt is
the reason why we have the grandkids,

247
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,710
which our current guy is trying to rank
fucking mantle, not the Grand Canyon.

248
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,910
I know camp. Yeah. I was
happy about that shit. No,
everybody's upset about it. It's,

249
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,980
um, well, shout out to Sam Duke.

250
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,100
He's in Alberta Right now. I know. I see
him giving you a hard time cam and you,

251
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:30,880
he's so nice. He's a nice guy. As a nice,
and people threaten him. He just put, Hey,

252
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:32,740
look at this guy straight
at me. What? I threaten you.

253
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:37,210
I wouldn't threaten you and I can
probably kill you. Well, the whole,

254
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,310
but I wouldn't eat you.
That's why I won't kill you.

255
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,110
It's a lot of people in other countries,
man.

256
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,140
A lot of people that get mad
about his hunting pictures,

257
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,420
they're from some other country.
They're all,

258
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:49,990
a lot of them are from South America.
Like a Yam. You're going to be, oh God.

259
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,760
When the electricity all goes out,
they're going to become a man.

260
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,190
They're going to be coming to you.
He'll be happy as fuck.

261
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,210
And I need a recommendation on the
beginner bow. I'll, I can hook you up. Oh,

262
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:03,110
there we go. Yeah. Got Joe's a bone man.
Now Dude, I'll get a Hoyt to send you one.

263
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,010
You really want to learn. Yes,
that'd be the Shit I do. All right,

264
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,770
well next time I'm hanging
out with John Dudley,

265
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,530
I'll have him come and coach you and
we'll make a little video. Let me know.

266
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,740
Maybe I can attend. Maybe I
can jump in. Well that will,

267
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,050
I want him to coach you and teach
you how to shoot. That's amazing.

268
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,990
That would be perfect. We'll do it. We'll
make that happen. We'll make that happen.

269
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,230
Yeah. So that's three
years. Kind of a lot.

270
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,160
Condensed Reader's digest version is,
I,

271
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:30,770
I emotionally was in prepared to
be here and hang out and have fun.

272
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,890
I would have been like the,

273
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,310
I would have been the like
episode that everybody's like, oh,

274
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:37,070
you gotta hear this heart
wrenching fucking, oh my God. Well,

275
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:40,160
it's heart wrenching now, man. But
I'm glad she's doing better now,

276
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:44,000
but it's heart wrenching. But, but um, I,
I can stay in here like a man and be like,

277
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:46,880
look, here's, I've been through it. Right.
You know, you didn't want to see me.

278
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:47,714
And it's like you didn't,

279
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,230
it's like you didn't want to
see me cowering in the Fox hole.

280
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,830
You know what I know now the
battle is over. It's like, yeah,

281
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,620
I cowered in the Fox
hole for a little while,

282
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,620
but then we got out and we won the battle,
or we, you know what I mean? That's,

283
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,450
that's where I want it
to be before I came.

284
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,110
Okay.
