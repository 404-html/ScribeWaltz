Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,120
Well this is one of the reason why I want
to bring this up is because everybody

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:09,600
always wants to talk about
the power of belief, you know,

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,530
and how important the power of belief
is. And it's super important, you know,

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:17,460
and said it's a big factor in Connor
success is this like insane belief he has

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,294
in himself.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,720
But even with the power of belief at
10 you still have to deal with the

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,310
limitations to the body.
Correct.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,520
And you still have to deal with like
what is the reality of getting hit on the

10
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,490
chin. Correct. But the,

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,630
that self belief that Connor has got
him into the biggest fight and come at

12
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:39,240
sports history on if he even had a
little bit of doubt, we're not here,

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,160
you're 100% we're talking about them.
I know. So it's a fine line. Say Ah,

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,800
self belief only goes so
far, man. Even myself,

15
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,190
I myself belief was so high
private match my skills,

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,830
but I was so confident it
can beat anyone in the world.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,910
I'd beat a lot of guys that probably
had no business beating or just getting

18
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,990
through the beat cro cop. He's a
legend. And you beat him by Naca. Yeah,

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,720
but like get getting
through golden gloves. Man.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,600
I thought I was the next Mike
Tyson. I brought, probably not,

21
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,580
but I beat most of those
guys. Just stuff. Sure. Whale.

22
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:12,520
But I believed in my heart of hearts I
was going to be the best of all time. No,

23
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,500
you were a competitor. And there's some
people that have a hard time with the,

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,920
the big moment.
Conor obviously shines in the big moment,

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,130
but at the end of the day,
even with that insane belief,

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,080
you get to see his physical limitations.
But what you got to see though is,

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,240
well,
you got to see a lot in that fight,

28
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,600
but you don't know what's going
to happen until they do it.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,550
That's why I didn't fight.
So he has this amazing, uh,

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,470
belief in himself and he had a
really interesting style man,

31
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,290
that whole thing where he was doing
like putting his hands out there and,

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,260
and pap pap pap and them.
Yeah.

33
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,980
And then throwing off offspeed
punches and then drop it.

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,690
And then how about is that
his ankles were so good,

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,380
so good and and so exaggerated and big.

36
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,100
He'd get fluids back and Floyd, just
scary, smart. He went, turned into him.

37
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,210
They give him more of an angle.
He would just cover up because you need,

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,920
the ref was going to stop it. The
real MVP of that fight. Granted,

39
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:09,180
you know Conor and Floyd, that ref, I
read them fine, you're the real MVP.

40
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,650
And it did. He came, you know,

41
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,280
his opening dialogue with the hell was
that he was just staring at Mcgregor.

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,140
Like now we don't want to know that
that gay Raslan and just like students,

43
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,060
I don't think he said that.
I think I thought he was way over the top.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
I wanted to fight to start,

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,030
so I thought he was over the top
because I wanted to fight. C'Mon,

46
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,750
let's go with this fucking national
anthem. You do that in a locked room.

47
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,280
But I just thought it was off to
the wrong foot. But I think he,

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,690
granted, I don't think Connor was gonna
win that fight as it went on. However,

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,620
he, the Connor did have an
advantage. If they went in tight,

50
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,400
he'd even let it get there yet.
Grappling under hooks. What?

51
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,340
And that was where Conor
was going to get his rest.

52
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,130
He didn't have that opportunity. As soon
as they got to that ref separated. Yeah,

53
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,650
it was good. He was gonna
let them fight it. Yeah,

54
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:58,020
he was gonna let him fight though.
Here's the perfect rest. However,

55
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,510
I think Connor thought you'd be able to
get his rest in those moments and just

56
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,120
never was capable of doing it.
Cause the ref, what's that thing?

57
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,820
He got more tired than he ever
thought it was going to tell.

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,300
So the efficiency of Floyd, here's what
I did. I watched it live from the uh,

59
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,290
third round on. I got offstage, Washington
DC, the first two. I ran upstate.

60
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,970
I did last yesterday. Oh God. I watched
it yesterday when I get home, but I've,

61
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,840
I flew home, um, I'm airflow
upstairs. It was the,

62
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:25,810
they had it on paper view
in the upstairs green room.

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,500
So we ran upstairs and type move. Yeah,
it was, but I caught on the third round.

64
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,050
I'm yelling, Ian Edwards. I'm like, I'm
like, how's it going? He goes, the fights.

65
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,380
Great. This is a great fight. So
I got in there like writing it.

66
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,660
I didn't want to give, this is
people waiting in line a long time.

67
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:41,170
The show started late. People bought
tickets months in advance, and I'm like,

68
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,640
I'm not cut my shelf short.

69
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm going to do the full show and then
want to thank everybody good night and

70
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,450
then wants to fight.
You're a better person.

71
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,460
Okay.
