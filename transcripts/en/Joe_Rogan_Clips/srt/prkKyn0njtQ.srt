1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,510
Problem that if you don't address is not
going to get any better and it probably

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:04,344
is going to get worse.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,930
People don't address the problems
in society until it affects them.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,840
What do you think they could do though?
Like how, besides just education,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,250
how do you stop as much crime?
How do you give people like counseling?

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,650
Like you can get the guns out of Chicago.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,170
You can get the guns out of anyway
if you want to. You think so?

8
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,600
How would they get them done? They
would get most of the guns out, right?

9
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,110
You can get, you can get most of
the guns out, you can do that,

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,470
but do you run the risk of taking guns
away from people that could defend

11
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:35,430
themselves in a really dangerous area
that's filled with guns by taking,

12
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,890
by taking the guns out.
Like what about people that are also set?

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,410
Like who are you going to
take the guns away from?

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,200
You got to take the guns away
from the lady who runs the bakery,

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,440
who carries a lot of cash at the end
of the day. Lady that runs the bakery,

16
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,230
keeps her gun lady that
runs the bakery that has a,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,260
that has a business that provides goods
and services for the neighborhood that

18
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,460
wants to protect you.
That once protection keeps her gun.

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,690
Did you see that recent video?

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,390
There's a crazy video of these two
gals behind the stove and one lady was

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,520
cooking yesterday and got punched her in.
The Guy Comes back in Wales,

22
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,820
her in the head and then the other girl
pulls a gun. She keeps our gun. Yeah,

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,350
that she keeps her gun because shit
like that might happen. But that got,

24
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:16,740
now imagine if he had a gun. That's a
good thing for people to see. This is why.

25
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,210
And I'm not saying
everybody should have guns.

26
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,630
It's a good thing for people
to see because we, oh, you
only hear the other side.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,720
You only hear guns being
dangerous and killing people.

28
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,440
You don't hear people like that lady
that just saved herself from getting the

29
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:32,310
fuck beat out of her with a gun. I
know, I saw, I saw that video. Uh,

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,400
and then I saw the other video was
a a guy and a jewelry store. Yeah.

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,550
It comes in three, two or three
guys. Hoodies on, mask on.

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,870
You see the guy who's coming through
the door pulling their man's down. Ooh.

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,930
It's like on the camera.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,740
And then you see a guy walk
away from the jewelry display.

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,840
He walks the camera's shooting this way.

36
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:56,160
So he walks out of range of the
camera and when the guys come in,

37
00:01:56,161 --> 00:02:00,000
he comes back blasting.
Boom. Whoa. I keeps his gun.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,370
Jesus. He just started shooting as soon
as they came in. Guns out. Oh Jesus. Yeah.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,850
So what happens? It was like,
it was customers in there
too. So he know he hit one.

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,710
He did the first guy.
Yeah.

41
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,370
And other two ran out and you see
the guy run out of camera range.

42
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,580
Imagine being in a fucking jewelry store
trying to buy a watch for your wife and

43
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,030
a gunfight breaks easement ring.
You just like, I'm so in love.

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,920
Me and my girl are going to get,

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,610
and the guy just comes in and
you think this could be it.

46
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,370
This is how I'm going to
go. My kids, you know what?

47
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,750
This is a sign we shouldn't get married.

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,020
Ah Ah sorry.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,510
I just have too much PTSD to get married.

50
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,020
That's what the task. That is hilarious.
Yeah, but she can we run a business.

51
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,690
You keep your, keep your gun. Yeah.
I'm just the guy on the corner.

52
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,730
20 guys on the corner. Cops stopped
him frisked. Okay. Taking these guns,

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,320
it's going to be hard to get them all man.

54
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,290
And the problem is defining who gets to
keep one and who doesn't get to keep one.

55
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:03,500
It's very sketchy. Let's
have that argument later. Get
the guns first. Well does,

56
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,000
but the problem with that is you're
never going to get them back.

57
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,820
Like if once you take them away,
whoever got the guns taken away,

58
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,640
they're never getting their guns,

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
but know that you got to take
the guns and then you have to,

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,410
there has to be more to just that.

61
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,010
You've got to take the guns and it has
to be an increased police presence.

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,240
You have to take the guns have to be
something to do with school. Lets out,

63
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,670
you have to take the guns and
they have to be a, you know,

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,700
counseling for drug offenders and you
take the guns and it has to be jobs in the

65
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,850
neighborhood. You know, it's a lot of
steps that have to cope, but you can,

66
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:38,560
it can be done. Um, you can
definitely get the illegal guns,

67
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,800
right? If you could somehow or another
get access to them, the illegal guns,

68
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,270
the legal ones are going to be real tough
because if someone has a gun legally

69
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,710
and they haven't committed a crime,

70
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,560
it's going to be real hard
to take that gun away. Yeah.

71
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,750
But I don't think if they did the numbers,

72
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:56,300
the guys with legal guns aren't the guys
that are committing these crimes. Right.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,190
The guy would leave your gun.

74
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,360
I'm pretty sure it isn't the guy that
drove past this party and she got up right

75
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,250
then you got to worry about the people
with legal guns getting robbed for their

76
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,910
guns. Right. If guns become a shortage,

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,260
the whole thing is very, it's a, it's
a real problem and it's very, um,

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,950
it's very complicated I think
to try to completely solve it.

79
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,140
And how do you get these people that
are in that life that are every day

80
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,670
involved in gang violence?
And I don't think I could be wrong.

81
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,280
I don't think everybody that's
in gang life wants to be there.

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
I think you're right. No,
I think definitely right.

83
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:32,920
I think they just like what the fuck
else is there to do in this neighborhood.

84
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:36,280
I right. You're right. I think if
they had an opportunity to, you know,

85
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,820
I think the guy, the kid that is
a very good basketball player,

86
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,780
that his uncle was, like I said,
his family lineage gang life.

87
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,830
If he had a chance to go
play basketball somewhere,

88
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,440
he would take that chance.
I think you're totally right.

89
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:53,050
And I think in the absence
of any other chances,

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,540
that's when it becomes
something that's an option.

91
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,370
And I think it's all about
the same feeling that people
get when they're joining

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,510
gangs or when they're, um, oh,

93
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,010
like a staunch right winger
or a staunch left winger.

94
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,420
I think it's all the same thing.

95
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:10,990
It's like people have a desire to
belong to something. Absolutely.

96
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,220
Make something that makes
your life have more mean.

97
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,160
I feel like it has more meaning.
Absolutely.
