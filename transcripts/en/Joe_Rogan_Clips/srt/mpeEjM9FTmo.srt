1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,530
The only difference between the sexes is
socially constructed obstacles. You are,

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,040
well,
gender's construct gender itself.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,170
It is. They should come here and take a
look at your place. That would shut them.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,930
Shut the argument. That's
all male, male, gender.

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,200
I've got some female stuff here from when
my kids come over tonight. Tempa tell,

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,260
tell them what you said to me when I
say what a fucking great place. Oh,

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,570
this is what happens when women
don't get to tell you what to do.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,320
A place you have a warehouse of mail,
but this looks,

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,120
that's not a nice guy. That's not bad.
And it's been a problem in this society.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,380
Male energy, male thinking, male,
and he is vilified and you're,

11
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,490
you're taught to think that it's
something wrong with being masculine.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,450
Being masculine is the reason why we don't
speak German. Okay, stop. Uh, exactly.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,050
Talk about toxic masculinity. You could,
you will be the poster boy for that Shit.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,590
Well,

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,590
the whole reason why you need male
people is because there's mail people,

16
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,990
other places that will take away your
shit and kill your people. And exactly.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,250
This is not a bad thing.
Male does not equal evil.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,390
Just because there are evil men, they are
evil men. Doesn't mean all men are evil.

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,660
There's evil women too. It doesn't mean
all women are evil. I dated three of them.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,370
I bet he did it more than three, let's be
honest. Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,120
But this toxic masculinity that
is his fuss Solera like you said,

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,970
really World War Two,
however there turned out well,

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,950
there's just so many dumb phrases like
that, you know, will they made up,

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,630
do you know about heteronormative?

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,460
I'm sure he knows his CIS gendered.
CISGENDER.

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,290
Hetero normative. Yeah. Like
you're, you're imposing the norms.

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,680
Like as if heterosexuality is normal.
Well,

28
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:47,610
did you see what was the story a couple
of days ago and I was in California here,

29
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:50,340
a beautiful state of California.
They're trying to the heat.

30
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:55,140
You can't say he or she gets they
now lat. Yeah. Where everywhere.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,060
I'm saying what I'm saying. She,
Hannah something Jackson. He uh, yeah.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,050
Now you have to say they nope. And they
were passing it. They had her in the,

33
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,410
the meeting, uh, the actual,
uh, town hall. A city.

34
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:11,310
Where are they passing the ordinance?
And at the end she goes, my, my grandma,

35
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,800
my grammar teacher wouldn't approve
of that. She's rolling around her,

36
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,240
but we won't hear from her.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,440
She said her and somebody called
her out on it as she was passing the

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,290
nonsense. You shouldn't buy your
grandmother. She's not here.

39
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,020
It was corrected to
dentification densification.

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,430
Of course she looked like no Gingrich.
This,

41
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:33,900
she is California state senator bans
the use of he and she during committee

42
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:37,740
hearings. Oh look at her with her
perfect fucking little real haircut.

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,990
Newt Gingrich's haircut pow. It's
facing. Some people are just hilarious.

44
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,630
But they called her out. She's trying to
do a good thing though, you know, and uh,

45
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:51,960
they call her. They had a laugh
about it. But uh, that is so funny.

46
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,060
Who the fuck does she look like? Oh my
God. We wouldn't be hearing from her.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,840
Well,
you made me.

48
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,530
That's what was in interrupted
by listeners who corrected
her usage and demand.

49
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,980
Oh, stop, stop, go back.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,250
Corrected her usage and demand that
she used the word they or them,

51
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,630
they demanded. See this is the problem
with all this shit. Yes, it's demanding.

52
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,750
They're trying to control people or
telling people what to do, what not to do,

53
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,800
and it's about power.

54
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,150
A lot of this stuff is about power on as
they're imposing their worldview on on

55
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,940
you, but it's not even their
worldview. It's not real.

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,150
What it is is they're just deciding that
this is a thing that they're going to

57
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,690
agree to and they're going to force other
people to comply. It's half the game.

58
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,210
Half the game is just getting
people to comply. Well,

59
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,310
you do that by and you
start with language.

60
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,530
You control people's
behavior through language,

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
which is the definition of
political correctness. Well,

62
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,500
that's what Carlin always said that
fascism is just political correctness with

63
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,160
good manners are political correctness
is fascism with good manners.

64
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,900
How bout you saw the clip a Louie had
governors when he was talking about this,

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,670
how the, you know the millennials,
whoever demanding what we call them.

66
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,140
Yes, they are them I, and he goes, okay,
I'm, Louis Goes, okay, I'm a location.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,580
It's your mother's car.
And he goes,

68
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,170
I got to come up with something more
clever and not as harsh, whatever. Yeah.

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm a location. Your mother's gun. Yeah.
