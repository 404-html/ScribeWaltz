1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,100
What was it like finding
Bernard who, you know,

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:10,101
and I don't know if this is the stage
stage I want to fighting Bernard was,

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,430
it was um, totally different than
what I expected. What'd you expect?

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,760
I expect him to be tricky and sneaky
and just a very crafty and obviously I'm

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,620
experienced.
Um,

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,190
I did jump up two weight classes
to take that fight and um,

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,020
but at the same time,

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,260
that was not an 80% Kelly public.
And this is true and this is documented.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,650
Um, I have it on my phone and I was
going to actually bring that out,

10
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,200
but that fight I sport,
you know,

11
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,790
three times for that maybe for the fourth
time was with an arm brace and then it

12
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:50,640
went into it and I'd never said
anything cause I'm the type person,

13
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,310
I don't want to have people
think that was making excuses.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,910
I love Bernard and I think he's,
uh, one of the greatest of all time,

15
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:01,730
greatest middleweights. But that was
not that night. You know, I came down,

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,620
we had what's wrong, what was
right, I had bronchitis, I was sick,

17
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,600
I was running a temp.
Actually in the locker room,

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,180
we had to go through what to commission.

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,060
We almost took the inhaler for it.

20
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,570
Then we found out through the commission
that you cannot take that cause it's

21
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:20,400
steroid. So we had to go to the
nasal, um, or not nasal to the pill,

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,790
oral pill. Uh, we had
it in the locker room.

23
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,640
I don't know if you ever heard of
a Guy Thomas houser. He writes,

24
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,550
you mean he used to write from New York
Times? He does a lot of big box in books.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,680
He was a nerd and houser don't,
he's not one side. What's anybody?

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,290
He's Bryce. What? He knows what he
sees and that's the truth. And um,

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,220
he was a nerd when it commission came in.

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,570
They were going through my prescription,
you know, they ever taking a temperature,

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,540
uh, giving me the exam
and that's what happened.

30
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,800
How it was a look Dardick fight
with what, uh, of all people,

31
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:57,780
what was wrong with your arm? You had
burst, burst, sac bursitis, societies,

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,860
bursitis in your elbow. And you know,
that came into an issue. And we sport,

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,410
you know, like I said, it was a handful.
It might've been more than three or four,

34
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,830
but it wasn't a lot because usually in
training camp you do three days a week

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,240
for about eight week camp for about six,
six and a half weeks.

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,970
And it was because of your elbow that
you couldn't spar. Yeah. You know,

37
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,050
cause he didn't want to keep hitting it.

38
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,150
And then I didn't like just the way I am.

39
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,070
I didn't like having a brace on it or not.
And um,

40
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,540
so that was an issue and there was a lot
of things that sometimes if you could

41
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,490
go back and you wish you
could do it over again,

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,350
but there was a lot of other things going
on. Why we didn't postpone to fight.

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,790
First of all is sold out. And uh, the
Youngstown people bottle or tickets,

44
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,040
um, we had the issue with the
Paul Williams fight, you know,

45
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,480
that that fell through. So I can't, I
just came off fighting Gary Lockett,

46
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,040
who was really not a well known name,
a household name.

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,320
So if I were to postpone that fight,
the backlash on that would have been bad,

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,830
really bad. And you know, so it
was more to ego thing I think.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,050
And worried about what
everybody was going to think.

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Taking nothing away at all from an s
where I wanted to tap into taking nothing

51
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:12,391
away from Bernard Hopkins unfortunately
against a guy like Bernard Hopkins.

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,020
I had to have that happen
to me is what socks and,

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,140
and he was a tremendous fighter.
I mean, he did things in there.

54
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,600
A lot of times I've seen him make a
moves that I knew what he was doing and I

55
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:26,920
just couldn't pull the trigger on it.
Um, and he was fast and he was strong.

56
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,630
And then there was times that he just did
some crafty things also that, you know,

57
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:35,230
got to me and, and his body work
in that fight slowed me down a lot.

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,610
But it was just one of them fights where
I could honestly say that that was not

59
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:43,630
an 80% Kelly Pollick. And that could
be honest to say if I was 100%,

60
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,020
I don't know if I would have won that
fight. And I'll be honest about it.

61
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:49,450
I'm not going to be the guy that's,
that comes there and says, well,

62
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:53,470
I thought it was 100% I'll or knock them
out. No, it was Bernard Hopkins, you know?

63
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,970
Um, when you think about your legacy and
you think about looking back at your,

64
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,970
your career,

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,890
those kinds of fights where you had to
take it when you were compromised, um,

66
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,790
how do those factor in to do those
fuck with your head? Mm, yeah.

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,980
That never a bad way, right?
But enough for you. Like if
I was 100%, yeah. You know,

68
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:15,430
I got an a buddy to the international
boxing hall of fame over the summer and it

69
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,210
was cool as hell and it'd be there
and you start seeing the inductees and

70
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:23,280
everything and I start, you start
breaking down your career. Like, am I,

71
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,930
am I able to qualify for
this? You know, and it's so,

72
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,240
so going to get pissed off who didn't
get in because I got in and I look at it

73
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,770
and I break it down a couple of ways.

74
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:37,210
I say 40 and two with 34
knockouts is a hell of a record.

75
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,660
You know, I held the belts
for over three years. Um,

76
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,540
I be a handful of guys that were
legit when I beat them. And then I,

77
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:50,860
then I look at the fight though I
fought Bernard Hopkins and I got my ass

78
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:53,200
whooped in that fight and there was
no other way of putting it, you know,

79
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:57,510
it's the truth. So how much
did that damage? You know, uh,

80
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,330
people remembering that nobody looks at
the fact of the two way class jump and

81
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:05,770
they call him back down and defending
against a very game. Antonio Rubio.

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,340
And then of course the Martinez fight,
which a lot of people,

83
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,780
and it was documented and, and on
Hbo with the commentators, you know,

84
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,410
the weight issue in that fight. But what
was the way it, it shouldn't know fine.

85
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,860
Well, how we had to get down. That was
my last fight at middle weight, you know,

86
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:25,210
trying to cut the weight. I was 29 at
the time and another great fighter.

87
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,820
It happened. It was tough
with the weight. Um,

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,390
I really can't use that as an excuse
though, cause I don't know. But you know,

89
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,430
I know I was doing good in the
ninth round. I did hit a wall.

90
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,760
A lot of people try to use the cut
and I think even without the cut,

91
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,490
the same result would have
happened though, you know,

92
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,710
he would have boxed my ears
off the last four rounds.

93
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,090
It was just one of them things that there
was nothing you could do. So when I,

94
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,630
when I have some up my career,
I look at those fights and I,

95
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,570
and I know personally that
it could have been different,

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,500
but at the same time I'm very happy and
content with the way my career went.

97
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,180
You know, I was 40 and two,
um, my last four or five at
one of my last four fights,

98
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,930
you know, before I retire. So
I went out winning, um, and,

99
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,080
and I was done with the
sport. I truly was. And so I,

100
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:14,120
I think right now I'm, I'm kind of content
and happy with my career. Of course.

101
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,330
I think anybody says could have been
better and I wish it was better.

102
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,720
It may be a little bit, but I'm not going
to have ever beat myself up over it.
