1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,193
Hold on, hold on. Hold.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,140
Parties basically pushed him hard.
Listen to him.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,680
There's not a part of you that respected
the Conor McGregor dare compare

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,150
yourself. Total agreements makes
martial arts, you know of all time,

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,570
part of the entire nation.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,000
You know Conor Mcgregor, you know how
many [inaudible] you and can I ask

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,000
whoever the fuck is in Ireland?
What?

8
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,940
Connor would love bird
fucking if you said Connor,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,910
you got one hour to party with
one guy hanging out with one guy.

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,050
He's picking on me Bro.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,010
I talked shit might ask me advice.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,610
I would like to talk to him about
his future. I have some thoughts.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,990
I want him on your podcast so bad
man. I love that. I don't know.

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:53,970
We were supposed to do it a long time ago.

15
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,790
I had his trained around really recently.
You know,

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,030
I hope he doesn't think
that in any way that I,

17
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:04,710
I don't respect him or appreciate
him because fighters are like super,

18
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:07,350
super sensitive.
Like I've gone through that a few times.

19
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:10,630
Like I called Tony Ferguson who's
like one of my all time favorite.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,690
Literally one of my all
time favorite fighters.

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,250
I said he was a brilliant Weirdo
because he wears like ankle weights.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,870
He got mad at me,

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,280
he got upset and I had to talk to
him and I like try to sort it out.

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,880
I did it through someone
else and I was like, no, no,

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,140
no, no, no, no. He seems like
that. It seems like that,

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,770
but what it is is so exposed.

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,920
It's what you're doing is so personal.

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,730
It's so insane that you
like what we can brush off.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,290
It's way harder for them.
Will you?

30
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,330
If you lose a fight and
someone disrespects you or
they in public sentiment

31
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,080
keeps you from getting a title shot,

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,540
I guess that's a significant
part of their life.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,660
They're not used to dealing
with public reaction.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,890
They used to dealing with his competition.
Right,

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,840
so the public reaction thing of celebrity,
it's an afterthought.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,180
It's something an after
effect of competition, right?

37
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,060
You become successful and then you have
to deal with all these people around you

38
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:12,870
that want you to dance. Well, Conor
Mcgregor's in natural shit talker.

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
He's a great fighter,
but he's also a natural shit talker.

40
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,820
You want a buffalo bar? Yeah, Dude.
That's what I love about Conor Mcgregor.

41
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,890
Conor Mcgregor,
Bernie Sanders on,

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,490
it's a weird situation that you haven't
had either one of those people along.

43
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:31,070
I tried to get Bernie recently. He said
no, some fake Bernie contacted us. Oh,

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,410
you say you got your head right? Yeah,
that was had they got me and I said,

45
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:37,260
I'm a big fan of, I like a lot of
your ideas. I'd love to have you on.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,040
And then it was here though. I don't
think he wants to run for president, man.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,250
Why would he still come on? I
don't know. I don't know man.

48
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,090
You know what I fucking love by the way
about Conor McGregor is that he meets,

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,030
he made me really appreciate the athlete.

50
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,930
Who knows they're also an entertainer.
Yeah. I actually, you know,

51
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,950
there's, there's people that did that
like, I mean everyone would probably give,

52
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,020
I'll leave credit to me why it works.
I don't know why it works.

53
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,220
I mean that's who he is. He is, that
guy will be talking shit and sparring.

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,580
Just guys that are just funny.
Locked on him is fantastic.

55
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,710
And he's smoking weed and Mike Tyson,
by the way,

56
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,970
Mike Tyson owns a god damn weed farm.
What does it call him down? Yeah.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,130
What is it called? Jamie?
Make that smaller please.

58
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,130
So we could read what the
Hashtag is. Um, used to have,

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,000
God damn, they used to say something
about Tyson something or another.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,960
Did they edit it?
