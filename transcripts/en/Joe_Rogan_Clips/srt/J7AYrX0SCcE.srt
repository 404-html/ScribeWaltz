1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,310
How many people told me, hey, I, we'd
been hanging out with George for a week.

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:05,970
I got fat again. 10,000 my, yeah, that's
George, man, that's George. Don't,

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,980
don't eat like he eats.
You won't, it won't work.

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:10,620
And he has his whole theories and
philosophies all about why he's lean.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,940
It's like, dude, no, you're just,
you're just born this way. You,

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,870
he just doesn't get it. I've tried it.
I've trained thousands of people. Okay.

7
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:20,550
He's trained himself like he thinks the
way he did what he did is we're going to

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,130
work for everyone. I love
Georgia, Super Intelligent Guy,

9
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:24,700
but I tell him towards the way,
like,

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,510
he's very gifted when it comes to
food and he does a lot of things.

11
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,970
And like now he's doing it a lot of
fasting and he's getting even leaner,

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,230
but it'll be a long time for Georgia's
fat. You see, there's, there's,

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,170
there's various body types. You know,
you do have ectomorph, Mesomorph,

14
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,950
endomorph and we're, we're, uh, we're
on the continuum of these three.

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,060
Georges on the Ectomorph side and in a,

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,850
in a strong sign of ectomorph is a
small waist. And George has a Mesomorph.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,560
No, Mesomorph is cause he's very muscular.
He is, I would say you'd be more active,

18
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,150
more Schwab. Muzzles sorry, go ahead.

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,630
George was very skinny and
scrawny when he was young,

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,890
so he went crazy on the weights. He
turned his weakness into a strength. He,

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,940
that's so much weight, weight training
and exercise because he wanted to bulk up.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,350
So he's a bulk ectomorph now.
He's not a perfect that Kumar,

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,940
he's not a 100% up to more,

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,030
I would say it's between
Ectomorph Mesomorph but
endomorph the other end of the

25
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:18,570
spectrum. You eat a little bit
of carbohydrates to get fat.

26
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:21,460
You lift a little bit of muscles,
your muscles explode in size.

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,060
George wasn't like that. George is on a
bit on the other side of the spectrum.

28
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:28,880
So a real mesomorph would
be like Melvin Manhoef. Uh,

29
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,870
yeah, like that, you know, I think I'm
kind of, no, no, no, no. That's more, uh,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,170
uh, endomorph. Endomorph it's fat. Yeah,

31
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:40,560
but you could also be very muscular and
more, yeah, you can be very muscular.

32
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,930
I thought into morph is like,

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,960
like people that have a really
hard time not being overweight.

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,630
You can gain fat and muscle really
quickly as an endomorph. Yeah,

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,840
but ectomorphs from what I've read,
I might be wrong.

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,520
Neither one of us are
biologists. Exactly, exactly.

37
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,730
I always thought ectomorph was really
skinny and morph was they'd tend to lean

38
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:01,810
towards being overweight
and then Meza more.

39
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:04,260
For someone who's like really
like a Francis and Ghana,

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,600
not super or Brock Lesnar like super
muscular fic like just look like they like

41
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,700
naturally would pack a lot of moms.

42
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,250
I'm sure you could pull
up a chart if you can.

43
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,000
All these pictures just show both of
them from what I, from what I've read,

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,540
see them as amorphous
kind of in the middle.

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,700
ECTOMORPH is Ilene and hot pack on muscle.
ECTOMORPHIC skinny,

46
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:27,570
dark and Mesomorph. Looks like you
super jacked and endomorph looks like,

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:31,620
well endomorph endomorph does
not look fat in that picture.

48
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,160
It doesn't have to be fat. That's
the thing. Now here, here's,

49
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,200
let me tell you something ladies.
When you look at those three pictures,

50
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,040
I go with endomorph all day.
Exactly. Those three pictures.

51
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,740
We love the other words,
if that's what an endomorph is,

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,420
let's take the in the
morning. Yeah, because marks,

53
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,960
they need a lot of naps and they're always
tired. And those mesomorph their egos.

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,590
Goodness,
they want to choke you.

55
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:55,560
The mesomorph shoulders want to
fucking strangle you. But uh,

56
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,360
endomorphs that's a woman.
God,

57
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,830
you can have a riff endomorph
anybody can be ripped.

58
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,290
That's the guy's an endomorph. Maybe think
about it in the morph is like a short,

59
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,730
stocky hulk. Should be fat. And he
could also be packed with muscle.

60
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,570
Calvin, Kelvin, guest alum,
Kevin Gasoline. And he would,

61
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:15,220
I would put them on the end of the moves
and the more site, yes, definitely.

62
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,130
Because he's never really,
totally ripped. Well,

63
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,500
dolce when he had him and he was
getting them down to a real one 70,

64
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,900
he, he really had, I'm pretty ripped at
one point in time. Just really low body.

65
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,660
You can get ripped. It's just not as easy
to get there. Anybody can get ripped. Um,

66
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,500
but uh, an Ectomorph so think
about a basketball player. Okay.

67
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,620
What are the signs they
say is small waist?

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,170
The waist and shoulders are quite similar.
Now George has a v going, you know,

69
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:43,810
is very broad shoulders,
which is great.

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,920
He's perfectly built for fighting that
allows him for reach and his Aa cause

71
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,260
he's got incredible, like, it's like
he's wearing shoulder pads almost.

72
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,150
And you know, he's blessed with many,
many, uh, uh, genetic gifts for fighting,

73
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,900
no doubt about it. And endomorphs
are naturally predisposed, excuse me.

74
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,050
ECTOMORPHS are naturally
predisposed to endurance sports.

75
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,410
So you'll see a lot of marathon runners
or whatnot. They're tall and lanky.

76
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,780
They're not short, bulky, uh, you know,

77
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,960
Mike Tyson type look athletes,
that's a real Meza. More real.

78
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,920
That's what I would say.
Endomorph endomorph because he's so short,

79
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,750
short and stocky and bulky. He could put
on a lot of muscle, a lot of fat Nasco.

80
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,630
Is he a little bit, I don't wanna
I don't want to say he's fat. He's,

81
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,300
he's put on some fat since
he's retired or whatnot. Right.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,630
I don't know how much it
works out anymore, you know?
Exactly. But an Ectomorph,

83
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,880
even when they stop working out,
they're still,

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,330
they're less likely to put back on fat.
And I have a little belly, you know,

85
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:38,260
but it's not as as pronounced.
It's not as pronounced as an Endomorph,

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,700
nm mournful pack on fat and muscle
real quickly and they're, they're more,

87
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,290
they're more, um, they gravitate more
towards power sports so they can explode,

88
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,460
but they have less cardio.
Where's the ECTOMORPH is like,

89
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:54,580
you'll see a lot of running backs.
There's short, stocky, endomorph man,

90
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,170
they have to explode for three,
four seconds.

91
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,460
Is there a best body for
fighting or is there a,

92
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,250
do you just adapt your style to
whatever body you had? Exactly.

93
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:06,780
I think there's the best body for
basketball, the best body for football.

94
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:09,550
While it depends on what position
you're playing, but fighting,

95
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,050
everybody has an a fight in their DNA.
So all styles,

96
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,190
excuse me, all body types can fight and
that's what's so amazing. You got it.

97
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,470
You got to Paul Harris.
He's an endomorph man,

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,470
but he found a way to fight
that make sense for him.

99
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,890
That's what I always tell people.
You got to fight according to your,

100
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,110
your body type.
And people think that's crazy.

101
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,500
No Muhammad Ali fought a certain way
because it has certain attributes.

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,130
He had certain, he had certain
uh, a certain personality.

103
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,370
Even your personalities were important.
If he tried to fight like Tyson,

104
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,820
it would backfire. If Tyson tried to fight
like Muhammad Ali, it would backfire.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,820
I think everybody has to start with
the basics. And then after three,

106
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,780
four years of training,

107
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,860
even maybe up to five years now
you've got to specialize for what your

108
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,960
temperament is.
What's your body type is,

109
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,980
what's your personality is because not
everybody wants to get it done and run.

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,470
And not everybody is the type of person
is going to take it to the cards.

111
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:04,460
And not everybody has a reach and speed
to jab in and out. Lucky and think, oh,

112
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:06,060
I'm just going to jab in
and out like I'll eat. Dude,

113
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,880
do you have the attributes that Ali has?

114
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,380
He was born with certain attributes and
everybody's born with an attribute for

115
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:15,770
fighting. In my opinion, everybody
got this far because they can fight.

116
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,900
Nobody got here, uh, this far without
having some innate ability to fight,

117
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,730
you know, to defend themselves. So all
our body types can defend themselves,

118
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:29,010
but you have to discover what works
best for that body type. Right.

119
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,100
Tyson's a perfect example of exactly.

120
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,810
They thought you couldn't
make it in the pools. It's,

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,490
I know he's going to get
killed in the pros. Right?

122
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,670
There's never been a short guy. When when
Ali was dancing around, people are like,

123
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,630
no,
that's not going to work.

124
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,030
He's going to get tired when
he goes to the heavyweights.

125
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,980
Heavyweight shouldn't bounce around,

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,810
and at least to spar a
lot with lightweights,

127
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,870
he sparse six rounds with light weights,
then six rounds with a heavyweight. Why?

128
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:51,590
Because he would play tag
with a lightweight. It just
about speed and movement.

129
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,510
You move twice as much with a lightweight.
