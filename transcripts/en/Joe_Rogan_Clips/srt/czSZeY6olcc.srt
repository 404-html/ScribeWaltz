00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello Freak bitches. You know,
as I was thinking about, um,

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,050
what the, so with John being out and
then you got calmer, right? Like Connor,

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,410
neat things like looming in the air.
That's like what they gotta do next.

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,810
He's huge money fights. Other than
that, there's not a huge money fight.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,580
But Connor has changed the game for
the better, especially with a fighter.

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:25,530
But it's like, you know with
WME he's steering the ship. Yes.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,810
Like think, think about it. Cause he
made over, cause the numbers coming out,

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,480
their stance going to be
his paper of all time.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,030
So he made a hundred something
million dollars, right? Yeah.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,660
So you're telling me if you're kind and
you're part of his team, he didn't go,

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,100
hey fight Nate Diaz for
how much? Five. 10 million.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,450
Oh and also we need your weird,

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,570
this Reebok and they're gonna pay you
$100,000 a year. Think College go.

14
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,120
You're fucking crazy.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,610
Well I'm sure there's non
negotiables and one non negotiables.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,130
The Reebok deal, like you can't get around
it, but what'd you can get disagree.

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,200
Well, it seems like you can't
get around it right now.

18
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,470
Everybody's wearing Reebok clothes.
Well, no, you can get this.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,110
I'm not saying he's not
not going to wear Reebok,

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,590
but what you have to do it you're,
you're playing a different game now.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,790
You're talking about the biggest athlete
combat sports and you're not getting

22
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:15,990
him for the 200,000 you were paying a
year. Oh yeah. That's so that he can go,

23
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:20,440
listen, I'm down to wear Reebok, but
it's a different animal now. Well,

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,430
Reebok professionally
sponsors him to site.

25
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:28,320
They do Paige vanzant just like they did
Canada different and more money, more,

26
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,890
but not to like think how much he
made to just wear those, you know,

27
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,720
whatever he had on his trunks. Right.
That's a good point. You know, that fight,

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,680
if it really did get six and
a half million paper view bys,

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,650
like they were talking about
Conor making $100 million.

30
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:48,210
If it got 5 million paper, you've eyes,
they got one and a half more than that.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,980
It's like he's super,
that's,

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,230
that's up for debate because
you know how that came about.

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,240
So I think Dana was sitting on on
that suitcase or something and uh,

34
00:01:57,241 --> 00:02:01,590
your eyes filming, right. And Dana goes,
he didn't think he was being recorded.

35
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:06,090
And Dana goes 6.5 mil and
everyone's like, damn, you know,

36
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,640
in the room like,
oh damn dog and Snoop's like damn dog.

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,670
And then your eye turns on the and goes
6.5 million and it shuts the camera off.

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,180
But Dana never officially said
6.5 but that's how it got started.

39
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,150
So Espinosa from showtimes like uh,

40
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:23,250
it's going to break the biggest
point of view numbers all the time.

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,870
But we're thinking more around four
something. Oh, like almost five.

42
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,190
Yeah. So who's, who knows the truth
and who doesn't? I don't know.

43
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,490
I liked to go with Dana on
this one. I'm sorry. Me. Yeah,

44
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:40,170
I was crunk I blasted out right now online
it says trending towards 4.6 million.

45
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,830
Oh cool. Domestic, domestic.
Oh well then it's 6.5.

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,680
So this is my thing with Dana.

47
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,520
He wouldn't just throw that up cause
he doesn't wanna look like an idiot.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,780
Especially with he did official or not.
If he says that to you, Ryan, snoop,

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,980
he didn't think he was being recorded
but Dana wasn't just like 6.5 everybody

50
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,010
like she's not making that up.

51
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,510
If it's trending towards
4.6 nationwide and America,

52
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,520
that's 100% 2 million more overseas
guarantee you that our calls us says that

53
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,560
uh, it wasn't $100 worldwide either.
It was 25 bucks in some countries,

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,620
24 99 or in the UK and Ireland.

55
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,040
You know that's interesting. But still
you, you still the pay per view buys it.

56
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,640
It's going to be around 6.5 from while
I heard it's going to be six one five

57
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,540
seven does,

58
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,130
does the UK have like a history
of paper views like we do?

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,470
Yeah. Joshua quite the same.
That was, that was a pay per
view for them over there.

60
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,800
But over here was it's free.
Free. It was HBO. Right.

61
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,380
Cause he's not big as star that you know,
we like trade a little bit. Yeah. Yeah,

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,070
it makes sense. Yeah.
It doesn't make sense.

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,070
I just wonder how many people order
paper. I mean, you know, the whole,

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,780
the way they watch TV is different there.

65
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,930
And I don't think they consume as
much TV as we do with flatting.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,810
If Connor Suetand or anything
Josh was fighting. They do. Yeah.

67
00:03:55,811 --> 00:04:00,070
But I mean like overall England,
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

68
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,440
but I don't think they have
as many channels as we do.

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,120
I don't think they watch as much
TV as we did this 2017 so yeah,

70
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,020
by Netflix they get all that.
That's not what I'm saying.

71
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,860
I just don't think that it's a normal
part of their day, the way it is our day.

72
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,870
I don't think people in England like,
well go BBC to find,

73
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,360
but I don't think they watch as much.
Yeah.

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,240
I don't think they watch as
much TV on a whole as we do.

75
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,830
They have some great shows. No, no doubt.

76
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,320
But I don't think they
watch as much TV on a whole.

77
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,490
I think that's more of a like a,

78
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,870
it's probably fair to say a problem with
our lazy ass. Yeah, it's a big problem.

79
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,170
I watch some TV there last, I'll work out
for guts to their own president. Works,

80
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,210
works out at all. Zero watches,
five hours of TV a day.

81
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,030
He's hilarious. He doesn't believe in
bed. He thinks your body's a battery.

82
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,660
You think Juliet. So He's, do you
choose? You only have so many beats.

83
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,090
That's why he looks like he's hilarious.
He's so fat.

84
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,420
I was definitely an unhealthy looking.
This fight to amazing by the way,

85
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,890
for you paying attention
at all. Zero. Um, yeah.

86
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:00,040
But either way, I think it's going
to break the paper, your numbers. So,

87
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,560
but congress changes the
dynamics for everyone.

88
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,870
Cause now when you want
him to fight again,

89
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,680
you can't have them agree to
those old terms. He's a smart guy.

90
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:12,310
And if he learned anything from Floyd,
you know, when you, when you fight Floyd,

91
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,360
you're fighting a different animal.
