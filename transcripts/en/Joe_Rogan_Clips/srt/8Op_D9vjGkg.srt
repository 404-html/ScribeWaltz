1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,930
You see fit. Paris is going crazy right
now given having these crazy riots. No.

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,540
What's up?
Every time I think about visiting Paris,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,030
there's some new shit
that goes down over there.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,220
I know it's kind of feels
like a little like a,

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,750
like a jewel box is about to
explode all that good man.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,130
It's not good. Is it
workers? What kind of riot?

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,800
Well the weird thing is everyone
is riding is wearing those.

8
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:27,340
I'm reflective vests. Like
see that? Yeah, that's, Yup.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,020
They're wearing these yellow reflective
vest and lighting things on fire and

10
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:35,160
smashing store. So like who is
Gucci inch? These? These protesters.

11
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:39,870
They've been going scroll backups.
When we got violent it says 17 pictures.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,160
Oh, it's terrible. And it keeps
getting worse. It keeps getting worse.

13
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:48,300
I mean it started November 17th when
French driver sporting yellow vests let a

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,800
demonstration apparently has to do with
oil prices rising. Rising fuel prices,

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,640
280,000 people. Four people have
died. Hundreds have been injured.

16
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,710
Thousands of dollars for the
property has been damaged.

17
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,220
The protest has started in
November 17th from French drivers.

18
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,260
Sporting yellow vests,

19
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:06,030
led a demonstration of 280,000 people
across the country to push back against

20
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:09,630
the rising taxes on gas and diesel at,
uh,

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,120
French president in Menu Ed crown.

22
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,150
I love a nice McCrone as part of his
many economic reforms announced the gas

23
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,750
taxes early this year to minimize
Francis reliance on fossil fuels.

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,760
That's a fucking shitty way to handle,
you know, reliance on fossil fuels.

25
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,600
You do the opposite. You can't face, well
actually, you don't charge people money.

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,171
You know,

27
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,680
you don't charge people extra money and
make it more expensive than they'll use

28
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,700
it. The less you give them subsidies for
electric cars, you stupid prick. Yes.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,330
Don't you understand the American
way you piece of shit, Jesus.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,740
I love talking like, well, they left
Arteta about things I know nothing about.

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:51,130
What does it say? [inaudible] black up
there. Scroll back to where it was, uh,

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,630
the price of fuel. That's it. 30
cents of gout and they went crazy.

33
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,040
30 cents a gallon of
trying to kill people.

34
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,730
Gas already costs about $7 per gallon.
What friends?

35
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,350
Fuck that man.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,980
So it's just going to break people's
backs and they drive you to their bread.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,020
Sean Bush was leaving office and they
jacked the fucking price of gas way up,

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,800
dude. But there's people that
were panicking, you know,

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,130
September 11th there's like lines
everywhere. Cause we thought right, empty.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,970
That's right. Yeah. But
then the price didn't,

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,040
I don't think the price randomly went up.

42
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,450
Some places charge charging like
25 bucks a gallon. Assholes.

43
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,360
They should go to jail.
But that's,

44
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,430
that's kind of insane that people
use to have riots like that. When,

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,360
when we would spike and people
couldn't eat well looking at this,

46
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,930
they were like in cars. The God,
that's a shitty little car. Anyway,

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,390
I probably wanted to light
it on fire. Finally. He's
not even part of the protest.

48
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:45,900
He's just.
