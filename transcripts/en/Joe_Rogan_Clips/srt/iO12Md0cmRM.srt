1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,500
In no matter what anybody wanted to
say about how good the movie was,

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:07,410
what the critics say,
anybody in this business,

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,570
if you can do something where it goes
from a thought and it goes to the paper

4
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,990
and you can execute it, how
many motherfuckers can do
that? They don't do that.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,440
People talk shit all the
motherfucking time. But then you say,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,120
how many have you got an can yo, I'm
right movies, give me a strip. Oh hold on,

7
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:28,770
hold on. I'm almost 30 pages
in. You know what I'm saying?

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,580
How many times you that story,
why are they going on? I got it.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,710
I've got a great idea.
All right, what is it?

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,040
I remember I was just with Chappelle
show was popping and ludicrous gave me a

11
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:44,640
lesson out of nowhere. I saw many
airport and I was on Ashy, Larry Hart.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,060
I was I rich bitch man. So I'm like
doing reference like we're even right.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,310
So ludicrous. I was like, Yo Luda
right. He said, what's up Ashley?

14
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,870
I said,
I said Yo,

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,920
kill a motherfucker getting a movie or
something cause I just thought that's

16
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,760
what you do.
You just add some motherfucker.

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,950
I like it a month I get a movie or
something and he looked at me, Joe,

18
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,250
it was so cold. He looked me
right in my face. He said,

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,530
we look for people with ideas and I looked
to him like, well, I have none, right? So

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,820
I guess this is this conversation and
it did and when I'm telling you it was a

21
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,654
lesson,

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,410
how the fuck you want to ask somebody
for something and you don't got shit to

23
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:29,280
give them? A lot of guys in the
beginning think that's how you do it.

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,640
That's how he did when I was on HBO is
the wires. Motherfucker told me one time,

25
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,850
he said, Yo d can you give
me the number to the wire?

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,950
I think I could do this shit.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,210
This motherfucker what the day was like
a hotline from anybody from the streets.

28
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:46,050
Do you ever thought about being an actor?

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,470
You don't want to put those
10 years of getting rejected.

30
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,350
Just call this number and we'll
put you on the wire. You know,

31
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,260
what gets me about acting though is
when someone has never acted before,

32
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:58,140
it goes in there and kills it.
You know,

33
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,130
like people who are like the athletes in
particular, like rappers have done it.

34
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,080
Like a lot of people have done it,
but some people,

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,480
but some people I believe that that,
do you have natural talents? Yeah.
