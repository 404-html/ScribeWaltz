1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,640
Okay. I have to try this
just because it's disgusting.

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:07,400
So tell me what the name of
the candy is again. Pulse pit
spell that. P. U. L. U. L. S.

3
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:11,850
E. It's a green mango candy.
Yeah, it's originally,

4
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:15,120
it's a classic snuck right
where they use the sulfur salt.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,620
It's called black salt and they'd put a
bit of Chili and sulfur salt on mango.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,270
And I have to admit that when I had the
real green mango with the sulfur salt is

7
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,780
not that bad. That candy was like pushed.
It's like the mega warheads, you know,

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:28,800
that we had as kids.

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,720
I wonder too sometimes like the Gamey
flavor of the pheasant, the cheese,

10
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:38,640
that is the yield of that is it? I see it
sometimes as a bit of a, like, you know,

11
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:43,490
the ghost pepper is a bit of a pissing
contest between, yeah. You know,

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,390
like it's like no one could possibly
enjoy the taste of ghost pepper. No, no.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,710
I mean, does it even have a taste? I
mean, you even responding to that taste,

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,820
I won't even try it. Have you, you know
who you know, who loves that? You know,

15
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:01,680
Olivier, those guys, they have like
what they watch, like game of Thrones,

16
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,270
they get together and they,
those peppers, oh yeah,

17
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:09,080
they have like Olivia all bone merciay
who's a fighter in the UFC and they'll,

18
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,520
they'll have like ghost pepper parties,
you know,

19
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,900
and then the next day they'll
go to comicon and dress
up as superheroes and then

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,630
play some online poker and
then eat more ghost peppers.

21
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,500
And he's also a UFC fighter. You got to
think he's a very extreme human being.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,600
These are funny kid. I was
very, very, very nice guy guys.

23
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,800
Brilliant to know that
he was a trained killer.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,400
You would have no idea if you talked to
him. It just seems like a jail. Yeah,

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,460
he's a sweetie could kid. And it's a good
for us. It's interesting. You know, we,

26
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,520
we actually have a bit of a chapter in
the book where we talk loosely about

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:46,090
those guys and that relationship where
you guys sponsored him or something.

28
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:49,410
He four before the Reebok thing.
Yeah. Because I remember one,

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,710
one of the fights that we did in Montreal,
um,

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
we went to your restaurant afterwards
and Livier showed up after his fight and

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,670
you guys were congratulating him on
his, uh, his fiance's, his wife works,

32
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,530
his girlfriend works with us at the
restaurant and for a long time now and uh,

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,220
you know, we met because these
guys, it's, it's interesting. Hey,

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,250
there's super into food and they're open
to a lot of things and they're curious

35
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:22,260
and a lot of them get aimed in
the wrong direction, you know,

36
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:27,261
like the brown rice and chicken direction
and you're responsible for in big part

37
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,570
for the awakening, the nutritional
awakening of these guys. You know,

38
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:37,500
a lot of them go for their gun license
and health just to be able to hunt.

39
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,820
They go fishing on the weekend,

40
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:42,450
they go for like two hours hike in
the woods and like little fishing rod.

41
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,120
They come back with droughts and we
get a phone call. He's like, Hey Fred,

42
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,050
I go fish for trout. You know, what
do I do with that? You know, it's,

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,260
it's a great thing. And Yeah, we
did. We did sponsored them after.

44
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:57,060
But then what we do now is we, um,
we cook for them a post way in,

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,730
ah,

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Marco did GSP or the last fight at
Madison Square Gardens. They were,

47
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,770
the boys were there for
a week. Uh, we've done,

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,380
Tim Kennedy came for a week and just hung
out and cook meals. We sat in the kids,

49
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,490
uh, Marco and Fred goes and Gab goes,
uh, got real drunk polo. They'd go,

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,760
they rent a suite and they prepare
all of the meals up to weight cut and

51
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:22,060
afterwards.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,620
And do they have nutritional requirements
for the weight cut and like just like

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,820
the weekend they do, they
have a nutritionist there
with them, but then they,

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,200
they have the crime.
But my,

55
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,270
I have a take on that is
if the nutritionist writes
a plan and the food's not

56
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:42,460
good and you don't eat it, then it
doesn't, it doesn't work. Right.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,160
Like can even write on paper.
But if you don't take the pill,

58
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,390
then you don't eat chicken and Kale.
This much grabs this.

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,820
But we can professional cook,

60
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:58,020
we'll make the Kale delicious or Brussels
prize and the chicken properly cause

61
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,570
the Kale could be bad and the
chicken can be dry thing too.

62
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,510
That works that you guys
are already suffering.

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,530
The thing that works the best in that
case is that all of a sudden you have in

64
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,400
the room, we set up a
little table, which is,

65
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:15,730
so it's not like playstation dirty
underwear's like pre-fight vibe.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,640
It's dining with dining with friends.

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,290
And whether it's Marco Gab me, we know
we don't talk. If you don't want to talk,

68
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,990
we want to talk, we're here, you know,
and we'll, we'll, we'll hang out.

69
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,780
But then you feel like
your eggs in that Tortilla,

70
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:33,280
you feel like your eggs with potatoes
or like it's mellow and it helps a lot

71
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:33,700
with the,

72
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,470
just the context of not being like
ordering pizza from room service.

73
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,470
George used to tell us whole
horror stories, you know,

74
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:46,150
but for some of his biggest wins years
ago with George say eating like room

75
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:51,151
service Rigatoni and pizza
before like a major fight,

76
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,370
you know.
So now it's different.
