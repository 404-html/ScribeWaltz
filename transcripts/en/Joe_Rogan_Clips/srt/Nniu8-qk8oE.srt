1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
What are your thoughts on,
on alien life,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,100
on life outside of this planet? Is
there something you think about? Yeah,

3
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:12,940
I think there must be,
um,

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,740
even in the solar system,

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,030
I would not be surprised if we find
microbes on Mars or some of the moons of

6
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:22,420
Jupiter or Saturn where there's
liquid water like Europa. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,680
And the reason is, if you think
about, there isn't, I think that,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,430
and it's a guess is because if you
look at the history of life on earth,

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,440
then so earth formed and it was just, uh,
there was no life. It was a ball of rock.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,590
And almost as soon as it cooled down,

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,970
we see evidence of life
certainly 3.8 billion years ago,

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,050
possibly even further back than that.
We see evidence of life on earth.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,760
So somewhere along the line,
geochemistry,

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,330
active geochemistry became
biochemistry on earth.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,140
And we have some idea, you know, the, the,

16
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:04,141
if you get a gradient of temperature
and acid and alkaline and the conditions

17
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,630
that are naturally present
on the surface of oceans,

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,490
then complex carbon chemistry
spontaneously happens.

19
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,110
So we have a,

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,100
we know that life almost certainly
we know that life began on earth.

21
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,040
I mean the other option is it came
from space or something like that,

22
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:23,590
but probably didn't.
It probably began on earth.

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,070
And so that means that at least here
that happened and that we know that the

24
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:34,711
conditions that led to the origin of life
on earth were present a 3.8 4 billion

25
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,950
years ago. And we know that
they're present on Europa today.

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,970
So I don't see that
there's anything special.

27
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:46,510
Life is just chemistry
and it, and, and the,

28
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:50,350
the idea that Geo chemistry becomes
biochemistry is not fanciful because it

29
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:55,000
happened here.
So I think that given the same conditions,

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,800
it will be surprising to me at the same
thing didn't happen in that life begins.

31
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,060
So I,

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,060
that's one of the test that is one
of the great frontiers of science.

33
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:07,960
Now.
It's one of the great challenges,

34
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,800
which is why we're another reason we're
interested in Mars because we know those

35
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:12,700
conditions were there.

36
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,360
We know there were what's called
hydrothermal vent systems on the floors of

37
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:20,050
oceans.
Our mouths 3.8 or 4 billion years ago.

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,290
So it will be good to know what
I've said is right and they're,

39
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:27,670
the way we find out is to find
life or evidence of past life.

40
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,730
Are you aware of uh, the speculation
that was going around? What,

41
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,180
how recent was it? That
occupy thing? The uh,

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,950
the octopus eggs,
they,

43
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:43,220
there was a group of scientists that
were speculating that it's Po, you know,

44
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:48,221
Panspermia the idea of Panspermia that
it's possible that Octopi had come from

45
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,670
somewhere else. I'm frozen eggs. It
actually come from somewhere else and,

46
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,070
and landed on earth and there's just
like legitimate scientist or contemplated

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,370
not morons. I don't think I've
seen this. The, no, I didn't,

48
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:05,350
but I mean I think so. Panspermia doesn't
have to be unlikely. I mean, for example,

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,620
you might have seen the other day we
found an earth rock on the moon. Right?

50
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,060
Well they'll let your back
on earth now cause he,

51
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,500
Apollo astronauts brought it back then
there is 4 billion years old or something.

52
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,690
Like one of the oldest rocks
ever found. Yeah. Right. So,

53
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:19,320
so we know that material gets
transferred between planets. Um,

54
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,280
and so it's not inconceivable
that microbes could survive
that journey. Right.

55
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:27,220
We know that microbes can
survive in space, for example.

56
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,750
So that isn't mad. Uh, is probably
unlikely, but he's not mad.

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,760
But with the octopus,
I hadn't heard that.

58
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,761
But the thing is that the octopus is still
extremely similar biologically to us.

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,440
I mean the differences are negligible.

60
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,670
So he still got the same energy system
with a single ATP and DNA and all that

61
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:49,510
stuff. It's all very, very similar.
It was something about RNA and DNA.

62
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,550
Did you to find that out

63
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,170
girl? I'm trying. If I'm looking at
different one from a different website,

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,930
it's about the same thing it has to do
with the Cambrian explosion. And there,

65
00:03:56,931 --> 00:04:01,120
there are 33 authors on a paper that
got published in the progress and of in

66
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,230
biophysics and molecular biology
that talked about this possibility.

67
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,880
There are other people that
disagree with it though,

68
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,070
right? I mean, yeah, I suppose
the, I haven't seen it.

69
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,790
So I think it's unlikely because the
octopus is extremely similar to us.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,120
So that suggests a common origin to
me that's oppose the cancer argument.

71
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,300
You could, you could advance would
be, there's only one way to do life.

72
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,850
So you could say that actually given,

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,460
because the laws of physics and
chemistry the same everywhere.

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,740
So maybe it's maybe DNA
is the only way to do it.

75
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,460
So that's the way it gets done,
which is why they're so similar to us.

76
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,270
All those so alien as well. Yeah,
they, they're not though. You know,

77
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,101
that's the thing about it.

78
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,710
Not so that's why I'm surprised a value
because they're not the alien that

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,040
they're very similar while
they're in their abilities.

80
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,450
I mean their ability to transform their
outer outer texture and their color

81
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,470
almost instantaneously.
Oh yeah.

82
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,580
I mean they have incredible camouflage
abilities that really don't exist.

83
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,510
And the Ma'am Mammalian world.
Yeah. But on a cellular level,

84
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,970
you look at an ox for sal
and among under a microscope,

85
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:07,250
and you wouldn't be able to tell the
dean she knocks per cell and humans.

86
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,500
So the only way that that would make
sense as if all life comes from basically

87
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,790
the same kind of building blocks.

88
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,870
And just varies depending upon the
conditions and where it takes place.

89
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,430
I'm I'm guessing, but yes,
that that must be the,

90
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:23,200
there the only way you could sustain
that given that they're so similar to us

91
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,380
because they really are biochemically is
that that's the only way it can be done

92
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,540
given the given the building block, the
toolkit, the laws of nature and the,

93
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,800
the elements and so on that
we have in our universe,

94
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,500
we have so many different
life forms on our planet,

95
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,760
but if we found anything that's remotely
similar to what we have here on earth,

96
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:46,210
on another planet, it would be such an
incredible discovery. Like when we sat,

97
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,740
if we found a frog on the moon, I mean
there was, the world would stop. Right.

98
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,030
I'd be very surprised they
were in the car going to me.

99
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,100
What I mean if we're found anything,

100
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:58,460
anywhere that is any in any
way similar an insect on Mars?

101
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,050
Well this is, I mean as I say, it'd be
micro. I think we single celled things.

102
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,940
Remember, I mean, you mentioned
the Cambrian explosion.

103
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,080
So that is that what we do that earth is,
although life began,

104
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,820
let's say 3.8 billion years ago,

105
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,330
it wasn't until around 600
million years ago or so,

106
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:20,130
or maybe most 700 that you see any
complex multicellular organisms.

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,140
That's all.
So for something like 3 billion years,

108
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,000
it was single celled alone,

109
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,950
and that's one of the reasons why
I would guess, if I had to guess,

110
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:34,730
I would say that microbes would be
common because life began very quickly on

111
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:38,690
earth. And I wouldn't be surprised
to find it on Mars, but complex life,

112
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,730
multicellular life,
insects, plan intelligence,

113
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,850
I would guess would be very rare because
it took so long on earth to get there

114
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,570
and you just slime for 3
billion years of slime.

115
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,180
That was it.
