1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,770
The joe rogan experience, years
of years of competition, you know,

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,850
all day the problem at the colitis
and all that. That's because of that,

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,590
that that bs that I got it like
putting too much on me. Normally fight,

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,330
fight again. It will be, it will go back
that same pattern. I will, I will not be,

5
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:22,410
I will be very stressed and it's normal
to be stressed, but I will accept it.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,370
I accept it better now than I
used to do when I was younger.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,380
Now after you won the title,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,440
there was thoughts of whether or not
you would defend it if you were going to

9
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,350
fight Robert Whitaker, like
what you were going to do, what,

10
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:38,040
what caused your decision? What made
you decide to relinquish the belt?

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,280
So the reason why I
relinquish your belt is ag.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,770
I went to do some physical
tests to see what, what,

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,120
what does that problem with my
El Condition? Because during the,

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,850
the Cap I knew I had problem. I didn't
know what it was. I knew it was, you know,

15
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,540
that tests, the blood tests and everything
for the cancer, it came negative.

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,820
So after I went to do like, like I say,
colonoscopy, it came back that I uh,

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,200
no sorry,
inside my stomach

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,870
that as a doctor I say how long it takes
to get rid of this is I is whole your

19
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,220
life. But the symptom, the symptom can
go up, down, depending every people,

20
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,990
whatever they do differently.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,920
Then I started researching was the
best doctor I'll can I do this.

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,921
And that's when I started reading
about like the fasting and stuff and I,

23
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,730
and I then I, then I tried it, but

24
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,340
I saw that a lot of it
in that sport of MMA,

25
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:32,200
a lot of the guys are a starving day.
They know they're not hungry,

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,870
they are not rich.
You know,

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm lucky now have enough
money for the rest of my life.

28
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,730
I don't need to fight anymore.
You know,

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,350
if I don't do nothing crazy like buying
a private airplane and I'm not that kind

30
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:48,150
of person or falling into drugs and
stuff and I, I think I'm good, you know,

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,730
for me, my family and
everything, I think I'm good.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,710
However APP when I'm looking at
the landscape, I say a lot of guy,

33
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,980
like for example,
condo met Gregory,

34
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:01,530
he hold on to the title two to 40
attention the sponsors at this and that,

35
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,090
and I love people do that. That kind
of, they kind of stole the division.

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,840
And I'd said to my side, I
said, you know what I stand for,

37
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:13,320
for the fighters always did,
you know, and publicly as her,

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,130
why am I gonna keep that title until to
see if I feel better or not and defend

39
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:21,840
it because I don't even know if my leg,
my weight that it was dropping down.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,130
It's like I,
I'm not even,

41
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:27,780
no one 85 or a Memoriam one
70 or one 50 Fiverr's I'm not,

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,800
I don't have the size of a one 85 hours.
So I'm like,

43
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,370
I, I relinquished it right away. You know,

44
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:39,080
I don't want to install the division and
make people wait because of me and that

45
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,980
they're the, well, don't go around
me. You know what I mean? So far,

46
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,430
the respect I did,
I did it,

47
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,330
but I didn't know before the fight I
was going to do it is it happened like

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,980
[inaudible] like this people, I was like,
oh yeah. You know, not knowing. No, I did.

49
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,820
I didn't know he was going,

50
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,350
I didn't know it was going to have
it called ids and all that stuff. He,

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,280
it came up, I never tried it before. I
didn't know what would be the outcome,

52
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,880
how I would feel. I never
did it. You know, it was a
test. And this same, no bad.

53
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,290
I didn't know. You know, I have a
lot of, uh, I'm not a perfect man.

54
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,580
Joe Have a lot of, uh, negative stuff
about me. My one thing that I'm not, is,

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,610
I'm not a coward. This I where if
I say I'm going to do something,

56
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:19,210
I'm going to do, I'm not a coward,
you know, and every of my fight,

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,710
every of my fight I was, I'm
scared. I'm scared. I'm terrified.

58
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,580
But whatever. I feel, I
step. And I, and I, I, uh,

59
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,110
I respect Mike on trek and
I do it, you know, and, um,

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,100
I didn't, I didn't know the
colitis and all that. It was,

61
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,430
it would be illogical right now if we,

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,980
if I want to go back when I'm ready to
go back one, eight five, I'm not one 85,

63
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,320
you know? Right, right.
It would be a stupid move.

64
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,570
And so if you're gonna fight again
and it'd be one 70 or one 55 yes.

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,960
What were, were you leaning?
Are you leaning towards 55 or 70

66
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,110
I don't know. I, I'm, I'm Leah,
I'm gonna. I want to lean. We're,

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,950
if I, I want, you know what

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,080
af climb the Everest many
times. You know, I've climate,

69
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:11,190
once I lose to Matt Hughes
and I climate too, I loosed,

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,000
I then I, then I got it, then I
lose to Matt Serra. I climate again.

71
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,410
I've done it like three times.
And you're like, I'm 37 years old.

72
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:22,170
I just turned 37 few,
few days ago.

73
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
I don't want to have much less.
Right. And the far what have left.

74
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,460
I want to make the, the, the big fight
that fight, that the fan want to see,

75
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:32,940
they want to enjoy.
Um,

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,740
I also want personal need for me to
achieve something that is unique,

77
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:42,150
that is rare, that maybe that never
been attempted before. You know,

78
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,800
that would be something that excites me.

79
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,020
And I'm not only driven by
money, you know, like, like,

80
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:52,710
like a, it's good to have
money. We like money. It's,

81
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,720
it drives us all, including myself, but
it's not the unique thing that drives me.

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,270
It need to be more than
money and they need,

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,190
need to be some kind of achievement that
comes with it. That would exciting me.

84
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,130
Okay.
