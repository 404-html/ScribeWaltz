1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
When was the most troubled person? Well,
that's my defense of Roseanne. You know,

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:05,670
all these people were coming after
Rosanna. I'm like, you don't understand.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,580
She's bad. She's, she's not just
batshit. She got in a car accident. He,

4
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:13,500
she had severe brain damage.
She's on all sorts of medications.

5
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,200
He has multiple personality disorder.
She's drinking,

6
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:20,630
she's on Ambien and she's seven years
old. What the fuck do you want? Right.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,920
What you want from this lady. And you
spoke that way. And so did norm, you know,

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,420
norms talked about Louie and Roseanne
and the same way you that like, Yo man,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,580
she's bat shit crazy. First of all,
if you're going to her for, for,

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,020
you know, if you're going to
her for political discourse,

11
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:44,970
you know my one or you evaluate your
light comes on you, that's your fault.

12
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,100
Yeah. You, yeah.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,880
And that doesn't mean either one of
us agree with exactly what you wrote.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,590
It's just how she got there. But that's
what also was, she's so funny, you know,

15
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,380
if you go back and watch
Roseanne in the early days,

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,940
well that show was fucking heavy. It was
a great show. And her standup before,

17
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:07,710
even before. That was fantastic. Yeah.
I put her in the top 20 of all time.

18
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:10,890
She was brilliant. She was brilliant.
But it's also a monster man.

19
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:14,760
Like there was nobody like her before.
Like she was just as brash.

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,670
I don't give a fuck. She was
like a man kill, like, like, uh,

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,520
like, like a world class stand up. I mean,

22
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:27,200
I remember like when that show came
on, just seeing that house, I was,

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,250
I had never seen a house like that
on television. You know what I mean?

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,100
Closer to what we knew
then what I had ever seen.

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,930
My house didn't look like the Cosbys,
you know what I mean? I was like,

26
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,720
maybe Archie bunker, you know,
it was like a little bit closer,

27
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:47,721
but it's when people are batshit
crazy and someone reacts to that with

28
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,620
confusion, not confusion
with contempt. I'm like,

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,330
you understand their bat shit crazy
and it's part of why they got to where

30
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,710
they're at. Don't, don't
ask surprise now that,

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,950
that someone said something loony.
Yeah. This many years after.

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,980
You know what I mean? It. It it,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,400
it just seems strange to me
that now you're blown away.

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,340
She's been saying batshit
crazy shit for a long time.

35
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,550
I think it's also part of this new
culture that we have in where people just,

36
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,390
they find a target and they attack.
Of course. It's like if, if you have,

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,090
if there's any sort of weakness,

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,510
like if you have chickens
and one chicken gets sick,

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,110
that's what that pecking order thing is.
Sean chicken doesn't feel good.

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,540
The other chickens,
they don't,

41
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,240
they don't like make moral
judgments on this chicken.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,300
They just find a target the
site along with that chicken,

43
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:43,350
so they start fucking it up. Right. And
this, it happens with dogs. It's a horse.

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,580
It's an animal thing. It is
human beings. We have to,

45
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,240
if we're going to be real, if we're
gonna, if we're going to be compassionate,

46
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,770
we're really going to be compassionate.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,660
If we're really gonna like try to
engineer a better culture and a better

48
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:02,260
community, we got to stop that. I agree.
We've got to just stop attacking people.

49
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,880
Like, she didn't, I believe I talked
to her on the phone, just me and her.

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,380
She did not know that lady
was black initially. She
looked at that lady, she goes,

51
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:15,550
she looked Jewish. She looks like me.
She, that's what she said. I believe you.

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,750
I believe her too.

53
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,590
I think she was just cracking a joke
fucked up on ambien short and drinking and

54
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:24,910
smoking weed all night. And, but
no one cares what her intent was.

55
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,680
All they care is, I got a
green light. That's a target
we're going to go in. Well,

56
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,920
here's my issue with the, the
modern, the modern left is,

57
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,600
is they talk compassion. But
there though they pounce. It's,

58
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,480
I feel like a man with no country
now too. Cause I don't, I don't,

59
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,400
the modern left isn't something that
I gravitate towards and neither is the

60
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:53,320
right. And when I was growing up and
listening to public enemy, you know,

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,030
and that left of it,
it changed.

62
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,000
It changed and I didn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,460
And you, and you have these people, um,

64
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,480
I don't know where I stand anymore,
man.

65
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,760
I think there's this rational left
leaning people that are against

66
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:19,870
discrimination and for
welfare and for food. I look,

67
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:23,440
I was on welfare when I was a kid.
If people say I shouldn't be on welfare,

68
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:27,700
well what the fuck? Right. My parents were
on, well, no, I came from a poor family.

69
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,970
We had food stamps and eventually
they did better and we got off of it.

70
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,350
But if you want to tell me that, that
doesn't help, that fed me. Absolutely.

71
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,990
So how could I ever go against that?
And that was a part of my childhood.

72
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Solutely there's all these things that
people want to associate with being,

73
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,390
you know,
like with the left or right.

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,590
I think there's just a gigantic
problem with people being tribal.

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,630
That's what it is. It's tribalism at
its, at its highest degree, which,

76
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,850
and since I've been alive, I haven't
seen, never seen it like this for Fords.

77
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,070
I think we know why, but, well it's
facilitated not just by Trump and,

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,660
but it's also by the ability to
communicate instantaneously, of course,

79
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,130
without any consideration.

80
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,980
And you could just tweet something or
make a youtube video about something

81
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:15,750
instantaneously. Sure. Roseanne's
ability to tweet that. Yeah.

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,880
That quickly with the phone is why Song
Kirsch show costs millions of dollars.

83
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,510
People lost their jobs. ABC Junk, you
know, it's either going to do the Connors,

84
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,540
guess what? That show's gonna
fucking sink like the titanic.

85
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,760
Of course it's going Roseanne.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

86
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,450
Roseanne without Roseanne,
right? Three episodes.

87
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,390
That's like flavor free diet.

88
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:41,410
Coke tastes like water and
just have water motherfucker.

89
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,910
It's diet coke though, without
the flavor. It's true. It's true.

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,950
And I don't, um, it's just,

91
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,320
it's the hypersensitivity and it's like
the ability for anyone right or wrong to

92
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:01,440
be able to something right
then. Right where you would
have, you know, if, if, uh,

93
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,310
you're doing fear factor in
rolling stone interviews, you,

94
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,970
there's a thought process there and,

95
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,790
and there's editing and you're sitting
there and you're talking with a

96
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,630
journalist. All of that's
gone, man. It's like it,

97
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,890
that's what it's come down to.
You know, we have all, all three.

98
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,740
It was our phones in our pockets.
You can say something crazy right now.

99
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,470
If we stubbed our toe right,
it's nice, steady job, fuck this,

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,230
Blah Blah and all of a sudden you're done,

101
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,560
your son good in that because the tyranny
of these gigantic organizations like

102
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:34,710
if they were tyrannical,
if they did have an agenda,

103
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,650
if they were trying to smear you,
you were fucked.

104
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,300
He had no recourse and they did that.
Too many people,

105
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,220
I'm sure there's unscrupulous journalists,

106
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,270
but also journalistic
integrity takes a backseat to,

107
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:46,830
because now they have to get clicks.

108
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:50,970
Like these people are real journalists
are fighting for their lives. Absolutely.

109
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:55,300
Cause these publications going under,
well real journalism is almost dead.

110
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,360
It's not totally dead but it's,
it's hurt.

111
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,710
But like I was got emphysema
like the Alex Jones thing. Right.

112
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:06,760
Whether I agree with shit he says
are not corporations shut him down.

113
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:11,761
And that to me that scary that the
corporations can decide what we are.

114
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,490
Well to hear really well.

115
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,370
I was having a good conversation about
this last night with some friends and

116
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:24,630
they were talking about whether or
not things like youtube or Twitter or

117
00:07:24,631 --> 00:07:29,610
Instagram should be regulated
like utilities where anybody
can use it. You know,

118
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:34,140
like you have the right to get the power.
Like if you have, if you have a house,

119
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,530
you're, you have the right to, you pay
your money, you get your power turned on.

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,370
It's a utility.
Maybe a channel like that,

121
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:44,100
whether it's a youtube
or whether it's Twitter,

122
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,540
maybe a channel should be treated like a
utility, but then the question is like,

123
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,520
what is it exactly that is good
enough to get you kicked off?

124
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,590
Because I've seen some horrible shit.

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,030
People have read or written rather on
Twitter that, and they're still on, right.

126
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,860
I've seen shit, whatever. He's
being a whatever, you know,

127
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,660
this is why he was brought down.

128
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,560
I've seen people say much worse shit
thing was the sandy hook and it was that

129
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,890
the sandy hook thing was he said
that he thought that it was fake.

130
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,520
He's since disavowed that,
but they don't care if you disavow things.

131
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:24,400
It's like they have this thing on you now.
You said that the kids didn't die.

132
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:26,350
They definitely did.
Let's get rid of you.

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,370
But are you saying that people
aren't allowed to make mistakes?

134
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Are you saying that people aren't
allowed to evolve their thinking?

135
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,610
Are you saying that people aren't allowed
to say things that are wrong because a

136
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,110
lot of people say things in a wrong,

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,110
but is it only things that are
wrong about children? Like where,

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
what does the line,

139
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,170
I don't know where lines are anymore
and I don't know who's the one drawing.

140
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:46,611
Well,

141
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:51,611
it's these people that either are the
CEOs or the stockholders or the CFO's,

142
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,730
whoever it is that, that is in the
meeting dictating these standards.

143
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,760
They're deciding,

144
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:01,110
and these are gigantic corporations
that we were just talking about this.

145
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,110
I don't think they ever anticipated this.

146
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,800
I think when they made Twitter they
thought it'd be, like Jamie was saying,

147
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,770
it was a fun way to like tell your
friends, you know, uh, you know,

148
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:14,220
Vinny pads and Joe Rogan to go into the
movies and that's what you would do.

149
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,490
That's what Twitter was. It
was just like, I'm at, I'm,

150
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,290
I'm eating pizza at the mall.
Yeah. It wasn't anything crazy.

151
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,570
And then people started using
as a platform for, I don't
know what, uh, you know,

152
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:28,090
Vinny pads and Joe Rogan to go into the
movies and that's what you would do if

153
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,280
that's what Twitter was. It
was just like, I'm at, I'm,

154
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,090
I'm eating pizza at the mall.
Yeah. It wasn't anything crazy.

155
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,470
And then people started using as
a platform for, I don't know why.
