1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,250
The joe rogan experience it. Exactly
right. I need three, four, you know?

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,020
Yeah. That's weird. It hurts us.
It's weird. Like the UFC could just,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,020
did they just decide who's fighting?
I mean it's the whole thing.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,880
The business is so interesting because
it's like they decide who's fighting.

5
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:20,680
They decide who's champion. They decide,
Tony, you're not champion anymore.

6
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:24,170
I'm going to strip yet. It's
like put it, I fucking fell.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,470
I don't want this to, he's up
at Fox studios. I twist my knee.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,290
But he was working for the UFC when
he fell. I mean he's doing his,

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,960
his obligations, his press
obligations. Very strange.

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,650
A strip him of a belt when he never lost
it and he the longest winning streak

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,810
and then and mean.

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,370
But also he has no belt could because
there's no belt can be what's going to

13
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,230
take the belt.
They're going to make up a bell.

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,650
And then Connor has the belt at 55 so
what do you do with that belt? Well,

15
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:54,690
what they were planning on doing,
I believe,

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,260
and now they've kind of let the cat out
of the bag cause they said it's going to

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,470
be for the world lightweight title.

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,100
They were going to strip Connor
the moment something happened,

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,370
like the moment the fight started. That's
when they were going to strip Connor.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,700
Yeah,
because if they'd stripped him beforehand,

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,510
then what happens if Tony doesn't make
weight or something totally mixed with

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,030
out of could be,
doesn't make weight.

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,370
Then what the fuck do you have
a concern then you have nothing.

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,550
You already stripped him.
We're going to give it back to him.

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,510
I'm going to give it back to him.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,710
So if he wants to fight again
now he's not the champion.

27
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,050
He more the fuck kind of shit is strange.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,850
So they waited and the idea was to wait,

29
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:31,820
but now they're in a desperado situation.
Rato still belt on the line.

30
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,430
That'll yet fucking April fool's.
April fool's day, it happens.

31
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,160
I didn't believe a God damn word of it.
Jimmy Smith's starts texting me. I'm like,

32
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:41,040
fuck that dude. I'm not falling
for it. Jamie texted me. I'm like,

33
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,720
I'm not falling for it. You texted me, you
go, Bro, it's April fools. I'm like, no.

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:50,610
But Dana, I sent dated, released
a video and he's listening.

35
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm sure he likes a
good April fool's joke,

36
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,740
but what he likes more his money and
pay per view buys. You can't honey dick.

37
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:58,620
The fans are like psych.
It's back on, right.

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,020
People are going to be pissed and
not be biased. That's a good point.

39
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,350
I didn't buy it. I still was like,
maybe it's just an elaborate PR scam.

40
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,750
I didn't even tweet about it
until the next day. I know.

41
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,120
I was tweeting about other shed.
People were like, what the fuck, Bro?

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,450
This is go jog or not even tweet
about it. I'm like, I'm not. I'm not.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
I'm not going to do it. I checked it. I
checked with you and then I checked with,

44
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:19,650
uh, Josh Thompson who works
closely with, uh, could be,

45
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,390
and then so boom, there's my two main
guys and I went, all right, Ariel,

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,050
that's all aerial tweet. I'm like,
God, he's a journalist. I'm a,

47
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm an ass clown. He's a legit journalist.
Like [inaudible] he is the, you know,

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,400
credibility. So I went, Bro,
is this real? And he goes,

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,020
I would never joke around like that.
Brendan. I'm like, he's right. Well,

50
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,710
I went straight to his Jujitsu coach. I
called Eddie, talked to him on the phone.

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,260
Yeah. So an Eddie gave me the full
rundown on what happened with Tony.

52
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,220
It's like he saw somebody and
he turned to say hi to somebody,

53
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,080
didn't see some wires on the ground,

54
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,810
tripped over some wires
and just blew his shit out.

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,320
And Eddie was on the podcast yesterday
and Eddie was saying that Tony wanted to

56
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,250
fight or day before yesterday. Tony wanted
to fight. They wouldn't let him fight.

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,990
Yeah. His, his ligament is torn
from the bone, which is rare,

58
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,180
which is hard to do. I don't
know. Where's that one?

59
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,250
Lateral lateral whenever collateral
ligament, some shit. Anyways.

60
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,400
But do you think, uh, it would, uh,
if, if, if it went tripping off that,

61
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,190
is that a freak accident or do you think
it would have went during the fight?

62
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,600
It's hard to say. Oh, I bet it was a
freak accident, right? To associate LCL.

63
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,730
I mean the way they said it, but first
of all with Dana said was very savage.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,850
What'd he say? Dana said, uh, he
wears those sunglasses indoors.

65
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,250
That should happen to everybody
that wear sunglasses indoors.

66
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,910
That's the letter I have
your glory David quote.

67
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,640
Cause there's only two types of
people that wear sunglasses indoors.

68
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,900
Blind people and assholes.
It's true. So true.

69
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,010
It's so dope there. Those weird
thing man, especially at night,

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,670
like what are you doing so hard to
see? What is this? What are you doing?

71
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,100
I've seen a guy in a club
when I used to go to clubs,

72
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,850
he does his glasses on and
then people walk, laid,

73
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,390
lift them up to look around and put
it back down. You can't see shit.

74
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,280
The biggest tools wear glasses,

75
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:13,930
sis to fights and wear sunglasses and they
sit there with her fucking sunglasses.

76
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,760
I'll especially celebrities that too,
that it's like flurries do it.

77
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:20,170
It's like get, get a grip. However mean
that's like when you know you fucked up,

78
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,130
you got two famous,

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,300
you have to wear sunglasses at a fight
that sit in the front row. It's Sunglass.

80
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,720
And your boys are just like, no, I like
it, man. Yeah, we're those indoors.

81
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,840
That makes complete sense.

82
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,080
It same if you were like a peacock coat
and your boys like, that's all good.

83
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,090
I'm gonna Start Doing podcasts.
Like that stresses me out for now.

84
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,010
That stresses me out. Sam trip. We did a
podcast like this. Did you say something?

85
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,450
What did you say something to them like
what are we doing? And I put mine on,

86
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,190
I put mine on and we've,

87
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:49,130
we've done it before with a sunglasses
with NASA outfits. That's hilarious.

88
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,440
Deleted. Did our, did the fighter and the
kid with sunglasses. I don't, I go, Bro,

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,320
you got to take the sunglasses off. He
goes, my future's too bright. Too Bright.

90
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,930
I'll fuck mine too. And
the calendars. Shit.

91
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:05,200
I'll have my sunglasses. Yeah.
It's a weird thing. Sunglasses.

92
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,950
That's a hilarious quote by Dana
though. Yeah. Hilarious. Hilarious.

93
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,180
And especially considering how much money
he's losing on this. Can you imagine?

94
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,740
Can you imagine, you know, call
that close. We were like, what?

95
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,850
What keeps happening and keeps happening?
It keeps happening.

96
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Does it tap into this Mac Times? It's
happened a bunch of times. Just one lemon.

97
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:29,530
May God like you morons.
I'm trying to do your favor.

98
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,570
Who was the most recent
one where that happened?

99
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,070
Where cyborg stepped in last
minute. This close. The last one.

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,260
Cyborg stepped in. Who? Oh, that
was Max Holloway Holloway Hallway.

101
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,230
But then there was the Ferguson one with
Khabib or could bebes liver shut down.

102
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:47,020
They had to take him to the
fucking hospital. It was a bummer.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,310
That was a bummer because this happened
a ton of times. It was the worst one.

104
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:55,990
Jon Jones do UFC 200
DC mayor the the right,

105
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:59,060
literally the day before.
You're like, what?

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,210
But I wonder if that's better for
the UFC shitty business either way,

107
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,160
but is it better for
the UFC because people,

108
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:06,380
we've always seen the hype
where a bought in. Yeah,

109
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,980
and then like the next day like what
the f where's John like, oh yeah.

110
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,520
You didn't hear that. Like does that
help them more or does this week yet?

111
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,070
Lisa can promote a little
bit with Max Holloway,

112
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,730
you could promote a little bit with Max
Holloway and it's an interesting fight.

113
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,860
It's a very interesting fight.
Yeah.

114
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:24,620
There's a lot of those men
that happen to you. Like what?

115
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,410
Which one was the Jon Jones DC one.
You'll see 200 and that will,

116
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:34,120
what was the thing that John did? Which
one was that? Remember that a coq one B,

117
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,270
I think there was a coke. Coke was,
he goes, this was Dick Pills. Oh,

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,700
you remember the, he was like, hey, we
got strip up, pull them from the car.

119
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,730
And then DC fought dash in Silva. That's
right on like today's rounders, Anderson.

120
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,840
And then DC didn't when he fans that
cause he just Kinda, yeah. Yeah.

121
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:53,450
He just wears fly. He just
wrestled him in his, whatever.

122
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,330
It's still one the front kicked him in
the gut too. And I think you heard him.

123
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,164
Yeah.

124
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,520
Yeah.
