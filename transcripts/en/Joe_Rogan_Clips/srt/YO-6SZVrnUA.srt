1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,490
but then the same guy will call
mission when he was like, okay,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,290
give me one for my private collection.

4
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:11,810
And so that's where they would have all
the way more explicit stuff. Yeah. They,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,950
I mean they didn't have
pornography back then,

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,150
so they must have been beaten
off to paintings and stuff.
It had to be, yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,050
I mean had to be thought of as being
arousal inducing. So much so that,

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
what was it during the Victorian
era where they put legs of tables,

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,640
they would put dresses on them.
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:32,990
They would wrap it the legs of the
tables because you know they are legs,

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,600
they are Bayer. They may give you
ideas, which I don't know about you man,

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,510
but you know, look at the leg of the
that that really doesn't wait for me.

13
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:43,730
So the lemon law, something to it
where people got so horny, right.

14
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,970
The table leg, smooth skin.
But that's what you're doing.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,440
You really have problems.
Right.

16
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:54,360
When you look at the leg of a table and
you got all excited, he's like, man, yeah,

17
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:58,830
that's not good. No, you'll revisit your
life choice. That's up until that point.

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,370
It's fascinating to see. People must've
agreed to that too. What's up Jamie?

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,480
I just looked it up.
It says it,

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
that it originates from a satire
that was written and people,

21
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,670
I guess took it as truth, so it's
not real. Yeah, I supposedly not,

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,840
but they definitely did cover the lens.
I think they did,

23
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:15,120
but the reason why this exaggerated,

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,820
since he was poking fun at Americans
that did something like that,

25
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,160
I'll come up this point of the meat.
The meat is too cool.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,270
That's prosperous farmhouse parlor
in 1900 and that has it covered.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,000
But this is 19 hundreds,
right? This is, um,

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,980
the Victorian era is when
they did this. Oh wait. Okay.

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,230
1839, an Englishman wrote
a satire of American tour.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,950
He wrote the American propensity to
use the word limb and place of leg,

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,390
though he says the English two a two.

32
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:45,610
Then he says that he visited a boarding
school, young ladies, New York Strip, we,

33
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:48,330
sorry,
square piano forte with four limbs.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,370
Their mistress of the establishment had
dressed all these four limbs in modest

35
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,740
trousers with frills
at the bottom of them.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,350
He's exaggerating or not subjects,
uh,

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,970
is exaggerating or not
subject to speculation.

38
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:07,090
He certainly poking fun or
whether whether Mur, Mur, Mur,

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,250
Yat Maryat is exaggerating or
not is subject to speculation.

40
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,890
He is certainly poking fun and Americans.

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,010
But I can attest that having
page to dozens of books
showing old black and white

42
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,410
piano photos of Victorian
Interior as I saw,

43
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:24,411
not one example of a table piano or any
other piece of furniture with skirts

44
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,210
around the individual legs.
That's interesting. Boom.

45
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,230
I liked the legend so much back there.
Hadn't you always heard that?

46
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,090
I thought that from professors.

47
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,430
I remember hearing that from a history
professor. I'm old off the, you know,

48
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,100
between boring history and a fan
legend. Are we signing? Yeah.

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,330
I would like to think that people
were way more stupid than they were.

50
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,000
It makes me feel good about
this error. Exactly. We're
in now. Yeah. You'd be this.

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,980
Um, I mean, you look at the
dresses that people had to wear,

52
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,720
you know that when all the
way down to the ground,

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,650
I mean this is not really much different
than what we see in the Middle East.

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,230
It's, it's very simple. I mean,
what we see in the Middle East,

55
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,280
they have to cover their face.

56
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,120
They hit job and the whole deal and
the headscarves and that's a little,

57
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,930
little more extreme, but not much.
Yeah. I mean they, they wore shit.

58
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,550
They went all the way to the ground.

59
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:17,440
If you showed any ankle would lose their
mind. It's an ankle. I crazy. Yeah.

60
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,680
Well, you know, reputation does it. Yeah.

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,150
I wonder if they were more
hypersexualized than we are. I bet not.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,680
I bet because of porn we're probably
more hypersexualized. Right. There's,

63
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,670
I think different arguments there because
some people say the more you write,

64
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,880
the rest of the more than
you're going to obsess with it.

65
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:38,210
So that's all you think about all day.
[inaudible]

66
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,330
he's less likely to obsessed.
Then again,

67
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,450
there are vaults of people are so
addicted to Internet porn that,

68
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:47,140
I don't know if that idea works,
but you know, that's the, well,

69
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,830
Internet porn is the problem that an
airport is, the availability is this.

70
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,490
You don't even have to go some way.

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,370
At least back in the day when you had
VHS tapes or DVDs or something like that,

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,160
you had to go to a store,
you had to buy him,

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,520
he had to put them into the TV at a sit
back and get the remote control. Yeah.

74
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,830
There's a process. There was work
involved minors to have minor work,

75
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,210
right? Yes. Now it's just far
too easy as far as, I mean,

76
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:17,260
how many people that work that
have jobs go into the bathroom,

77
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,110
locked the door and beat off.
That's,

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,530
there's a lot of people listening right
now but are doing exactly that in that

79
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,340
right now. You're beaten off right
now. Stop it. Go back to work.

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,980
Jesus is watching. That's what I hear.
Yeah. Um, it's just, it's interesting,

81
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,110
I guess if you have to think about it.

82
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:39,670
Like they were trying to control those
people and trying to control their urges

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,330
because it was beneficial to society.
It was beneficial to society that,

84
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:47,290
that these people needed to do their
fair share and get to work and they

85
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,100
couldn't just be staring at
legs all day and, you know,

86
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,140
engaging in an impure thoughts and, but
you know, that's the, that's the problem.

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,680
We any kind of probation,

88
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,420
it's completely misunderstanding of the
human mind works is you do not say no to

89
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:04,010
seeing says you are not
going to do it is yep.

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,960
Guaranteeing that people
are going to obsessed with
this. Right. It doesn't work.

91
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,110
There's um,

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,550
how's that sad story that I heard
was that I thought he was hilarious.

93
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,610
I can't remember where it already, but
like guy goes to a zen master saying, Hey,

94
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:19,900
I'm only going to be called at peace
and happy. I want to be just like you.

95
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:24,130
What do I need to do? Said master
says, okay, just for the next 24 hours.

96
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,660
Don't think about monkeys,
guys like Walton keys. Never
flipped about monkeys. Him.

97
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,470
I was that gonna make me a light and
send my myself. Dot. Shut up. Go Away.

98
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,300
Come back in 24 hours. Don't
think about monkeys. Okay. Like,

99
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,400
okay well be cutting a light and he's
going to be at peace of gay cause all I

100
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:40,780
have to do is not think about monkeys.

101
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:44,610
And of course the next 24 hours become
the most monkey field thou shall slide.

102
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:49,250
Cause that's the one he got to think
about. Right? Floyd being the bore,

103
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,200
you make sense and get taboo.
The boy,

104
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,340
you've guaranteed that people that
are to obsessed with it. Yeah,

105
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,490
it's a like he didn't
like drinking at 21 in us.

106
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,280
Right?
It's like growing up,

107
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,970
I don't even know if there was an age
in Italy where you're supposed to not

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,030
drink but is not that glamorous.
You know,

109
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,520
is what your grandparents have for
lunch and you know where you are,

110
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:14,180
maybe 60 year old that you want to try
a little wine and they give you a tiny

111
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:17,730
beat saying if you have a little more,
you've got a headache. So Jessica,

112
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,630
and then one day you would do got a little
more, you got a headache and you go,

113
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,620
oh shit, you're right. Okay. Yeah,

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,400
and you kind of learn how to drink rather
than being like, oh wait, God awake,

115
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,150
cool. Now we got all of these bulls and
people drink. Throw up all over done.

116
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,150
Sales is like, touch hasn't got a
hose. Why are you dwindle? Yeah.

117
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,630
I think there's definitely a healthier
attitudes than Americans' attitudes about

118
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,200
alcohol,
but also like wine is a good way to start.

119
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,670
Like you start off a kid with whiskey
shit, that's not the way to start.

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,050
Yeah.

121
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,830
One of my first times I ever got drunk
was on Jack Daniels and took years for me

122
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,200
to smell Jack.
Daniel's not want to throw up.

123
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,470
I'm sure he gets those
triggers in your head.

124
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:00,750
We smell it like Jagermeister. I
used to smell Jaeger mine. It's like,

125
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,090
and just be like,
Yep.

126
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,760
It's just think about just
getting violently ill.

127
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,430
Your body's trying to purge it from
your system so you don't die yet.

128
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,020
It's to to hide it from kids and
tell them it's that, that it's taboo,

129
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,270
but then you drank it. Yeah.
And then they're like, oh,

130
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,780
can't wait until these fucking people
can't tell me what to do anymore to help

131
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,940
get myself a nice cold glass of whiskey.

132
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:32,960
Yeah.
