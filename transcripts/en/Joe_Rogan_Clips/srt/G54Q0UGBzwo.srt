1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
So back to Anderson though.
Yeah,

2
00:00:01,391 --> 00:00:06,391
so my book ends with him are that first
leave and fight and then shattering his

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:10,200
leg, which I was in the front row
for which you didn't even believe it.

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:13,620
If it didn't make sense to see a leg
move like that, you're like, I don't,

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,320
I don't get it. It looked like
somebody filled up a sock with,

6
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,880
with pebbles and just like look at
something and it's like it doesn't,

7
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:25,650
it didn't make sense and it was so gross.
But in the interim,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,020
seeing that first Chelsea
on and fight when he was,

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,070
I mean he won 400 half rounds checks
on it. He almost won the title.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,960
And then to kit that, I mean it
was such a legendary sports thing,

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,700
not UFC,
but sports thing.

12
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,220
How this guy's down like
crazy in a title fight.

13
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:50,221
A guy who's never been tested was
finally tested and was losing.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,270
It was over. This guy could, Chael Sonnen
was beating him. He figured him out.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,580
And then to get that triangle with what,
40 seconds left, two minutes left over.

16
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,414
It was,

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,040
but I remember what's so
clear and indelible in my
head is afterwards we're at

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:09,120
the entrance, everyone's cleared out of
the stadium. We're at the entrance to the,

19
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,140
um, to the, under the, you know, the caves
of the, of the stadium, wherever it was.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,300
And it's me, you, I think Dana, uh,

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,020
Randy was there and we're all talking.

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,060
And then every once in a while somebody's
mind would go to that fight and you'd

23
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:25,380
just see him go like, yeah, yeah, I
think the weather's pretty nice here.

24
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,580
And then you see someone go like,
like,

25
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:34,460
you couldn't believe it. I remember seeing
Randy couture, dude. Like, I'm like,

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,303
why do this?

27
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,200
Four minutes into the fight grabs a
hold of it or four rounds in the fight,

28
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,034
grabs a hold of it,

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,690
syncs up the triangle and gets a triangle
armbar combination and taps him. Wow.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,240
And this is an Anderson
came into that fight,

31
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:53,800
injured and her Anderson had a fucked
up rib entering into that fight.

32
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,690
And a lot of people thought
he should have pulled out.

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,760
What kind of weird edit is this role?
The blurriness all.

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,640
He's strange fan and it was nuts.
It was nuts for that guy.

35
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,980
He'll come and see how he's holding
his side and the moat, the first,

36
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,310
that was the first trash talk
fight ever remember to Oh,

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,220
Chels son and people forget how good
he was talking. Shit. He was the best,

38
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,720
the best. He was the best. When I come in,
when Anderson Silva walks into the ring,

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,220
you could hear a mouse piston on cotton.
When I walk in,

40
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:25,720
it's thunder. I mean, the
problems he would cut. Yeah,

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,290
we're just the APP that hadn't been
done yet. Now. Not a lot. Well,

42
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,220
Conor Mcgregor Prob,
you know, it's arguable.

43
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:38,110
The chill was even better than Conor,
but if you take time period into accounts,

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,250
no one was doing right.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,510
He was the first and he was building up
fights as a heel for the first time ever.

46
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,300
[inaudible] and brought
them in a little bit later.
