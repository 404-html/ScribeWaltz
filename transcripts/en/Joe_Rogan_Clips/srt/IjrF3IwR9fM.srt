1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,320
The only one who's getting get
a rematch on the card is Yolana.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,570
She deserves it after,
after defendant,

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:13,560
how that many times you hit murked
in that first round. I think she's,

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,470
that qualifies for an immediate rematch.
Well,

6
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:18,210
I think that's where the
big money is for sure.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,290
I mean people are going to want to see
that. That's a big fight because when,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,210
when you want to walk down to the
pop from the audience was immense.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,460
She's finally become like this star that
they've been putting all this promotion,

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,760
the door, she's winning fights. She was
kind of thriving in it a little most.

11
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,500
A little too much. Which is one of
the reasons can should loss. Yeah.

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,620
The little bit of the Rhonda Syndrome,

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:43,170
they're little bit why don't
know if it's that, but you know,

14
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,500
she was definitely doing a lot of
press and he learns a lot of fucking

15
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,600
tremendous amount of pressure.
But I'll tell you what, dude,

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,500
when she was talking to the camera and
she was talking to rose and she's like,

17
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:55,980
the Boogie woman coming for you,
the book you woman come in for you.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,770
I kept fucking, we scared. I was legit.

19
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,270
The greatest like Promo of all
time. I was like, Boogie woman.

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:08,271
What the fuck did you see her at looking
at rose in her eyes like staring into

21
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,360
your soul and she's talking about kinds
of crazy shit. I'm going to fuck you up.

22
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:15,540
I'm going to hurt you.
And rose is saying the Lord's prayer.

23
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,470
It's some demonic shit. I was like, why?
I asked rose there what what he's saying?

24
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,120
She's like, I was saying the Lord's
prayer and she didn't even look at you.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,130
Anybody. She wouldn't look okay. I was
like, all right. I'm like, wow, this is

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,550
easy to say. In retrospect. I knew that
something special was going to happen.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,460
Hell No. I thought real. I was
like, Rosen. He see a psychiatrist.

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,670
That's why when I saw that way and I'm
like, we need to get rose some help,

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,270
pace up forever. I'm like, you know
what? We need some professional help.

30
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,690
But after the fact, knowing the
result that rose won by knockout,

31
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:48,210
it makes it even all the more profound.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,510
Now you're gonna see motherfuckers just
reciting the lawyers you want to talk

33
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,420
about. I hope the UFC
realizes, and I think they do.

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,540
That's a fucking star. That's what
those real talk. Hell yeah. Boy.

35
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,170
Amino real stars. The look, she's a
skinny five years old. She's got the look.

36
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,710
She shaves her head.
She's a beautiful stranger saying,

37
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:09,910
look is so in writing that 11 Lucas.

38
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:14,720
So she's 12 she's 12 she's 11.0 she's,

39
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,550
yeah.
And she's like a genuinely good person.

40
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,200
Like when she was talking after the fight,
she's like,

41
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,810
just chomp didn't just be
nice to each other. Here's
the thing, Jill, that's real.

42
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:26,840
Coming from her. The fans gravitate
towards that nice person. Oh yeah, sure.

43
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,760
When do you look like her? And you
weigh 115 pounds. You're a woman.

44
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:34,630
You fuck up boogie woman. Yeah. But
you wouldn't maybe. Yeah, I hope so.

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,780
Yeah, man. If, if she doesn't become as
big as stars, any other woman in MMA,

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,950
I would be stunned. Damn. That would be,

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,540
I liked that position because she's a
good person, man. She's worked hard.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,690
Misha Tate got some star out of it.

49
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,920
Rhonda clearly got the biggest right
for sure. Rhonda got the biggest by far.

50
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:56,470
She was the biggest, like it
was timing her opponents. Yeah.

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,160
Everybody's heard and domination or sure.

52
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,380
Opponents just worn on our
level until they were right.

53
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,650
So until she fought Holly,
they weren't really on our level.

54
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,950
And she also had this new thing,

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,820
which was the female ass kicker,
this thing that didn't exist before.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,900
So in that way,

57
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,050
like one of the most unique athletes
ever did for sure besides Ali and,

58
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,700
uh, who's the coal miner's
daughter? Christy Martin.

59
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:26,410
Remember Christy Martin from back in the
old Tyson fights fight on the undercard,

60
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,910
the coal miner's daughter. Remember
that? I'm sure. But the pioneers,

61
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,750
but it's different. Yeah. Not that much.

62
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,120
Like Laila Ali got few
people paying attention.

63
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,970
You better be able to bus your dad's
Mohammad Ali Frat guy. Fuck that man.

64
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:42,340
That's a shoe in. Yeah, man. But
being George Lucas, his daughter,

65
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:46,660
like you're going to be, you know in Star
Wars refluxing yeah, but it just never,

66
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,480
it never hit the levels that
it hit with Rhonda. Right.

67
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,660
But I think that it's possible that rose
could be the biggest star in MMA today.

68
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,110
I've really think so.

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,060
I don't think anyone's ever going
to be a Rhonda because that was a,

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,960
the first one. You know, it
was crazy. Yeah, I agree.

71
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,170
But rose could be gigantic.
I mean, I really think she,

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,110
I mean who knows if she could be as big
as Rhonda, but she could be gigantic.

73
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,170
I really think so. Yeah. I liked
that. She's true to herself.

74
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,660
She's fucking nobody out to do.
She does wild shit.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,310
She throws up close second arm bars.
I mean she, she does wild shit.

76
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,730
That fucking karate hottie fight, which
he had kicked her and choked her out.

77
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,950
Dude, she's a little savage. She
keeps on your back. Ooh. That,

78
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:29,410
that division is kind of stacked though.
Like you want to do a lot of people.

79
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,440
But for rose, there's a lot of
tough competition is very tough.

80
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,750
Competition is tough
competition standing up too.

81
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,660
There's a lot of good strikers in that
division. That's case scenario though.

82
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:40,150
Especially for the EOC N rose,
cause I'm, you know rose,

83
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,850
my favorite fighter in that
division come from Denver.

84
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,770
But you know that that division for her
to defend it and build a star like the

85
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:51,450
head and Yolanda, that's when you get a
star. But if that belts circulating, it's,

86
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,000
we can't, the public doesn't gravitate
towards that. We don't like that.

87
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,230
And you know she's likely going to have
to fight Karolina who went five hard

88
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,100
rounds with you,
Ana and three rounds with her.

89
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,160
Was it three or five rounds with her?
What? She wanted a decision three, right?

90
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,470
I think it was three.
There's just a Andraj Jess gone drive.

91
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:14,320
She's a model like Dasia what? Jessica
and draws beat the shit out of car.

92
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,000
You get a yeah, she beat the brakes off
out of her. That was the man handling.

93
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,700
Nope. Nope. No offense will man handling.

94
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,630
She will manhandled her.
She strong strong arms.

95
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:32,490
She's slightly rushed. She
smashed the hulk, smashed.
She straight up. Hulk smash.

96
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:37,000
She's straight up, straight up.
I was like, Jesus Christ, man.

97
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,630
I've seen the ass whooping like that's
in cyber. Got Ahold of some bitch.

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,400
Okay.
