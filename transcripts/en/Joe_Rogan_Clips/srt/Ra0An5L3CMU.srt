1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,490
Uh, so it's really, it's an insane form,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,730
insane form of science denialism that
I've spent 25 years fighting and I'm not

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,130
sure if I'm any closer
to winning the battle.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,190
It's the only form of science and now
isn't, it's culturally acceptable.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,730
It's culturally acceptable because it,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,590
it defines people in a way that makes
them feel like animals or makes them feel

7
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:23,070
cheap or it makes them feel like
they're prostitutes, you know, makes it,

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,560
makes people feel like they're
prostitutes. And interestingly,

9
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:29,610
it comes a lot more for this particular
form of size than eyes and from the left.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,940
This is why a lot of a lot of
people will write me and say, well,

11
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,150
why do you seem to be critiquing a lot
more people on the left and the right

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,180
that that's not,
that's not showing my political colors.

13
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,830
It's simply because the ecosystem that
I navigate in, which is called academia,

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,000
it just so happens that most of the bs
comes from the left because the academia

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,910
is laden with leftists.
Yeah.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,890
So it's not so much that I
give a free pass to the right.

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,280
When you have a right wing
senator who denies evolution,

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,060
I'm the first to also critique him.

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,720
But the reality is when
it comes to human nature,

20
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:04,380
it's really the leftists who are denying
the biological basis of our human

21
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:04,950
nature.

22
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,420
Why do you think that this science
denialism is so prevalent on the last,

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,700
on the left when it comes to gender?

24
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,730
Because gender seems
to be the battleground.

25
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,340
It seems to be the battleground even in
terms of transgender, right? Uh, but the,

26
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:21,750
the,
the battleground of gender,

27
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:26,751
whether it's the gender pay gap or
whether it's traditional gender roles,

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,090
this seems to be where science denialism
it lives on the left in the more,

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,303
you know,
like

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,730
what I always grew up
thinking about the left,

31
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,700
the left was always more open minded.

32
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,390
They were supposed to be the more educated
and they were supposed to be the more

33
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:51,340
compassionate people. So
something happened and I
don't know when it happened,

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,270
but somewhere along the line,
this science denialism and then this,

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,150
for whatever reason, this idea
that if it shows any differences,

36
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,750
if there's any statistics or any data
that shows differences between the men and

37
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,610
the women,
that this is somehow,

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,720
this is somehow an example of
sexism or patriarchal tyranny,

39
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,500
or there's a reason for
this that's negative. So I,

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,090
I think the reason is actually quite,
quite simple. At the right wing,

41
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:26,990
folks who deny science,
it's typically for religious,

42
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,780
ideological reasons or
for industry, right? So,

43
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,810
so there is some pet ideology that is
threatening me and therefore I'm going to

44
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,900
deny science, right? This exact same
thing is happening with the left.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,550
They also have been parasitized by a
quasi religion. It's called progressivism.

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,930
Okay. And I say progressivism
in quotes, right? Uh, you know,

47
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,610
equality of outcomes and all
the rest of the garbage, right?

48
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,140
And therefore to the extent that
evolutionary theory in general,

49
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,170
but evolutionary psychology in particular
is a threat to my quasi religion than

50
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,790
I will reject it.

51
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,030
This is why evolution deniers tend to
be on the right and evolution psychology

52
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:10,330
than hires tend to be on the left. They've
both been parasitized by religions.

53
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,530
They're just different religions that,
so that's a fascinating way to look at it,

54
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,440
that progressivism is in
fact some sort of religion.

55
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,590
And it makes sense if you're looking
at the science denialism aspect of it,

56
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:24,580
because you're not looking at it in
terms of an objective analysis of all the

57
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,010
facts and the data that's in front of you.
You're saying,

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,740
what fits this construct?

59
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,280
What fits this pattern of behavior
that I've chosen to adopt,

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,240
and then I have to show all the people
that are around me exactly like you

61
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,590
accused Sean Carroll of doing,

62
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,300
adopting this instead of looking
at the actual facts of this case.

63
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,300
Postmodernism, I think. Did you have, you
had the grievance studies folks, right?

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,950
Fantastic. Peter Boghossian. Yeah.
