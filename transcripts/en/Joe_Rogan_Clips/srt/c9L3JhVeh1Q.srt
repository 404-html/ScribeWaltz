1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,410
Which is, I mean, this is a controversial
thing to say, and I've, I got in trouble,

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,800
or one of my podcast guests, Gavin
de Becker, uh, the security, uh,

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,550
Guru, uh, got in trouble on my
podcast talking about the primacy of,

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,920
of intuition here.
Like,

5
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:20,921
like our intuitions are actually really
good for detecting something that makes

6
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:25,530
us uncomfortable about another
person, right? And this is,

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,060
this becomes politically incorrect, really
fast, right? Because it's like, you know,

8
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:34,920
if you see a guy on an elevator who
makes you uncomfortable, you know,

9
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:39,270
Gavin's advice. And I think, I think
the real st advice is just don't get on.

10
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:43,110
But there are many people who get on just
because they want to prove they're not

11
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:46,280
racist, right. Or they're not,
you know, it's like, and, and, uh,

12
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,750
I actually know someone who was
in a situation like that, uh,

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,490
and it didn't work out
well. And so, I mean,

14
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,660
intuition is bad for so many things.
We,

15
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:59,610
we have terrible intuitions for
statistics and Britain probability theory.

16
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:02,380
And it's like where we're reliably,
you know,

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,890
whole careers and Nobel prizes have
been won on, you know, the people like,

18
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,270
you know,
Danny Conoman have,

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,460
have shown us how, it's not only
that our intuitions are bad for,

20
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:18,270
for these judgments, but the reliably
bad, and we can understand there's this,

21
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,190
there's a structure to how bad they are.

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,700
But for judging people who are dangerous,

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,490
you know, who give us the, who makes,

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,590
who make the hair stand up on the
back of our neck for reasons we can't

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,390
understand, um, you know,
for where the eye contact was
wrong or the, or the, or the,

26
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,710
just the, the way they will,
you know, I mean, just like a,

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,620
what's called a witness check,
you know,

28
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:45,240
like someone comes up to you and
engages you and then they look to,

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,260
they just kinda look to check for
witnesses right now. Like, people don't,

30
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,250
aren't aware that that's even a thing,
right?

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
But when like that body language
is very salient to us and,

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,780
and, uh, there, there are hundreds
of things like that, that, that, um,

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,060
we immediately fee that prompt,
you know, an intuitive response.

34
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,700
And these are intuitions that are,
you know,

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,380
from a self defense point of view are
worth listening to because I like the

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,670
worst case scenario is you wind up being a
little rude. They're like, sorry, I'm, I,

37
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,590
you know, I can't talk.
But, um, uh, people are,

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,130
you know,

39
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,130
people are very dogmatically being kind
of trained to ignore those kinds of,

40
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,860
those kinds of intuitions. And what do
you think those intuitions are? Like,

41
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,650
what do you think intuitions are like
when you meet someone, you go, Whoa,

42
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:38,430
this person feels dangerous. Like
what is that, what's happening? Well,

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,000
there's a lot, you know, the gays
detection is a big one. I mean, we,

44
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,870
and what people do with their eyes is a,
is a,

45
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,640
is a major variable in just
how we feel that, you know,

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,730
the relationship is going.
Um,

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,450
but it's,
uh,

48
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,130
and there's their micro expressions that
we notice in people that were not aware

49
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,770
of noticing. You know, like,
it's just, there's the, this is,

50
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,450
this is not well understood.
Uh,

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,790
and we're bad judges of whether someone
is telling the truth. I mean this,

52
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,280
this has been fairly well studied.
I mean, there are people who,

53
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,600
even people that work for the FBI or not,
you know,

54
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,580
much better than chance and
detecting whether somebody is lying.

55
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,770
But there's just,
we get so much information by,

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,340
you know,

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,340
body language and being in somebody's
presence and we get it so fast that it's,

58
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,200
um, again, and it there whether
we understand it or not,

59
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,970
there are evolutionary reasons
why this is so, I mean, if,

60
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,440
if we've evolved for
anything as social primates,

61
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,890
we have evolved to detect stuff that
just is a precursor to violent intent in

62
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,900
others.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,320
I think it's just gaze or do you think
you can sense the energy of someone?

64
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,121
There's certain,
well,

65
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,170
the movements that people
make when they're thinking
about hitting him. Oh yeah,

66
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,790
yeah, yeah. A certain like there's
like a twitchiness to them.

67
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,150
I got while pulled back like
almost like a spring or a bow.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,210
There's like a feeling you get around
people that are looking to hit people.

69
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,270
Yeah. Well, there's the, but again, all of
that still vision, but there's, you know,

70
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,880
I mean, who knows where it detecting
pheromones, where we could,

71
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,000
we could be detecting people's
level of, of stress. I mean,

72
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,960
just how tuned up they are.
Um, but, and this goes beyond,

73
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,950
this is beyond just physical
violence. This is just, you know,

74
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,720
detecting psychopaths who are, who are
manipulative. I mean, just detecting,

75
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,180
I mean there, there are ways to spot
people line, uh, you know, I mean,

76
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:38,080
just, you know, they're,
they're tells like, you know,
too much information, you know,

77
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,590
like a pit people who are giving
you superfluous is a peripheral,

78
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,600
was information, uh, as an overcorrection.

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,280
And they're anticipating that
you're going to doubt their story.

80
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,210
And so they're filling in blanks that
you don't even need filled in. Right.

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,160
And it, and it's there sort of patterns
to, to sort of tee to that. But,

82
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,470
uh, and again, we, we,

83
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,520
we pick up on a lot of this stuff
without consciously being aware of what's

84
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,001
going on.

85
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,450
We just know that that's like not a
person I want to spend any more time with.

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,670
Right. Uh, but I, you know,

87
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,880
so there may be more of a literature
on this than I know about,

88
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:16,510
but a lot of this is not well understood.

89
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:21,040
And I may have people like Paul Ekman have
done a lot of stuff on Mike, you know,

90
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,770
micro expressions.
Um,

91
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,460
I mean that goes back probably
30 years at this point. And Yeah,

92
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,260
there are people who are outliers who
are great at detecting micro expressions

93
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:35,770
where they really, they really
just understand what's going on,

94
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:39,010
but it's not a w and an
AI eventually will be,

95
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,060
if it is not there already, we'll be
much better than we are doing this.

96
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:46,150
I'm so scared of that service
here to them getting that wrong.

97
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,090
Micro expressions are funny because
they remind me of microaggressions,

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,280
which is one of the,

99
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,690
one of the weirder social justice warrior
things like w things that used to be

100
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,940
just slights where someone was just
like slightly rude, not, not even slice,

101
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,220
just like, where do you come from? Right.
Space space of that accent. They're like,

102
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,280
oh, like what? So it away
from where your parents from.
