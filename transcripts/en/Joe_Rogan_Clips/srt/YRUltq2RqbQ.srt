1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,000
He was like way deep in the TAC.
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,530
Nice uppercut by canal.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,280
He was definitely like a big check tax
trouble before we got bailed out with a

4
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:16,510
fight in the past. Do you
think they reimagine? I think
the rematch they should.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,823
Why not?

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,220
I think Connor would have to beat somebody
good in a boxing match and he would

7
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:27,220
also have to have a real training camp,
I think.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,280
I think boxing's over for
Connor. Oh, I don't think so.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,460
That is one more fight like that cause
people will buy it kind of went to the

10
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:37,120
10th round. He got fatigued it there's
still a motive for people to buy it. Yeah.

11
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,550
I mean look,
he,

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,910
he went the very first fight against the
greatest hour and so many of you didn't

13
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,750
like to bag. You're right. Yeah, you're
right. You're right. There's that too.

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,200
But the thing is if
there's a legit big fight,

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,230
like say if Canelo Alvarez steps up
and says that he wants to fight Conor

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,750
Mcgregor, Conor, I'll do it.

17
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,110
He might be a smart,

18
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,500
I think Connor made me realize
you've got to specialize,

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,870
but actually you can't do both.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,690
Especially the difference
between Canelo and Floyd.

21
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:12,340
Floyd was just a brilliant boxer.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,230
Canelo is a murderous puncher and
he'll fuck you up. He'll hurt.

23
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,500
There's also a promotional difference
to Kyron. Flood are pretty much,

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,270
they're very similar guys,

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,970
and they both understood what
they were doing promotion wise.

26
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,840
I don't know if Canelo is that guy.
Well, he's not gonna promote it that way,

27
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:33,540
but he's got, oh, look that up
or cut. That's his genius. It's,

28
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,770
he's got the support of the American
people love again versus Mcgregor.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,940
Okay.

30
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,540
Ooh, look at that upper cut. I don't
know if Mcgregor would take that fight.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,573
No,
that sounded good.

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,540
Fight for him either neither Canelo
or Lufkin's a good fight for him.

33
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,300
It's a terrible fight for him. Those guys
are different. They're, they're, they're,

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,470
they're this, you know, like,
look at the way these guys fight.

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,540
[inaudible].
