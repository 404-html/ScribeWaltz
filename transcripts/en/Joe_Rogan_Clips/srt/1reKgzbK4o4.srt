1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,560
You plan out your future?
I do. So I'm, I'm very go.

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:09,330
So I had that Accountability Mirror, but
I also plan on all my small, big time,

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,710
you know, medium goals, all these
things that have to do in life. Um,

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,650
I'm a big planner. I'm a
big planner, so you know,

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:20,640
right now I'm going back to scratch.
So I'm trying to be wild land firefighter,

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,660
you know, I did that for a couple of
seasons. And you going do that now? Yeah.

7
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:27,990
So I did it for, I did it
for two, not full season but,
but, but two half seasons.

8
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,700
So this year was my second year
doing it. I had to, I had to um,

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,010
stop about two months before it ended
because this book to start promoting the

10
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,550
book and started finishing the book up.

11
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:41,190
But I've been doing an opportunity
that's some fucking work, man.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,260
Those fucking guys get after it made
you decide to do that. The work,

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:46,801
you know,

14
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:51,480
like when your hand stopped becoming
really callused it's time to get back to

15
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:55,620
work. You know, like I retired from the
military. I did 21 years in the military.

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,290
The military was my life. Loved everything
about it, the discipline of it. Um,

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,340
there's some about going back in the,
in the money you make is nil.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,940
It's not about the money at all.
It's just about the hard work.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,370
I've always been looking for those people,
like those guys.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,760
Like you're out there digging
a three mile fire line,

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,630
literally a three mile fireline you're
cutting down, he's fucking shoes,

22
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,130
ash trees to dig his fire line and the
fire line, it's like 20 to 18 inches,

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,480
eh, for, for three miles. And you got
like fucking 12 people digging this shit.

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,100
And I'm either thinking,
man,

25
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,010
this is some of the hardest
fucking work I've done in my life.

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,310
And it's that challenge that you can't
find sometimes by going to the gym or by

27
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,830
running, you know, a hundred mile race
if that, if that new challenge of like,

28
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,750
hey and you get done digging, all
right, you've worked 17 hours, 16,

29
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,980
17 hours, you get your fucking
little fucking sleeping mat out,

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,270
shack down, boom, right down the floor
right there on the ground, get up,

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,330
dig some more. You know, it'd
be out there two or three weeks.

32
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,300
Sometimes man has doing that shit and
there's great satisfaction in the kind of

33
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:05,250
work that you do out there. No one's
watching. No one gives a fuck. It's hard,

34
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:09,000
dangerous fucking work. And you know
you're doing it to help shit out man.

35
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,770
You know?
How did you get drawn into that?

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,240
So I got drawn into it
because I was always looking
for the next challenge and I

37
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:19,500
was like, Hey, what is there
after the military with like,
what the fuck is it man?

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,580
I'm 43 I'm getting back in shape.
You know,

39
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm fucking getting these health
issues for taking care of that.

40
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,800
I had and I started once again,
Google is amazing shit.

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,710
Hardcore fucking jobs. No, pretty
much, you know, hard, hard as fuck.

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,240
That's how I found the horse.
But the first race, you know,

43
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,620
hardest races in the world.

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,120
So basically I started to find this wild
land firefighters like what the fuck is

45
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:46,440
wild land firefighter? So I Google and I
start googling smoke jumpers. You know,

46
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:47,670
I'm like,
what the fuck these guys do?

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,010
What they jump out of planes and attack
small fires. Like that's the shit.

48
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,860
So I'm like, okay, okay. We could
put down a list and okay, hot shots.

49
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,860
It was a hot shot dude.
They go out but you know,

50
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:04,861
big fires and they dig fireline the I'm
like fuck [inaudible] I saw a video of

51
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,040
it. I'm like, that Shit looks
like it sucks is hot. You know,

52
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,920
there's limb know you're out, you're
on your own. I mean, you know,

53
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,870
you're out there on your own man,
just digging a fire line.

54
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,870
So that's kind of how I found it.
I'm always looking for the next challenge.

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,870
I'm never satisfied with, oh
I did that. Like, you know,

56
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,020
I became a seal. I was air force guy,
became a seal. I went to ranger school,

57
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,830
I tried out for Delta Force
twice. You know, like I'm,

58
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,330
I'm always looking for what is next.

59
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:35,920
Looking for those uncommon men and women,
uncommon people. Cause I'm trying to,

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,270
I'm trying to grow, I'm trying to
grow. And a lot of times, you know,

61
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,270
you won't be the only person that's making
yourself grow. You looking for those?

62
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:44,650
Cameron Hanes is those Joe Rogan,

63
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:48,250
those people who are like just different
people who understand what the fuck

64
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:52,150
you're saying because a lot of things
I have to say, I can't save them all.

65
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,270
I can't say them all.
You may not understand them.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,350
So I had to really find
a way to communicate with
people. So they don't think,

67
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:04,140
oh my God, like what? What'd you just say?
So these Cameron Hanes is these job boy,

68
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,910
these people get it. So I go to those
little, those little nucleus spots get,

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,680
get a little more straight to get little
more knowledge, get a little more tools,

70
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,990
take those tools with me, putting my
tool shed and I go off gown, you know,

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,500
down the road or on a new journey.
So that's what I do.

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,250
Well the proof is in the pudding. If
you're really doing woodland firefighting,

73
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,900
cause there's no glory in that. No
Sir. No, there's no fame. There's no,

74
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:33,340
there's no one taking pictures of, you
know, and that paycheck is small. So

75
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,910
I'm a fucking Mickey. You
want to eat today? Wow. Yeah,

76
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,631
it's,
there's,

77
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:43,420
there's nothing involved in that
manner and they worked their ass off,

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,430
but you're just doing it as a challenge.

79
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,560
That's it does they freak
out when you're there?

80
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,630
You know what I think they're wondering
why is a 43 year old retired man?

81
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,930
You know, all this stuff you've
done. Why are you out here?

82
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,810
And I explained it to him. I'm out
here. I'm out here to, you know, to,

83
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,490
to learn from you all to grow.

84
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,990
And also to never forget
where I came from. You know,

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
that's where it starts.

86
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,220
It's that mentality of I'm going to pick
up that fucking Pulaski and I'm going

87
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,640
to dig this fucking fire
line for three demos.

88
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,900
That's that mentality I never
want to lose. I never want
to get so nice where it,

89
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,880
oh yeah, I did it, man. I
did it. I did it. I'm good.

90
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,170
That mentality of I'm going to pick up
that shovel and I'm willing to dig a

91
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,850
three mile line is there's some
about that mentality that I'm,

92
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,010
I'm ready to go to work at any time.
And that's what keeps me,

93
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,210
those are the sparks. Like, you know, I'll
look at motivation. There's just a spark.

94
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,450
It's like, it's like kindling.
You know how a big fire starts.

95
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,560
It starts with a little smoke.

96
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,730
It starts with a little cigarette
being thrown in the woods next.

97
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,600
He knew all California's fucking burn up.

98
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,420
That's what I've been doing my whole life
is I find these little sparks and once

99
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,130
that little thing takes off,
that's a, that's one hour of fuel.

100
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,720
Did you get tin are a fuel.

101
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,920
Then you can move that thing
to what 10,000 hour fuel.

102
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,150
These big logs and big trees that burned
for days and that's where you want to

103
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,000
bring that motivation.
That's what you want to bring that drive.

104
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,380
So if you have no kingly to Killeen is me
going out with these young guys saying,

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,450
Oh, I'm a fuck you're 43 it's a 20 year
old. Keep up with them that caming.

106
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,670
Now when I leave those young guys,

107
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,960
it has now become that 10 hour
fuel and now that 10,000 hour,

108
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,150
a few that I use throughout my whole life,
I use that term or whole life man.

109
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:33,680
Hey this summer at 43 you went
out there and you did that, man.

110
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,760
So you know you're not giving up
yet. You're not done yet. Not Today,

111
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,520
and not done today.
That's a crazy choice to make though.

112
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,320
Woodland firefighters a very interesting
choice. It is. It is. It's a nasty job,

113
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,710
man. Because again,
that's a proof of concept.

114
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,210
Like you're really just doing
just for the struggle. That's it.
