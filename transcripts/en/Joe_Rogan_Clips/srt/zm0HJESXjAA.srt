1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,840
They don't and you know, it's not
there either, you know. And in fact,

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:08,010
I've started to try and lobby doctors
to stop prescribing sleep and don't make

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:11,580
the mistake that that's me suggesting
prescribing sleeping pills,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,480
that's a separate straight sleeping
pills are associated with significantly

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,890
higher risk of death and cancer. And,
and I'm happy to speak about that too,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,230
was the one chapter in the
book that I think the um,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,070
the legal team of my publisher took,
took a very long, long look at,

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,580
but I think doctors,
to come back to your point,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,170
they on average only have about two
hours of sleep education in the medical

10
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:38,790
curriculum. So one third, two hours,
two hours, one third of their,

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,690
this podcast has been two hours.
Yeah, that's fucking crazy.

12
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,850
And so it's not frightening.
That's terrifying.

13
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,600
And I bet you probably have laid things
out better in this podcast than you

14
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:52,380
would get in those two hours of education.
I don't know about that,

15
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,780
but I think if I'll give you that credit,
if they could eat,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,630
if they could increase that, you know,
I'm desperately appealing for the senior,

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,060
it's a third of their patient's life,
but they only get two hours of education.

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,810
But the other problem is the
medical industry itself. By the way,

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,110
you know that residents,
that data,

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,140
you know at residents working a 30
hour shift of 460% more likely to make

21
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:21,240
diagnostic errors in the intensive care
unit relative to when they're working 16

22
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,400
hours.
If you have elective surgery,

23
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:26,910
you should ask your surgeon how much
sleep they've had in the past 24 hours.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
If they've had six hours of sleep or less,

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,820
you have a 170% increased risk
of a major surgical error,

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,370
such as sort of organ damage
or hemorrhaging relative
to that same surgeon if

27
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,960
they had been well rested.
And then the irony here by the way,

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,470
is that when a resident finishes,
a 30 hour shift,

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,050
gets back into their car to drive home,

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,410
there is a 168% increased risk that they
will get into a car accident because of

31
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:02,520
the under slip seat being ending up back
in the same emergency room where they

32
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,950
just came from. But now as a patient
too, from a car crash, you know, it's,

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,430
we need to radically rethink the
importance of sleep in education,

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,720
in, in business, in the
workplace and in medicine too.

35
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,640
Why do they do that to residents?
It's a fascinating story. Um,

36
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,430
so there's, there's a chapter
here in the book on this too.

37
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:28,431
It's a guy called William Holsted and
he set up the first resident surgical

38
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:33,621
program in the United States at Johns
Hopkins University and he was known for

39
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:38,370
being able to stay awake for these
heroic lengths of time, days on end.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,050
It was incredible,

41
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:45,051
like superhuman strength tuns out
that in later years after he died,

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,540
there was a dirty secret that he
was actually a cocaine addict.

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,060
That son of a bitch. And here's
what happened. It wasn't his fault.

44
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,980
Ellian is Korea.

45
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:00,670
He was examining the anesthetic
capacities of cocaine.

46
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:05,310
So you know, if, well I'm
not going to save, you know,
you may have heard from, uh,

47
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,490
perhaps colleagues that when you
snort cocaine you get a numb face.

48
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,900
The reason is because it's, it blocks
nerves. Kay said from colleagues,

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,220
my colleagues have told me I've
actually never done cocaine.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,160
I've know quite a few people who
have and they will, you know,

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,620
they'll have this sort of numbness.

52
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,450
It's the reason is because cocaine
is also a nerve blocking agent,

53
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,080
like lighter cane, lighter
cane. Exactly. Times about this.

54
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:32,800
Yesterday ironically on the podcast and
about doctors becoming drug addicts,

55
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:36,150
the initial doctor's has started doing
light of cane. Holsted was one of them.

56
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,910
He became an accidental cocaine
addict and then he's up for days.

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,190
He was up for days and um,

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,910
he structured a program where he expected
his residence to match him to go toe

59
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,840
to toe with them. Our, that huge remain.

60
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,810
It sounds like what a coke had would
do, come on and stay away. Unbelievable.

61
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,200
And I think the story was that he
actually knew that there was a problem.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,520
He went to rehabilitation,

63
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,760
checked in under a different
surname and one part of the, um,

64
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,100
regiment for him coming off
cocaine was to prescribe morphine.

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,040
And at the end of the
rehabilitation program,

66
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,570
he came out with both the cocaine
addiction and heroin addiction.

67
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,870
And so now there's rumors,
you know,

68
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,100
that he would get his shirts
laundered in Paris, you know,

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,190
in France.
And you know,

70
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,820
they would come back and it wasn't
just the white starch, you know,

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,660
shirts that were in the box that we were
other whites substances too. But that's,

72
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,230
you know, you ask a great question, where
did that come from? Where's that history?

73
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,140
The legacy seems to date
back to William Holstead,

74
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,450
who is an accidental cocaine addict.

75
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,690
And there we have then maintained
that inhumane practice in medicine,

76
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
which is so critical to be
awake and aware and to be sharp.

77
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,630
You're cutting people open,
you're operating on people.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,210
And think back to what we said
about being awake. You know,

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,110
you would never accept treatment
from a doctor who started, you know,

80
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:09,040
looking at your child who's sick with an
appendicitis at three m in the morning,

81
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,900
who then switched some whiskey and says,
yeah, I'm going to do the operation.

82
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,830
That's fine. You would, you
would go ballistic. Well,

83
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,970
why do we accept treatment
after 20 hours of being awake?

84
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,910
You're as impervious.
You would be if you were legally drunk.

85
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,670
So unfortunately we placed young
residents in this position of, you know,

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,180
acting and operating and decision making
under conditions of insufficient sleep.

87
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,340
One in five medical residents will
make a serious medical error due to

88
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:37,061
insufficient sleep.

89
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:42,061
One in 20 medical residents will kill
a patient because of a fatigue related

90
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:46,750
error. One in 20 that's
crazy right now, you know,

91
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:50,650
there are well over 20,000 medical
residents. For a hundred of them,

92
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:54,400
five were going to kill people, accidental
deaths. Think about that number.

93
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,760
That's insane. If we were to solve the
sleep epidemic in medicine, you know,

94
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:03,020
we could start saving lives and I don't
know what it is. Is it just a, you know,

95
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,740
an old boys' network where we
say, well we went through it. Yes.

96
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,520
So you've got to go through it. You know,
and there's, the data now is so prolific,

97
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:14,720
you know, I write it all about that and
try to make a build or an evidence based,

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,310
you know, emotionless cold
case for sleep in medicine,

99
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,340
asleep prescription for medicine
as it were. Or most people don't

100
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,890
realize their requirements
that residents have.

101
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,330
No. And, and they are, they
are literally, you know,

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,770
beyond human capacity thinking that,
you know,

103
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,870
Hubris and some degree of hours on the
job is going to be able to allow you to

104
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,230
sort of,
you know,

105
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,230
cut short what took three and a
half million years to sort of,

106
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:45,920
you know,
get in place,

107
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,580
which is an eight hour night of sleep
that's just thick headed. You know, it's,

108
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,510
and I think the medical profession that
may be at the stage where it's my mind

109
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:57,880
is made up, don't confuse me
with the facts. Wow. That,

110
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,233
that

111
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,460
this is blowing me away.

112
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,610
I just don't understand how the very
people that are working on the health of

113
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:11,821
patients and fixing them and repairing
injuries and taking care of diseases,

114
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,530
those are the people that are ignoring
one of the primary factors of disease and

115
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:21,580
errors and cognitive function.
It's impairment.

116
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,593
It's a travesty.

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,660
I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist
and he tells a story about during his

118
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:29,680
residency, he was uh, is, is back
in the 80s and you had a pager.

119
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,040
He was on the toilet with a tray of food
on his lap because he didn't have time

120
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:36,670
to eat and go to the bathroom.

121
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,790
So as eating food and he fell asleep and
then his pager went off and he's like,

122
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:42,924
fuck my life.

123
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,380
How many warnings,

124
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,180
how many warning bells do you need to
tell you that you're in a deleterious

125
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,910
state if you use with your trousers
around your ankles, with food or via face.

126
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,420
And yet you're in the deepest stages
of non rem sleep and he's a guy who was

127
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:02,980
working on people's eyes.
Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. I mean,

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,833
I mean it's,
you know,

129
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,590
sleep is equally absent for the
patient in the hospital setting.

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,920
We know that somewhere between 50
to 70% of all ICU alarms are either

131
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,010
unnecessary or ignore bubble,
you know,

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,140
and the one place where you desperately
need the Swiss army knife of health,

133
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:26,650
that is a good night of sleep is the
one place where you get at least,

134
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,690
which is on a hospital ward.
We could,

135
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,740
we could exit people out of hospital
beds early at the data is already there.

136
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:34,600
For the neonatal intensive care unit,

137
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,020
they used to leave bright lights on 24
seven and that would prevent sort of the

138
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,300
signaling for sleep and
wake and sleep and wake.

139
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,320
And that cycle is critical if
you regularize sleep, sorry.

140
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,470
If you regularize the light in
the neonatal intensive care unit,

141
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,200
those infants ended up having high
levels of oxygen saturation because were

142
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,070
sleeping better,

143
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,090
their weight gain was dramatically
increased and they ended up exiting the

144
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:04,530
neonatal intensive care unit
five weeks earlier. Whoa.

145
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,700
Simple things. You know, why don't we
do something like this in medicine?

146
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,350
When you come in onto a hospital ward,
you get this on an international flight,

147
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,220
travel for free,

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,520
earplugs facemask even just that by
itself could help people to start,

149
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,470
get better sleep.
Next on the hospital admission form.

150
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,440
Tell me when you normally go to
sleep and when you normally wake up.

151
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,390
And to the best of our ability, we as
doctors will try to sort of, you know,

152
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,350
manage your health care around
your natural sleep tendencies.

153
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,480
If we could do that, you know,
sleep is, is the elixir of life.

154
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,630
It is the most widely available democratic
and powerful healthcare system I

155
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,230
could ever possibly imagine. Why aren't
we leveraging that and taking it?

156
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,270
That's one of the greatest hacks that
medicine could actually, you know,

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,330
inflect does stunning.

158
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,880
But how's this being received by doctors?
Are they reluctant to listen to you?

159
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:03,000
I mean, what, what, what is happening
with all this data and you're,

160
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,770
you're passionate cry for extra sleep
or more sleep or the proper sleep,

161
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:12,510
I should say. It's starting to happen.
I mean, when the book came out,

162
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,630
which was sort of the hub that
came out in back in October and,

163
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,670
and some people started to give push
backs to sort of in the medicine realm,

164
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,330
you know,

165
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,140
there was some concerns about continuity
of care that if you keep switching

166
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:29,700
residents out every 16 hours that you
wouldn't have continuous patient care.

167
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:34,140
And that was a problem. Um, well there
are other medical training systems.

168
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,190
For example, France or Sweden, New
Zealand, they do this all the time.

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,220
They do not allow their
residents to undergo anything
longer than either a 14 or

170
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,000
a 16 hour shift.

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,870
They train their residents in
the same amount of time or less.

172
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,920
And if you look at the rankings of their
medical health systems around the world,

173
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,650
they rank far higher
than the United States.

174
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,930
So you can't tell me that longer work
hours for residents, for example,

175
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,100
on necessary to train good doctors.
The evidence just doesn't support itself,

176
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:08,100
had some push back there.
But for the most part,

177
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,270
I think people are receptive once they
know the information. And I think I'm the,

178
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,520
I've been someone who's been to blame
here. I've known this evidence for,

179
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,520
you know, I've been doing sleep
research now for 20 or so years.

180
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,630
We are with sleep where we
were with smoking 50 years ago.

181
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,250
We had all of the evidence
about the deathly carcinogenic
cardiovascular disease

182
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:30,084
issues,

183
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,620
but the public had not been aware where
no one had adequately communicated.

184
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,600
The science of,
you know,

185
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,350
smoking to the public the same I
think is true for sleep right now.

186
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,410
That's part of the motivation
for why I wrote the book,

187
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,900
why I've been doing or trying
to do a lot of publicity.

188
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,050
I'm a very shy person and I don't
like being in the spotlight,

189
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,680
but I feel as though there is a mission
that whose voice has not been actually

190
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:57,790
gifted yet and I wanted to try and
help them be a sort of asleep diplomat.

191
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,740
I mean that's why I choose
the handle on social media,

192
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,990
trying to be there as
an ambassador for sleep.

193
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,460
And now once people start to understand
the science as we've spoken about for

194
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,294
two hours,

195
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,830
then people start to actually realize
it's not the third pillar of good health

196
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,360
alongside diet and exercise.

197
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,890
It's the foundation on which those two
are the things set. You know, for example,

198
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,100
if you're dieting but you're
not getting sufficient sleep,

199
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,940
70% of all the weight that you
lose will come from lean body,

200
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,010
mass muscle and not fat.

201
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,900
Your body becomes stingy in giving
up its fat when it's under slept.

202
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,160
So once you get this information out
there, things are starting to change.

203
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,760
I've started to have some discussions
with the World Health Organization.

204
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,480
They seem to be very interested now in
getting, getting to grips with sleep.

205
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,870
I love to speak to first
world governments though.

206
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,860
When was the last time you saw any
first world nation have a government

207
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,200
supported public health campaign
around sleep? I don't know any.

208
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,670
We've had them for, you know, drink
driving for risky behaviors, you know,

209
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,280
for drugs, for alcohol,
for healthy eating.

210
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,790
Sleep should be a part of that equation.
You know,

211
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,170
I want to lobby governments to start
to instigate this and it will save them

212
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:12,070
millions of dollars.

213
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,990
The Rand Corporation did an independent
survey two years ago on the demonstrable

214
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,480
cost of a lack of sleep too,
global economies.

215
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,540
What they found was that a lack
of sleep costs most nations,

216
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,950
about 2% of their GDP, the gross
domestic product here in America,

217
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:31,870
that number was $411 billion
caused by insufficient sleep,

218
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,820
solve the sleepless epidemic.

219
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:37,330
You could almost double the budget for
education and you could almost half the

220
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:41,110
deficit for healthcare.
Wow.
