1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,860
They no idea. Kind of nervous.
Here we go. Here we go.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,910
Bam. What a boy's gonna have to be smart.
A lot of footwear to south paws too.

3
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:14,610
And other big point. Here we go. Get
the size of tils. Fucking thighs.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,210
Boy.
Their styles look at their styles.

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,630
Both real loose but more moitai based
with till he's going to throw a frog lake

6
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:28,340
round kicks. The thing about wonder
boys, he's all light on the toes.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,120
His trigger is insane

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,970
leg kick right away by till.
Very interesting.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,740
I'm so curious about this fight. She
that video til put out of him sparring.

10
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:45,120
Just beating the shit at some guy. Yeah,
it was weird, right? Yeah. Very strange.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,470
Yeah, that good. But he knocked
him out. Hurting him too.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,860
I wouldn't post that if I was
him. Yeah. And then you know,

13
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,810
he posted some of him getting hit too
after that because he said people are

14
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:59,220
calling him a bully that I don't like
because that means he's reading the

15
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,980
comments and then he's
reacting to those comments,

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,190
which means people can fuck with this
guy. If you're a young fighter, to me,

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,770
tough men to navigate through,
well those comments,

18
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,520
you got to leave them alone because
there's so many you're dealing with, uh,

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,510
you know,

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
a pool of thousands and thousands of
people and who knows who they are or what

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,530
their peak yet. But also a lot of those
people aren't happy for your success.

22
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,260
I know Ms. Brown, their
life, so they come of course,

23
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:27,150
especially a guy like Tim was on the rise,
you know,

24
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,170
or anyone in the spotlight tries
that switch kick off the front leg.

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,320
UFC might want to hire just wanting
to help these younger guys with that.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,580
Well just give him a little psychological
counseling on how to handle it and get

27
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,550
a social media expert in their tills
are going to close the distance in land.

28
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:44,550
That left hand over the top.
Wonderboy is not there though. Yeah.

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,220
What a boys footwork.
It's fricking ridiculous.

30
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,030
Well this is the perfect kind of style
ram to an aggressive guy coming forward.

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,140
This is what he's used to have. I have
to imagine that's why it took the fight.

32
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:59,040
Just stylistically, he's like, yeah,
big guy. Aggressive. Let's do it right.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,300
Yeah. Even though remarried, just be
Mazda doll who he's see Wonderboy,

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,990
he shouldn't be there. Right. He
better get the fuck out of there.

35
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,600
Don't stay there. Yeah.
He loves that leg kick,

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,420
but he was a little off balance
and he didn't recuperate. Well,

37
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:16,680
Darren made a shift as he was going to
launch that leg kick and he put them in a

38
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:20,040
weird position where he was off balance.

39
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,310
I mean there's some good adjustments
going on here at both guys.

40
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:27,280
Trying to find the right day. What? Oh
Shit. God till likes to fire one aleks.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,470
That slide with the right hand forward
and then look off to the left hop.

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,170
You good? Oh Shit. One,
two quick one to Wonderboy,

43
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,120
letting them know it's still there. Boy
has that a finished. It's still there.

44
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:42,270
It looks tilt. Tilt. A little
hesitant now. Wait a little bit.

45
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:46,500
Now be careful like a
cobra man. Be careful. Oh,

46
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,700
you're talking about dude who was
like 57 and o was a kickboxer.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,270
Good wonder by agreement as
far as high level striking.

48
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:57,720
I can't remember the last time two
strikers were matched up this, well, no,

49
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,050
and this is five round son.
Ooh. I'll take, Ooh. Yeah.

50
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:06,790
Who knows what's going to happen and
that's fine. This is interesting. So,

51
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,240
so there's high level. I'm just trying
to figure out with the left hand.

52
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,220
Pop them with the left hand is
caught him at the end event.

53
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,870
Not a lot of power but reached him.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,610
Yeah.

55
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,300
He's letting tell know that
he's down there. Yup. Snap.

56
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,230
He's also switching legs,
switching stances now he's all sideways.

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,680
It's hard to find a trading partners.
Get to emulate Wonderboy. Man.

58
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,130
You don't really get a real look at ou.

59
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,270
He's picking his shots. I think he's
trying to frustrate till so till jumps in.

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,640
Makes them, Ooh, looked for it.

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,410
I don't think that landed though. Huh?
No, look cool though. And I was onboard.

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,810
I yelled out. You got to get off
the cage chair. He got to get out.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,740
Yeah. I think for one of where these first
two rounds, just try to frustrate till,

64
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,720
yeah.

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,400
What time is it in England right now?

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,610
There's seven hours ahead or they eight
eight so it's fucking eight o'clock it's

67
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,020
really late Thursday at eight o'clock
eight 30 at night or they see,

68
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,640
I see. I think it's seven
30 it's eight hours. Is it?

69
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,990
Trust me. Yeah. You probably
know. So it's 9:30 PM right now.

70
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,690
Eight 30 bro.
Eight 30 what time is it now?

71
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,940
1230 I looked at my watch broken unless
there's a couple different times zones

72
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:27,660
in the UK.

73
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,540
I thought it was just one and I have
daylight savings time or something.

74
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,810
Nobody should have that shit dead.
Arizona does it right? They do.

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,750
They're like, fuck you fuck with
it. And not our sleep we lose.

76
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:44,570
Got Real fuck yourself. Two year old.
But how about when you gain that hour?

77
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,550
It's nice when you gain it for
like two days. Not worth it, bro.

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,170
It's not worth it in the morning.
It's dark in the afternoon.

79
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:56,630
It's not your boys too. Yeah. Yeah.

80
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,920
Mike six got a grown man.
He's all into Harry Potter and Shit now.

81
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,130
That's crazy. Damn we got it.
We got a universal studios.

82
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,980
How often have you haven't been,
you haven't been a universal studios.

83
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,590
You need to go universal studios.

84
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:14,360
Fucking brules now the three
d simulations. Hell yeah.

85
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,130
High level that that Harry Potter ride

86
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,820
at Disney is pretty sick. Yeah, I was
straight up scared on that. Right?

87
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,510
I was scared.
That transformer ride is amazing.

88
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:31,140
Also in [inaudible] land is sick

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,680
or rides ever. You know what's the
best ride ever? All time. Hands down.

90
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,300
Flights of passage.
Avatar ride in Disney world in Orlando.

91
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,980
I went to the simulation. It's
incredible, dude. It's incredible.

92
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,000
It's like virtual reality. You go in, you
sit on this bike, you're riding a dragon,

93
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,090
you saw Avatar,
right?

94
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,550
You're riding one of those things
through the fucking jungle.

95
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,090
It is every is think of like,
have you ever done that?

96
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,770
There's the thing at Disney land called
soaring over the world, will you?

97
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,700
It's amazing.

98
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:09,630
Giant screen and you're flying like over
India and over the Everest. It's amaze.

99
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,910
Sure. That's not Disney world
or they've got, no, it just
did. It just did. He said,

100
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,680
yeah. Disney world. Disney land has
soaring over the world. Oh, but oh,

101
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:23,000
here we go. Round to fuck
world around. I remember,

102
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,120
Oh till we get a little more aggressive,

103
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,510
tagged him with that left
hand and that castle,

104
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,580
that Bet Harry Potter castle that they
build. What the fuck? That's amazing. No,

105
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,230
it's incredible. Tills getting
way more amped up. Oh Shit. Ooh.

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,910
One mistake man. I know Wonderboy
is such a good counter fighter.

107
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,860
Oh he lives where it done.
Oh gotta get off the fucking fence.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,020
That's all till once.

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,310
So that first round you got to
give it to one or boy, right? Yeah.

110
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,970
I mean it's super close, but yeah. Yeah,
give it to Wonderboy. The Wonderboy,

111
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,540
not a whole lot going on. Most of them.
And he landed like maybe two shots.

112
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:06,310
One of the body, one to
remember this though. They're
in Liverpool, the home kit.

113
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,090
He's the hometown kid and the
judges look at a octagon control,

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,770
so it's not necessarily
could give to wonder. Boom,

115
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,300
that that front my ground until
I don't think landed anything,

116
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,560
but he's going forward and the judges
are morons. So like, oh, going forward.

117
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,620
That works well.
Give it to till he did a good job.

118
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:27,070
Didn't t they always ask a
question after they say something.

119
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,070
He's amazing. Isn't he
fantastic, right hand, wasn't it

120
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,730
the side tried to get
loose in the third round.

121
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:41,940
I feel like it's getting
looser ready a little bit.

122
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,460
It's just such a dangerous chess game.
I know.

123
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,290
And Wonderboy hands motherfucking
down son. He's always
like that. It's like that.

124
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,790
That's that karate style sign.

125
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,590
Okay.

126
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,270
Ooh, look for it till slid, slid to the
right tills. Elbows are no joke either.

127
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,900
Now if he gets in close, they're the one
that he landed on. Cowboy was ruthless.

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,610
God, who else has he beaten? It's
about it. So yeah, I'm really, uh,

129
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,920
in,
he hasn't really,

130
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,310
he hasn't really knocked you off
your socks before that cowboy fight.

131
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,660
He's at some decisions. Hmm.
Yeah. We still need knockout.

132
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,780
You stopped somebody to know yet early
on he had one stop. It's, Oh shit. Ooh.

133
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,070
Damn. Wonderboy. Wonderboy
top a very smart man. Yeah.

134
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,890
Well this is like,
again,

135
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,100
stylistically such a great fight because
this is the style that Wonderboy really

136
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,730
does.
Like he likes to God,

137
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:37,731
that's Uber aggressive and when it turned
in terms of like high level technique,

138
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,380
both these guys are really
good. Really, really good.

139
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,800
Don't till till keeps throwing that
front like so kicked to the frontline.

140
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,450
Oh Gosh. No, we wanted to do
a little short with Yep. Ooh.

141
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,950
Hixon yeah, he doesn't mind. Oh boy. He's
going to have to adapt to that. Yeah,

142
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,540
they both switch it up.
Don't, Yup. Oh, Ooh.

143
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,960
Just missed that head kick son.
But uh,

144
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:05,270
miss financial is as good as a mile.
Tim Scott.

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,760
Great Distance Control.
They both do delete that. Do
they bought two? Don't they?

146
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,670
Don't they don't they? That's Irish,
isn't it? I don't know. My accent. SOC,

147
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,230
we need a high natto in here.
I have some scouts for us.

148
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,170
Amazing Kid. Definitely a different
accent to it. The thick man. Yeah.

149
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,310
Sunderland, Liverpool, thick ass.
Liverpool I think is Ozzy Osborne.

150
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,200
Okay.

151
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,790
Oh, Russian in man. Why do boy loves
to do that? Like switch slit splits.

152
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,520
Yeah, but it's, it's so,

153
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,190
it's so hard to figure out what the fuck
he's going to do because he switched

154
00:09:42,191 --> 00:09:45,690
his stance as well. He does it sometimes
and then we'll throw a kick. Yeah,

155
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,770
he's back to Russia and again, tills just
trying to figure out and pin him down.

156
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:54,570
But here it's not there. I wonder how this
is, this is one of the boys game plan,

157
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,640
man Kimmy up commit and make a mistake.

158
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,970
They should capitalized but tills doing
a good job of not giving them much space

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,900
where the cages,

160
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,690
this is not happening in the center
of the cage as much as it's Ha.

161
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,940
Oh wonderful. I'll try that. Sweat,
chills going to feel any pressure.

162
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,150
Get a finish cause till is absolutely
controlling the center of the cage.

163
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,100
They under void does not have a lot.
Well now they're in the center and you,

164
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,850
you know that wins rounds
for these judges. Yeah.

165
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,730
Cause they don't understand fighting.

166
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,160
That place is packed too man.
Oh I'm sure they say, you know,

167
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,990
he's a superstar superstar

168
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,390
and be the face of the,
of uh, England man.

169
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,180
Big knockout here. It'd be the fit cause
Bisbing IFC is, but if he's retired,

170
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,060
yeah. Who else is coming up
in England? Uh, we got uh,

171
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,900
Michael Van and page, right? Sure. Yeah,
but he's not, he's not on this level.

172
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,430
Well, why don't they give him high level
fights? He just had fought a Rickles.

173
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,070
Do you see what he did to
him? No. Fucked him up.

174
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I heard he exploded his face
and choked him out. Yeah.

175
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,860
And I was like his first like they
weren't feeding him, you know,

176
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:08,460
like that was a tough fight.
Mike van page daily.

177
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:13,230
Next they say and, and, and
Roy MacDonald. Musashi. Ooh,

178
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,900
those are two very good
fights. I really, me,

179
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,360
I really like page daily cause
they don't like each other.

180
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,370
They fucking hate each other.
I liked that fight.

181
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:23,700
I'll watch shout out to all the
10 plan of schools in the UK.

182
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,340
We got like a eight now. Damn Lung,
10 30 lunch. This neighborhood.

183
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,600
How many cranberry Redditch Darlington.
Uh,

184
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,950
Shit. Am I missing one? Oh, glass
gal. That's Skorton Scotland.

185
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,750
How many got worldwide? About a
hundred. That's amazing. It's crazy.

186
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:47,350
Amazing Ooze. And it keeps
growing, man. It keeps growing.

187
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,390
He hit him with that psychic and a,

188
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,500
you see wonder boys leg Bacall she's
out in the replay. He didn't like that.

189
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,110
[inaudible] with three straight. Yeah.
One of them really made his knee buckle.

190
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:00,730
Ma'Am. Those things fucking sorry.
Here it is Michael Van and page.

191
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,240
We'll kicked him.
Oh Shit.

192
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:08,560
Okay.

193
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
Damn. Oh, he's so fast.
That's again the karate.

194
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,250
He comes from that point
fighting background. You know,

195
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,470
there's a great karate match
that I watched. I mean,

196
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,190
I don't know how many times
they fought, but on, um, uh,

197
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,110
they fought point fighting way back in
the day. Um, Raymond Daniels and Michael,

198
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,390
then a page for each other and fighting.

199
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,710
Now Raymond Daniels is the glory champion
and Michael Van and Paige is coming up

200
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:37,690
in Beltour. Very interesting. Oh, he's
a belt or champion now. Raymond Daniels,

201
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:42,580
right. He left glory.
[inaudible] here we go.

202
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,910
Here we go.

203
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,693
Yeah.

204
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,030
Here we go,

205
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,300
Darren till super aggressive here.
Now I wonder if a Wonderboy,

206
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:06,080
his knee is okay because those, uh,

207
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,980
he still hasn't landed anything now
except for those sidekicks to the knee.

208
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,670
Is Atlanta anything to the head?
Nothing. Wonderboy, his knee seems fine.

209
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:18,590
He's moving fine tooth around so
far. No shot to the head. Yeah.

210
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,390
Ooh,
kick to the body.

211
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,380
Well,

212
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:32,380
the whole thing with Wonderboy is just
you make a mistake and he counters you

213
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,620
and so far till hasn't really made any
mistakes but wonder boys found a few

214
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:41,310
openings but there's never been like one
big bum rush where he'd left a gap and

215
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,310
Wonderboy could drop a ball on him.
Did I miss anything?

216
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,590
Nope. Nothing. But they did show the
replay. The knee buckling a Wonderboy.

217
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,280
It look pretty now. Yeah. From what? From
that sidekick. Oh Wow. From a side kick.

218
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,500
Front leg side kick to me.
But he's moving fine.

219
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,700
It doesn't seem like he's a limping at
all and he threw some kicks with that

220
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:06,410
left leg. So it would be nice at one
one. It's hard to tell. It's hard.

221
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,650
Wonderboy was a little more
aggressive though. Yeah,

222
00:14:09,651 --> 00:14:13,040
I wouldn't be getting knocked
out. Knocked out. You think so.

223
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,780
Same thing with the Woodley
five who was like, oh,

224
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:17,720
be more aggressive and get
fucking starched by Woodley.

225
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,370
That isn't a real fighter.
A, it's still, you got to,

226
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,960
well this is his style man. This is
his style. His style is move around,

227
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:31,961
but the thing is until is so high level
as well that it's hard for this style to

228
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,970
even find its home. You
know, you have an aggressive,

229
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:38,180
which counter striker this is, I don't
know what people expect. Really. Machida.

230
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,020
Yeah. How about that? My cheat
at front kick to vittores fails.

231
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,180
Dariana Cheetah. How fucking
dare you know. Ooh, the
man's sign off fighting went,

232
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:51,710
you know what? Enjoy the retirement.
Hey Josh. Yeah. Crazy, right?

233
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,070
That was the one, the worst knockouts
effort and it just walks off fucking,

234
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,560
it starts praying and you see the
photo of the foot on the face.

235
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,890
Text book,
front kick balls of the balls of the feet.

236
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,270
You think feature goes to ride just juices
with every Brazilian drug ever. Uh, my,

237
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,850
my heart hope so too.
I pray for that at night.

238
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,210
I pray for golden like Masters Division.
Yeah,

239
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:16,910
just go off and want to see
veins in his teeth against.

240
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,590
It's crazy that he's still
fighting Jesus Christ and his gums.

241
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,630
And he was around in the early days.

242
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,290
He's the only guy from the
early day still fight. Oh yeah.

243
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,120
Wonderboy caught him with that right hand,
man.

244
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,820
You could say the same thing for Dan
Henderson, but he's officially retired.

245
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,710
He's retired.
But Wonderboy,

246
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,420
I mean a [inaudible] was around a UFC 12.
That's crazy.

247
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:43,070
Henderson was around in 98 so it
wasn't much longer afterwards.

248
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,690
You know. Crazy. Really.
They fought, right?

249
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:51,490
Dan Henderson and killed him both times.
Yup.

250
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,230
Oh, oh, we caught all right. And See
till starting to get anxious here.

251
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,640
This one's gonna get in trouble,
man.

252
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,620
Ooh. Well he's looking for
wonder. Boy gets baked. Kale
is the his legs, man. I mean,

253
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,660
his hands are dangerous for his
powers in those fucking legs. Oh Shit.

254
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,210
He's found that head kick a few times.
A sick slip,

255
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,330
but till who does till train with,

256
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,050
I don't know much about his
to come bone and live a pool.

257
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,240
Uh, his coaches calling,
I forget his last name.

258
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,430
It's crazy one or boy's dad crane's
him, right? Yeah, it'd be tough dynamic.

259
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,880
Ooh Damn that. Not everyone
is no touch. Just touch them.

260
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,100
But he didn't touch him at the very
end with that a round kick to the face,

261
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:42,060
he might be fine and an opening for that
one to blitz out till just tagged him

262
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:42,903
with that job.

263
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,520
I have a hard time believing in these
judges. I don't have it. Three nothing.

264
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,780
Right, right in Liverpool
dock to gun control. Well,

265
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,980
judges are two, right?
Or the American judges.

266
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,830
The English judges are all morons though,
aren't they all around the world?

267
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,000
Unfortunately.

268
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,230
I love the fact that you could say that
you don't work for anybody. I know.

269
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:10,060
Isn't it cool? And you
can have no written.

270
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,240
Oh no till. Got poked in the
eye. Get the fuck Outta here.

271
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,140
Mark gutters were worried about
an eye poked in anybody. That boy,

272
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:26,950
that doctor got in that room quick.
That doctor just jumped in. God,

273
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:28,960
where did he come from?
And now he's out.

274
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,840
He's trying to get a little
too much TV time. Oh yeah.

275
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,050
Oh definitely.
I don't mean to poke or Reno.

276
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,380
Oh, they were booing him.
Yeah. He's saying no, no. Boom.

277
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,390
Oh Shit. Sometimes I poked really
rev a dude up or a Dick Kik.

278
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,930
Oh my damn till. Get wild here. You
know. Don't get too comfortable. Okay.

279
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:59,850
There you go. On over
the top. Oh Shit. Oh. Oh.

280
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:00,870
He's getting crazy here

281
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,993
dude.

282
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,790
That I poke.
Really poke him.

283
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,310
I wish you would have poked nine the
first round or the round here. Oh, not,

284
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,150
I was trying to get loose. That's
about to get fun. That was three,

285
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,080
so we've got two more to go. Thank
God this is a five rounder. Right?

286
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:20,400
That will stretch me. Pissed. Yeah,
you'd feel so. I talk so much.

287
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,220
Shit on that fight is three
rounds. It ended there. Yeah,

288
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,470
man.
Yes.

289
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,860
That dude has a prominent forehead
cheekbone situation going on.

290
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,190
I think gang is kind. Got a little
bit of that. A little bit of,

291
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,460
it's definitely got some fucking
ancient man and I'm a, he does.

292
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,580
I don't look like him. He
definitely boom. That right hand.

293
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,740
That was the nice the
counter. I'm here. Boom,

294
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,120
boom. Oh, that got him. Definitely. He
slept with it. Yeah. He went with it,

295
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:55,180
but it caught him at the end of it for
sure. Look what I done. I'm like tired.

296
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,500
This is his style. You know, he's
so efficient at doing that. Oh,

297
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:05,030
both these guys can do this for 10
rounds. Yeah. Round Four. Here we go.

298
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,790
God, it's, this is a fight.

299
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:11,750
That is a great argument for the
five round fight for high level.

300
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,340
Maybe we would feel so bad if we were
leaving here and then, yeah. Like who won?

301
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:23,380
Who cares what even happened?
Like what, what are the stats on?

302
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,180
Oh Dude. Enlist trenches
and kicks. Landed. Yeah.

303
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:30,530
Unless you're super and you'd be so
wonderful. It was a hard jab. Right.

304
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:35,420
Their kid didn't tilt better. Watch his
p's and q's though. You are too hard, man.

305
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,313
Yup.

306
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,943
But

307
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,630
juice is worth the squeeze
if can get it knocked down.

308
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,043
Okay.

309
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,100
Oh, Ooh. Damn.

310
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,470
This is getting hot.

311
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,540
Yeah. Cause Yeah. Daren tills
never been five rounds. How's
he? No, I don't think so.

312
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,820
He hasn't switched in the EOC.
This first made it well,

313
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,350
first times because his main event against
cowboy Jase starch cowboys, he has it.

314
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,470
Yeah. That's his first main event.
Right. And what about outside of the UFC?

315
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,160
How many fights he had a,
he had what?

316
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,170
17 or a 14 on crazy speaks
perfect Portuguese. Oh,

317
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:29,500
does he? I didn't know that. Oh yeah,
man, when he fucked Darren till I tan,

318
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:31,990
this kid's marketable when
he fought in Brazil. Uh, he,

319
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:35,350
he spoke Portuguese to the crowd. He lived
there for like 10 years. Right? Yeah.

320
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:40,060
I watched one of his, uh, older fights
when we stop this guy and he, uh,

321
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,220
spoke Portuguese to the crowd after the
fire, the guy up 10 fights were there.

322
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,260
Wow. Yeah, he went there.
It just went to live down.

323
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:52,120
That had to get on to Liverpool cause I
guess there's little talks that form we

324
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,970
got stabbed. Yeah. Yes. That,
yeah. You can see the stem mark.

325
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,310
Where is it a lower like on his,
uh, on his rights dab in Brazil,

326
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,930
but right above his hip in England, in
Liverpool, in his hometown. And his coach,

327
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,700
his coach told him, Hey, you
gotta get Outta here man.

328
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,360
If you want to continue to have their
knives and the you can often off.

329
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,000
How many more people got to
get stuff that's, you know,

330
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,760
the London mayor actually said that
if you get caught with a knife,

331
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,610
he'd be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

332
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,180
What about if I had an open
boxes? Princesses, brother-in-law,

333
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,010
her brother got caught with one when he
went over there for the royal wedding

334
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:32,070
last week. Oh, that you
got caught with a knife.

335
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:34,710
They said he took one because Trump said
that you should take one with him and

336
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,800
he was in a bar. God. Oh, he's crazy.
Is he crazy? Her brother's crazy.

337
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,090
She's a dime piece man.

338
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,183
Okay.

339
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,930
I'm assuming you to Deb. Nothing. No,
I'm watching it. It's fine. Your son,

340
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,990
one boy with a step in Jab.

341
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,120
Not a lot of action. This fighting. Oh,

342
00:21:57,121 --> 00:22:00,600
Wonderboy looking for that left hand
over the top because it land. Nope.

343
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,500
Just kind of grazed him. It's kind
of hard to tell his back was to us.

344
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,990
It's can be a tough fucking
fight to judge, man.

345
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,620
Tell us having a hard time hitting him.
That's for damn sure. Beautiful Duck.

346
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:18,440
Under that, we get this tail with a
clinch. What if he takes him down to,

347
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,780
we just stopped the fight. Interestingly,
the tills, the one holding onto him here.

348
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,900
Oh, elbow that clinches. Mortised nasty.

349
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,230
Good elbow on the break there.

350
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,530
You're one of my say exactly what he
wanted. That light's kind of fucked up.

351
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:38,490
That lead leg, right leg. Yup. It
does look a little bruised. Oh Oo.

352
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,870
Good kicks to the body. I mean, yeah.
You guys watched that show Cobra Kai? No,

353
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:45,990
I haven't seen, I've heard close
to be good. Yeah. No, it's great.

354
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,840
That's a crazy well on Wonderboy.
His leg.

355
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,780
I really haven't noticed him
getting hit that much either.

356
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,430
It's on both legs to the office.

357
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:55,770
See the right legs worse would
that left leg is pretty tender.

358
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:59,010
Ronnie to the right leg
looks really fucked us.

359
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,660
I don't really remember
him kicking that heart.

360
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,140
It must have been when he was standing
in South Park, sideways, you know,

361
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,080
and now he hasn't gotten back then. Hathi
really not mine. Let's just round it.

362
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:13,710
Doesn't like it. Oh my God. Yeah.
I mean his footwork just stupid.

363
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:17,130
So Darren till can't really
get a read on him. But again,

364
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:20,580
the judges are given that the till.
Yeah,

365
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:24,900
that nothing big has happened where
you go all that guide. Definitely.

366
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,410
If someone knock someone down,
you've got the fight.

367
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,080
It shows Mike Lp got the
good right hand to the body.

368
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,780
So such a high level chess
game here, which I dig it.
I'm on the edge of my seat.

369
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:45,230
But if you're just a regular
fan like come on man.

370
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,970
I'll tell you what he's going
to get more shit is Wonderboy.

371
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,840
Cause there's one Woodley fights.
Which thoughts are not his fault.

372
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,000
It's not his fault. I'm just saying the
public thing. Iom Shit, I guess. I Dunno.

373
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,710
It's what it is. It's this is
the, I mean you want to beat him.

374
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:04,600
You got to come after him
and he'd come after him.

375
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:05,720
You run into the woods shipper.

376
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,900
But the thing is he's not
winning when he does this,

377
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,070
but we didn't win against Woodley
when he did this for sure.

378
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,340
But his wife obviously, he's
obviously got number one for a reason.

379
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:20,140
He's number one in the world happened
there at that back leg is fucked up man.

380
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,910
Yeah, I'll do friendly Boyce will. Yeah,

381
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,250
he's wobbling a little on the back to
his corner. That leg is fucked up man.

382
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,160
Maybe they just get it loosened this
fifth round and just save it for the fifth

383
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:35,400
round. Eddie. I hope
so. Me Too. Cause again,

384
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:40,190
if it stopped right here I'd be bummed
out. I'm feeling pretty lack luster.

385
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,920
Yeah,

386
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I was really cross going to give it to
till oh 100% know that every round of

387
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,310
that gift to my that and then once you,

388
00:24:48,311 --> 00:24:50,770
it's like we don't want to like make it
too obvious and he gives one to one a

389
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:55,170
boy. I don't know. I'd say he's
up. He's up three to one till.

390
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,700
Really? Because of the judges. Yes. But
the judges of what you think. Right?

391
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,020
Uh, even that it'd be tough.
You can maybe go to two,

392
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:08,490
but I would say tills winning this fight.
I don't know about that.

393
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:12,840
I think Wonderboy is winning. Can I get
some Goddamn copy? Strike numbers, Fox.

394
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:17,220
I know. No wonder they left her ass.
Just kidding. Can I get something?

395
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,410
How's your show going on showtime?
Enjoying it? Yeah. It's been good, man.

396
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,930
It's been fun.
Nice to a lot of fun.

397
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,860
Did you know that guy that just died
without from the comedy division? Yeah,

398
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,970
I did not. Did you know? Everybody
seems to think he's, I might've met him,

399
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:37,110
but everybody seems to think he's a
really good guy. That sucks, man. 55 man.

400
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,940
I know. Such a shame. Crazy.
Burt. Love the Gar. Oh yeah.

401
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,990
Yeah. I burned up some real nice to say
about also the dice. That's a bummer man.

402
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,680
Yeah. [inaudible] super
aggressive here coming off of you.

403
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:53,530
I'm sure he wants to get the finish.
Probably feels a little bit of pressure

404
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,163
and you should.

405
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,590
Okay. They're saying Darren
tills corns very urgent.

406
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,240
Like he's losing the fight.
No,

407
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,390
I think he's losing. You do. Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:16,980
I think if I would count up all the
different strikes strikes that landed.

409
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,070
Yeah. I think a lot of this,
according to the UFC thing,

410
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,870
I don't know in terms of strikes landed,
it says 48 to 42 God damn,

411
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:28,080
that's tough to judge. Yeah.
That's impossible. And then
you have one aggressor,

412
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,620
right? And Liverpool. I
got two or three. Two,

413
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:36,050
one five rounds. 48 strikes
landed. That is just bananas.

414
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,750
Bananas let a defense going on. Yeah.
A lot of missing as well. Movement.

415
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,530
Which tiles right hand you
think would for a great,

416
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,370
a little jab to the grill.
Face.

417
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,973
Sidekick.

418
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,680
No one's really going balls to the wall.
Or they know

419
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,510
Darren till would go balls to the walls,
but wonderful. It keeps moving. It's hard.

420
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,250
Fucking writing. Keeps moving. Don't get
blasted in the face. Yeah, it's hard.

421
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,270
What did we come on man, just sit there.
What was that about? He threw a Shitty,

422
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:19,390
we'll kick and then shook his head
and then they touch gloves. It's fun.

423
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,190
Fucking weird. Oh, switched up on them.
It's two are a little too friendly for my,

424
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,800
and he's looking to set up his
wheel kick with his left leg.

425
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,260
Someone throws something.
Anything the crowds like. Yeah.

426
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:35,710
That you have on their w w till,
but he doesn't.

427
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,400
Oh there he landed a lefthand.
Why are they touching?

428
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,460
What do I want to touch?
Dab Cause got all the goddamn corner.

429
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,420
Oh is that about gorillas? Don't act
like that. I don't understand this.

430
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,550
That does touch gloves.
Again, too much respect.

431
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:54,310
I know there's not enough
killer instinct in this.

432
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,900
He's looking for that low fake and then
go with the high round kick off the

433
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:00,370
front leg.
He does that sometimes,

434
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,730
but he didn't do it and you just want
to know how many miles they've ran this

435
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,850
goddamn fight. You kind of give it
to them for sticking to their phone.

436
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,210
No one's getting out of composure here to
pros. Pros, I get the style. You don't,

437
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,060
you don't want to risk it. But if, yeah,
if you're not balls deep in a fighting,

438
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:19,610
you're not happy with this
fight. No, not thrilled with it.

439
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,780
This is one of the most
uneventful big events.

440
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,180
Who good jabs by till.

441
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,110
Oh Guillotine.

442
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,450
Oh He, I thought, Oh shit,
that's enough to win the fight.
100% that's all you need.

443
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:41,480
It don't get drop time to go a
little bit of time to go. Damn.

444
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:44,090
How hard does that motherfucker hit?
They didn't look like it. Atlanta,

445
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:46,910
like behind the air.
We'd have to look at it in the replay,

446
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:51,110
but I look or you heard him? I wonder.
Boy has got to move his ass now.

447
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:55,100
He lost the fight. Well wonder boy's
in trouble now. He's flat footed. Yeah.

448
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,770
What are ways to be a little bit
trouble? It's what? Till lifts where

449
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,910
Damn Wonderboy would've went to
till just out arrange for it to hurt.

450
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,730
This got interesting. That's for sure.
Proud man. Everyone's on their feet now,

451
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,900
but this is like wonder boy when he
fought Tyron Woodley to right. Got Tagged,

452
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,090
got hurt and then people
rushing get dealt with.

453
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,230
Look at this Wonderboy
to fucking take down.

454
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,103
Awesome.

455
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,730
No Shit.
No Shit.

456
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,280
Anything exciting when someone shoot
for a take down or these stills? Yeah.

457
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,860
Oh no wait,
left

458
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,010
Wonderboy still dangerous.

459
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,843
Crazy,
right?

460
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,560
40 seconds off. Boys. Who till just thinks
he has in the bag? I don't think so.

461
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:56,730
I just think he doesn't want to get
tagged coming in. He's a little tired too.

462
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:57,564
Mouth's open.

463
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,080
Hasn't been a high pace.
There's been a lot of foot work though.

464
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,960
So you might be a little boy.
You got to rent.

465
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,520
Remember till did have a real
hard time cutting that weight.

466
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,320
Oh and he's been going through a lot.
You're right.

467
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,810
They need some get downs in
it. You Ain't, you ain't,

468
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,990
you ain't lying. No standups.
Just get down. Get down.

469
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,123
Thanks.

470
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,060
Yeah, there's no way can give one a boy
the flat after that. It'd be hard pressed.

471
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,161
Especially in Liverpool.

472
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:35,500
It's over a man until one of
boys in a tough spot though.

473
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,850
I don't know why he's not
happy about that. That was um,

474
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,760
I mean he landed a good shot.
I guess he was trying,

475
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,360
it wasn't like he wasn't trying.
Yeah, he was sort of unfolded.

476
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,420
Where would you rank till after that
lackluster performance cause he,

477
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,820
cause Wonderboy is number one.
You'll make him number one obviously.

478
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,660
I think you put them in the top. Waterboy
is just a nightmare for everybody.

479
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,860
He's a nightmare for everybody.
It's tough to look good against him.

480
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,180
Oh win over him as,
as a win.

481
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,960
You know he beat you with a baseball
bat number one while he didn't even make

482
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,260
the weight.
So that's,

483
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:11,340
that's where it gets tricky because
it gives a fuck about that. Right,

484
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:13,230
but you're saying that they fought here.

485
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,070
Here's that front leg side kick that
wobbled his knee. Good job. Metro pcs.

486
00:31:17,071 --> 00:31:20,610
A blocking the vision. God Damn it.
Metro pcs. Why would they do that?

487
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,430
Why would they have that right where you
need to see, I'll tell you right now,

488
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,760
if you're my friend, you have metro pcs.
We are not friends anymore. Knocked down,

489
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,000
knocked down. Do you get angry
with just because of that? Well No,

490
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:34,140
I can hang you because the cricket
wireless cell phones now cricket.

491
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,650
Oh Shit.
Hard fucking left hand.

492
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,000
Boom. Right bye. That was
legit. Not One of the fight.

493
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:46,050
He clobbered them right there behind the
air. Huh? That was as legit as it gets.

494
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,730
That's the most, that was the legit
shot of the fire. Like one legit shot.

495
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,320
That's why like if you have 49 other
strikes at land, do they even count?

496
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,480
I mean that. That's a real, strike that.
Do you ever use the word clobber when,

497
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,680
when you're calling fights? I
don't call fights. Cooperates.

498
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,040
Clobbers nine my addiction. You know
it's too old school collaborating.

499
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,750
Clobbered him cooperating.
Collapsed.

500
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,990
The thing says that, right? Yeah.

501
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:18,060
If the thing for Claude
tasks for clobbering time

502
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,080
guy, you need to bring that
up. So what do we think here?

503
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,320
What do you think you think until
100% for one till close to switching.

504
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,460
I think til split. Someone's going to
give it to Wonderboy tills. Some rebel,

505
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,770
some rebel. He wants to die in Liverpool.
I want to get caught on my shield.

506
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,070
They place that where they set that
place on fire. If do give to Wonderboy,

507
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,850
Liverpool Games card and the paint,

508
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,150
you know there's some hooligans
then it's going to be a tough,

509
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,620
it's going to be a tough exit strategy.
Is that a [inaudible]?

510
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,200
Where the fuck her name is she the in
there? Adelaide bird fly her out there.

511
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,610
You never know. She's seen everywhere
fucker. Does she go everywhere? Yeah.

512
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,570
She like gives lessons
on judging and stuff.

513
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,800
You don't think they put her in
there for a reason. You know,

514
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,990
cause she don't give a fuck.
So didn't do it on purpose.

515
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,900
I think day w they want um,
controversy.

516
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:15,290
Do you want people to get
used to fucked up decisions?

517
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,700
What we're used to it that's, yeah,
I've done this work. I think they,

518
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:22,940
they want that because if they
ever needed to pull something out,

519
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,800
like something was like, dude, this
motherfucker has to win. You know,

520
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,830
people are like, oh it is Vegas, Vegas,
Seattle boxing's corrupt as ship.

521
00:33:30,831 --> 00:33:33,170
But with MMA, I just think they
don't know what they're looking at.

522
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,440
They don't understand west. Correct.
They just don't know either way.

523
00:33:36,441 --> 00:33:39,440
It sort of thing saying, oh
here we go. Here we go. Jamie,

524
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,960
can you give us some volume
split?

525
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,310
It's a sport for be a killer Strip club.
Dj

526
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,390
46 and 49

527
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,993
unanimous.

528
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,113
Oh

529
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,100
Holy Shit.

530
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,463
Wow.

531
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,770
Boy, he didn't even need that knocked
down. It's a big fight for him.

532
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,960
What were some of those scores?
I can hear it.

533
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,020
(494) 074-0840 seven or
494649464847 well that's,

534
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,850
that's a big victory for him,
that's for sure.

535
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,480
You pointed Wonderboy

536
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,500
for you.
What does it feel like you're on your way?

537
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,740
I think you said something bad.
Thank you. Some potty language there.

538
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,750
What do you think?
I mean,

539
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,480
strategic point.
Did you expect it to go the distance?

540
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:39,750
Did you think it was gonna be like the
whole boy? I didn't. Yeah, I played games.

541
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,180
I don't leave. It kicks. I'm
going to go. Stuff like that.

542
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,400
Well classified to have such
a specific way of talking.

543
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,930
I feel like it's so much cooler when
they talk like this is a fighter. Yeah.

544
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,313
It's pretty cool.

545
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm looking shoulder.

546
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,490
I'm going to fold this way.

547
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,720
Not really. Really. I'd
have to him. Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,193
Yes.

549
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,350
What is he saying?
What are they saying?

550
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,080
Boy? Fucking censorship.
Yeah. Well, let me,

551
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,390
let me hear the Bjorks next said
everyone. Anyone? I don't care.

552
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,980
Yeah. People ask him. Maybe you might
disable Tanya. She'll talk to them.

553
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,250
God Damn.
What the censorship?

554
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,320
Yeah.

555
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,000
ESPN. Please let these guys
swear. Please. Come on.

556
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,300
They're not going to let it. No Way.
It's going to be worse than he owns ESPN.

557
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,010
That's true.
Good call.

558
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,220
I think they might not even let
me do commentary over there.
