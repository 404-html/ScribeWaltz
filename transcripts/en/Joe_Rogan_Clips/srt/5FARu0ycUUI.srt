1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,370
Fuck man.
Is that this?

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,850
So that's the scariest thing in Africa
in terms of like interacting with human

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:09,760
beings. You know what the scariest
thing in Africa is? Mosquitoes. Oh yeah,

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,920
of course. Right? Like all, all, all
stuff. You can see all the big wildlife,

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:17,280
you can kind of feel it out and you
put yourself in the bad situations.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,110
Mosquitoes, there's nothing.
You know what I mean?

7
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,440
You just know you can do about
it. Yeah. My Buddy Justin wren,

8
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:26,260
he a runs fight for the forgotten charity.
They build wells for the pygmies. Okay.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,740
And He's been bitten. He's
gotten malaria three times. Yeah.

10
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,920
And one time he got it like
he didn't even get bit again.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,770
The malaria just returned.
If so,

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,190
it must be in some way systemic,
I think. I believe it is. I don't,

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,850
I don't never had it. Knock on
wood, my grandfather had it,

14
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,510
but I know that it's it. It wrecks
you for life. Like it can come back.

15
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:52,900
You can get it again. It stays with
you. I think that's his situation.

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,280
And he's a professional athlete.
He's actually a fighter for Bella.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,470
He's one of their, a heavyweight
contenders. Damn. Yeah.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,330
Has he said that it's affected his
performance? No, I don't think it has.

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,020
I think a, I think he's been okay with
it. You know, he received treatment,

20
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:10,560
but it's definitely rectum on three
separate occasions where he was, you know,

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,210
basically on death's door. Right. And one
of them was, and he's flying back. Damn.

22
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:15,421
You know,

23
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:19,830
and he's just sweating and it just
rotting out and the inside was awful.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,880
Say you want to ask what scares me? That's
it. Like I would, I'll take a hippo,

25
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:28,110
a snake, a crock of Leopard. Anything
over that? Yeah. Malaria is terrifying.

26
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,230
You see, malaria has killed more people
than anything ever. Really. You know,

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,870
malaria has killed half the people that
have ever died. Oh my God, that's insane.

28
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,430
Just make sure that's right. There
might be bullshit too. That sounds good.

29
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,910
I think it's real. I think, I think
we actually have googled this before.

30
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,360
The malaria is literally killed 50%
of all the people that have ever done.

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,370
That's insane.
Yeah.

32
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,050
It's not to me that people were
worried about so many different things.

33
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:55,920
And you should be worried about Miskito.
Exactly. Well, apparently they're,

34
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,870
they're trying to genetically
engineer mosquitoes to, uh, to,

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,000
to be void of devoid of malaria
and they hybridize. Right.

36
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,440
So my understanding is the way that it's
done is they genetically engineer at

37
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,210
the males to reproduce with the females,

38
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:16,890
which are the malaria carriers and then
the offspring of that generation can no

39
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,640
longer carry malaria. Yeah. Okay.

40
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,880
Malaria killed half the people who've
ever lived. That is bonkers. It's a myth.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,710
Yeah.
It would have had to kill.

42
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:29,460
It says like five and a half million
people on average per year every year for

43
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:33,240
all of human history. And that's not,
I think it kills half a million a year.

44
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,750
I think the real numbers
like half the size,

45
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,290
it would have to be five and a half ago.

46
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,270
So it was just one of those things
that people say, yeah, I like it.

47
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,720
I should probably shut the fuck
up. But what else is new? Um,

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,550
so how many people have they killed?
A lot. Okay, we'll go with a lot.

49
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,440
So other other does.
I mean like typhoid and shit.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,290
Isn't there like a fucking case of
typhoid in California now, right?

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,820
Yes.
Yeah.

52
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,710
Well we've got some weird situations in
this country with measles returning and

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,230
polio returning. All these came
in. Yeah. What the Hell Nah.

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
Outbreaks expands and La and Long
Beach. Jesus. Cool me down here, Joe.

55
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,860
Congratulations. There's no, it was my
hand was sweaty when they're different,

56
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,910
but it's different. It's
similar but different. It's
not typhoid. It's typhus. Oh.

57
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,820
Fleet borne disease that can be treated
with antibiotics or something. Yeah.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,970
I'm terrified of Lyme disease
to have you had line? No,

59
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,830
but I have a gang of friends that
have had it and it wrecks them. Well,

60
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:36,640
you spend a ton of time hiking
around and stuff out here. Yeah.

61
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,320
Well California doesn't have much Lyme,
but east coast it's horrific.

62
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,470
It's like everybody that spends time
outdoors in the northeast seems to get it.

63
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,810
Yeah. And I don't know
what you can do about that.

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,040
There was a vaccine that they
were doing for awhile, but um,

65
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,360
one of my friends,

66
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,520
her dad actually got Lyme
disease from the vaccine. Huh?

67
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,090
Like he didn't have it got vaccinated and
Mondo catching it from the vaccine and

68
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:04,640
I think they were like, okay,
fuck this proxy. Sorry. Cause
they had it for a while.

69
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,060
I've done, that's no fun. Yeah.
