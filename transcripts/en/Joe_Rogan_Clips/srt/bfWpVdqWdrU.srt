1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,510
Rick ross. Guy Max was going to come
in, but he wouldn't do it on camera.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,570
It was weird like he wouldn't
do it after he wanted to do it.

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,600
They'll do it at a certain time of
night, but here's the thing, man.

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,630
Some of that shit is publicists because
I'll tell you the same thing happened

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:15,840
with Liz Phair who I'm a
giant fan of hundred percent.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,520
I've been a fan of Liz Phair for ed
to an exile in Guyville was fucking

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,290
fantastic.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,900
Leverage record and evil empire at
the same time at the record store in

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:28,260
Nashville, Tennessee. That Reggie gets
machine and Exxon guy. Wow. Totally.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,540
My wife also miss Dee who we
went near with who was listing,

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,390
she loved this fair too at the time she,
she came and we got high together.

12
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,610
She's like, you can get high here.
I'm like, yeah, I don't have a boss.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,790
Alex Jones got high as fuck on high.
That was fucking awesome.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,970
He's trying to come back on and I just
don't know if I could do it. Oh, come on.

15
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,720
Let them come on their fucking
stop dumping them down.

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,360
They are shutting them down.
But the problem is he still on trial this,

17
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:56,100
this whole trial that's going on with the
Sandy Hook and all that shit has to be

18
00:00:56,101 --> 00:01:00,270
resolved first. But it doesn't mean
like Bill Maher respect to Bill Maher.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,950
I respect him for saying he gets to
speak to [inaudible] was on his show and

20
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,460
people were clapping and cheering that
he was pulled off of these networks and

21
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,720
pulled off of everything. It's like, look,

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,870
this guy said crazy lies about
me is with Bill Maher said,

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,450
he said the guy said crazy lies about me.
He goes,

24
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,060
but he still gets to talk like
this is what America is about.

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,350
Free speech means all speech. But see
like, here's what I don't understand.

26
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:25,620
Like Alex had me on many times
and he supported my record.

27
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,920
Black ribbon sort of Cameron. Yeah. He
been on the Alex Jones show many times.

28
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,330
I've been, I've been on it
three times. Where you ever
sober? Yeah. Every time. Yeah.

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,830
Every time sober. I've never, I was never
a situation. Well, the first time I was,

30
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,170
uh, we have the black ribbons record that
I did as Steven King on and stuff like,

31
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,720
so when that record came out, nobody
would support the record. So Alex,

32
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:49,760
Stephen King's on your record,
old record from what I do,

33
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,120
he plays,

34
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,180
he plays a DJ or a radio talk show hosts
that comes in and out of the record.

35
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,800
Um, that Stephen King,
yeah, as Stephen King.

36
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,950
So like when I did that record,

37
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
Alex Jones is the only person that
would support the record. He put it, he,

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,360
he debuted the whole record
on his show and then I went,

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,160
it was on for two hours by phone and
then I went in and was on his show in

40
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:18,220
person, uh, about just the music business.
That's all we were talking about,

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,770
like kind of how things were.

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,410
And then later I was on for
bitcoin discussion kind of, um,

43
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,200
by Skype or something. But I will say
this in his defense, in all of this,

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,420
I just think that like,
dude,

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,650
that guy has been saying things and
conspiracy theories about all kinds of

46
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,310
things. What do you want?
Call him that or not.

47
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,880
But like forever and like now the,

48
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,210
the situation is like so
volatile that like they're gonna,

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,610
you know, the sandy hook thing. All right.

50
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:51,660
So like they definitely caught fucking
Anderson Cooper having the green screen.

51
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:55,260
And it's probably because they had another
person. They're talking to the mom.

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,940
And then what happened?

53
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,650
There's a video of Anderson interviewing
one of the moms from Sandy Hook and he,

54
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:06,370
he walked, he leans a little too
far forward and his nose disappears.

55
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:11,371
And it's probably because they had a
stand in reporter talking to the mom and

56
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,510
what Anderson Cooper was then
like, uh, put in via, you know,

57
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,980
whatever greenscreen and like kind of
I need to see it. Is there, I mean,

58
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:24,520
I know this is, we're, we're propelling,
but my point is, is like, and I'm not,

59
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,780
I mean,
Sandy Hook,

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,750
I remember where I was when I heard
about sandy hook and it was horrific.

61
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,060
And I don't believe for a
second that there's like,

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,830
it's all fake or anything like that.

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,270
But like Alex's thing has always been
that I remember watching him go to

64
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,290
Bohemian Grove when we
did the fucking record on,

65
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,570
this is back when nobody was
paying attention to them.

66
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,680
It just certain small group.

67
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,160
But I remember we did the black ribbons
record and we took a clip of the

68
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,110
laughing.
He went,

69
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:53,890
he snuck into Bohemian Grove and film
the ceremony and there's like a scene

70
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,950
where they were not a scene.
I get the scene in his film,

71
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:01,630
but there's a part of that where they're
doing the ceremony and they have this

72
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,160
light. It's like Disneyland when you
go well look, the owl God. Yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,610
But it's like it's done in a way where
it's like Disneyland when you watch like

74
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,710
the ferries fly around the castle.

75
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:16,711
Like there was a whole thing where there
was like a laugh that happens at the

76
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:20,480
end of the Moloch thing or whatever.
Or the big owl and the, and the,

77
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,850
the funeral guys drove. So druids,
right. So like I used a part of that,

78
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,130
but I remember watching that
documentary and he, you know,

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,420
his deal has always been so over the
top where like you go, he's like,

80
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,350
where are the, he like go to the local
people aren't near Bohemian Grove.

81
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,140
He's like, we're looking for
where the Satan, it's go to
go do that. Then you know,

82
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:42,240
and it's obviously at this point, it's
not like people who are knowingly sadness.

83
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,960
It's like really old fat rich guys that
go there and there's probably hookers

84
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,680
and all kinds of shit because that's
what happens at big rich things,

85
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,320
especially in the nineties I mean,
so he get away with it. Right.

86
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:57,730
And so like now with all this and they're
crucifying him, especially pointing,

87
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,120
especially the Megan Kelly thing.
And I just feel bad for it. I mean,

88
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,100
especially the Magna Kelly,

89
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,710
because that was clearly a headpiece
with Alex because like they,

90
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,740
she buddied up to him and then then
focus that piece on the sandy hook thing.

91
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,370
You know, they had their talk in
her defense, how could she not?

92
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,370
Of course she's got on if you're going
to come Jones, if I was going to come.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
But if I came here with the,

94
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,920
with the intention of like just talking
to you and then all of a sudden you were

95
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:29,770
like, hey, on this day on this
thing, when you did the thing,

96
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:33,100
like you focused on this one
thing, now it'd be like, Oh man,

97
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:37,540
like this is a hit piece. Like,
yeah, but you're a musician and he's,

98
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,280
this is what he does. I know Alex is my
friend. He's been my friend since 1999.

99
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,200
I get more shit from being friends
with Alex Jones and anything in my life

100
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,400
because you know what I'm just saying
like, I'm sure I'll get hit for this,

101
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:55,550
but the point is, is that point in check
her Twitter, I'm ready for it. I don't,

102
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,050
you know what, I don't have to check
it maybe next year, but like, um,

103
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,630
but the reality is I just think that,

104
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,680
and I'm not even here from
like the side of the, the,

105
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,440
the political point of view is this,
it watch this video, this is the video.

106
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,040
It says d quality Anderson
Cooper's disappearing,

107
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:17,240
knows Greenstein clip debunked. I see
that. Hold on. Do you see what it says?

108
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,160
It says debunked,
which means they had let us down there.

109
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,980
Hold on, let him, sorry. Bad
quality video right here.

110
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,330
It'll play about three seconds.
Then there's a it,

111
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,310
there's a weird part on his nose that
happens, but just say it's a green screen.

112
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,660
I would just,
I would tell the same,

113
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,420
the same people that are looking
for conspiracies and everything.

114
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,410
They use this to say that the
space station didn't exist. Right,

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,530
but hold on right around right there.
Hold on and you can't even really see it.

116
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,580
Something really happened to those
super quick that looks like it was.

117
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,860
It was just like a digital glitch.
That's it. No, that's not it.

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,950
This is what I couldn't find it anywhere.
You've seen the other piece. Yeah.

119
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,680
I mean he leans forward his
nose. Look, here's what I think.

120
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,030
I think that they had a stand in because
he couldn't be there, but hold on.

121
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,930
You might be wrong. I could be. This is,
we're talking about several years ago.

122
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,610
You might have a fucked up memory.
This,

123
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,120
let's try to find the video that said
he was there all week shooting from the

124
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:14,020
exact same location. Maybe it
was, maybe I'm wrong. Got You.

125
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,030
They got to you shooter Jennings.
I would say the same thing.

126
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:21,460
You know, so you make more than a
hundred thousand dollars a year. Dude,

127
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,070
knocks on your door and starts
talking to you about conspiracy.

128
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,800
Well, if you make it $34,000 a year, you
look at people to make 100,000 like Tam,

129
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,780
all my fucking bills. How do you get to
that hundred thousand dollar level? Well,

130
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:38,230
you got to sell out, son.
That's how people look at it.

131
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,100
But there is a threshold. There is a
threshold. I remember when I was broke,

132
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:45,190
I had an a suburban. I wasn't broke,
but it was, I was doing it right,

133
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,240
but I had a suburban and some guy and I
got into a fucking road rage situation

134
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:52,240
on the highway and he goes,
you fucking rich asshole. I go,

135
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:55,990
rich Mike.
I'm trying to fucking suburban man.

136
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,960
Like what is rich to you?
Rich is driving a suburban

137
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,170
man.
I have that.

138
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:08,650
Like I already had the rich thing because
people thought that I was rich because

139
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:12,190
my dad, which I never really, I never
was. I mean he was supportive of me,

140
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,880
but once I got here it was, I was Kinda
on my own. I liked that. But then,

141
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,710
then once I talk about bitcoin with you,

142
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:20,860
like fucking five years ago or whenever
it was, I was here three years ago.

143
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,560
Everyone's like, oh, you gotta
be rich now. Cause that I'm like,

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,930
I can not reject coin.
Yeah.

145
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:29,440
But I mean look what's all the point
up to like seven grand now. Yeah.

146
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,170
Went up to 1930 seconds.
Keep going down sick.

147
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,220
He hadn't dropped very much
below six grand. But I mean,
when I was here with you,

148
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:39,370
it was like less than a grant.
But um,

149
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,440
you know what I'm trying to say about
this is not like I'm not validating his,

150
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,180
this Anderson Cooper thing,

151
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,020
but that dude has always been
fishing for things like that.

152
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,850
And it's always been his gig and
it's been as Gig from Columbine.

153
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,450
It's been as Gig from all of this,
and I understand the,

154
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,010
the passion and the emotion involved with
the children that died in sandy hook.

155
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:05,670
And I have no, I'm not defending him
on that deal, but at the same time,

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,860
that's always been this guy's Gig.

157
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,330
I feel like dad is where he legitimately
fucked up. I don't think if you take,

158
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,060
you take away, I got to defend
him to fucking fuck up. Yeah.

159
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:22,350
But this is a silly fuck up.
He's saying that for sure it was a fake,

160
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,680
but did he say for sure it's a,
hey did people sent me the clip?

161
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,300
They sent me a clip of him saying that
it was 100% fake. He thought it was fake.

162
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,170
So he said it, but he thought it
was fake. Yeah, he thought it was a,

163
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,790
he thought it was a false flag. So
he said it. I mean, but that's part,

164
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,850
that's a part of the conspiratorial
thinking. That's a real problem.

165
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,360
It's like saying, you know,
he said some shit about me.

166
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,150
He said send him some shit
about me and it's 100% not true.

167
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,380
He said that post your interview
with them. I don't remember.

168
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,510
I think it was post,
it was post.

169
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,990
He said that the government threatened
my family to stop talking about

170
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:01,530
conspiracy theories. No, no.
Nobody threatened my family.

171
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,520
No one zero never happened.
Did Not happen. It is fake.

172
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,080
It is a lie. Someone told it to him, I
guess, or he says someone told it to him.

173
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,360
It didn't happen. There's
so, that's me. I understand.

174
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,810
But he didn't understand
like how frustrating that
is. This is a minor thing.

175
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:23,290
Someone him lying, not lying. Okay.

176
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,980
Some he said someone told him,
I believe he's telling the truth,

177
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,620
but it's not true. He could have fucking
called me. He's got my number man.

178
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,640
Call me.
So he didn't even bother calling me Joe.

179
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,600
I'm about to go live from Austin,
Texas.

180
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,330
I need to know did someone
threaten your family?

181
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:44,331
Stop talking about the moon landing and
big foot sturgeon to fucking imagine

182
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,200
they're gonna threaten you.
You got to stop talking about
big foot man. Like, well,

183
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,620
no, I, I found, I did a show.
This is a well documented,

184
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,330
I've talked about it a
hundred times in the podcast.

185
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,460
I did a show called Joe Rogan questions
everything and during that show over a

186
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:03,450
period of six months I fucking
questioned a lot of shit legitimately,

187
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,550
but I did it with researchers. We
had the staff, we had producers,

188
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,800
we went and we,

189
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:14,801
we actually went to like these places
where these people are claiming to see

190
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:16,680
you.

191
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Fo's went to these places where
people are claiming to be able to uh,

192
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,950
what does that shit they do? Remote
viewing, remote view. Oh yeah.

193
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,090
We talked to those great movie.

194
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,780
We talked to all these
people and I found a real,

195
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,490
a clear thread through all of it that
I documented in my 2014 comedy central

196
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,950
special where I said,
here's what you don't find.

197
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,830
When you go looking for
bigfoot black people,

198
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,760
what you do find is
unfuckable white dudes,

199
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,180
you are more likely define big foot.

200
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,840
Then you are black people out looking
for big, full wholesale alien abductions.

201
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:55,690
Probably it's due to,
and they go looking for hidden mysteries.

202
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,520
This is a real big part of it. I know.
I know. My point is from doing that.

203
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:04,030
Show it,
it's soured me off conspiracy theories.

204
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,470
Conspiracy theories were fun for me and
me and my, and especially Eddie Bravo,

205
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:12,220
me and Eddie Bravo would get high and
we'd watched documentaries on flying rods

206
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,600
and all this UFO documentaries
and all the other, the the,

207
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:20,410
the fucking Zachariah sitch and shove
it. And I love that. I love that stuff.

208
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,940
But here's the thing,
I used to watch a,

209
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,660
a chariots of the gods all the time to
get it all falls apart under scrutiny.

210
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,270
It all of it all means does all the girls.

211
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,960
It's fun but it falls apart if
you're being a serious person.

212
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,350
And if you really being honest about what
you actually know, this is the problem.

213
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,820
It's like the saint and the parallels
like that comparison comparing to Alex

214
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,890
Jones, saying that my family was
threatened. It's the same thing.

215
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,560
My family was never threatened.
No one ever threatened me. So,

216
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:46,900
but he's saying this on the radio.
Why is he saying it?

217
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,550
Because someone told him and he may be,

218
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:51,820
he believes it and he also
thinks it's fun to say.

219
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,700
It's the thing to say if you're
really into conspiracies,

220
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,160
but this is the problem with
these fucking conspiracies.

221
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,850
They say things they don't
know are true and they say,

222
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm like they're true now this is fine.
If you just that hold on,

223
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,090
it's fine if it's not an issue.
If you're talking about the Illuminati,

224
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:11,530
if you talking about your kid getting
shot, if your kid's dead and someone says,

225
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,630
hey man, this fucking Tom Smith on
the radio saying you're full of Shit.

226
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:20,560
You're a crisis actor and your kid's not
dead. I mean you're crying every night.

227
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:23,520
You wake up in the middle of night
crying because some fucking guy,

228
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm that you are a little bit, I'm just
discussing this right to be Alex Jones.

229
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,040
I and I defend that as well.
And then when bill for being David,

230
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,870
I'll coat one time I would
have David Allen Coe do.

231
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,310
I played a show with David Allan Coe went,
this is not any like,

232
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,150
let's get sandy hook out of this
cause I'm not trying to talk,

233
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,620
let's make some defending the
right of people to be who they are.

234
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,900
And I love David Alinka
is music and all that.

235
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,930
But I played a show with David Onco one
time and my dad always would tell me

236
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:56,470
these things about him. You know, he, he
really, he liked David and everything,

237
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,930
but there was always kind of
a little distance of like,

238
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,760
there was a showmanship part of him and
were like a good example of this. Again,

239
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,260
distancing from Sandy Hook.
But a good part of it was that when,

240
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,630
when David Allen Coe,
we did a show with him one time.

241
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,690
My mom was over on the side of the
stage with me. I was opening for him.

242
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:17,770
This is many years ago before I even
had a first record out or anything. Um,

243
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,660
and David Allen Coe did sh, you
know, we did our song, our set,

244
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:27,661
and then he played and he was onstage
and he performed a song my mom wrote

245
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,510
called storms.
Never last,

246
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,450
so my mom's over on the side of the
stage and we were talking and my mom are

247
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:36,820
watching it and he's singing
it with his wife and stuff.

248
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,720
The next night I'm opening up for
him and he goes on stage and he goes,

249
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,913
last night,

250
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,570
Jesse culture was right in the front row
when I sang the song with my wife and

251
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:50,080
she was crying and like
I'm sitting there going,

252
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,790
I was here and she was not crying.
She was standing there.

253
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,070
She called and she was not on
the front row. Right, right.

254
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,610
My mom just colder wrote the song
storms never last teasing and,

255
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,760
and that's his character.
That's who he is.

256
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All I'm saying here with like I'm as
forgiving about him lying to the audience

257
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:12,440
because that is what he's
doing at the moment. It's
his. I could sit there and go,

258
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,750
you know what? You're lying. I'm
going to take you in the back.

259
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,570
We're going to talk. I'm going to tell
this audience tomorrow night. He's a liar.

260
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,450
He's a piece of shit. Fuck him. I'm not
going to do that because it's David Alco.

261
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:25,100
He's, you just sit it on the show,
which is, I'm not much larger audience,

262
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,400
millions of pieces of shit.
I'm just saying the character,

263
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,660
but why would I do that to him? Because
it's like, you know, I just feel like,

264
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,620
look man, the Times that I met Alex at
times I've been around him. Yeah man,

265
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:44,510
his Gig is this and he got called
out for a specific thing. Yes.

266
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,900
It involves the lives of children and
everything that I understand that I'm not,

267
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,850
I'm not at all sympathizing for those
family or for him versus those families,

268
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,230
but I'm just saying,

269
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,040
I just think that like at the moment
everything is so hot with this and it's,

270
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:04,010
and it, it's kind of exhausting and it's
the Internet is the reason for it in my

271
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:06,770
opinion, because I think that like
all the years that have come along,

272
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,650
the mass amount of people that
have migrated to social media,

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,360
the way that the integrated
conversations happened,

274
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,900
the way that that stuff
ends up on the news now,

275
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,050
like AOL chat rooms in fucking 1998
that shit did not end up on CNN.

276
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,990
People were not listening
to those. The, the, the,

277
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:26,630
the best tank get the closest you
could get to fucking TV was to catch a

278
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:29,660
Predator when, when you were on
that, at that time, you know,

279
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:33,500
and I feel like at this point
in time, people need, again,

280
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,630
not those families. There are lawsuits.
That's fine. That's, that's their thing.

281
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,890
But, but I just feel like people need to
lighten up a little bit in the sense of,

282
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:47,810
uh, I just think that the social media
thing is very hazardous and I think that

283
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,210
people's faith in all of it, it doesn't
have to do with, with fake news.

284
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:56,090
And it doesn't have to do with
Russian bots and all this shit.

285
00:16:56,091 --> 00:17:00,850
I just think that like Alex Jones is a
casual the, because he's always been that.
