1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,530
You say, okay, so fine,

2
00:00:01,531 --> 00:00:04,530
you docked a little responsibility for
yourself and you can sleep with a clean

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,364
conscience.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,120
What happens if you dropped it full
responsibility for yourself and then for

5
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,940
your family? Lots of the people
who are coming to talk to me say,

6
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:15,900
now I've been really trying to put my
family together. I have made that a goal.

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm trying to heal my family and
bring it together and it's working.

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,410
So here's a story. I love this
story, man. It just killed me.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,380
I was in la at the Orpheum and you know,

10
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:29,640
it's rough downtown in la at places
around the Orpheum too. And Tammy and I,

11
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:33,940
my wife, because she's traveling with
me and is a big help by the way. Um,

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,390
we're wandering around downtown La
that morning after the talk and, uh,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,290
we're walking down the street
and we were on streets.

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,450
We probably shouldn't have been on,
but in any case,

15
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:44,490
because what the hell do we
know being stupid Canadians?

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,090
And so we're walking down the street
and this car pulled up beside us and his

17
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,930
kid hopped out and he's good looking
Latino Kid, 2021, something like that.

18
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:55,530
He jumped over and he said, uh, he's all
excited. He said, are you Dr. Peterson?

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,170
I said, yeah, yeah. And he said, I'm
really, really happy to meet you. Um,

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,810
I've been watching your lectures
for like a year and a half and, uh,

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,130
I've been trying to put my life
together and it's really working.

22
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,970
I'm really doing way better. I really want
it to thank you. And so it's lovely a,

23
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:12,510
when you're walking down and kind of rough
area and somebody pulls up beside you

24
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,720
and they jump out of the car to tell
you how much better their life is,

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,170
that's a pretty good morning. And so,
but then that is, no, that happened.

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,110
He ran back to his car. He said,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,030
He went back to his car and he got out
his dad and they came over together and

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,330
his dad was just smiling away,
like a real smile, you know?

29
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,240
And so as the kid and they had their
arms around each other and they said,

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,510
look like we've really been working on
our relationship for the last year and a

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,310
half and it's going just great
and we want to thank you.

32
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,660
And the father said something like,

33
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:43,020
I'm really happy that you got my
son back to me. It's like, yes,

34
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,800
that's what this bloody tour
has been like. It's great.

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,000
And everybody that's coming
to these talks, that's what
they're trying to do now.

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,270
I've got 3000 people in each audience
and what they're trying to do is figure

37
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,170
out how can I take maximal
responsibility for my own life?

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,620
How can I imbue it with the meaning
that helps me with Stan tragedy and

39
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,190
suffering?

40
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,300
How can I be a better person and wouldn't
it be great if that was of optimal

41
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:09,900
benefit to my family and the community?
You get very emotional about this. Well,

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,610
it's something Joe Jesus, I seem like
150,000 people in the last two months,

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,860
you know,
and this is what it's well,

44
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,960
you'll have a chance to talk
to Reuben about this too.

45
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,900
This is what it's been like. It's
so positive. I can't believe it.

46
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,380
And it's just one person after
another saying like, look, I was,

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
I was having a rough time.

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm really happy that I've
been encountering what
you've been talking about.

49
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,060
I've really been trying to put things
together and it's really helping.

50
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,140
Yeah, Ruben was pretty blown away by
it. We had a long conversation about it,

51
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:37,500
about,

52
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,860
he just feels like there's some crazy
movement going on at something's changing

53
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,120
in the world because of this.

54
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:46,800
This new avenue of learning and
developing is opening up for these people.

55
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,770
Well, well I know, I've been thinking
about that too because you know,

56
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,050
like I said at the beginning,
if you're surfing,

57
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:55,620
you don't want to take responsibility
for the wave. And so you know, I mean,

58
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,161
first of all,

59
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,140
a lot of what I've been telling people
are things that I've gleaned from the

60
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,120
clinical leader and the
psychological literature.

61
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,970
It's not like I'm coming up with
this of my own accord, right?

62
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,360
I'm transmitting information that I've
learned from very, very wise people.

63
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,620
And so there's that.

64
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,240
But also we don't want to underestimate
the utility of the technology, right?

65
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,560
Because we have this long form technology
now and it's enabling us to have this

66
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,910
discussion and so we can get deeper
into things publicly and socially.

67
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,400
Then we were able to
before and I see this,

68
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,720
I see this as a manifestation of that and,
and as an,

69
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,280
and I'm hoping too that maybe,

70
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,550
maybe what's happening cause we were
going to have a lot of adaptation to do in

71
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,810
the next 20 years as things change so
rapidly we can hardly comprehend it and

72
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,250
hopefully the way we're going to be
able to manage that is to think and

73
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:47,020
hopefully these long form discussions
will provide the political or provide the

74
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:51,340
public forum for us to actually think,
to actually engage at a deep enough level.

75
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,970
So we'll be able to master
the transformations. And
I think that's possible.

76
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:55,540
I mean,

77
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,050
part of the reason that I wrote this
book and well part of the reason that I'd

78
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,080
be doing what I've been doing for the
last 30 years is because I really have

79
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,960
believed since 1985 something like that,

80
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,030
that the way out of
political polarization,

81
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,800
the way out of the excesses of the right
and the left is through the individual.

82
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,660
I think the west got that right.

83
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,520
The fundamental unit of measurement is
the individual and the fundamental task

84
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:22,090
of the individual is to engage in this
process of humble self improvement.

85
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,030
I believe that's the case and that's
where the meaning is and that's where the

86
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,980
responsibility is.
And I think,

87
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:30,380
and I'm hoping that if enough
people in the west and then,

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,050
and then have the rest of
the world for that matter,

89
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,420
but we're very polarized
in the west right now.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,350
If enough people take responsibility for
getting their individual lives together,

91
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,680
then we'll get wise enough so we
won't let this process of political

92
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,000
polarization put us back to the same
places that we went so many times in the

93
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:50,110
20th century. I don't see another
antidote for it. It's not political.

94
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,370
It's ethical.
