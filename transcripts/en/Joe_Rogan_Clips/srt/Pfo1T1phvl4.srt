1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,700
Breaking it down. Uh, you
know, smoke up. We help

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,570
through. It doesn't, I ain't gonna lie to
you. They do. Oh thank God it's legal now.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,610
I didn't start until the after my
last, uh, to Leonardo. Really? Yeah.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,210
First Time that I did,

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,450
but honestly it was probably like the
best thing they get it because I was angry

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,630
at the fight. I was angry at everything,
you know, I was like fuck, how can I,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,540
you know this guy, I was like a 10 to
one favorite going into that fight.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,750
That was the one fight with that never saw
much. I was like, don't you smoke them?

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:31,560
Uh,

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,560
so I just had this anger and the only way
I saw my dad can I deal with it was it

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,280
was alcohol. So I kinda turned to
that and you know that it's no good.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,280
It's really, it's the worst way
to do it. Worst way to do it.

13
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,980
It just makes the delusions bigger.
You know what I'm saying?

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,240
It just makes you angry or in and it just,
it just kind of compounded everything.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,880
But honestly like what have smoked weed,
it was like,

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,090
cause at that point like you know what,

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,610
I had tuned it out for so long because
that's what folks did that I kind of

18
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:04,380
associated with being lazy and
the hospice as well. And you know,

19
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:06,290
these fucking me to know,
you know,

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,010
I don't want to be using that because
on a corner. Right, right. Like uh,

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,240
but when I did it, it kind of
opened up the anger towards myself.

22
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,670
You know what I mean? It kind of opened
up my mind for the first time and, and,

23
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:22,350
and I think that actually did help a
lot of help with any, you know, I don't,

24
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:25,440
I don't like chronic or nothing, but you
know, I know what you're saying. Yeah.

25
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,970
I think that's what people were afraid

26
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,100
of with it too,
is that paranoia.

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,050
I would say paranoia is just you looking
at things realistically and even the

28
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,160
possibilities of things
happening realistically.

29
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:40,500
I mean some people for sure if they
have tendencies to be schizophrenia in

30
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,990
particular and then they smoke a
lot of weed, it could spiral them.

31
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,780
Cool. Yeah. Like anything else. I spoke
to my, it's not a good idea. And you know,

32
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,480
do doing too much of any one thing.
It's not a good idea. I mean,

33
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,250
he's the same way. You have to,
you have to be able to balance,

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,560
you know what I mean? You can't just
fucking sit on the couch all day,

35
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,410
but I'm glad

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,110
you're saying that there's a real
benefit to it too. There's some,

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,430
there's a benefit to it
mentally and exposing that
vulnerability and just making

38
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:10,480
you aware of who you really are.
Like maybe to other people.

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,460
We all,
especially men,

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,700
I think we puff our chests up and we like
to look at ourselves as a baby better

41
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:21,340
than we really are because
it's, it's, it's like a shield,

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,270
like a false confidence shield that you
put up to protect yourself from your

43
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,300
vulnerability. But marijuana
says, no, no, no, fuck that.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,330
Why don't you just look at whatever the
fuck your vulnerability and stop doing

45
00:02:31,331 --> 00:02:34,480
that stupid like this is, this is your
problem. This is what you're scared of.

46
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,450
You're like, shit, the weeds,
right? Yeah. It can help you.

47
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,070
Yeah. And it, and it Kinda a Alexa App,
especially after a fight. I remember it.

48
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,900
That really made me, that really helped
me to get over and not just get over it,

49
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,520
but to understand it and understand
what I was doing. Uh, because again,

50
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,090
you just don't, you know, you get that
the informal is maybe it's testosterone.

51
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,430
You get that fucking puppy, just
all, you know, you don't give a fuck.

52
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,220
That's the part of it for sure.
You know, it's just, it's also

53
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,710
think about what you're doing for
live in, man. I'm, it's the most,

54
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,730
one of the most risky propositions
you could do as a human being

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,540
outside of war. That, that too.
That too. And I, and I took
that and to, you know, you,

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,730
you obviously you take that
into consideration when you,

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,260
when you start doing something like this,
uh,

58
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,260
I'd taken into consideration every fight.
Um, you know, once slight one slip up,

59
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,240
you can be, you know, bad news. Sure.
Injury can take you out forever. You know,

60
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,800
especially when the EU was,

61
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:30,460
and when I was in my situation and
even when I was signed with the UFC,

62
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,980
it was like, okay, do I go
and try and be a doctor and
you know, or, you know, I was,

63
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:39,310
I was going into bio mat,
so I was like, I was really,

64
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,460
that seemed more secure.
You know what I mean?

65
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,970
That seems more like attainable easier,

66
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,500
or do I like throw caution to the wind?
And you know,

67
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,090
at the time when I was 18 or
19, uh, no, I guess I'm, yeah,

68
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,960
19. Uh, you know what, that was like
a hard, you know what I'm saying?

69
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:04,090
I'm one of those ones that was hard
for me to make, but it turned out well,

70
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:04,924
I guess,

71
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,150
you know, you're going to have
more than one interest too.

72
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,100
That's also part of the problem.
There's probably,

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,820
there's a lot of people out there that
like doing different things and you know,

74
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,720
you might be leaning more towards one
than the other and you just gotta kind of

75
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,650
soul search.
