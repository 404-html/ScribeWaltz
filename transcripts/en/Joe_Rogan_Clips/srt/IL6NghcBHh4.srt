1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,310
Um, so you, you go to
this one destination,

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,600
you a, you shoot this black Jack.
Will you hooked immediately?

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,710
Yes. Really. It was not about
his fishing part. Actually,

4
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,870
I was still traumatized in the water.

5
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:19,871
I still had panics attacks
when I was in the water and um,

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,490
but I fell in love to second.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,200
I arrived to shore and we barbecue the
fish on a beach and I was like, okay,

8
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,640
this is,
this is for me.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,300
That's the same exact thing that happened
to me when I went deer hunting when we

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:33,380
were,

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,380
me and my friend Brian Cowen and Steve
Rinella and Dan Dody were cooking this

12
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:43,120
deer meat by a fire. And I was like,
this is the greatest thing ever.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,360
This is, the meat was so fresh because
it was like from an animal that was,

14
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,170
you know, literally killed hours ago.
And then we're eating it by, by the fire.

15
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:53,110
I was like, this is, I'm going to do this
forever. This is the greatest thing ever.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,360
Primal, right? It is. It's
you, you, you feel, you felt,

17
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:01,790
what I was told people is that, you
know, when you live in a big city,

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,920
like when I've never
experienced that before,

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,620
I've never felt that I was part
of the ecosystem whatsoever.

20
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,760
Right?

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,270
And then all of a sudden I've been putting
myself into water when I'm surrounded

22
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:17,540
by sharks are big fish or different
things. And I'm like, wow,

23
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,300
we're actually not in top
of the food chain at all.

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,830
There's a lot of stuff on above us. I
can't kill us. And it's, it's, it's,

25
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:29,300
it's caring. It's humbling. And I think
as a person, you have to experience that.

26
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,134
You have to,

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,210
you have to put yourself out of your
conference old to understand that you need

28
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:40,100
to respect what's around you. You could
tell me 10 years ago, ah, you have G. Dot.

29
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,550
Fish because it's baffled DRM. And I'd
be like, yeah, yeah, sure buddy. Right?

30
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,560
And then you see an airplane,
you're like, Ooh, that looks good.

31
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:46,520
Then it's fine and this.

32
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:50,630
But then when you in a water and you see
what's going on and you see the a spa,

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,970
you've been diving for five years old,
southern is empty,

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,760
then it makes you understand that,
you know,

35
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:59,570
we actually have a very strong
impact and it's, it's our job to,

36
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,870
to understand and, and, and respect it.

37
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,660
We're where we're at.
Where did it go? System,

38
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,900
which just the one that we're
the smartest one. Sometimes

39
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,230
we're the only ones that are
consciously aware of our actions and the

40
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:16,820
repercussions. Yes. Our actions.
What, when, when you're,

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,970
you know,
first experiencing this your first time,

42
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,310
eat in this feeling of connectedness
and freedom and just being a part of the

43
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,220
ecosystem,

44
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,020
did you imagine that some or know that
this could be your life and your job?

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,470
Not at all. I've, I've, I've, I've
never been hiking, I'm not a big fan of,

46
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,640
I've never used to be a big fan
of the outdoors. I'm, I've, I've,

47
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:45,030
I don't go to the gym and
exercise. I go to the gym, no, no,

48
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,590
that basically don't eat anything.

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,940
And then all of a sudden I was living in
London and the Nice apartment with two

50
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,960
dogs and a nice car and all of a sudden
I was in fricking Africa being in a Bush,

51
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:59,470
getting catching my own food and sharing
would villages or had nothing eat.

52
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,140
And it was like, okay, well this is,

53
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,930
how did that happen?
Like how did you go from this one trip?

54
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Um, I got invited to film a documentary
and food sourcing and I was like, okay,

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,970
I'm going to try it.

56
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,660
And I fell in love with it and
the second I went back to London,

57
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,370
I remember sitting in my desk and
be like, she, no way I can do that.

58
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,660
There's no way I can keep doing that for
rest of my life. And everybody taught,

59
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,160
I was completely crazy.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,270
I sold everything I and I just left,

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,550
I moved away and I,

62
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,480
I have like maybe two suitcases of
stuff for the past three years and

63
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,420
I was reading somewhere where they were
going to do an interview on you and they

64
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,050
decided not to.

65
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:45,620
They're going to feature you in something
with a decided not to because of

66
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:50,270
concerns for the depletion of
fish in the ocean, and I said,

67
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:54,410
that is one of the dumbest fucking things
I've ever heard because the impact of

68
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:58,370
someone like you, what you're doing,
you for your own personal consumption,

69
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,210
taking a fish a day or whatever you're
getting for your own personal consumption

70
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,320
is negligible in comparison to all these
people that are probably writing these

71
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:10,580
articles that are going to buy Sushi
from commercial fishermen. They're there,

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,890
they're buying fish from the store
that's wrapped in Saran wrap there and

73
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,060
they're, they're completely out of
touch. I don't mean your intouch,

74
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,810
you're as in touch as you can get,

75
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,670
but to think that somehow or another
you're doing something evil because you

76
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:28,070
take photos of it and
put it on your Instagram.

77
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,480
What was that one you had this amazing
photo from a couple of days ago with you

78
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,220
with is this big fish?
It was so fresh and you,

79
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:37,850
you guys were eating pieces of it.

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,220
He had cut a chunk of out
of the out of its tail.

81
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,520
Yes. That was in Thailand? Yeah,
Paquette. Paquette actually, yeah.

82
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,160
We'll just went with this
friend of ours would his family,

83
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,160
and we just went off for today and we
went spearfishing when my phone would

84
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,990
caught a fish and,
and the guy was super happy.

85
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:56,350
He cut it right on the spot and all the
kids were just picking on it and it was,

86
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,470
they were so excited.
The second year he came,

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,790
the second day came that the
boat arrived back to the island.

88
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,470
He just went and grabbed the fish and
they were trying to take pictures.

89
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,150
It was super cute.

90
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,940
What,
what was the argument for not,

91
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,460
what was the piece that they were trying
to put you in where they pulled you out

92
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,300
of it?
What was that about?

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,290
Oh, that story is, it's still
getting me pretty angry.

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,850
She'll basically where I was speaking
at a woman empowerment conference in New

95
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,680
York last May. And then when I
was actually in Thailand, the,

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,160
the woman that is organizing it calls
me and she's like, oh look Valentine.

97
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:33,020
Like I need to talk to you about
something. And it's, you know,

98
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,800
it's a little touchy. I'm
like, what? She's like, well,

99
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,080
one of her sponsors said that if
you speak at a conference thing,

100
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,450
gonna withdraw their
participation and the conference,

101
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,880
what was the sponsor and
the Wall Street Journal,

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,010
The Wall Street Journal.

103
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,130
And I'm like, and she said, yeah,

104
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:56,131
do you feel like that's your lifestyle
is in align with ocean preservation?

105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,180
And that's, and she said something,
she didn't say it directly,

106
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,460
but she said,
and you know me,

107
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,690
I don't mind that you have pictures
and a beanie seat. I'm like,

108
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,890
what do you mean should have my beanie?
You, sorry, my Burkini was not clean.

109
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,570
Like what do you want
from [inaudible] beach?

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,070
When am I supposed to wear
swimming? I'm swimming, you know,

111
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,830
wear your bathing suit.
You mean

112
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,280
your high heels? You know,
being an Insta model,

113
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,190
you're wearing a bathing suit and
there's nothing wrong with that either.

114
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:30,430
But you're wearing a bathing suit
because you're actually in the water.

115
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,270
Exactly. I'm not in Mykonos next
year. Fricking pool. I'm in, I'm in,

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,890
I'm in Africa on a beach
when it's like 110 degrees,

117
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:41,060
what am I supposed to Campbell's Arion.
Exactly.

118
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,450
Respect.
So,

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,080
so I mean,
what did you say to them?

120
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,000
Well that's Wall Street Journal.
That is so crazy. You know what?

121
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:55,000
And I get it from their perspective,
it's a bullshit argument.

122
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:58,930
But from their perspective, it's just
about optics. It's about how it looks.

123
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,853
That's all it is.

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,210
And if they go there and people love to
get outraged about something and if they

125
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:07,540
go there and then they go
to your Instagram and they
find pictures of you with

126
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,440
fish, they're like, well this girl's
cleaning out the ocean all by herself.

127
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,400
She killing home.
You would have to be really good.

128
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,700
I mean, have you ever seen a commercial
fishing boat? What they do? Yes. Yeah.

129
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,080
Most people haven't.
Jamie CV,

130
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,100
you could pull off the horrific affects
of commercial net fishing because,

131
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,690
uh, if you find a video, we
can watch a clip of the video.

132
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,260
It's crazy when you see the sheer
volume of fish that they pull out of the

133
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:38,620
ocean.

134
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,620
And when you realize there's countless
numbers of these boats and essentially

135
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,480
pretty much unregulated and
no one's watching them and
they're doing it all over

136
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,700
the world. I mean there's areas
where you're not allowed to fish,

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but overall it's nothing like the way
we treat wild mammals or wild birds.

138
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,680
The way we treat wild mammals,

139
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:03,940
especially in North America is
they're very closely monitored.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,930
Their numbers, their populations.
We make sure that it,

141
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,040
unless it's an invasive species like
wild pigs, I, here we go, this is,

142
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,690
this is awful.
They take this gigantic net,

143
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,320
they circle all these fish and
then when they're pulling them in,

144
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:24,070
you get to see the sheer volume
so you as they get close.

145
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,530
But that's, that's, that's one of
the smoother way to commercial fish.

146
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,270
Frances ready big on on trawlers
and it's two kilometers wide net.

147
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,580
That is actually,
it's,

148
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,530
it's scraping the bottom completely
destroying every store in the coral.

149
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:42,630
This is his shocks on each side.

150
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,800
This is actually a,

151
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:48,801
a fairly mild one and it looks like
they're getting these little tiny fish but

152
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,020
me, you could find it folks if you
wanted to go and Google it online,

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,690
but that is the issue
too, right? That these,

154
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,400
these go all the way to the bottom and
they destroy anything that they touch.

155
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,230
Like the whole, the bottom of
the ocean just gets dragged in.

156
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,120
All the coral gets destroyed.

157
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,060
It's this extremely destructive, but it's
what, what, that's how you get Sushi.

158
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,640
There's so much the fish industry,

159
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,130
it's not even necessarily
how you get Sushi.

160
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:19,000
It's how you get Sushi so
damn cheap. Right? But it's,

161
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,960
it's by Deloitte. If we keep doing that
is literally going to be no fish very,

162
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:27,250
very, very soon. But then how do you
explain that? And Canada, you know,

163
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:32,080
allowed to spearfish what and you have to
release most of the fish. You run rail.

164
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,610
There's a lot of your stories.

165
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
Most of the fish you rod and reel.

166
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,130
Yeah. In Canada. Like you'd like
the stripers try Beth. And how many,

167
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,680
how many can you get a day straight past
like one a day or something like one a

168
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:47,730
day. Spearfishing, one a day.
And, and the US site and Canada.

169
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:49,020
You not even in touch anything you want.

170
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Can't use spear phishing Canada because
the Anglers Association in Canada,

171
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,910
things that were to evil
basically that you're evil. Why?

172
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,190
Because you can actually see
what you're catching. Yeah.

173
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:06,120
So basically w where did cheaters,
because we can see the fish and I'm like,

174
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,780
how can you be a new
camping chairs on your boat?

175
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,270
Drinking Beers all day telling me that um,

176
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:17,271
the cheater when I'm working my ass off
diving at like 60 feet to catch my fish

177
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,570
to bring it back. And I Rick, smile
life. I was my life drowning and risk.

178
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:25,050
My left would shark service my life
would all sorts of things that can happen

179
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,580
and you're telling me drinking you but
wise when you fricking camping chair that

180
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,110
I'm the cheater. I'm sorry, but no.

181
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,470
Well people always want to think that
everybody else is doing it wrong. True.

182
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,740
You know, vegans want to thank people
that eat meat or doing it wrong.

183
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:42,200
People that eat meat, one of the
things, vegans are doing it wrong.

184
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,410
People fish off a boat.
Want to think that people spearfish,

185
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,530
you're doing it wrong. You'd think
they're probably doing it wrong.

186
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,230
No, I have nothing. Again, catching
you on food as long as you, you know,

187
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:55,000
respectful would,
would do or you do it.

188
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,380
But there was a big scandal in Florida
for the past years with the red snapper

189
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:02,860
by example. And it was about, um,

190
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,100
like recursion recreational fishing.
You allowed a certain amount of,

191
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,460
of red snapper and then a season closes
and then when a season closes as an

192
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,150
individual,
my license to fish is gone.

193
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:21,010
And then he gave it away to the
commercial fishermen and I'm like,

194
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:21,844
whoa.

195
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,140
So basically you telling me that I'm
not allowed to catch that fish for a few

196
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,790
months because of population is too bad.

197
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,470
But then you given my quota to the
commercial boats that are at catching

198
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:36,040
hundreds a day. They like, yeah,

199
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,880
no, it doesn't make any sense.
No, it doesn't. Then what?

200
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,690
Most people are not going to spear fish.
Most people are going to fish,

201
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,120
so they don't, you guys
don't have a voice, right.

202
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,180
In terms of like representative voice
comes to creating these laws and

203
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,270
establishing these, these rules.
There's not that many of you

204
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,580
and the food chain. We're
the plankton is, you know,

205
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:06,260
you had a commercial fishing would very
big, uh, lobbyists, men, a lot of money.

206
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,870
And then you have the Anglo
or juices a little bit.

207
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,810
It's still not super bad because
it's still have big boats,

208
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:15,240
company and equipment is still, I give
the market which is good enough. Right.

209
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,430
And then you had a spear
fisherman, right? I'm spearfishing.

210
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,580
Men's were not a lot in the world's eye.
I couldn't even tell you how many,

211
00:12:22,581 --> 00:12:25,160
but we're not 100 million
us for fricking sure.

212
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,560
It's probably less spear fisherman.
Then there are bow hunters.

213
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,240
Okay.

214
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,260
That's highly possible.

215
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,910
Yeah,
I would,

216
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,910
I would imagine because it seems more
dangerous and difficult than bow hunting.

217
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,410
It seems like the next level,

218
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,110
it seems like one of the most difficult
things you can do if you want to get

219
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,944
your food,

220
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,700
it's because you're going into an alien
environment and you're holding your

221
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,400
breath. True. But actually the human body,

222
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:54,090
that's the main argument I
get from people. They tell
me, Oh, I could never do it,

223
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,340
but every, the human body
is actually made to do this.

224
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,280
So there's a thing called
the Mammalian dive reflex,

225
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,620
and this is very present
and aquatic mammals such as
like, it's like a Dolphin's,

226
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:12,240
your sales and things like that. And the
human have it in a very way, weaker way,

227
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,440
but we still have it.

228
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,790
And so when you emerge
as you face on the water,

229
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,280
your heartbeat is automatically
going to slow down,

230
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,480
especially if the water is colder.
So you bodies,

231
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:28,110
as you're getting prepared to
hold his breath to catch food,

232
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,920
and that's,
that's a new DNA.

233
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,930
Is it preparing to catch food or is it
just preparing to survive to hold your

234
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:39,260
breath on the water? Right.
Some reason. I mean, I, I guess,

235
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,770
I guess that was a very successive,
thank you so.
