1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,050
Uh, it's, it's huge because until then,
I was winging it. You know, it, the,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,970
the way quitting part of the sport is
cloaks and daggers and you're trying to,

3
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:14,550
you're, you're overhearing conversations
and you're googling. So, you know, I was,

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,290
it was pretty much guesswork
on, on, on, on my end. You know,

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,560
I got him to one 45,
um,

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,430
nearly 20 times on my own.
But when we brought George into,

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,170
and I wasn't even just
about making weight,

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,480
what I noticed with him was
that every session was, um,

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,220
productive.
There was no sessions where it was,

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
he didn't have to pop in the
shots or soreness or you know,

11
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:43,350
that that would just be a
normal part. Whereas when we
brought in George, um, that,

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,020
that was a lot,
each session was a lot more effective.

13
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:50,120
So it wasn't just about making the way
it was making the training camp, um,

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,190
where he was improving
the whole way through it.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,240
He got down to one 45 a couple of times
and he looked like, like a monster.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,620
You look like a Zombie. It
was terrifying. Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,890
I mean that had to play a big part in
your decision to no longer have to fight

18
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,820
it that way. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,840
I mean we'd already gone up to one 55
is his final flight before going to the

20
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:13,740
UFC was was at one 55 and I was kind
of like, oh thank God, you know,

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,210
this is just to see what in the better,

22
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:18,480
because when he joined he was a
sort of a scrawny 16, 17 year old,

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,070
but then you start becoming a man.
So getting down there,

24
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:25,230
it was getting scarier and scarier.
And in his last fight outside UFC,

25
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:29,070
I taught you look fantastic.
It was a handy way coat. Um,

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,890
and he just looked at,
so it looked like a tank.

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,990
Now the offer came in a couple of weeks
later, Sean emailed me and said, hey,

28
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,050
we're offering you at one 45 fight in a,
in April.

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,560
And of course I tell Connor and
he's screaming and running around.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,980
We didn't care what weight class. If he
had to say, well in 25, we would have,

31
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,200
we would have done it.
John Specifically,

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,500
you want as as a one 45 and
that we've sort of went,

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,180
we went back to back to that lighter
weight class and it was almost accidental

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,590
and then as soon as we got the
opportunity, you went back up again. Yeah.

35
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,920
He looked very thick at the weigh ins.
He looks heavier, he looks bigger. Yeah.

36
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:08,070
And it, you know that that's a part of
a, you know, the lifecycle of an athlete.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,580
If you're with the same guy for over
a decade, you're going to see changes.

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,980
You know, he's Turkey
now, he's not 18 anymore.

39
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,030
It's these different things going on in
his life. So you have, you know, it's,

40
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,240
that's the benefit I think of working
with someone for a long period of time

41
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,900
rather than, you know, kind
of Jim helping that you,

42
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,640
you'll know what they can and can't do.

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,300
And he does a lot of
unconventional training. Right.

44
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:33,650
In terms of like physical conditioning,
like I know he, is he still doing that,

45
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,540
that the, all that stuff with Ido Portal?
Yeah. Anytime. Ito's in, in, in Europe.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,150
Ped tends to drop in Ireland.

47
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,120
We have a great relationship with them
and he'll play around with that. A,

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,680
you know,
the reality is,

49
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:48,681
is most of our time is going to be spent
on the fundamentals of MMA and grating

50
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,440
with ido is he's, he,
especially in training camp,

51
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:56,230
he will come in near the end where you're
just tired of doing single leg defense

52
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,920
is you're tired of doing pad work and
he comes in, he does these fun games.

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,670
So we're still working out. We're still,
he's firing his brain in different ways.

54
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,230
He's where he's working on coordination
and balance for me is the, you know,

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,510
the head trainer. It's like, it's
a nice break and you know, a, um,

56
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,110
I'm sure it was John John Wayne
power heard say to, you know,

57
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,420
when you have a fight coming up, you know
him anymore that you're going to ruin,

58
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,090
you know, how many kicks you're
going to trow every night. Again,

59
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,090
you want to come in and want to do
so long back and jumping in the air.

60
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:26,650
Spinning Albert's itself at breaks the
monotony and am amazed is fantastic.

61
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,140
You know, cause it's all the
martial arts together. It's,

62
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,140
you're almost never going to get forward
because you can always do something

63
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,980
different, but it's still, there's
still a repetitiveness to it,

64
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,920
but it's nice to break with
something unusual. Now,

65
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,580
how much does training change when
you're dealing with a specialist,

66
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,260
like a guide, like could be who
is just, uh, uh, grappling phenom?

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,300
How much do you shift the emphasis
of the training to take down defense,

68
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,460
working on grappling and
do you work mostly takedown
defense or do you just work

69
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,780
overall wrestling so that takedown
defense becomes a part of that as well?

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,860
Um, all of that. All that. But yeah,

71
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,230
definitely I would maybe talk about later.
Like I,

72
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,960
there's one thing I could change is
that I think I was too defensive in,

73
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,230
in my mindset for this
training camp. But, uh,

74
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,520
Habib has very specific types of
take downs depending on where he is,

75
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,310
whether it's shooting on the low
single, on the, in the middle.

76
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,950
And then on the fence. I, I, you know,
long before Carnaby street, the fire them,

77
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:27,520
I loved watching him. Um, that's
kind of my areas. The fence.

78
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:32,020
I just love right from the Randy
couture days, how to use the fence and,

79
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,610
and a beef does it to a, you know, a new
level, um, you know, when to take downs.

80
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,250
The hidden Conor [inaudible], he hadn't
actually done it until the eloquent,

81
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:42,250
the fight. So it was nice that we kind
of got to see that at the high crotch.

82
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,200
I was, I, I see a bit of DC in that,

83
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,260
the high crotch and then trip on the
far leg and I think he blocked the ones,

84
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:50,680
but he did catch him with it. Um, so, you
know, it was a very specific take downs.

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,370
Um, definitely for this training camp
was the most specific that we went.

86
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,240
And then I remember about a
week out or whenever it was,

87
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:02,290
he did an interview and he said, well,
if he doesn't make it a fight, Tony,

88
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,570
I don't care who it is.
And I was going down it.

89
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,150
I hadn't even looked at
Tony's fights in so long.

90
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:11,440
So me and the other coaches
like start like, okay, what
does he do again? Oh yeah,

91
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:15,520
he has that style because we
work so specific for this one.

92
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,230
Um, Tony could possibly be a fight
in the future. When you, when you,

93
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,860
when you think about the future now, after
the could be fight, how, what do you,

94
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,980
what are you thinking?
Are you thinking about just rest,

95
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,340
let the dust settle and then look at
the landscape? Like what, how did,

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,550
how did you approach it?
I might, but he doesn't,

97
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,970
what is he screaming and shouting
for the rematch within minutes?

98
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,110
It's hard to push for that rematch
though, after that fight. Right? Sure. No,

99
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,340
I understand the logic of that. You
know, Tony's kind of errands and stuff,

100
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:48,230
but I also understand
this is a business and

101
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,590
it will be a huge fight. You know, the
rematch would be a huge fight. Does it,

102
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:58,591
don't you think that it would be difficult
to sell because of how dominant could

103
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,930
be, wasn't that fight? I'm sure. Uh,

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,950
I do think the Roundtree showed
promise. Um, I, I, like I said,

105
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,980
I would like to have change
things up a little bit,

106
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,900
specifically a more offensive mindset.
I thought defensively we did quite well.

107
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,870
Um, but offensively we weren't
really where we usually are. And,

108
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:22,560
and you know, right when the fight was
over, I was thinking, you know what,

109
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,200
I was kind of going into this like
not to lose, but not to win, you know,

110
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,080
and his shots warden is Christmas.
They normally are.

111
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,690
He had opportunities to hit him,
especially in the third round.

112
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,410
And he just seemed to be the range
at the time. Something was off.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,970
And then I had to do with the fact that
he hadn't fought at my main two years.

114
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,970
Absolutely. You know, I'd say
right. Yeah, of course. Of course.

115
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,490
And we tried to mimic as
close as we could in the gym.

116
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:50,480
And I brought in guys that he didn't
know and I would say, this is fight day.

117
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,190
And He, you know, he would do what George,

118
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,150
exactly what it's gonna do on fight day
and we'd have a referee and so t to get

119
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:59,210
the fight feel, but it's still in
the gym, which rides, you know,

120
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,390
is he at a position now where every
fight has to be a gigantic super fight.

121
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:09,080
And is that, is that a problem in that,
you know what, I thought after the fight,

122
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,840
after it was all over, I was like,
you know what a good fight would be.

123
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,430
It would be him versus Pettis.

124
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,540
Like that would be a really good fight
and it would be a really interesting

125
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:22,160
fight in terms stylistic matchup and
it would be a great fight I think for

126
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,930
Connor to sort of just get a wild three
round or I guess it would probably be a

127
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:30,590
main event. It would be five rounds,
but oh well it would be a wild fight.

128
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,630
They would probably favor him. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean the boxing have, you know,

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,500
when Tyson fury was kind of coming
back, the government, you know,

130
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,430
not the toughest guy in the world.
It doesn't happen.

131
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,670
It never doesn't happen to them.
And me

132
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,990
specifically to USC and there's
an issue with that I think. Yeah.

133
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,060
You know, he was, you know, I
did. And as it is, early stages,

134
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:55,250
we was fighting all the time.
And as is natural,

135
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:58,820
as you get older and as you achieve more,
it is going to start becoming, you know,

136
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:02,060
once or twice a year. That's just a
natural progression. As an athlete,

137
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:02,930
I don't care who you are,

138
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,160
but the wild fights that he
could have at 155 pounds,

139
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:12,161
whether it's James Vick or just engag
or pedis or there's good fights for him.

140
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,370
Yes. That aren't necessarily could be,
they aren't necessarily Tony Ferguson,

141
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,060
but they're a good fight
to get that timing back,

142
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,430
get everything locked in,
you know,

143
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,290
100% but you have to factor in his
personality and he's only fighting now for

144
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,090
fights that are really interesting to him.
He's not that interest in anybody.

145
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,080
Not that I've heard Mayweather paper.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well money, money,

146
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:40,460
money, money. Right. So, you know.
Yeah. What more can he, you know,

147
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,330
even with his spending,

148
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:45,890
well kind wouldn't be the eye on the
future and on the eye, on the rematch,

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,371
you know,

150
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:50,690
like getting everything dialed in so that
when he does have a rematch with Kirby,

151
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,980
he is Samurai sword sharp. Yes sir. Yeah.

152
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,040
As opposed to having two years off,

153
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
one one boxing fight in between them
and then such a grappling heavy contest.

154
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,700
Yeah, I don't disagree. That
would be a trainer. You know,

155
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,530
for me as a trainer
that would be the ideal.

156
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,150
But it be hard to motivate him for that.

157
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,300
I think it would be hard to motivate
them and it's, it's not the, you know,

158
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,510
it's not really the UFC model.
It's obvious it was going to be though.

159
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,360
You know what I mean?
It was going to be those two.

160
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,220
Anybody could tell the UFC what
time it is. It's Conor, Khabib time.

161
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,270
I mean if anybody is the guy that
can say, hey, this is what I want.

162
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:31,920
I want a fucking tune up fight. I want a,
I want a tough guy. He absolutely could.

163
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,380
Yeah. And he absolutely wouldn't.
You know who is like when, when,

164
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:40,050
when he lost the Diaz as
one place and a backstage,

165
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:42,960
he was screaming and shouting
at all the top brass.

166
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,350
So they get getting the rematch at
one 70 as quick as possible. I'm on,

167
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm in the background going, please
don't, did you not see that fight?

168
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,700
He's a terrifying the individual
that's good at one 55, five.

169
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,610
Yeah. Okay. Maybe you meet him again,
but he was not letting that go.

170
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,440
And then four months later
he fought the exact same guy.

171
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,950
That's where he is right now with Khabib.
That's all I,

172
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,690
that's all I'm hearing from you. Well
listen, you could sell it for sure.

173
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,950
Especially with the fucking
chaos after the fight. You know,

174
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,600
just keep Dillon dance at home.
He's grounded.

175
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,090
Yeah. So with what would
you do differently? Um,

176
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,901
like I said from it,

177
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,530
from a strategy point of view and my
number one thing would be to be more to

178
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:32,740
think more offensively that we definitely
had opportunities to learn shots on

179
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,180
when Connor land shot, you know, you know,
watch the Eddie fight back again. It's,

180
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:40,440
it doesn't take them a whole lot of shots.
He rarely misses, you know, even if,

181
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,100
if you look at strikes that it didn't
land, those strikes were for a reason.

182
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,220
They were to see what way he holds his
hand. See what we mean? It was like,

183
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:47,791
you know,

184
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,310
you used to love watching Anderson civil
back in the day and I thought they were,

185
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:53,130
you know, they have a similar
kind of approach, but this one,

186
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,590
we just didn't seem to be landing in my,
only,

187
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,180
when I look back at the training camp,

188
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,020
we did spend most of her time
with a defensive mindset,

189
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,030
and I think that's a mistake.
