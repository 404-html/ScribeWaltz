1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,050
I can't be all the way.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,080
Don't think that applies to a British
Iraqi gay nonbinary and also identifies as

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:09,290
Muslim person.
I think you're out of your line.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,210
I identity or lane Irish,

5
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:15,670
Italian straight white male
from Chicago who he'd like.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,340
I just think we don't need
all these labels. You Glamor,

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,960
you are allowed to be whoever you fucking
want to be and I support the fuck out

8
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,420
of who you are. Always do your shit. Well,

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,540
it's almost always people that don't have
a lot of other things going for them.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,790
Yeah. Cause you got to, you have to,

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,850
when someone says Stephen
Hawking's identifying as a British,

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,540
he identifies a debt guy now when
he was alive. Yeah. Brilliant.

13
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:40,800
British physicist slash
heterosexual atheist,

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,240
a heterosexual identify
who by the way was, um, uh,

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,160
rebuttal freak riddled with infidelity.
I've never met a guy, so not capable of,

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,500
of cheating and found a way
to cheat on his wife. Well,

17
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,840
apparently it gets still get it up.
Oh,

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,460
well apparently even though his body
didn't move, his car could feel things.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,353
That was his sign.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,250
The scientist he used to go to was Eric
Weinstein told me about this. I was like,

21
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:08,850
what? He's like, yeah, he's a freak. And I
was like, wait, what? And he's like, yeah,

22
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:12,300
he used to go to strip clubs and there's
like videos of him like rolling into a

23
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:15,720
strip club in the wheelchair. Like
he would go. That was his thing.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,470
Where'd you hear it littered with
infidelity. Did you hear that?

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,120
He cheated on his wife all the time.
We were in that fucking movie. The,

26
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:24,870
the whole reason that he,
well,

27
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,420
I mean the whole reason that he left his
wife was because he fell in love with

28
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:27,871
somebody else.

29
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,870
But wasn't it like a nurse who was taking
care of what the truth was that he was

30
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,410
watching my balls.
If you Google,

31
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,660
if you Google Stephen Hawking, he was, he
was always fucking around. Oh. You know,

32
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,150
come on man. He was always
fucking around. Um, yeah.

33
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,170
That's once he got a taste
of the good life. Yeah. Once
he got to taste good. Yeah.

34
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,260
Man. That cosmology cash. Yeah.

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,310
You know what also helped me like my
cock and the play by the rules the world

36
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:03,210
dealt me. The shitty has got please. I'm
a super genius. Please. Gary's. What?

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,990
I fucking agree. Do whatever the fuck
you want to do and you want to leave me.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,290
You should leave me. Why would
you only fuck me? Yeah. I'm, I'm,

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm barely here. I'm a machine
now. I use this finger to talk.

40
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,140
No, it fell apart. It was his eyes and
his fucking and his mouth. That's up.

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,590
Why he couldn't use his hands. It
was just his eyes, right? Yeah.

42
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:27,180
Wasn't it as kind of a
thing where he could kind of
click? He would do. He would,

43
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,990
he would look at something too. He had a
thing where it was take the away, then I,

44
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,170
he would look at Shit and it
was maybe I want to see your,

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,050
so can you sit on my face? Face
face. Don't kill me though.

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,910
Now I have can't figure out the universe.

47
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,750
I don't smother me with your pussy.

48
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:48,230
I need to figure out how stars work.

49
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,610
Are black holes real or is
it just a brown star? Please.

50
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,810
I don't want to drown in your pussy.
I'm still on the subject of dark matter.

51
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,530
I'm trying to figure out the universe
before I know in my pants. That's what I,

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,080
that's one of the strippers that he
looked up what it was called dark matter.

53
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,150
I try to, I'm trying to think
around dark matter. Dark matter.

54
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:15,100
I could see her with a big old fur
coat. Hell yeah, a big old for Bush.

55
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:19,810
I see a big old message with a, with a,
a pencil because her nails are too long.

56
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,850
Logs can't text that dark matter.

57
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,350
Is that possible that you could grow your
fingernails to girls with long nails?

58
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,660
They probably have a terrible time
texting. Well, how did they touch with,

59
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,250
they try to touch with their finger.
Right?

60
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,570
But if you have a crazy ass long nails,
you'd be like [inaudible] voice text. Oh,

61
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,860
I always text the whole time.

62
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,450
But then you gotta use your nose just
to get to the fucking microphone thing.

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,760
That's what this, that's what I was
just reading about how this worked.

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,390
He had a infrared sensors on his glasses.
See what I'm saying?

65
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,310
I was on his eyeballs
movements in his cheek,

66
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,720
which then translated into a software
program that a lot of them to navigate a

67
00:03:55,721 --> 00:04:00,010
system without his hands
and then eventually turned
into his speak his text to

68
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,260
speech. I just want to fuck
Ken sound one fuck that.

69
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,050
Facts speak functionality
which takes techs,

70
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,060
techs rights and turns it into
speech in his iconic voice. Yeah.

71
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:14,650
He apparently he liked that
voice and didn't want to
upgrade it. Cause like Siri,

72
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,510
like if you talked to see like who do you,

73
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,660
do you have a specific kind of Siri
like my Siri is an Australian lady.

74
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:21,160
Like Hey Siri.

75
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,020
I Dunno what's cracking bitch.

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,710
I don't know how to respond to that.
Okay,

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,933
okay.

78
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,760
Does not a Syria, but
that's how I have, I have a,

79
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,623

to search the web for love? Ooh,

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,500
that minus, I think it's the same one is
British. I think we have the same one.

82
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,320
I used to have an Australian lady.
They swapped me out the new, uh,

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,300
maybe they don't like Australia.
The new,

84
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:55,110
upgrade it fuck out his voice in 2004.

85
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,650
He was a good enough with it.
This is how I talk.

86
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,900
I will always be this. I am a bro Man.
It was funny for you heard his voice.

87
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:08,250
It was like Yo, what's up with Stephen
Hawking? It's real hardcore. Yeah,

88
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:11,130
like a super ghetto
voice. Yo Yo, what's up?

89
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,530
The talk to Gie up in this pitch
is a pigging out this motherfucker.

90
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,760
Then fuck what's up with

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,240
They used to be a or no dark matter. Dark
