1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,380
Fight derrick lewis. I'm, I must feel
like shit for Steve Bay. You must be like,

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:06,510
God, don't you feel bad
for Steve Bay? Yeah.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,360
Cause like if Daniel
Cormay wasn't injured,

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,320
he would have got that shot click.
He was him was okay.

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,090
He would have got that shot in New York.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,890
But now Steve Bay's and everything get
that shot. Dude. How about John? Steve,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,680
I feel tend to spit balling. I
like gems here, but I fee, I feel,

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,400
I feel terrible for steep bay to
really do because I mean there's,

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,280
how long has it been since he lost
the title? A year here. A year.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,740
How long has it been and,

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:38,741
and he's tried to fight
June two 26 oh my gosh,

12
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:43,860
he's 26 so it wasn't a year.
DC DC's fought twice more than a year.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,420
February, February. Fuck.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,350
Oh, what are you talking about?
Do you not know how to count? No,

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,890
that's wrong with you. I dare you. I
didn't cut, what'd you say to 26 oh, oh,

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,690
oh. I thought you were
saying. Okay. I was like,

17
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,690
how dare you?
How dare you make that mistake.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,250
You will see two 26 okay, well that's
July, so that's not quite a year.

19
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,360
He's been relevant. He's fought
twice since that loss loss of Steve.

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,350
He hasn't fought. Damn.
It's heartbreaking.

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,040
Damn. Jon Jones, Steve Bay

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,730
coach, Javier Mendez can Tim wise
tp meal. Chuck is waiting for,

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,670
you can use to move on.
It's not happening.

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,620
I don't think he necessarily is waiting
for it. No, he is. He even wants it.

25
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,280
He wants it, but I don't think they're
offering him a valid fight him.

26
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:37,540
In the meantime,
I haven't heard any big fights that are,

27
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,610
that are being mentioned. I
mean, obviously I could be wrong,

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,433
you know.

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,560
Well, the only, the only thing they
could really offer him as what is funny,

30
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:50,550
I have all these questions and
I don't ever call Dana. Dude,

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,570
come on Bro.

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,450
I don't call Sean Shelby and I'll call
them McMahon or I just sit here with you.

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,080
We Talk Shit.
We just speculate.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,050
Total stroke total speculation.
