1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,010
Pan Out.
I had a similar idea.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,300
Anthony Kumina were alive,
sir. I love it. Joe Rogan.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,950
If it was not for you, oh
my God, this, this would not
exist. That which is insane.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,230
That is 100% actual fact.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,790
I was watching you doing live from
the compound. Me and Brian Red Band.

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:23,880
We're sitting in my fucking living
room and we were watching you.

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,980
You were fucking playing karaoke.

8
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,240
You're singing karaoke with a machine gun
in front of a green screen. I was like,

9
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:30,691
this guy,

10
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:35,691
this guy just set up his own studio like
he already has opie and Anthony show.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,170
At the time you guys were at Sirius Xm
and he just decided to do this thing and

12
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:43,110
your basement just for a goof.
Yeah. It was like a hobby,

13
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,530
but it's like guys who don't have kids,
married, not married, don't have kids,

14
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,250
so I have anybody telling them what to
do and they also have disposable income.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,290
Then you get to see what
guys really want to do.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,450
They want to sing karaoke with a machine
gun in front of a green screen. Yeah.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,660
It was crazy. Crazy gun guy.
Karaoke, so I could do that.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,520
If I was married, I would have a wife that
would lose her mind at my living room.

19
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,660
My living room table that you're
supposed to have a candle on and little

20
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:13,350
chotchkies and stuff is a widescreen,

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,390
a computer monitor and a gaming
system right next to the table.

22
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:21,990
I have a gaming computer that's just
unbelievable and I sit there and just play

23
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:26,260
video games. So the table itself is a
gaming monitor? Yeah, the whole tape.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,870
Well it's one of those touch screen ones.
No, it's, it's a giant wide monitor.

25
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:35,760
It's like a like 40 inches wide. So
that's the table? No, it's on the table.

26
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,230
The table is big, heavy metal
thing, but it's just everything.

27
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,470
There's VR goggles up on
the console by the TV.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,410
It's just a sensors around
the room for the VR.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,470
It's a playground and
you're absolutely right.

30
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,570
Guys will spend their
money on having fun if,

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,720
if allowed to. That's what this place is.
This place is insane. Joe's in my house.

32
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,510
You go to my house, it's my wife's
house. Say That's how it works.

33
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,320
I have one elk head on the wall. That's
all I have. That's all you're allowed.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,590
I laugh at guys and they have
the, uh, the man cave. Like, dude,

35
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,430
come on down to the man cave. The chicks
aren't allowed down here. I got this,

36
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,570
the TV that, and I'm like, no
horror places. The whole house.

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,130
She relegated you to one room
and go and you're happy about it.

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,150
You're happy that you got one
room. Happy wife, happy life.

39
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,650
That's apparently it didn't work.
It didn't work for me.

40
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,280
You know that the row quote that I say
way too many times in this podcast,

41
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,780
but I love the quote. Most men live
lives of silent desperation. Wow.

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,040
Yeah, that is true. It's
100% true. It was, uh,

43
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,920
I was married for a time and it was a,
it was a nightmare.

44
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,960
It was a living hell for me.

45
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,140
The only thing that got me through
as many years as I was married,

46
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,350
because I was married nine years and
I don't remember one happy year out of

47
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,034
those nine,

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,820
but I had gotten into radio pretty
early on in that marriage. Um,

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,800
and that was my life.

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,150
So I dedicated myself no matter how
miserable anything else in my life was.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,620
I was doing radio, so I thought it was
awesome. I have a theory about that.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,633
I really do.

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,050
I think that a person needs a certain
amount of suffering in their life.

54
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,490
And if you look at some of
the all time great comics, oh,

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,990
or even all time great radio
personalities, like Howard Stern,

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,290
Howard stern during his
hay day when he was,

57
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,000
the fucking man was miserable. Right?
Right. And he would talk about it.

58
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,400
He would hide in his basement. I
love those stories. You realize like,

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,310
here's this guy. He's the, you know, the
biggest radio personality ever. He's,

60
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,390
he's huge.
And yet he's got to hide and,

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,790
and he's just talking about masturbating
and hiding from his wife and you can't

62
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,000
get any sex. And you'll like,
it didn't matter if he was huge.

63
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:52,390
It didn't matter if he was famous. Didn't
matter how Richie was, it didn't matter.

64
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,950
He's just hiding in the basement.

65
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,270
And that anx came out on the radio like
you related to him. You understood it.

66
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,940
Yeah. Yeah. I get that. Um,

67
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,710
and it worked for me because there was
a lot of misery. Like when I started,

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,300
uh, doing really well, we
moved back to New York from,

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,930
from Boston after we got fired.
[inaudible] opiod myself.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,530
You guys got fired for saying
that the mayor died? Yeah,

71
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,960
it was an April fool's gag. And,
uh, because we always thought the,

72
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:25,040
the radio April fool's jokes were
so stupid and Hokey and uh, yeah,

73
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,050
we changed the format to all Elvis and
it's like after 10 minutes they say April

74
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,030
fools.
So we're like,

75
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:36,140
let's just go balls out and
say the mayor's dead and
to have a news guy come on

76
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:37,370
and report it and everything.

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,640
And then it was supposed to subsequently
get more outrageous as the, uh,

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,980
the show went on. So by the
end of it, there was a, uh,

79
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,020
Taiwan male hooker in the car with them
and they crashed because he was getting

80
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,930
a blow job or stuff like it was
going to get really ridiculous,

81
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,640
but they stopped it early on and
never allowed us to even mention it.

82
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,820
So people really thought he died.
Although it's kind of stupid.

83
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,130
You go to the ONA show for your news,

84
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,900
but back then the internet wasn't
what it is now. Exactly. Yeah.

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,740
Dinner was it even it was barely a
thing. It was barely a thing. Uh,

86
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,570
cause that was 90, 97 around there. 98.

87
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,760
What year did you get on? You'll
probably early. I was on really early,

88
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:26,760
like the 80s. I was on bulletin
boards servers, uh, and uh,

89
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,890
used to play Trivia Games with
a 300 baud modem with people.

90
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:36,070
And I thought it was amazing. Uh,
even then and then in, in the, uh,

91
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,280
when we were up in Boston,

92
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,210
I bought a digital camera that
was just this giant thing.

93
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:43,960
And I had a laptop and
other giant thing and uh,

94
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,960
I would take pictures of what was going
on in the studio and then post them that

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,570
night on a website that I figured out.

96
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,570
I used to code the html myself and make
a website just to post pictures and

97
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:58,670
links and people thought it was amazing.

98
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:03,410
Like you're seeing what we talked
about that day. Uh, it wasn't instant,

99
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:08,180
but it was pretty cold. And then I started
doing videos. I was able to put video,

100
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:13,070
like maybe eight second clips of nude
girls if they were in the studio and pop

101
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,550
that up and people loved it. Uh,
and then I got a bill from the,

102
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,850
the company for bandwidth
and I didn't know bandwidth.

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,800
It was a $12,000 bill for a
month. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I,

104
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,470
there was no,
there was no compression or anything.

105
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,630
I'm pumping video out to thousands
of people on compressed. And uh,

106
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,280
apparently, um, they had that happen
a couple of times. So they told me

107
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,620
just don't do it again. They didn't
make me pay, which was pretty cool.

108
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,840
But at that point I had to learn about,
you know,

109
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,260
coding and a compression
and things like that.

110
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,060
So you just kept doing it and just,

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,650
just put them in some sort of a
compressed format. Yeah. Would you use,

112
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:58,340
do you remember back then? Oh God,
I think it was like a for audio.

113
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:02,540
It was real audio, which was hilarious.
Right. The little player, he'll play it.

114
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,110
Real audio player would pop
up. And then for video, God,

115
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:09,410
I can't even remember what it was, but
it was terrible. It was all pixelated,

116
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,240
you know, like 10 frames per minute and
kind of weird to things like real audio,

117
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:16,700
which was everywhere.
Just they just quit.

118
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,340
Then they gave up around
still, unless they changed
into something else, you know,

119
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,960
or kind of got bought out by somebody up.
Yeah, yeah. That's happens to everything.

120
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,741
But honestly,

121
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:32,180
if it was not for you and your show
live from the competent and for opiate,

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,380
hilarious because opie and Anthony was
the first radio show that I re what are

123
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,780
wherever realize you don't
really have to have a format.
