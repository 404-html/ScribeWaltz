1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,480
I do do other things,

2
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:06,130
whether it's podcasting all the time
or doing the UFC commentary, like,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,190
you know, if I'm, if I watch some
fights and I started posting about MMA,

4
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm not trying to be funny and it's
just, it's just what it is, you know?

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,170
Well, yeah, you're, you're, you're
living in a lot of different worlds, but,

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,340
and I look at your Instagram,
you're cooking meat, right? Yeah.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,710
But for me, I'm thinking, how the
hell does he get the meat? Uh,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,560
like from, from top to bottom, like medium
rare throughout, you know, like that's,

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,070
for me, that's more of a learn.
I can teach you Sebastian,

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,980
I could teach you, you, the
key is cooking it slowly. Okay.

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,090
So you got like this grill
or whatever Drager yeah,

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,090
it's a pellet grill pellet grill.

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,490
If it gets my meat the way Jimmy,
well in La,

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:53,590
well, I'll have them send you
100%. Perfect. Um, but yeah,

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,560
he's the only one of those are,
do you know how they work? No. Oh,

16
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:58,550
it's fucking fantastic. It's, it's uh,

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
like say if someone wants to make
a desk like this out of hardwood,

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,260
like this oak, the saw dust,
they take the saw dust from,

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,090
from saw mills and they compress it and
they make these little tiny pellets.

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,500
And so there's no chemicals, no
nothing. It's just wood. And then the,

21
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,860
the way a pellet grill works is a bunch
of really good companies that make, um,

22
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,130
uh, I use a trigger, but I've used
a Yoder that's a great one too.

23
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:24,550
And Green Mountain grills, that's
a great one. This, uh, they have,

24
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,670
they're all worth the same way. They
have a heating element and a worm drive.

25
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:32,260
So you have this big bucket of these
pellets and then the worm drive feeds the

26
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:36,130
pellets into this heating element and
the heating element makes the pellets

27
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:38,260
catch fire.
So once they catch fire,

28
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,090
it's a matter of how much pallets
and how much fan to keep the,

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,580
that's what it looks like up there.
So then

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,760
see, look at this job. Yeah, no,
I'm looking at this and I'm like,

31
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,270
that looks like a, that looks
like a lot of work. First of all,

32
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:57,590
you've got to get a pet, a side
pellet, the catchall, but it's there.

33
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:00,290
It comes with the whole thing. Yeah, but
then you've got to go by the pellets.

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,840
I'll have it delivered to you.
I'll have it to live.

35
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm trying to get more people to
cook like this because it's just

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,310
would in fire. It's the
best. There's no chemicals,

37
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,570
there's no bullshit and hold
lighter fluid, no gas, no nothing.

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,140
So your entire me fire,
your entire meet process is on this grill

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,550
except the end at the end.

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,700
This is a different grill than I have
because this one has a thing on the side.

41
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,451
If you see that thing on the,

42
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,990
on the right hand side is
like a like that looks like a,

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,710
like a direct flame thing. Looks
like it's got gas as well. Right.

44
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,750
The one that I have doesn't have that,

45
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:37,400
but at the end I sear it at the
very end on a cast iron frying pan.

46
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:42,080
So I cook it from between 225 to
275 degrees, which is pretty low,

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,290
and I'll kick it until it
hits an internal temperature,

48
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,460
depending on what I'm cooking.
Some are around one 22 the maximum,

49
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,360
like one 30 ish.

50
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,290
Then I take it out and then I have
a cast iron frying pan is hot as a

51
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:59,291
motherfucker and I use either a beef
tallow or grass fed butter and I see her

52
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:04,550
that shit out of that with some garlic
and I throw some time in there and

53
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,500
forking,
flip it over and get that good senior.

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,030
And then I let it sit for
a minimum of 10 minutes.

55
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,110
I think he's realized that mother Oh.
Oh,

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,130
okay. So you're, you're
me is unbelievable.

57
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,440
I've seen it on the thank you care
when you say that it's the girl.

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,720
So I do something similar, but I do it
in the oven. I don't do it. That'll work.

59
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,440
I do a slow cook in the
oven and then I take it out.

60
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,390
I let it rest for I think 15 minutes
and then I do a sear job. Oh.

61
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,890
But I'm always looking for
better ways to cook meat.

62
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,450
And, uh, if, if you're saying
that this Palette thing, uh,

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,950
does it add any flavor?

64
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:46,600
And that's what's good about it because
it's smokey hardwood. Gotcha. So you're,

65
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,600
it's all smoke. You lift the thing up,
smokes coming out of it and everything.

66
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:53,190
It's a nice aromatic,
smart, that's what I know.

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,120
It's like cherry smoke or oak or you know,
Hickory or maple,

68
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,570
all these different hardwoods. You could
choose a bunch of different. Perfect.

69
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,620
Okay. So we're not getting that in
the, in the oven. No, I need, no, no,

70
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,561
it's different.

71
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:09,100
And there's also a setting on a trigger
called super smoke where you hit it,

72
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:12,400
it goes to, it can't be over 225,
but that's what I like anyway.

73
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,010
And you put it on two 25 and it just
constantly fans hard and pushes all this

74
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:17,411
smoke.

75
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:22,411
So it just gets his deep rich smoky
flavor in the meat Molly's but a,

76
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,450
I like, if you're not into that
too. I like a regular Weber Grill,

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,220
like one of those little fucking Weber a
that, you know, the little Hibachi. Yeah.

78
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,370
What are those things called that you get?
What would you call them?

79
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,380
Like a drum looks like a half a drum.
Like a barrel fucking thing. Yeah.

80
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,050
But what are those, those way it looks
like it looks like a cuts like a black uh,

81
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,520
yeah. The black ones
like steal those. What?

82
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:53,470
I like those with, uh, just lump charcoal,
that puts a nice flavor on it too.

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,560
The key is don't fuck
around with the chemicals.

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,910
When you start using lighter
fluid in shit that, that,

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,700
that adds weird tastes to your food does.
Yeah.

86
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,830
And even if you buy that lump charcoal,

87
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,550
those charcoal briquettes rather
the charcoal briquettes there's,

88
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,810
there's something in them that makes them
that shape. They have to, and then they,

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,800
they, you know, they light fast. Yeah.
Cause it's just fucking gasoline in them.

90
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,900
Like,
but lump charcoal,

91
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:23,940
meaning they just take hardwood and
then they burn that shit down to took,

92
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,950
you know,
that clunky looking lump charcoal.

93
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,150
Just get that stuff and then take some
newspaper and rolled a newspaper up.

94
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,890
And one of those you ever used one of
those little, uh, um, those chimneys,

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,900
do you know what those things are? No.
It's a barbecue chimney. It's like a,

96
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,710
you pour the charcoal in this tube and
at the bottom of the tube you take like

97
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,020
pieces of paper and your
crump alarm up balls,

98
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,490
and then you like the balls on fire and
the fire rises up from the paper to the

99
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:55,000
charcoal and it lights the charcoal on
fire and then you dump the charcoal out

100
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:58,690
into the grill. And that, that puts a
nice flavor on it too. That's just a,

101
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,910
but it's again,
same kind of feeling.

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,660
It's like would just this wood
flavor on the meat that's nice. Sold.

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,690
Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm a
big fan of cooking. I love it.
