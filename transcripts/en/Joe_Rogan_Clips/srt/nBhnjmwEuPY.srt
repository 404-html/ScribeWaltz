1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,900
Speaking of delicious. Are
you hunting at all? Yes. Yes.
Yes. What's your hunt? Well,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,560
I mean I'm going through the two elk
that I've given away a lot of it too and

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,530
got shot last year. Every year
I scheduled to elk hunts and uh,

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,780
assume I'm going to strike out.
And uh,

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,320
the last two years I've been very
lucky and I got to elk each year.

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,350
So it's breaking the rules of the
secret in think and grow rich, you know,

7
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:23,850
to assume you're going to strike out.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,130
I supposed to sit cross legged in your
son and manifest that shows. Yeah,

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,993
I work hard,

10
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,270
but I assume it's a hard thing to do to
fucking it is and people don't realize

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,321
they don't.
And he'll,

12
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:40,620
he'll look at a clip like there's clips
of me online and the clip is like a

13
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,540
minute long and it seems like,
oh look,

14
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,230
look how easy you don't
see stalking in for hours.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,590
You don't see the hundreds
of hours of shooting arrows.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,830
The coaching from John Dudley,
all the reading,

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,620
archery articles and understanding what,

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,060
keeping your mindset clear in the moment.
It's a lot of difficult to long haul.

19
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,790
My boys have their first hunt in
three months when we'll kind of,

20
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:07,690
we've been prepping for seven months.
They're doing bow hunt and Kona real pig.

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,320
Oh yeah. My, my wife, she's
going to have to sheep.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,100
How old boy is it going to have to pay
the 10. So you're getting them a crossbow?

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,900
No, no, they're right now they're
shooting at Hoyt ignite. Um,

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,030
they're shooting at about 25 yards.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,230
Justice shooting at about 40 yards
and how much they've been prepping.

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,290
They're about 45 now, which is
going to be enough. That's enough.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,560
But I mean there's still contact
Brian. I mean there's still, when they,

28
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,020
when they draw their, you
know, pointing up and pull in,

29
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:36,280
so they've still got a couple
more months of training to,

30
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:41,190
to really get dialed in. Um,
but yeah, it's, it's difficult.

31
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:44,970
I still haven't even gotten my elk bow
hunting. You know, I spent my last time,

32
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,950
I spent six days up in the Colorado
mountain range in the, uh, the um,

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,910
what they called the Santa De
Cristo Range, you know, and,

34
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,070
and on the last day I finally came in
on elk and it was dark and I shot and I

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,384
missed.

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,340
And that was after seven fricking days
of trying and you walk out or how far was

37
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:10,020
a shot your horse out? Completely empty
handed. It's about 45 yards in dusk.

38
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,700
But you know, I mean, you
know how it goes. You're
shaking. It's so dark and yeah.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,650
Um, anyways though, so I'm going
to do a, I'm going to do Kona.

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,890
Actually I'll get you in touch with
Dudley cause I know been touching him,

41
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,750
we've talked before,
I know how you shoot,

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,600
you shoot with a finger
trigger that shooter. Yeah,

43
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,080
I need to, it's, it's on my list. But
as those moments like that when you,

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,370
you're hunting for six days and you just
trekking through the woods 20 miles a

45
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:41,460
day and you're exhausted and
you finally get that one moment.

46
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:46,461
There's so much weight on that moment
that it's so difficult to stay focused

47
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,130
entirely on the task of
executing the shot perfectly.

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,130
And there's methods. There's a guy named
Joel Turner who has, um, I don't know,

49
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,500
he's got a website called
iron mine hunting. He's a, uh,

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,130
he's a, he's an instructor for um, uh,

51
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,840
first responders and snipers and things
along those lines and iron mind iron

52
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,674
mine where she lived,

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,020
I think he's a Pacific northwest guy
and he's helped me tremendously. His,

54
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:18,080
his methods. It's all about keeping a, uh,

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,520
the difference between an open loop
system in a closed loop system.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,990
Be Able to control it and stop it and
stop the process anytime you want and

57
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,440
keeping yourself in that versus
like a baseball bat swing,

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,120
which is once you start swinging,
just swinging. And the idea is to,

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,350
to maintain the present NT,

60
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:39,370
to have a mantra and he gives you a
mantra to chant and to think about it in

61
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:43,900
terms of controlling all
of those movements. So you
are in control constantly.

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,360
Well you, you develop your own, but the
idea is to talk yourself through it.

63
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,140
Don't let your excitable mind take
over Oge it's coupled with the dope.

64
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,430
Did you freak out and you pull the trigger
and you shoot fucking over the things

65
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:02,200
back and you don't even know what
happened. What's your mantra? Lost? Um, I,

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,570
I pull back and I say draw.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,290
I go through all the steps in
my head that I'm supposed to do.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,330
I actually modified his
and went to John Dudley's.

69
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,360
So his,
he has his own one,

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,050
which is a drawback and aim. Get
it done, watch it to keep it.

71
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,010
And the whole idea is just
keeping those things in your head.

72
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,890
So you have one thing,
but what would Dudley,

73
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,800
I go through all the
different things that he says,

74
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,900
like a drawback.
Tip of the nose center,

75
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:37,670
the peep center, the bubble pulled
through the shot, pull, pull, pull,

76
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:41,950
let the shop break. And so I go through
all those things in my mind, but the,

77
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,870
the whole idea is did
not allow the freak out.

78
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,270
Cause the freakout is what
causes the target panic.

79
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,540
And when you have that itchy trigger
finger with the finger trigger,

80
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,710
you look good. And that's,
that's, I've done it. I mean,
I've seen it. I've done it.

81
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,280
I've seen it, I've heard it. Everybody
does it. The, the Arrow goes in the spot,

82
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,350
you know where you're yanking
it and you're pulling it.

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,390
He's not very precise and you want to
get it to where it's a surprise shot.

84
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
And when it's a surprise shot,

85
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:10,810
you're just concentrating entirely on
the area that you want to hit on the ALC.

86
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,800
Your form is perfect, everything's aligned
in order and if it's not, you let down.

87
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,810
If it's not, you let down and try
to get your shit together. Yeah,

88
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,540
she was trained to hunt competitions.
Helped me out quite a bit, I'm sure.

89
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,490
But those are like,
it's like a three day shoot,

90
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:27,300
but they put shooting around and
getting exhausted. No, no, not really.

91
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,780
Like they're, uh, they do
have part of it as like that,

92
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,460
like an obstacle course
race with your bowl.

93
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:35,730
But then part of it too is just
a three day shoot. But like, uh,

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,760
like a a 40 target three day shoot where
one shot might be I'm facing you but

95
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:45,480
the targets behind me and you've
got a ten second time spend a draw,

96
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,930
turn and shoot or you got to take a shot
seeded through the trees at 40 yards

97
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:56,370
and then within 20 seconds
do a shot at 60 yards.

98
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,160
So a lot of hunting scenario,

99
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,680
we would tell you that that is
going to cause target panic.

100
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,830
Did that whole thing of shoot now
that you should never just do that,

101
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,440
that you should always
execute the shot correctly.

102
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,070
Even he doesn't even like
this fucking game, this thing,

103
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,070
this a techno hunt that we,
we've done, he doesn't like that.

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,190
He thinks that that thing causes target
panic because you only have a brief

105
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:18,230
window and you're like go,
it's like you,

106
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:22,340
he believes that you should concentrate
entirely on the correct fundamentals and

107
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:27,341
execution of archery and then with time
and understanding of the situation,

108
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,780
the experience of hunting itself, then
when those moments present themselves,

109
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,310
you're going to execute correctly.

110
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,780
Whereas when you have this like ten
second you've got to turn and behind your

111
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,690
back ready go. He like Blah. You're
just, you're just going to hit that.

112
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,680
You're going to hammer that trigger.

113
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,740
You going to put that pin on the target
and hammer that trigger, and that's just,

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,040
you are emphasizing all the wrong things
that you could do when you're hunting.

115
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,470
Yeah.
