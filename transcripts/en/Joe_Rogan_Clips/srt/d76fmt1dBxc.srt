1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
This is the thing I don't think I don't,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,350
fighting is very important to me.
It means a lot.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,540
It means a lot because I used to do it.
It means a lot cause I love to watch it.

4
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:16,560
It means a lot because I'm very deeply
entrenched in the history and the

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:19,110
significance of it, what
it means. And for me,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,800
fighting should always
be done at its best.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,590
And what that means is you should always
do what's the right thing to do in the

8
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,670
situation. Like if you're, uh, you know,

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,130
you could break it down when
individual arts, right? If you're, um,

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,220
if you're doing Jujitsu,
there's a,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,430
there's a correct way to do
an arm bar counter, right?

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,640
Don't do the incorrect way because
the fans want to see, right.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,290
That doesn't make any sense to me.

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,350
If there's an exciting way
to get out of an arm bar,

15
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:50,160
that's not the right way to do it. But not
Dan's like his lamb, but it might, well,

16
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,140
the pick 'em up and slam.
I'm works if you have to,

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,900
but I'm saying like just as
a rough example, if, if you,

18
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:59,460
if there was a way to defend an arm bar
that wasn't the correct way to do it,

19
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:03,060
but the fans liked it more.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

20
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:07,630
You want to fight like a maestro, right?
You want to fight like, like a virtuoso.

21
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,860
You want to fight like mighty mouse. There
you go. Exactly. What I tell everybody,

22
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,320
you look at my mighty mouse
has had moments in his career,

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,800
like the Ian Mccall fight is
a good example where he was,

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,420
he also had a full time job,

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,180
wasn't dedicated the way it should be and
got into a brawl and Ian took his back.

26
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,930
Wanna pounded them and mighty mouse
had vertigo. After that fight,

27
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,810
he was really fucked up and,
and then quit his job.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,240
I realize like I have to go full time.

29
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,740
I have to dedicate myself to this full
time, you know? And when he did that,

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,780
then under the tutelage of Matt Hume,
he came,

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,660
he became the mighty mouse we see now.
But in my opinion,

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,740
one of the things that sets him
apart from everybody else is that he,

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,580
he's not running away from
you and not getting hit.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,760
He's running at you and
not getting hit or, I mean,

35
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:58,761
he's coming straight forward and then
cutting angles and doing things to you

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,890
that you didn't anticipate and
he's not there for the counters.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,700
So he's fighting correctly.
Seamless too. Yeah.

38
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:08,580
And it's incredibly exciting.
And that was one of the, the,

39
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:13,410
the criticisms of him really early on in
his reign was that he wasn't finishing

40
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:16,890
guys and then he knocked out
Joseph Benevidez and then
he started finishing guys

41
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,160
in the final seconds of the round.
Right. You know what I mean? He's,

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,550
he's just a monster man as man.
He says fucking monster.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,390
But he fights correctly.
I would say don't,

44
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,590
no disrespect to Chris Lytle,
who I love. He's a great fighter.

45
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,420
I was just watching his fight against
Brian Foster and he was so skilled that

46
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,240
people have got a good, Chris Lidell
was won that fight with a leg lock. Hmm.

47
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,350
You know, and he's known as a brawler and
people forget, he fucking spun around,

48
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,360
got that leg and snatch it out and
extended and really fuck Brian's leg up

49
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,050
crafty veteran. He was a
crafty guy, but broad a lot.

50
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,640
I'm not a fan of, I'm a fan of
watching brawls when they take place.

51
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm not a fan as well either.
