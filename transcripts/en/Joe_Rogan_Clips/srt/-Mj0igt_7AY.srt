1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,790
Reality could be like an onion,
we don't know,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,000
but it could be like an onion
to where you think, you know,

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,030
you're studying a layer of an onion and
then you peel it away and there's more

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,081
and you keep doing it.

5
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:12,990
And there's an infinite number
of layers with intelligence.

6
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,040
There's the same kind of component
to where we think we know we got it,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,640
we figured out, we figured out how to
beat the human world champion to chess,

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,230
we solved intelligence, and then we
try the next thing. Wait a minute,

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,170
go was really difficult to solve as
a game. And then you say, okay, uh,

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,841
I've,

11
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:34,920
I came up when the game
of go was impossible for
artificial intelligence systems

12
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:39,600
to be and if not recently had been beaten
within the last like five years. Right.

13
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,100
And next last five years.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,080
There's a lot of technical fascinating
things of why that victory is interesting

15
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,050
and important for artificial intelligence.
It requires creativity, correct?

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,100
It does not.
It just exhibits creativity.

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,790
So the technical aspects of why Alphago
from Google deep mind that that was the

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,350
designers and the builders of the system.
That was the victor.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,100
They did a few very interesting
technical things where essentially you're

20
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:14,700
develop a neural network.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,300
This is this type of artificial
intelligence system that
looks at a board of go

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,620
as a lot of elements on it is black and
white pieces and is able to tell you how

23
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:29,520
good is this situation and
how can I make it better?

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,990
And that idea,
so chess players can do this.

25
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm not actually definitely over the game
of go is that can speak to I'm Russian,

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,560
so chest to us as romanticizes
the beautiful game. Uh,

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,100
I think that there you look at a board
and all your previous experiences,

28
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,250
all the things you've developed over tens
of years of practice and thinking you

29
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:54,810
get this instinct of what
is the right path to follow.

30
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,140
And that's exactly what the neural
network is doing. And some of the,

31
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,250
some of the paths it has come up with
are surprising to other world champions.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,250
So in that sense it says,
well,

33
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,360
this thing's exhibiting creativity because
it's coming up with solutions that are

34
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,670
something that's outside the box.

35
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,340
Thinking from the perspective
of the human when why?

36
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:22,390
What do you differentiate between requires
creativity and exhibits creativity?

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,520
I think one because we don't really
understand what creativity is,

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,370
so it's almost,

39
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,243
yeah,

40
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,770
it's on the level of concepts such
as consciousness. For example,

41
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:43,390
the question which there's a lot of
thinking about whether creating something

42
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:45,490
intelligent requires consciousness,

43
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,030
acquire as for us to be
actual living beings,

44
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:52,600
aware of our own
existence in the same way.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,490
Does doing something like
building an autonomous vehicle,

46
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:01,330
that's the area where I work in.
Does that require creativity?

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,590
Does that even requires something like
consciousness and self awareness? I mean,

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,390
I'm sure in La there's some degree of
creativity required to navigate traffic

49
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,410
and in that sense you start to think,

50
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:17,350
are there solutions that are
outside of the box and AI system?

51
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,040
You used to create it.
It's once you start to build it,

52
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,060
you realize that to us, humans, certain
things appear at creative, certain things,

53
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,920
dope.
Certain things we take for granted,

54
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,460
certain things we find beautiful and
certain things are like, yeah, yeah,

55
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,130
that's right. Well, there's
creativity in different levels, right?

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,830
There's creativity like to write
the stand was Stephen King novel,

57
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:40,120
and that requires creativity.
There's something about his,

58
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,940
he's creating these stories.

59
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,670
He's giving voices to these characters.

60
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:50,020
He's developing these scenarios and these
dramatic sequences in the book that's

61
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:55,000
going to get you really sucked in. That's,
that's almost undeniable creativity,

62
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,950
right? Is it? It's a,
he's imagining a world,

63
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,230
what is it always set in a New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Maine, Maine is, right.

64
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,000
So he's imagining a world and imagine
the emotion of different levels

65
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,760
surrounding that world. Yeah.
That's, that's creative.

66
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,160
Although if there's a
few really good books,

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,520
including his own that
talks about writing. Yeah.

68
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,740
He's got a great book on writing
and it's actually called on writing.

69
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,720
If there's anyone who can write a book on
writing, it should be Stephen King. Uh,

70
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,300
I think Steven Pressfield,

71
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,390
I hope I'm not saying the war of art
and the war of art. Beautiful Book.

72
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,350
And I would say if,
from my recollection,

73
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,470
they don't necessarily talk
about creativity very much,

74
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,510
that it's really hard work of putting in
the hours of every day of just grinding

75
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,670
it out.
Well Pressfield talks about the muse.

76
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,570
Pressfield speaks of it
almost in like a strange,

77
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,850
mystical, mystical sort of
connection to the unknown.

78
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,830
Cause he,
he almost,

79
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,500
I'm not even exactly sure if he
believes in the muse, but he, he,

80
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,950
I think if I could put words in his
mouth, I have met him. He's a great guy.

81
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:09,940
He was on the podcast once.
I think the way he treats it as deaf,

82
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,210
if you decide the music is real and you
show up every day and you write as if

83
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,460
the Muse is real, you get the benefits
of the muse being real. That's right.

84
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,120
Whether or not there's actually a muse
that's giving you these wonderful ideas,

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,320
and what is the muse? So I think of
artificial intelligence the same way.

86
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,670
There's a quote by, uh, Pamela, uh,

87
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,210
McCormack from 1979 book
that I really like. Uh,

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,570
she talks about the history
of artificial intelligence.

89
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,630
Ai began with an ancient
wish to forge the gods.

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,300
And to me, God's broadly
speaking or religions represents,

91
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,920
it's kind of like the muse.
It represents the limits of possibility,

92
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,420
the limits of our imagination.

93
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,440
So it's this thing that we don't
quite understand that is the muse,

94
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,700
that is God, this us,

95
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,500
us chimps are very narrow in our ability
to perceive and understand the world.

96
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,080
And there's clearly a much bigger,
beautiful,

97
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,860
mysterious world out there and God
or the Muse represents that world.

98
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,910
And for many people, I think throughout
history and especially in the,

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,830
in the past set of a hundred years,

100
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,880
artificial intelligence has become to
represent that a little bit to the thing

101
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,840
which we don't understand and we crave.

102
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,590
We're both terrified and we crave in
creating this thing that has greater,

103
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,750
that is able to understand the world
better than us. And that in that sense,

104
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,550
artificial intelligence is the desire
to create the muse is this other,

105
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,680
this imaginary thing.

106
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,220
And I think that one of
the beautiful things,

107
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,930
if you talk about everybody from y'all,

108
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,660
I musta Sam Harris to all the
people thinking about this,

109
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,840
is that there's a mix of fear
of that, of, of that unknown,

110
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:04,640
of creating that unknown and an excitement
for it because there's something in

111
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:08,540
human nature, the desires creating
that. Because like I said,

112
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,820
creating is how you understand.

113
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,120
Hmm.
Did you initially study biology?

114
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,420
Did you study the actual
development of the mind or what,

115
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,170
what is known about the,
the evolution of the human mind and

116
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,280
the of the human mind? Yeah. Uh,

117
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:29,170
so my path is different as it's the same
for a lot of computer scientists and

118
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:33,840
roboticists is we ignore biology,

119
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,260
neuroscience, the physiology,
anatomy of our own bodies.

120
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,320
And there's a lot of beliefs now that
you should really study biology and he

121
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:48,550
should study neuroscience.
You should study your own
brain, the actual chemistry,

122
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,450
what's happening, what is actually,
how are the neurons are interconnected,

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,280
all the different kinds
of systems in there.

124
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,210
So that is a little bit of a blind
spot or it's a big blind spot.

125
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,680
But the problem is,

126
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,050
so I started with more philosophy
almost. It's where, um,

127
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,490
if you think Sam Harris is
the last couple of years,

128
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:13,050
it started kind of thinking about
artificial intelligence and he,

129
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,330
he has a back on, you know, science,
but he's also a philosopher.

130
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:21,331
And I started there by reading
[inaudible] or dusty yefsky thinking,

131
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:25,270
what is,
what is intelligence?

132
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,740
What is human morality? Uh, will, uh,

133
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,770
so all of these concepts give you the
context for which you can then start

134
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,740
studying these problems.
And then I said, there's a,

135
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:43,210
there's a magic that happens when
you build a robot that drives around.

136
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,530
I mean, your father. Um, uh, I
would like to be, but I'm not yet.

137
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,450
Uh, there's a creation aspect.
That's wonderful. That's incredible.

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,010
It's for me, I don't have any
children at the moment, but the,

139
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,870
the act of creating a robot where you
programmed it and it moves around and it's

140
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,830
census. The world is, this
is, is a, is a magical moment.
