1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,780
The people fighting each
other over stupid shit,

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,190
then you're not going to take the time
to sit back. I compare those people,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,600
you know, was really going on. I,
I used the analogy of a magician.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,150
They're trying to tell you,
look what's in the left hand,

5
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:16,640
but what the real shit
is in the right hand.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,850
So by doing all this shit and
causing all these problems,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,540
you're not going to go back and look at
the shit that he's pushing through his

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:28,090
agendas. He just cut a taxes
to the fucking enriches,

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,210
uh, people that, uh, the
billionaires and corporations,

10
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:35,510
which he said he wasn't going to do.
He's gone back on everything.

11
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:38,900
So if he could just get people,
fuck you and fuck you,

12
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:43,901
and getting people to hate each other and
keep this country is the United States

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,550
of America. When the fuck, how
did we become United as a country?

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,940
Like I think a lot of these countries
right now who may pose a threat or

15
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:58,760
whatever, they're seeing what the
fuck's going on and they're like, Yo,

16
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,400
this country's never been
more fucking divided.

17
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,990
It's divided states of America,
not the United States of America.

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,680
Well,
what he's doing with these,

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,180
these rallies is he's getting people
excited about being a part of a team and a

20
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,590
team that's winning.
You know,

21
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,920
like we're the team that's kicking ass
and this is team fake news or there you

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:19,560
tell them to go fuck themselves
and everybody gets Ya, Ya, Ya.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,930
He's consolidating his support.
He,

24
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,200
and it doesn't have to make sense and
especially it doesn't have to make sense

25
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:27,810
with the people that are going to these
rallies because they're not smart people

26
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,180
in the first place.
There are people that are easily led,

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,300
but that's the same thing with people
that would go to the rallies for Hillary

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,340
Clinton or people who go to the
rallies for almost all these people,

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,470
a giant chunk of them are just, they're
just lemmings. I don't know what to do.

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,730
I do and hit one thing and that was
when fucking Hillary Clinton Clinton was

31
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:54,071
losing and the faces of the crying and
people who were like fucking losing

32
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:58,490
negotiate when Trump won.
I was like, I'm sorry,

33
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:01,090
but like funny fucking dude.
If that's dead,

34
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,180
the fucking truth of your existence
that you put every fucking ounce or your

35
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:08,570
shit into this fucking
corrupt as politician,

36
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,810
whether it's fucking Hillary Clinton or
fucking Bernie Sanders on any of them.

37
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,740
I feel fucking sorry for you.

38
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:19,910
I was laughing at those people when she
lost and they were losing their shit on

39
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:23,390
TV. Like they were just
fucking stunned at how like,

40
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,570
cause you don't realize I travel through
America and people may be progressive

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,680
on the outskirts,

42
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:34,550
but go into the middle of this
motherfuck and see what you got.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,870
What the fuck is that?
Voted for that too. Yeah.

44
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,780
Well there was also people
realize that she was corrupt.

45
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,440
I mean you did a good job of calling
her corrupt Hillary. Absolutely.

46
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,990
He just kept up with the mantra was going,

47
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,090
he loves mantras and he pushes those
fucking, but they just had yes.

48
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,700
Yeah, correct. So crazy.
Bernie crazy burns. Yeah.

49
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,160
I mean he's, he's a, he's a good

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,830
manipulator in that sense, but
she, no, she didn't do any service,

51
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:07,000
but there was also like a lot of the
women that were really upset, we're like,

52
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,920
this guy was in that video saying you
take girls and grab them by the Pussy.

53
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,640
And so they,

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,840
they felt like this was going to give
man a license to be sexually abusive.

55
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,850
And I think that in a lot of ways is what
like started the ball rolling with the

56
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,830
me too movement. It wasn't just the
exposing of monsters like Bill Cosby,

57
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,070
but it was also the fact
that you're dealing with this
guy who gets in the White

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,220
House. That's clearly not what
you want. You want. If it's a man,

59
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,340
you want a man who respects women,
who's a statesman,

60
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:44,170
who's a person who has worked
their life to get to that position.

61
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,110
Not a person who did it as an
afterthought once they're already famous.

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,920
See like the difference between a guy
like Obama, like Obama's probably,

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,820
he's probably measured his words ever
since he was in college because he was

64
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,710
hoping one day he would be president.

65
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,920
Whereas a guy like Donald Trump's just
been banging hoes and fucking fly around

66
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,860
the jet with his name on it since the
80s I mean this is what the guy did.

67
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,160
So then once he's in
office, people like, no,

68
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,250
just couldn't believe like
how could this have happened?

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,170
This is the pussy grabber.
He's not supposed to be in
there. And I get their pain.

70
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:19,270
I understand it and it is also funny,

71
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,740
but there's something like the
woman's on her knees with the glasses.

72
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:27,970
You ever seen that check with the DA
on screaming? She's like, she's a meme.

73
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,270
He loves, she, she, she will
exist forever. They made a,

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,380
they call it Trump derangement syndrome
now because people are literally,

75
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,980
they're so angry that he is in power and
there's nothing they can do about it.

76
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,980
But the problem is that anger and that
that going derange that that empowers the

77
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,870
people that support him.

78
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,390
They don't understand when
you're on your knees screaming,

79
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,540
fuck the people on the other side that
the Trump supporters of their fucking red

80
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:01,870
hats on, they think that's hilarious.
And they look, this is the liberal left,

81
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,840
unhinged, detached from
reality. Meanwhile,

82
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,350
we're making America great again and
black unemployment is at an all time low

83
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,460
and you know it's,

84
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,830
it's weird time for the truth because
there's so many people that don't want to

85
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,000
go any further past the surface.

86
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,240
The truth is this guy figured
out a way to win a rigged system.

87
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,230
He did.

88
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,220
He figured out a way or when a rig system
by pretending to be a republican guy

89
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:31,720
was a democrat his whole life democratic
supporters his whole life figured out a

90
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,890
way. Oh just pick a, be a
republican. They're easier
to scam. Weaseled his way in,

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,380
figured out a way. This whole
make America great again. Yeah.

92
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,300
Rah Rah Rah called people a bunch of
stupid shit campaign like a motherfucker.

93
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,860
Take Diet pills,
keep that energy high.

94
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,010
Just travel all across the country doing
these rallies and one and one a system

95
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,700
that really shouldn't be there to win.

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,240
And I think that we need a better way
to run our government and your idea is

97
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,480
fucking genius. An Alpha male or
Alpha female, that one person,

98
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:07,481
the one at the top of the peak run 300
million people's insane running 300

99
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:12,440
people's insane. If 300 people,
one person running shit,

100
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,640
you're going to have disagreements.

101
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,820
You're going to have people that are
upset that this one person gets to dictate

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,500
for the next four to eight years.

103
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:23,050
The path of everyone in this group and
your financial future, your healthcare,

104
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,490
you're,
you're all these how much taxes you pay,

105
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,900
all depending on what dip shit wins. The
popularity contest. That's outrageous.

106
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,190
It's an archaic way of handling things.
It's just not necessary.

107
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:38,300
But the problem with letting everybody
vote too is that people are really easily

108
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,600
manipulated and they're
really undereducated people.

109
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,890
They don't have any incentive to pay
attention to the real issues and what's at

110
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,380
stake and what the
consequences of each vote are.

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,300
They just vote with whatever feels good
and they're busy and people are tired

112
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:56,480
cause they're eating shitty food and then
not exercising and they're working all

113
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,820
day in a job that sucks. And
they come home, their wives,

114
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:02,450
bitch Nadam and they're on antidepressants
and pills and then the kids are all

115
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:05,570
fucked up and they don't have the time.
They don't have the time.

116
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,150
And they don't have the,
the incentive to be enlightened.

117
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,070
They don't have the incentive to have it.

118
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:15,071
A objective in lightened approach to how
you handle the future of our society.
