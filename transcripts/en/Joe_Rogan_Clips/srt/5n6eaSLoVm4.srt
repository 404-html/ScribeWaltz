1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
And apps. So this weekend is
Darren till versus Wonderboy.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,910
Excuse me, versus Tyron Woodley.
Why don't I say versus Wonderboy?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,450
We'll kind of flip was that,
and you know why?

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,870
Cause it was reading a article of
this really interesting article about

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,210
Wonderboy and his last three fights,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,020
the two fights with Tyron Woodley
that were super duper close.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,930
And then one fight with Darren
till that was also really close.

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,490
And they were talking about like how,
um, if you looked at it on paper,

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,860
the people from outside,

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,260
I think they were there were
saying that global scorecard,

11
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,930
I think that's how they're describing it,
meaning how people scored it,

12
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,010
like on average around the world.
Uh,

13
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,170
more people gave it to Wonderboy
then gave it to Darren till.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,190
And the same thing happened with,
um, the Tyron Woodley fights.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,920
I feel like the decisions were
right in all those fights.

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,210
I feel like I'm in the woods. He fights
in particular with the hurt Wonderboy.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,720
Wonderboy didn't really hurt with the, I
think that counts for more. It just does.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,920
Woodley, Tyron Woodley had him out.
I mean, he had, I'm really hurt.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,360
And Wonderboy never had Tyron in that
kind of trouble in either one of those

20
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,230
fights.
So I would,

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,320
I would give that advantage clearly to
tire and I would think that if he lost

22
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,790
that fight that wouldn't
make it any sense.

23
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,730
Cause fights are supposed to be
about who does the most damage,

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,290
who of WHO's more effective. I mean
Wonderboy was effective for more time,

25
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,150
but that's just like movement
and sticking and hitting him,

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,470
hitting him with small shots.
But tyrin put him on, you know,

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,030
unconsciousness his door. He was like
right there. It was very dangerous.

28
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:33,860
It was way different. And plus you got the
impact. Yeah. I said, well I don't know.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
I'm not sure. I believe that. I think, you
know, if someone really wins a decision,

30
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,790
they really wanted decision,

31
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:43,460
but it's just what's most
important is damage. If you,

32
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:45,240
you guys are basically
in a striking exchange.

33
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:49,800
We're not talking about like submission
attempts versus striking exchanges.

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,440
Like which one's better? He almost
had him choked out with that triangle.

35
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,150
Well he almost had them
knocked out that left hook.

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,810
We're not talking about that because it
was basically just a striking match and

37
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:59,610
in just as plain old striking match,

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,000
Willie was the one who landed
the biggest shots in my mind.

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,210
We've got to figure out a way to quantify
that. It just doesn't make any sense.

40
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,980
Well, you could see a guy having
a guy fucked up and almost out to,

41
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:13,890
I think the same way about the
Robert Whitaker Yoel Romero fight.

42
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,830
There's two rounds in that fight where
Yoel Romero is land in bombs on Whitaker.

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,560
Whitaker is hurt bad. How does he lose
that fight? I don't understand that.

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,570
It doesn't make, to me, even if it makes
sense in the current scoring system,

45
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,460
that scoring system is fucking flawed.
That shit doesn't make any sense.

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,890
Like logically when you're
looking at what is the,

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,090
what's the ultimate goal of fighting.
But if you look at those three fights,

48
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,140
just at least on paper,

49
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:45,141
Wonderboy is like right up there and
Darren till with one fight with cowboy one

50
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:46,891
fight with him.

51
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:49,320
Those two fights with their most
high profile fights of his career.

52
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,190
Boom already got a title shot. It's
really interesting. That's how,

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,020
that's how talented Darren Tillis people
are so interested in him. 17 to know.

54
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:01,150
25 years old, they're like,
fuck, give him a chance.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,740
The real battle for this guy
almost is not just the fight,

56
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,300
which is going to be of course a battle,

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,650
but making 170 and how much
longer does he do that? He's,

58
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,850
I mean he fucking,

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,060
he's hurting to get down to one 70
apparently he was at one 82 yes,

60
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:22,560
he's giant dude. Giant. You'll see
how much bigger he is in Woodley.

61
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,930
This is the video at the press conference
when I stand next to each other.

62
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:29,350
And how tall is it till puts his
hands over his head. I can't tell.

63
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,290
It says inches.
He's gotta be six too.

64
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:37,180
But he said a big giant six to six
foot either. That's just six foot,

65
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:41,920
even 72 inches. That's right. It
is. He seems way taller than that.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,780
Yeah, watch the go to the
video of them. That's crazy.

67
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,710
Why don't think he was six
to, anyway, just still,

68
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,970
we're talking one 70 his clearly taller.
He's a big fucker too.

69
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,420
It's not just tall. He's
thick. You know, he's a,

70
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,050
he's a big fucking guy and he has
a hard time making that weight.

71
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,990
Look how fucking big is dude.
Seriously.

72
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,800
That looks like more than three inches.

73
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,630
Unless he's wearing some crazy
cowboy boots on and, no, but look,

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,590
it's going to be hard to do anything
that Woodley man. Very hard. Hard. Well,

75
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,570
there's a bunch of things with
wood and the, first of all,

76
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,460
the fucking speed you're
dealing with speed that you,

77
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:26,920
you probably haven't seen before.
Exactly. And that his level of wrestling,

78
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,480
look at these two guys he
doesn't want to listen to, isn't,

79
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,950
there's no submitting until, I
mean, he knows Jujitsu for sure.

80
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,000
He lived in Brazil for a few
years. He actually speaks,
speaks Portuguese. Oh Shit.

81
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,140
Okay. Yeah. Um, he got stabbed
in London and then, uh,

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,200
went to Brazil to fucking recoup and hi
and hang out and lived there for awhile.

83
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,970
I don't know the full story of it,

84
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:55,450
but he speaks perfect Portuguese
after one of his fights in Brazil,

85
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,970
he addressed the crowd in Portuguese,
was pretty crazy.
