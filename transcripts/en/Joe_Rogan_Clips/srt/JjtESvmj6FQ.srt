1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,580
Her low freak bitches. So, um,
you saw the UFC this weekend.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,630
Do you see where I fucked up?

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,860
And I interviewed Daniel Cormay after he
had been knocked out. Yep. Dude, here's,

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,080
here's something that's like, people
think that somehow or another, uh,

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,340
the UFC told me not to do that and
I did it. Nobody said anything.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
It was just a hundred percent my fuck up.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,830
And it was also my idea in the first
place to stop interviewing fighters after

8
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:27,590
they'd been knocked out.
It was 100% my idea. No,

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,070
it happened before in championship fights.
It happened often, right? Almost always.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,960
Whether a guy got knocked out or Tko
or submitted or loss of decision,

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,410
I would interview the winner and I
would interview the loser every time.

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,200
Every time. Okay. So it's more
or less they ran out of the cage,

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,910
which has happened before. Yeah, I get it.

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,910
So you're just on running on instincts
here. This is what happened. Um,

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,180
I was there for Gonzaga versus cro
cop. Remember Gonzaga head kick, Cro,

16
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:58,800
cop, and just fucking into
a Bolivian and it was bad.

17
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,320
And I interviewed Cro Cop afterwards.
And I'm telling you,

18
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:05,610
that dude had no idea what I was talking
about. And I remember saying to the,

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,740
to the production team at
the time, it was like, man,

20
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,620
I don't think we should interview guys
after they get knocked out like that.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,900
Like that was my, my saying
like that. And then, um,

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,380
the one time it happened again is with
ouster and after when Alistair Overeem

23
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,550
floods deep a meal chicken,

24
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,860
he remembered this gay team
that didn't really happen.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,560
You remembered a Steve Bay tapping rather.
And it didn't really happen.

26
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,110
I was like, this poor guy. Like he's,

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,830
he really has this memory in his head
and it's just not correct cause he just

28
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:35,610
got knocked the fuck out.
He got knocked unconscious on television,

29
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:36,840
like completely flat line.

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,080
And then a few minutes later I'm
asking him to be coherent. I'm like,

31
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,914
I don't think it's fair.

32
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,750
So it was my idea to stop
doing this and the UFC agreed.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,510
So it's not like, like they said, we've
got to stop doing it and I violated.

34
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,330
I violated my own idea
and I just did it on,

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,030
this is what happened after the
fight was over. First of all,

36
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,420
the fight was crazy shocking how violent
the ending was because John Really did

37
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:09,591
fucking hate Daniel and Daniel I think
really did hate John or at least had real

38
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,670
anger. There was real emotions with these
guys. It was insane. It was intense.

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,290
When John landed that fucking head kick
and you saw him moving in for the kill

40
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,200
and then he,
he stopped him right in front of us.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,220
He got on top of him and just blasted him.
It was like right there.

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,400
I remember looking over and I'm like,
Jesus,

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,720
he was just dropping tell on real
close to, it was pretty close.

44
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,400
If I remember correctly. I want to
say it was like right off to my right.

45
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:41,790
If I remember correctly. You had a good
look at it. I had a real good look at it.

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,520
Yeah, I mean obviously I'm cage side.
I've got a good look at everything,

47
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,790
but I had a real good look at that.
It was intense. It was intense,

48
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,280
and it was also, I felt like there
was a couple shots, too many.

49
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,670
So I remember being
stunned like, Oh, I'm a,

50
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm a big fan of John Jones,

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,350
but I'm also a big fan of Daniel
and I'm a fan of both of them.

52
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,810
I know they don't like each other,
but I like both of them.

53
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,470
I liked them independently and it just,
I can't help the fact their enemies,

54
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,160
but I love hanging out with John
and I love hanging out with Daniel.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,240
I love doing commentary with Daniel.
I love that guy.

56
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,400
So I would never do anything to
make him look bad. I just got,

57
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,470
I was in shock.
There was,

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
he was confused because he got knocked
out so he was confused that that why the

59
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:26,350
fight was stopped and said he was mad
that they stopped the fight because he

60
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,510
just didn't understand
because he just been chaos.

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,940
So he was arguing with big John.

62
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,510
I didn't hear the exact words
then he was arguing with Dana.

63
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,010
I didn't hear the exact words that
either, but Dana was in front of me. It's,

64
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:42,370
you've got to realize when a Kale like
that happens in a world championship

65
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:44,650
fight and you're standing in the octagon,

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,620
you're surrounded by all these
people screaming and cheering,

67
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,010
the the fucking noise is so loud.

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,980
It's hard to figure out
what the fuck is happening.

69
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,790
So I couldn't figure out what Daniel
and Dana were arguing about, but Dane,

70
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:02,110
his whole head was red. He was like,
he was like, that fight was amazing.

71
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,420
He fought your heart out.
Like I couldn't tell exactly what he said,

72
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:07,600
like you'd hold your head up high. It
was a great fight, that kind of stuff.

73
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,680
But I think Daniel was still trying to
figure out why the fight was stopped

74
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,840
because it just had happened.
He'd just woken up.

75
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,410
Then he realized he got head kicked and
then he was really sad and then he was

76
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:22,411
upset and I went to go talk to him and
literally as I'm going to talk to him,

77
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,400
he's turning to me and I have
the microphone. I'm like,
why am I interviewing him?

78
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,470
After he got knocked out,
what the fuck is wrong with me?

79
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,110
I don't even realize what I was doing.
I was just in shock,

80
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,140
almost like I went on instinct
and I'm interviewing him.

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,930
If I had a chance to stop and think
I should have been like, oh yeah,

82
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:41,440
he's been Kao don't do it. So in the
middle of me even talking to him,

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,120
I say I normally,

84
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,250
I don't like to interview fighters
after they've been knocked out,

85
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,600
but it's just like I was stuck.

86
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,260
I was already there talking to him and I
didn't want to leave and walk away from

87
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:54,070
him and I really do care
about that guy a great deal.

88
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,550
And I just watched him get
knocked out and now watch him.

89
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,580
His heart's pouring out and he's crying.
You know,

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,220
when he was realizing that he got
knocked out and he lost the fight,

91
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,720
it was all awful. And um, so I put a Po,

92
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,600
it was haunting me all night.
This is, nobody had said anything.

93
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,260
Nobody from the UFC got mad at me.
No one said anything to me.

94
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,710
There was just me thinking, why did I
do that? Like why did I interview them?

95
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,760
I shouldn't have interviewed him even
though we used to do it for every fight.

96
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,890
Um, it was the right move to stop doing
it. And ironically it was my idea.

97
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,050
It was my move.
I don't even know if other guy,

98
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:32,020
I don't know if Brian's stands still
interviews guys after they've been knocked

99
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,040
out.
I don't think he does though,

100
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,460
because Brian Actually said thank you to
me for that because he got interviewed

101
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:42,070
after he got knocked out by
Vandelay and he remembers thinking,

102
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,330
I don't remember what happened.

103
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,790
He didn't know what the fuck happened
and they were interviewing him.

104
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,640
He's trying to keep it together for the
interview. And he was like, you're right.

105
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,420
It's not fair.

106
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,490
It's not fair to interview a fighter
after they've been knocked out.

107
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,550
I just fucked up man. There's no
other way to say it. I just, uh,

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,250
if I could go back,
I definitely would have taken it back.

109
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:02,300
I definitely wouldn't have interviewed
him cause feel, uh, feel like he didn't.

110
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,140
And he sent me a text message saying it's
all good. I didn't say anything crazy,

111
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:11,030
so it's no big deal. But you know, he
could have, you know, he could've said,

112
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,770
I never got stopped. I could
have said, you know, he could,

113
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,880
you don't think anything,

114
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,280
like if somebody doesn't explain
to him well enough what happened?

115
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,640
And then it takes a few
seconds and you forget again.

116
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,580
That's the other thing about guys had
been knocked out like you like say if,

117
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,270
if I got knocked out and I asked you
Eddie, what happened? And you said, oh,

118
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:29,330
this dude just punch you in your jaw and
knocked you out. I'd be like, no way.

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,650
Hey Man,
what happened?

120
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,400
Like a few seconds later he started
asking again when you get knocked out,

121
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:38,930
it's real weird. So, um, it's a
huge fuck up on my part, but it was,

122
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,380
I was in shock, honestly.
It was so ferocious.

123
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,700
The final barrage was so ferocious
and it was the way it was.

124
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,490
The Way John did it when you heard him,
once he knew he heard them,

125
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,170
he just started going after him. And one
of the, the spookiest things that he did.

126
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:56,530
Was he the, he tripped him. You see what?

127
00:06:56,531 --> 00:07:00,080
He tripped him like Daniel's like sort
of stumbling back and John just sort of

128
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,920
scoops his leg out from under him a trip.

129
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,990
Some Daniel falls back and John just
moves in on him and you could tell Daniel

130
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:09,560
just couldn't get his feet back under
him and John just jumped on him and just

131
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:10,394
marked them.

132
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,770
Carme did great on his feet
for awhile there. He did great.

133
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,880
But I was really impressed
with John John Stryker to dude,

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,550
he throws so much unorthodox shit.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,700
Those stomps on the knees do,

136
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,920
that's high level shit and the
volume is thrown a lot of strikes.

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,660
That's his shit. He was in
tremendous shape. Taste on those uh,

138
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,800
those elbows from, you know, from left
field, you know right down the pipe.

139
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,330
Yeah. He's doing a lot of elbows, man.
And he's throwing all kinds of shit.

140
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:45,710
He's throws everything for kicks. There
was a lot of front kick right to the,

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,150
yeah,

142
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,790
those a front snap kicks throws those
old kicks to die and hyperextends your

143
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,270
knee. Love that close
to him. I love that. Oh,

144
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,270
I hope he keeps going because
he's evolving so much as a strike.

145
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,490
I hope he gets more like,

146
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,920
I hope we get to get to gather 100%
you never seen him arrested again?

147
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:07,080
No more bullshit. No one cares about that.
I do. I want him to get arrested again.

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,470
It's like he tore his ACL.
What's the gift will be back.

149
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,410
He's going to be back you. It
doesn't matter. Let them party.

150
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:14,880
He's the king of the world.
He's the,

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,140
he's the probably the best fighter
of all time. Let them do some coke.

152
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:23,580
Let them party data should be getting
some house. You know what I mean?

153
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,360
Fuck it. He gets fucked up. Hey,
that's, that's actually better press.

154
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,640
So what he needs is like,
it's, she should take,

155
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:33,090
you should fake Duis and drunk and
stoned just like they do in TMZ.

156
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,230
He just needs a constant security
detail to keep everything away from him.

157
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:40,000
I let him let him do whatever he wants.
He's the king of the fucking world.

158
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,420
And you don't want him getting locked up.

159
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,790
We lost a whole year of them and
then we lost a year before that.

160
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,260
You don't want him to get
Tyson that that's for sure.

161
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,260
He could get locked up for five years.

162
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,830
That shit happens to people want
what you want them to do is have fun,

163
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,280
but don't do anything illegal.
Don't let him drive us,

164
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:59,310
can take his keys stolen to do
anything illegal. Just how sturdy team.

165
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,590
Have a rubber party room.

166
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:08,010
Go off and just say, dude, you go off
for five hours, whatever you want.

167
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,710
Boom, but you can't leave this room.
Do you ever been to one of them?

168
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,030
A bouncy warehouses?

169
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:16,670
We can go from one trampoline to the
next champion and those are amazing.

170
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,420
We go all the time and my son all the
time, those are the best man. The best.

171
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,360
So anyway, um, even though
I already talked to Daniel,

172
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:28,200
I felt like I put it on Twitter.
I apologize on Instagram and I was like,

173
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,910
I gotta apologize in the podcast too.

174
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,603
Job

175
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,070
[inaudible].
