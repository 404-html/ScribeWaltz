1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,490
Well listen, we're talking about this last
time was with you, the proud boys. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:09,120
Yeah. Got it off as a goof and
then became like, what the,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,940
they won't let him in Australia
now if you've seen that. No, it's,

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,610
it's gotten insane.
Yeah.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,510
Like Gavin is considered like
a war criminal at this point.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,490
I know Gavin very well. He used to
be on compound media, my, my network.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,660
Um, and that's where the whole
thing started. And space junk.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,320
Explain how it all started
because people don't know. It's,

9
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:35,010
it's amazing when you think about it
because it makes you question everything.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,580
Like how did, how did Nazi
Germany stock, was that a joke?

11
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:43,020
Was that like Stalin Ism than
everything? Uh, in Russia? Uh, Gavin,

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,460
how does show very outrageous?
Gavin is one of these, just a funny,

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,710
outrageous guy. His whole career has
been based on satire and parody and,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,200
and he's very loud to provocate tool,
right? Provocateur. Absolutely. Yeah.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,570
Loves shaking. People are
to find out where he really,
well, how he really feels.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,430
And when he's playing games, it's very
blurry. Absolutely. So we have, uh,

17
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,120
we have this employee, uh,
Ben Ratner, little kid.

18
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,200
We actually hired him just because his
name was Ratner and we wanted to call him

19
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:18,120
rat, like in fast times a rent. Why
don't you turn on the camera? Uh,

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,000
so it was, it was great. Uh,

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,700
he rat never talked about girls.

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,810
It's like this really Jewish,
really red hair,

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,790
kind of gangly, you know, kid. And uh, he,

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,460
he liked going to Broadway shows and
things and we always questioned his

25
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,750
sexuality and whatnot. And Gavin
really started hitting on him going,

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,680
what are you doing? Like get laid a
kid, your age should be out there.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,240
It just fucking plowing through
policy and a, he's like, ah, you know,

28
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,590
waiting for the right girl and everything.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,630
So Gavin would continuously goof on him.

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,200
So he would always go to Broadway
plays. So Gavin started getting, uh,

31
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,190
music from musicals and playing it to
him. Like, Hey, look at this, you pussy,

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,030
you know, is this what you like? And
one of them was proud of your boy.

33
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,950
It's a Broadway, a song from a
musical, a Disney musical, I believe.

34
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,340
And it's sealed. Oh, proud of your boy.

35
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:17,550
It's one of those big grandiose
Broadway pieces of shit.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,470
I can't stand that stuff,
man. I hate it. Oh, it is.

37
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:26,730
It's terrible.
So he goofed on about that and then said,

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,690
we ought to make a club
called the proud boys.

39
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,920
And that way you can learn how to
be a man and you know, you, you,

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,280
you'll get chicks and
tattoos and you know,

41
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,690
drink beer and hang out
with guys as a joke.

42
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,750
It was like this parody of a men's club
and so over the top that it was like,

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,740
I think part of the way to
get beaten into this gang,

44
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:57,480
this club was that you had to recite
five breakfast cereals while the other

45
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,190
members punched you and they would
keep punching you until you spit.

46
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,190
So ludicrous. So ridiculous.
Such a parity. Uh,

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,920
and slowly this fucking
thing mutated into something.

48
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,880
It got more members. Uh,
they started wearing, um,

49
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,950
what are those shirts? The, with a yellow
car piping on the collar and stuff.

50
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,310
It's a specific shirt that
became the uniform. Perry Ellis,

51
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,530
Perry Ellis shirts,

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,630
a specific black shirt with gold piping
and a on the collar and, and the,

53
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,810
uh, the sleeves. And that
became like the uniform.

54
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,750
And because it was presented as
a chauvinist stick club, like,

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,160
like girls are allowed, minorities are
allowed. It doesn't matter who you are,

56
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,310
but in essence it is a guy thing and
we will talk shit about girls and we're

57
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,950
going to drink and get laid.
And it was just a men thing.

58
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,480
So they started getting together at
bars, you know, in the area in Manhattan.

59
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:02,290
And how is this organized? This is
organized through his compound media show,

60
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,090
through the compound media show,
his own Twitter account and Facebook,

61
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:11,980
which he subsequently lost.
He's persona non grata on a social media,

62
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,500
but that's how it started.

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,010
And it never was supposed
to go any further than that.

64
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,940
Gavin himself didn't really
take it any further than that.

65
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,930
It's just let's get together
every so often. We have a
good time, we drink, laugh,

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,793
everything like that.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Well then this whole thing with a
politics got involved cause Antifa,

68
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,920
which is antifascist started, uh, uh,

69
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,900
coming into, uh, conservatives
that wanted to speak.

70
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,450
So Gavin was conservative,
is conservative.

71
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,490
He'd get speaking engagements
at schools, Nyu or, um,

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,890
any, any of the numerous
places around New York City.

73
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,900
And antifa would show up to protest
him and try to shut down the event.

74
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,230
So then the proud boys would go and
protect Gavin so he wouldn't get harmed

75
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,340
doing these speaking
engagements. Uh, and that,

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,330
so then it turned into this because
they're fighting with Antifa.

77
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,540
They must be the fog, the
fascists and the Nazis. Um,

78
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,730
and once that gets out there,
there's no pulling it back.

79
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,050
You could try to explain how you're not
a Nazi till you're blue in the fucking

80
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:27,250
face. It ain't going away. And
especially cause it's a good story.

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,250
The press likes it.
It's this good versus evil thing.

82
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,670
They present Antifa I like their protest.
They always call them.

83
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,220
And the protesters were beaten.
They're fucking violent. Uh,

84
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:41,380
a violent group of people that are there
to hit people they don't agree with and

85
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,880
silence people that want to speak.

86
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,330
And that's exactly what happened
with Kevin and Ann Coulter and Milo

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,130
Yiannopoulos. Uh, Ben Shapiro.

88
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:54,820
There a lot of these conservative people
can't go to these venues and speak.

89
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,770
They get shut down because
of a violent group of people

90
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,370
called ANTIFA. So proud boys
were kind of the answer to that.

91
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,030
So Gavin can go round and,
and actually, uh, speak.

92
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,100
Well when that happened,

93
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,570
more people came on board because
they kind of liked to beat people up.

94
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,600
Uh, when you have a
gang, a group of people,

95
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,190
and one of their missions is now to
beat up people you don't agree with

96
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,520
politically. When there was TV outlets,
there's tears to the membership.

97
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,690
Like the highest tier was you
fought for the cause, right, right.

98
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,120
To actually get in a fist fight.
Yeah, sure. Gavin thought it was like,

99
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,800
I've talked to Gavin,
I'd like Gavin.

100
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,710
I've had Gavin on the podcast
and the last time I had them on,

101
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,410
I didn't know what this whole thing was.

102
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,800
He was explaining the proud boys and he
was talking to me about we're going to

103
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:42,560
punch them, we're going to punch people.
Yeah. I was like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

104
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,600
I was like,
did you don't,

105
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,470
you can't just punch people like
they punched back and then you get,

106
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,780
they get mad that you punched him in and
they shoot you when you get out of your

107
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,650
car. Right. This escalates.
People don't just take it. Well,

108
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:59,030
it was never supposed to be an
offensive punching. Uh, when,

109
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,600
when I would speak to Gavin and every
example I would see it was an answer to

110
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,434
violence.
They,

111
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,260
they would have violence perpetrated
on that and probably they answered with

112
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,430
context and all Paul needed to say is
he's calling for violence. That's it.

113
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,190
And that's what they've said about
Gavin over and over again. Right.

114
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,740
Taking things out of context
and use it as a gamble.

115
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,950
The other problem being that the Antifa
people are a lot of skinny dudes and

116
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:27,490
chicks with masks on and they are
not really that adept at fighting.

117
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,240
It is a horrible video of this one.

118
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,990
Antifa guy tries to hit someone with
it looks like some kind of a stick or a

119
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:37,920
pipe and the guy catches it and
fucking blast him on the champion.

120
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,830
Fucking put him down. His head
bounces off the concrete unconscious.

121
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,390
A lot of people die. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
That's how people die in fights. Like, oh,

122
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:49,520
he killed him with his bare hands.
Yeah. You hit his fucking head on.

123
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,660
He hit his head on the concrete. You got
hit by the world. Literally the world.

124
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,510
Right, right. Back. Gravity budge it.

125
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:00,470
Gravity has punched you in the
back of the head. Yeah. Yes.

126
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,650
These people have this idea
that they're going to go places.

127
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,050
They're going to shut everybody
down and because they're in a group,

128
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,170
you're going to scream and yell and
hit people with bike locks and all this

129
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,280
stuff. All seen weird thing
is that that's from the left.

130
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,590
That was never from the left before. When
I was a kid, I grew up, um, when I was a,

131
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,970
from age seven 11,
during the Vietnam War,

132
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,030
I lived in San Francisco and
I was around the real hippies.

133
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,280
And I remember being a little
kid and I remember that. I mean,

134
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,280
if times there were flower children,
I mean they were, they, right,

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,730
the hippies and the lefties were not,

136
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,550
were love and peace and no violence
and everyone was doing acid, right.

137
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:40,370
Hey, and now they're all on Adderall
and it hitting people with bike locks.

138
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,720
It was, yeah, it's a different thing.
There was a time where the liberals,

139
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,890
the hippies, the, you know, they,

140
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:51,740
they were the ones that when there would
be a demonstration and the national

141
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,980
guard would show up, they'd be putting
flowers in the barrels of the guns,

142
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,100
famous pictures

143
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,280
of that. And then Kent state
was a bunch of hippies,

144
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,340
literally getting shot
by the National Guard,

145
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,450
the national guard that has
completely flipped around.

146
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:11,310
It's the weirdest thing.
And I don't know how it got distinguished.

147
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:15,380
We're proud boys became this
evil group of people and,

148
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,190
and Antifa is the good group of people.
Now I understand that proud boy,

149
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,400
uh, proud boys were infiltrated
by white nationalists,

150
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,430
Nazi White Supremacist,
whatever it is.

151
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,340
But those were constantly
being disavowed by Gavin.

152
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:33,090
Gavin never wanted any of that happening,
but is there a way,

153
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,210
how do you get in though?
Here's the question because this is my,

154
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:38,310
you saw my last comedy
special [inaudible].

155
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,320
This is my criticism of a vegans is not
that there's anything wrong with being a

156
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,950
Vegan, right? That when you have
a group where anybody can join,

157
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,880
you're going to get a certain
amount of fucking idiots, right?

158
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,260
If you have a million people,
for sure,

159
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:56,970
you have 100,000 fucking idiot
has no getting around that. Yeah,

160
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,750
so if you have a group where anybody can
join and you have a million people in

161
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,320
that group,

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,250
you're going to have 100,000 fucking
idiot fucking idiot and those people are

163
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,300
going to define your group.

164
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,930
The worst behavior in that group is
where people are going to call two as an

165
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:14,340
example. That's it. I think this is also
a symptom of the social media era today,

166
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,330
especially with Twitter,

167
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,420
because you can't express yourself and
explain things 140 or 280 characters,

168
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,170
it just takes too much time. So they can
say, oh, proud boys, racist, scumbag,

169
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,710
Nazi Gavin, and there are
always a racist scumbag Nazi,

170
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,500
and all a sudden that's the narrative
and everybody keeps pushing it.

171
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,470
And that's the videos of people
punching little skinny people.

172
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,450
Oh look at these people.
They beat up the Antifa,

173
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,530
these fucking assholes and
Gavin's an asshole. Yeah, that's,

174
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:43,770
that's what it comes down to.
I've seen it presented. Uh,

175
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,300
well you ask how it starts and how it
grows and how you become a member by

176
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,680
buying a fucking shirt.

177
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,520
That's by buying a Perry Ellis
shirt and opening a chapter two.

178
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,840
There are chapters worldwide. You
see it. It's like, here's the,

179
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,580
the proud boys Australia.

180
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:03,300
Here's the problem is England
proud boys fucking Japan.

181
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,280
Like it's everywhere and it never
was supposed to get to that point.

182
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,640
And regardless of how these people act,

183
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:17,030
it now reflects on Gavin even though he
wanted to hang out in a bar with a few

184
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:22,140
people do as public speaking without
being hassled. And that's it. And,

185
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,930
and I see the way the
media manipulates things.

186
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,931
I've been party to it myself and I've
seen Gavin presented in photos where you

187
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:34,560
look and go, holy fuck, it's
Hitler liked like they get them.

188
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,370
There's one picture of Gavin that I was
petrified by. He's got his arms folded,

189
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:42,180
he's got a scowl on his face, that
hair, you know the short on the side,

190
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:46,650
long on the top and he's looking like,
like he's angry. And I'm like that.

191
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,610
That's not the guy that him and his
wife who's American Indian by the way,

192
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,010
his wife is American Indian.
He's got beautiful kids that come over

193
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,400
my house and use the pool and we
hang out and barbecue and I'm like,

194
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,690
that's not that guy.
No one knows that guy from the paper.

195
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:06,010
They're getting this impression.
He's a really nice guy. He's,

196
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,290
he's a generous,

197
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,320
just a really cool guy to hang out with
and what you see them do in the media is

198
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,351
just crazy.

199
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:19,000
Especially when you know he didn't
invent some God Damn Nazi group.

200
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,590
He was just trying to have a little
outrageous fun and it ran from him.

201
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,990
It got away from him.
The origin of it though,

202
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,050
the way you're describing
that is fucking fantastic.

203
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:33,250
Isn't that nuts to crazy that
that is what presented it?

204
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,050
I mean that that emerged out of that we,
we,

205
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,630
we fuck with rat all
the time because we go,

206
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:45,360
can you believe the inspiration for the
proud boys is this little Jewish kid?

207
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,960
Is that guy's photo online? Oh, I'm
sure there is. Yeah. Pull it up. Rats,

208
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:51,640
rat compound media rat.

209
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,510
You'll probably find them of how
much does this weird you out though?

210
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:59,140
That compound media was the
source of all this is weird. Like,

211
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,510
and it's one of those things
that you worry about like,

212
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:06,070
like I don't want to then be tied because
I know how it works. I love Gavin,

213
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,760
but I don't want to be tied to the
proud boys at this point. You know,

214
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:14,470
I got my own fucking problems
through history. I don't
need any more piled on me,

215
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,250
but what was that thing that I'd sent
you? That here. There he is. There he is.

216
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,110
That's a rat. I guess that was
Halloween. You, I was wearing a suit.

217
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,490
That was, I was the mayor from jaws.
Oh, mayor Vaughn. I was for Halloween.

218
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,300
That's awesome.
That's the guy that started the proud.

219
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,340
He started the proud boys guy.

220
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,550
1938 propaganda posters. Little Cutie
isn't the Norman Rockwell painting.

221
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,440
That's it.
He should be there with like a,

222
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,220
like a guy who's handing them an
apple pie. Yeah. Yeah. And that's,

223
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,130
that's the face of the new Nazi movement.

224
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,620
I think there's a lot of
mistakes were made. Gavin's,

225
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,340
Gavin's made some mistakes and like his,
his whole thing of,

226
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,260
of not of blurring the lines
between parody and honesty's.

227
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,170
It's, he thinks it's fun. It's very
punk rock. He came up last time,

228
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:09,940
he's on the podcast,
which is a few years back.

229
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:14,050
He came on dressed like Michael Douglas
from falling down. He had a briefcase.

230
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,070
He brought the suit like the short sleeve.

231
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,570
She dresses like that all the time
now. Like he goes around, I just,

232
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,870
I just did a Skype interview
with him, uh, yesterday,

233
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:25,670
two days ago and from the
hotel room and he, uh,

234
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,020
he's got the pocket protector and
the pens and the glasses. Yeah.

235
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,540
Like falling down. He thinks it's
funny, but people need to understand,

236
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:36,310
and this is true, he is the
godfather of the hipsters. Yeah.

237
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,640
He'll put in godfather of
hipsters, Google. He comes up,

238
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,870
all of that wardrobe that
guys are wearing. They would,

239
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:46,100
they look like they're wearing old
timey suits with a skinny ties. Yeah.

240
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,010
That's Gavin McInnes.
Yeah.

241
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,980
Literally started that fashion trend
in Williamsburg. Yeah. And they,

242
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:55,240
it took off from there
that the hipster dress,

243
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,500
the way people would dress with those
weird mustaches and all that shit. Yeah.

244
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,560
That literally came out of Gavin Gavin
it, which is amazing. The motherfucker is,

245
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,390
he is like a,
yeah,

246
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,740
there's something like
magnetic about the guy.

247
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,210
He is what a cult leader is like.
He could just start a cult,

248
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,330
which in essence by accident he did
between the hipsters and then this.

249
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,910
He's one of those guys like,
like, Gavin, why don't you start?

250
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,880
Why didn't you start a cult where
you get to fuck the people's wives?

251
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,280
Like that kind of cult. Why?
Why do you go with what?

252
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:34,281
He also did some really good interviews
online where he would trick these

253
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,611
leftists into sitting down with him in
interviews and then along the way there

254
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:41,930
we're having this conversation.

255
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:45,830
It would be exposed that he didn't agree
with them at all and they were trapped

256
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,370
like this hardcore feminist
got trapped with them.

257
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:53,060
A couple of other people get trapped in
this room with him and they they realize

258
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:55,490
like halfway it like some of the
line of questioning and the way he's

259
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:59,120
approaching things like, oh my
God, he's an interesting guy.

260
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,030
He's very interesting and outside
of this progress thing of you never,

261
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,350
never invented that. They never did any
of that. He would be doing great. Yeah.

262
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:10,160
Although he had a problem with one of
one of his own companies that he made

263
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,840
after vice,
they bought them out of vice because uh,

264
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,040
Shane turned more liberal
and it wasn't really,

265
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,010
they weren't really meshing
anymore over their advice,

266
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:24,680
so they kinda just bought out. Uh, Gavin,

267
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,020
he got a lot of money and
decided to do his own thing.

268
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,600
He had an advertising
firm, I guess it was. Uh,

269
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,620
and then he got the boot from that
for making a trans gender comments.

270
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,380
Well, he was telling Damien I was
transgender people have mental health,

271
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:43,790
mental health issue. He was bringing up
all these, here's the problem. He was,

272
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,250
he was saying some things that are
correct. Yeah. Interspersed with, again,

273
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,660
yeah, already in sarcasm, but
in his mind this was like just,

274
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,290
this is something you can talk about
where it was in the public side,

275
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,200
particularly during the Caitlyn
Jenner. Yeah. Whole thing.

276
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,130
People had decided the transgender was
amazing. It's amazing. It's beautiful.

277
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,810
She's incredible. And he was saying, no,

278
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:08,570
these are people that are
mentally ill and there's an a,

279
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:10,370
there's a website and
that he was pointing to,

280
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:13,670
I think it's called transgender regrets
or something like that where they have

281
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:17,750
all these stories of all these men who
turned into women and turned back to men

282
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,600
again. Now they don't
have dicks, no cheese,

283
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:22,520
and they have to take testosterone
injections and they hate their life.

284
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,481
And there's,
uh,

285
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,450
some of them who did it like when they
were in their sixties and now they're in

286
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,250
their seventies and trying
to be a man again. And,

287
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,650
and that gender dysphoria was
thought to be a mental health issue.

288
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,420
Like Anorexia, like a lot, a lot of
other, there's, there's body dysphoria.

289
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:43,220
It'd be people have weird, um, you know,
uh, bodybuilders get it. They, they,

290
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,720
they never think they're big enough.

291
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,500
We'll have like weird perceptions of
their physical presence and their B and

292
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,400
some, uh, I had a
psychologist, Dr Deborah,

293
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:58,401
so who was discussing late onset
gender dysphoria in autistic girls that

294
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,760
autistic teenage girls,

295
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,240
they don't feel like they fit in and
people can convince them that they're

296
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,640
actually a man. Wow. And so a lot
of them start taking hormones and,

297
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,570
and going through transition,
massive regrets.

298
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,090
And then unfortunately for women,
when,

299
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,750
especially when you're a teenager and
you're going through puberty and you take

300
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:19,140
hormones, you literally start
developing male features.

301
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:22,920
Your face gets harder and thicker
and wider. Your shoulders get bigger,

302
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:26,940
like the whole deal. Your hands click
grows to the size of a thumb you,

303
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:31,310
so you make these irreversible
changes or unless, you know,

304
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,850
so you just described Jim Norton's
dream girl. Yeah. Perfect.
