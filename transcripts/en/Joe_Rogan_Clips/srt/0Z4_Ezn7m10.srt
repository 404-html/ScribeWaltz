1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,060
Wow, you're hangry chef was like
the, he was like the beginning.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,580
It happened before that old NBA
people will be like, that's bullshit.

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,940
They didn't the 70s but Shaq was just
the biggest guy that's ever played with

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:12,630
that much agility. Whenever I shake his
hand I'm like, what is that? It's absurd.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,460
Yeah. It's like a desk. It's like shit.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,810
He's like, hey man, what's
up? How you doing Joe pig for,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,210
he did fear factor with me and him.
Him and I were like,

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,800
he was a huge fear factor fan.
Yeah,

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,390
so he did like a whole episode where he
co hosted it with me and he stood next

10
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:33,990
to me and he like he would do,
I'm going to do the countdown to

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,030
shock attack and when he
would do the countdown,

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,180
almost standing next to him like this is
like an eight year old hanging out with

13
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,000
his, his dad. Oh all. I hear
stories like that that he's like,

14
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,760
he's a big kid on set. They can
like, he can't stop fucking around.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,240
I felt an eight year old who grown up.
He's so big.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,140
He's a big kid. That's all I
ever hear. Anybody who works
with him, like he fucked,

17
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:58,920
he loves fucking around. He loves
not taking it serious. Super Fun guy.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Very friendly. He's so dynamic.
He's like a cop. Yeah. He,

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,350
he wants to do like undercover work
for in Miami or something. Right.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,560
Workflow for Laura or some shit.
He uh,

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,890
he would be involved in raids and Shit
and pretty hard to be undercover when

22
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:17,460
you're six 11. I thought this
massive black dude, he's,

23
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,970
he's gotta be one of the
biggest guys that's ever
played. Right. Not the tallest,

24
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,170
but probably one of the most, probably
the most mass. Yeah. And Muscle. I mean,

25
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:28,830
you know, when you get up next to
his arm, it's, it's, it's this,

26
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:33,120
it's like two of my thighs. He got
into MMA for awhile. Diddy, yeah.

27
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,890
I don't know if he's trying
to doing it. Yeah. Training.

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
But there was videos of him
training and I'm just like, look,

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,900
if there was no weight limitations,
like he's so good.

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,310
Look at that and him together.

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,180
So fucking big. Yeah. This,

32
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,210
that does look like it's like
a man in his buddy child child.

33
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,100
And a grown man. Yeah. I have a picture.
I have a picture of me at the MTV.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,490
What was it at move your
words or something like
that with him next to me and

35
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,600
where I was interviewing him for this
thing and he will always be the roast one

36
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:06,480
of the road, a Bieber and I'm in and
I'm doing this with the microphone,

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,920
like full extension with it and he's
bending down still. You still has to Doug.

38
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:15,360
I'm like it check. It's kind of weird
that like the UFC has a weight limit,

39
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,250
like what's the top out to 65 yeah.
Isn't that weird? Yeah. Why is that?

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,630
I don't know. Does it get, there's a
hit. There's a super heavy, super heavy,

41
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,350
we've never had a super heavy fight,
but super heavyweight is to 65 and above.

42
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,071
Well,

43
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:33,210
who's the heaviest fighter that's ever
fought to 65 when they weigh in after

44
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:38,211
that probably Brock Brock was a cut and
wait to make two 65 wasn't he around 300

45
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,700
pounds? I'll for sure.
That's fucking insane.

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,760
And it's a different kind of 300
pounds to Shaq is three 37 and 41

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,550
his shoes are 2122 they're almost to,
his foot is two feet.

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,780
That's his foot. That's how fucking
bit, yeah, his foot is two feet. Jesus.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,630
But like a guy like that could never
fight in the UFC cause you probably can't

50
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:03,940
make two 65 no.
If he did,

51
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:08,890
you'd be sure fucking zero zero fat.
I want,

52
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:13,000
but I wonder about how because he's so
big, he'd have to lose 75 pounds, right?

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,970
They say three thirties I already weighed.
Yeah,

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,300
three 30 they look like as a rookie.
Oh my God.

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,280
He was so big, so big. And, and they,

56
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:24,870
and he's a kid right there by the way.
He's,

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,030
he's put 20 or 19 or 20 years old
right there. God Damn, that's crazy.

58
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a fucking full grown man at 20
I mean, what, did you ever see them,

59
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,020
do you ever seen movie blue chips? Do you
ever see that? No. That's a great movie.

60
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,410
It's like about about Shaq.
Nick Nolte.

61
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,390
He's recruiting him od
shack. Yeah, it's fun.

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,170
It's a phenomenon you would,
and he would love Volti what?

63
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,140
How good is that guy was awesome. Oh,
he's so good in this fucking movie.
