1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,110
I guess the other reason that people are
on my case to some degree is because I

3
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:09,490
have made a strong case,

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,340
which I think is fully documented
by the scientific literature,

5
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:15,880
that there are intrinsic differences say
between men and women and I think the

6
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:16,714
evidence in that,

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,840
this is the thing that staggered me is
that no serious scientists have debated

8
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,130
that for like four decades.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,780
It's that argument was done by the
time I went to graduate school.

10
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:32,080
Everyone knew that human beings,
we're not a blank slate.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,140
That biological forces not parameterize
the way that we thought and felt and

12
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,960
acted in and and valued.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,250
Everyone knew that the fact that this has
become somehow debatable again is just,

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,280
especially because it's being
done by legislative Fiat,

15
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,930
they're forcing it to me as a scientist
is it's just well in the states too with

16
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,640
tight with title nine for example,

17
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:58,510
because title nine is sort of predicated
on that viewpoint. What is title nine?

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:58,901
Oh,

19
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:03,901
title nine was originally just a piece
of legislation that mandated that female

20
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:07,690
sports teams were funded to the same
degree that male sports teams were funded

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,040
in American universities,

22
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:13,150
but it's been expanded out so that if
there's any differences in any areas

23
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:14,830
whatsoever between the genders,

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,930
then the universities are being taken
to court and like 200 of last I looked

25
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:20,141
about,

26
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:24,430
200 of them were up and they can have
their funding revoked if they violate

27
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,330
title land provisions. So it's become
like a vicious weapon for social justice,

28
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,880
Warrior equality of outcome types.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,770
And so it's not just about
sports. No, it's got way,

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,420
way beyond that. Yeah. It's, it's, it's
become an equality of outcome issue.

31
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:43,570
Fundamentally.
There was an article that I sent you,

32
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,840
one of them was, uh,
from, uh, think I, I got,

33
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,780
I got it off of digg.com but it was,
um,

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,600
Jordan Peterson is having his
moment and we should ignore them.

35
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,790
I send this to you and
there was one part of it.

36
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,790
Hey Bro, the last part of
that might be true. Um,

37
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,820
one of the things in the article was
citing this study that showed very little

38
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:10,830
difference. Oh yeah, true. Amen.
And Amen. God pathetic study. Yeah.

39
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,650
Well I sent it to you cause I
was like this, this is not right.

40
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,300
Well the thing is like most
things, it's complicated, you know,

41
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:22,320
so our men and women more
similar or more different?

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,940
Well it depends on how you define the
terms first, but they're more similar.

43
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,380
Well why? Well they're the same species.
So we could start with that like,

44
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,170
but the question is what
are the differences and how
do they manifest themselves

45
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,120
and are those manifestations important?
So here's an example.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,960
If you took a random woman out of the
population and a random man and you had to

47
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,700
bet on who was more
temperamentally aggressive,

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,210
if you bet on the man you'd
be right 60% of the time,

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,380
but you'd be wrong 40% of the time. And
that, that's not a walloping difference,

50
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,040
right? 60 40, it's not 90
10 like, so there's quite,

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,900
there's a lot of overlap between men
and women in terms of their levels of

52
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,110
aggression. And you think, well,
they're more of the same. Yeah.

53
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,240
Except so then let's say no, no,
let's play a slightly different game.

54
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,630
Let's pick the one in 100 most aggressive
person from the random population

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,650
while they're all men. And that's
why all the people in prison are men.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,890
So even though on average
managed them well, yeah,

57
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,800
it's 90 90 90 to 95% right? So, and
often if the women are in prison,

58
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,040
it's cause they got tangled up with
a really bad guy. You know, so,

59
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,610
so one of the problems is,

60
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:40,611
is that differences at the extreme are
where the differences really start to

61
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:41,800
manifest themselves.

62
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,160
And so you can have a small difference
at the level of the average.

63
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,480
But out at the extremes it starts
to make a massive difference.

64
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,490
So let's say to be a Google
engineer, which is hard,
right? Because you'd not only,

65
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:57,340
you have to be an engineer, but you
have to be very good engineer. Say,

66
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,570
well you have to be interested in
things rather than people. That's,

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,080
that's a huge difference in interests.
Like men are more interested in things,

68
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,040
generally speaking. And women are more
interested in people generally speaking.

69
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,960
Now, there's still a lot
of overlap between them,

70
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,720
but that's one of the biggest
differences between men and women.

71
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,280
It's been demonstrated cross culturally.

72
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,550
It's also very big difference in
the Scandinavian countries. Well,

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,080
on average the difference isn't that
great even though it's a relatively large

74
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,360
difference.
But at the extremes it's the same thing.

75
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,480
Almost all the people that are hyper,
um,

76
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,570
what would you call
hyperfocused on things?

77
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,710
They're almost all men and all the people
who are hyper focused on people are

78
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,320
almost all women. And so how does
that play out in the world? Well,

79
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,630
in the Scandinavian countries,
it plays out this way,

80
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,290
but 85% of nurses in Scandinavia
are female and about 85
to 90% of engineers are

81
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:50,410
male.
It doesn't mean women can't be engineers.

82
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,030
It doesn't mean men can't be nurses.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,670
It also doesn't have anything
to do with intelligence,

84
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,830
but it does have to do with interest.

85
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:01,831
And the differences in interest are
big now at the extremes in particular.

86
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,780
So when you read a review like that,
the one that was pointed out,

87
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,500
the first question is, well, what
do you mean by big and little?

88
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,770
There's more overlap. There's more
overlap between men and women.

89
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,010
Then there is difference on virtually
every parameter. Okay, fine.

90
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,880
Are the remaining differences significant
in how they play out in the world?

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,880
And the answer to that is
overwhelmingly significant because you,

92
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,780
you select for extremes.
So here's another example.

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Ashkenazi Jews have an average Iq of
115 so in the typical population overall

94
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,340
has an average Iq of 115 points is
about the difference between the typical

95
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,520
college student and the typical
high school student. Okay?

96
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:43,870
So it's not a massive difference. But
if you go up to the extreme, say, well,

97
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:48,010
let's go look at people who only have
an Iq of 145 which is kind of where you

98
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,690
hit the beginnings of genius level.

99
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,540
It's like the Jews are
overwhelmingly overrepresented.

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
So relatively small differences in
the can produce walloping differences.

101
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,400
At the extremes,
people don't understand that.

102
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:05,330
It's not surprising because it actually
requires a fairly sophisticated grasp of

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,470
statistics.

104
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,730
But when we're talking about things like
differential outcome in the workplace,

105
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,470
um, then you have to take a sophisticated
statistical approach to it or you don't

106
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:16,700
know what the hell you're talking about.

107
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:20,300
And unfortunately many of the people
who are talking about things like gender

108
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,430
differences, they have no idea
what they're talking about.

109
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,740
They don't know the literature,
they don't know there is a literature,

110
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,790
they don't understand biology, like
the, the social constructionist types,

111
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,020
the women's studies types,
the Neo Marxists, they don't
give a damn about biology.

112
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:36,020
It's like they inhabit
some disembodied universe.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,150
So the review was poorly
written at best and did not,

114
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,490
was showed it a very poor grasp of the
relationship between group differences

115
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,070
and economic and practical outcomes.

116
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,400
It's not just that it's
deceptive and there's,

117
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,900
there's a need in some way on that side,

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,430
this side of the debate,

119
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:03,431
the Anti Jordan Peterson side to
label men and women as being virtually

120
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:09,080
identical when there's so much
evidence that that's not the case.

121
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,910
And what your saying? Well, you've,
you've never said one is superior,

122
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:14,990
one is inferior.

123
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,640
What you are is a guy who's pointing out
the reality of the difference between

124
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,870
the various types of human beings and
you've been very open about the extremes

125
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:28,550
about, look, I'm, I'm well aware of
the extremes. I deal with MMA fighters.

126
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:33,551
I know a lot of female MMA fighters are
as aggressive and as tough as any man

127
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,270
you're ever gonna meet in your life.

128
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,830
And I know a lot of men from comedy
that are meek little guys who,

129
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,760
they're not nearly as aggressive as some
of these female fighters. Like there's,

130
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,890
I think one of the beautiful things
about freedom is that people get an

131
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:52,440
opportunity to express themselves
in a way that genuinely them.

132
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,430
And whether that is like a,
our friend Alex Honnold who's a,

133
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,480
a free climber who was like climbing up
these fantastic mountains with no ropes

134
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,080
or whether it's a female and then
they fight, or like Raquel Pennington,

135
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,530
it was just a tank and beating
the shit out of people.

136
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,670
And that's what she loves to do.

137
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,780
All of these extremes are available
to people because of freedom.

138
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,890
This is not a suppressive thing and the
ones and what's stopping people from

139
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:19,850
choosing these paths?

140
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,740
I don't know if you saw the most
recent slip up by the CEO of Youtube.

141
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,450
Um, I retweeted it today. Um,

142
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,790
they were talking about why
there's not as many women in tech.

143
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,360
And she basically said they,

144
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:40,220
both her and the CEO of
Google said exactly what
James Damore was saying in his

145
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,070
memo.
They completely fucked up.

146
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:48,200
They tried to find this, look at
this. This is God damn hilarious.

147
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:52,340
And James Demora had this on his page.
They respond to women.

148
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:55,630
A lack of tech goes could, you know, go
to jail, go to James Demaurice tweet.

149
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,940
Just go to the, the, the what
I retweeted and what he said.

150
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,560
So there was a study published
a while ago, uh, about,
no, Jamie's scroll back up,

151
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,590
right? It was right there.
It's right there. It just
doesn't make his tweet larger.

152
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,190
There you go. Let's see. It said he
sang, did I read this right? See,

153
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,700
I don't know how to say her name
is Susan. What? Jic Six, sorry,

154
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:19,140
I don't know how to say her
name. W A w. O. J. I. C. I. C. K.

155
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:24,141
I said that women find Geeky
male industries as opposed
to social industry's not

156
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,860
very interesting.
And Sundar cites research on gender.

157
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,230
That's exactly the difference in
interest that I just pointed out. Yes.

158
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,050
This is what James Damore wrote
in his memo that got him fired.

159
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,800
And this in my mind, if I was the
lawyer for James Damore, I'd be like,

160
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,090
oh well look what we have here. This
is, this is checkmate. You dummies.

161
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,570
The divorce story is really interesting.
You know,

162
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,850
because I think it's
such a classic story of,

163
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,700
of an engineer getting
tangled up in politics.

164
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:58,050
So Maura went to this diversity seminar
and he wasn't very happy about it

165
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,070
because he knew the literature.

166
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,370
And so at the end of the
seminar they asked for feedback.

167
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,590
Well James Demora is an engineer.

168
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,600
So when you tell an engineer that you
want feedback, the engineer thinks,

169
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,250
oh you on feedback and the and you
want like facts and stuff, right?

170
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,380
Cause that's what feedback would be like.
So do more.

171
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,440
Went and wrote this like Thoreau memo and
gave it to them. He said, well, you know,

172
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,600
this is what I think,
here's some feedback,

173
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,540
and then it traveled around the,

174
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,900
he got no real response from the diversity
people and then he posted it on one

175
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:31,080
of these internal boards at Google
where people can discuss things,

176
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,000
which people at Google do all the time.

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,790
So it was perfectly reasonable for
him to post it because he didn't get a

178
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,800
response from the diversity
people. He thought, well,

179
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,000
let's see what other people think.

180
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,770
And then it was there for a
long time until it was leaked
into the outside world.

181
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,000
It wasn't like Demora was trying to
expose Google for for what it is.

182
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,500
He was just doing what an engineered
type would do with someone asked him to

183
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,550
provide feedback because he's not thinking
politically. He's not thinking, oh,

184
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,920
they just want to hear
what they already said.

185
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,100
He thought they actually
wanted some facts anyways,

186
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:06,390
I think they picked on the wrong guy
because turns out to be pretty damn tough.

187
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,530
But he's very smart and a very kind guy.
When you sit down and talk to him,

188
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:14,550
he's not a sexist. He said he's a guy
that's talking about facts. In fact,

189
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:19,551
he wrote more than a page and a half I
believe on strategies for getting more

190
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:23,070
women interested in tech.
He's not a sexist,

191
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,310
this is just a guy that was talking
about the differences in the choices that

192
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,420
people make that it's based on just the
variations that you were just discussing.

193
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:33,330
Well there's a good study done a while
ago and unfortunately I remember the

194
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:38,330
author, but they were looking at
junior high math prodigies and they're,

195
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,800
they're pretty equally distributed
between boys and girls.

196
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,910
But by the time university came along,
they math prodigy boys,

197
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,220
they tend to go into the stem fields,
but the girls wouldn't.

198
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,280
And it doesn't because they lacked the
ability cause they had stellar ability.

199
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,870
It's because they weren't interested.

200
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,940
And it turns out like the interesting
turns out to be a big one.

201
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:57,130
So with personality alone,

202
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:00,310
if you measure men and women's
personalities and then you add up all the

203
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,660
differences in personalities,

204
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,840
you could tell with about 75
to 80% certainty by looking
at her full personality

205
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,200
readout, whether a person is male or
female. So you'd be wrong 25% of the time,

206
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:13,570
something like that.
But if you add interest to that,

207
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:17,170
you can get it up to about 90%
and so, you know, you say, well,

208
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,910
are these differences large? Well,
individually they're not that big.

209
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,590
They make more difference at the extremes,
but if you add the mop,

210
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,230
then you can almost completely
differentiate men from
women. So by that token,

211
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,130
they're,
they're very large.

212
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,440
And the interesting actually
it turns out to matter a lot.

213
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,290
Like it's probably the most important
individual difference that has been

214
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,950
discovered between men and women at the
psychological level and has real decent

215
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,370
explanatory power because you might say,
well,

216
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,100
men have a slight edge in spatial
intelligence and that's why they're

217
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,870
overrepresented in stem fields.

218
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,230
And women have a slight edge and
verbal intelligence, this is debatable,

219
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,000
but literature kind of indicates that.

220
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:58,870
And that's why they're overwhelmingly
the majority of fiction readers for

221
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:00,210
example.
Um,

222
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,940
is that the reason that there's
differential representation
in the stem fields?

223
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,230
It's like, no, it doesn't seem to be.

224
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,940
It doesn't look like it's
an intellectual issue,

225
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,630
which is also what the more pointed out,
by the way, he never said once that it,

226
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:13,960
this was a cognitive issue,
but it's a matter of choice.

227
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,120
Matter of interest and women tend
to be more, more people oriented.

228
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,350
Now the thing is,

229
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,830
this is also being discovered in
chimpanzees and other primates,

230
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,390
like if you offer baby
or child chimpanzees,

231
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:33,010
juvenile chimpanzees,
the toys choice between thing like toys,

232
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,890
like cars or people like toys,
like dolls.

233
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,190
The males will go for the thing like
toys and the females would go for the

234
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:42,490
people like toys. Do you see that
in primates and you think, well,

235
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,120
it's not surprising. It's like, well, no
it's not. It's not that surprising really.

236
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,820
I mean women have to take care of infants,

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,740
tiny infants and you have to be really
people oriented to do that because a tiny

238
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:58,741
infant isn't unbelievably demanding
social relationship and it's a primary

239
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,890
relationship for about two years,
you know,

240
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,340
and so women are tilted towards the
kind of temperament that makes that

241
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,600
possible. It's like, well, it's not such
a shock, really. That's such a surprise.

242
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,790
Okay.
Okay.
