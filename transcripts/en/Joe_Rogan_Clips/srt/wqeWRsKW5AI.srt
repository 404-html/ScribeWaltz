1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,830
Yeah. I don't want to watch that
Michael Jackson thing. First of all,

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:07,830
it's weird. Come on. Not Alive. He's
not allowed to defend themselves.

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,950
So it's weird.
It's also stories and you know,

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,800
people tell the truth in stories
sometimes and sometimes they don't and you

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,780
don't know. You don't know. And, and also
there was, you know, it was always weird.

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:22,350
Like people,

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,350
no one knew why with all the rumors that
everybody had ever heard about Michael

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,810
Jackson, that anybody would let
their kids go and hang out with him.

9
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,140
Like when you watched your documentary,
like these parents are fucking moron.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,800
I don't get it, man. Two of the
fathers have committed suicide since.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,480
Oh
Christ.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,910
We don't have any hard. Oh,
it was molesting kids. Right.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,710
All we have is rumors. Well,
here's the thing. He was
acquitted. Here's the problem.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,720
The doctor, his very doctor said
that he was chemically castrates.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,820
I'm not the guy who
killed them. Yes. Yeah.

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,540
That guy said he was chemically castrated
by his parents to protect his voice.

17
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,670
You have no testosterone. Right, exactly.
Not just no testosterone. The units,

18
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,020
I mean me,
I don't think so.

19
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,930
One of the other weird things I saw that
was like facts. You should hear it. No,

20
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:15,450
from the documentary was that he had uh,

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,660
some something to do with
the sound in the room.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,840
The hallway leading up to his bedroom was
wired so that footprint's would make a

23
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,320
ding dong sound in the room.

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:30,810
It's just a very strange thing to
just have in general for any purpose.

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,260
But if you grow up in the spotlight,
because remember he was such a big star,

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,840
you might have some anxiety,
right?

27
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,690
Maybe he didn't want anybody walking in
and I'm a naked or something or he don't

28
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:42,720
want anyone walking in while,
yeah, touching boys could be that.

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,920
Look who the fuck we don't know. We don't
know. However, what do you think Jamie?

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,050
I know,
I'm just saying some of the facts.

31
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:52,530
I remember he spent like 30 straight
nights with like a 12 year old at his,

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,860
at his house in between that kid's
mom's house in his dad's house.

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,410
We're divorced and there's some
paying for somebody's video.

34
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,420
There's so much video of him
in this little boy holding
hands and the boy in the

35
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,560
video goes, yeah, we would
hold hands and we had a signal,

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,750
we'd rub each other's poems when we
were thinking sexually about each other.

37
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,660
However you got to chalk
it up to the shitty pants.

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,010
Cause if John Legend came to my house
it was like, dude, I love tiger.

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,330
You mind if I take him out for a little
while but get your God damn mind you're

40
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:29,030
not going well not only that and John
Legend's not a pedophile is not known but,

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,650
but they didn't know Michael Jackson was
that everybody knew there was something.

42
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm not at the time he was the
biggest star in the world back then.

43
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,520
And the people in the nineties

44
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,400
I everybody knew something was really,

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,910
he was always hanging around with the
kids. Yeah. Cause he loved Dale Young.

46
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,220
Younger than us. You gotta
trust me anywhere. Sure.

47
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,670
Let's say month on something was up that
yet Jamie's more on the ball then you

48
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,710
saw he's always online. You're out
getting pussy James Online. The chip,

49
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,110
the chip point look too well.
Well played, sir. Well played.

50
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,810
I just feel like it's too weird.

51
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,380
It's too weird to let your kids
hang out with this grown man.

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,490
All those times he was mentally ill. They
and what his family says, they go, no, no.

53
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,630
A lot of you, you're confusing
him for being, he didn't
have a childhood. His Dad,

54
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,730
Robert with his child.
I think that's true inside.

55
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,050
He felt like he was nine years old,

56
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,750
so he missed out on the
sleepovers in video games,

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,300
so he would get friends with
kids and I think loud on.

58
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,770
It's batshit crazy,
batshit crazy.

59
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,660
I think all those things
that you're saying are true,

60
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,320
but I also think it's true that he
was probably chemically castrated.

61
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,680
I really think that's true because I've
said that a long time ago. I said, yeah,

62
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,660
I think he's a cast. Trato
the waste, his voice is

63
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,930
telling that it's human nature kid.

64
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,080
That voice is just not a man's voice.
She's not even a false settled. Yep.

65
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,840
A woman's voice castrated.

66
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,560
Then when he would have zero
testosterone to molest kids,

67
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,300
while he might not have been
doing it because he was Horny,

68
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,640
he might've been doing it
because he was just weird. Well,

69
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,230
these kits as he was busted nuts,

70
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,130
the kids in the video said like you
would jack himself off in front of them.

71
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,030
Boy It,
it'll make you sick to your stomach.

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,101
Not his wife,

73
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:17,760
but the woman that gave birth to his two
kids said she'd never had sex with him.

74
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,370
Yeah,
that's more likely.

75
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,360
If you're chemically castrated,

76
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,750
that means your body doesn't
produce any testosterone anymore.

77
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,880
But it doesn't mean you can't shoot it
into your body and you know you could,

78
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,530
you could shoot, test into your
body if you have no net not,

79
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:36,170
you're not making seaman.
Yeah, have your balls are dead,

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,610
but you isn't seeming or

81
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,510
[inaudible] a sperms from the nuts.
And then like your prostate and I,

82
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:43,350
some other things that
get the juice together.

83
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,760
So not a doctor.
Clearly

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,360
the whole thing is fucking super weird.
It's swab weird. It just makes me sad.

85
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,300
It makes me so sad. But it's
also, there's like a, there's a,

86
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:01,600
there's a lesson to be learned
there in so many different ways,

87
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,280
but one of the big lessons to be learned
is that you never want to be that

88
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:10,960
famous. That, that was my
takeaway. I was watching my grind.

89
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,040
I go, can you imagine being that famous?
And she goes, yeah, it's probably awesome.

90
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,610
But no, hold on. You know how we like
to go to the mall? We go out to eat.

91
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,600
That's gone. You can't do that anymore.
That's all gone. It's all gone.

92
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,090
People would book, but they'll
start a riot. So take that,

93
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,290
take that away from your
normal life is not over.

94
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,240
You just stay in your house. But yeah,
that's why he developed an amusement park.

95
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,340
Like he made his house,
I'll fucking amusement park.

96
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,280
They had, they set this up for him to
go grocery shopping. They had a fake,

97
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,990
the empty the grocery store and paid
people to be a shoppers so he could have

98
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:49,120
the experience of what
it's like to be normal.

99
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,670
Going through like a Ralph's or
whatever. Yeah. People like, hey,

100
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:55,504
how's it [inaudible]

101
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,120
some bread. See how weird this is. Well,

102
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:02,450
they should make it so we hired people,

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,270
we could do that and he wore
a hat and he's dancing around.

104
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,980
It's, everything was weird man. Everything
was going to feel bad for him though.

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,130
Oh yeah. So we know how
much he was worth. I Dunno.

106
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,060
One point $7 billion they say,
but that's after he died. It see,

107
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,950
the thing is when he died,
he got super rich.

108
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,980
He was actually in the hole
before he died. No, because,

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,190
because it wasn't tour hammer broke.
Where when he talked to MCM, he's like,

110
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:31,070
what are you talking about? He's
like, there's like, you know,

111
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,090
publicists broke where they released that
he'd go bankrupt and he was, I was fun.

112
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,710
I was balling,
I think it was Michael Jackson.

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,490
He owned the Beatles catalog. Oh. So
that's where he had all his money.

114
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,350
He bought all the originals. The
masters of his and the beetle. Yeah.

115
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,530
Paul Mccartney was mad
about that apparent. He told
him. He gave me the idea.

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,370
Paul gave me idea. Good
idea. I'll be right back.

117
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,330
So why question Paul by it. He's
got money. You can afford it.

118
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,890
Here's one fourth of the Beatles money.
Not all of it combined. You know,

119
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,600
do think health condition.
There's no stars like Michael
Jackson. You can't write,

120
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,530
can't do it in the
current society there's,

121
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:17,000
there's pockets now in happy
birthday he owned happy birthday.

122
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,130
He bought the rights to it.
So that's why you weren't,

123
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:21,440
you're not allowed to sing it
in a restaurant that's over.

124
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,310
I think you can say it and they can now
cause it's back into the public domain.

125
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,600
That's why everyone's sinks a bullshit.
Happy Birthday. Happy, happy birthday.

126
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,940
Happy, happy, happy times.

127
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,730
ASCAP or BMI could literally come
in and just find the restaurant.

128
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,660
If you were saying Shit, cause I'm
Michael. That's so stupid. Dude.

129
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,010
Watteau ball or move with copyright owning
happy birthday. I went out of money.

130
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,760
Too bad he doesn't like bitches cause
that'd be the biggest movie ever.

131
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
Maybe just like it just, who
knows. Know the guy's dead.

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,920
He can't have some respect shop.
Here's the thing,

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,290
those two dudes who are doing it,
they were,

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,880
one was the key witness when he
got away in court. What dudes?

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,600
The dudes in the documentary,
the two, oh, we got molested.

136
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,240
The one was the number one key witness
who is saying he didn't get them listed.

137
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,480
Okay, well then you shouldn't be able
to say anything. Both of them were,

138
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,560
because that means they should go to
jail. And now they're like, well, no,

139
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:20,510
that's not true. We were young bitch,
you were twice. Well also like,

140
00:08:20,511 --> 00:08:24,200
isn't that perjury? It means
he lied in court. Be fucked.

141
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,110
You can't lie in court either way,
one way or the other.

142
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,410
You can't lie to protect somebody and
you can't lie to accuse someone either.

143
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,750
You can't lie. I don't know
what the deal is. I mean,

144
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:35,340
that seems like that's something
they could drag him to court for it.

145
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:37,760
And the Jackson came out, went,
well, isn't it convenient?

146
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:42,410
You guys are coming out now when you're
in financial trouble? Uh, of course.

147
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,430
Yeah,
of course.
