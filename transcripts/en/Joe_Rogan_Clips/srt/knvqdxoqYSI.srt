1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,470
Hello Freak bitches.
I mean it's,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,810
who the hell doesn't want to hear that?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,400
So we're treading kind of close to the,
uh,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,530
the argument she got into with Sam
Harris about the nature of truth. And,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,570
and since I heard that I've been sort of
itching to have this conversation with

6
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:25,530
you because I think there's a, uh, a
way of viewing this that will actually,

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,310
um,
perhaps reconcile the two points of view,

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,470
but there's a bitter pill that comes along
with it. So here's, here's my argument.

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,843
Um,

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,650
we tend to think of intellect has evolved,

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,150
has as having evolved because knowing
what's true gives you an advantage,

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,200
but there's actually nothing that says
that the literal truth is where advantage

13
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:53,430
lies. And so, uh, I have a category
that I call literally false,

14
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:58,320
metaphorically true. These are ideas
that aren't true in the factual sense,

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,920
but they are true enough that if
you behave as if they were true,

16
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,760
you come out ahead of where you would
be if you behaved according to the fact

17
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,450
that they're not true.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,440
So let me give you a couple of trivial
examples that won't be controversial.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,540
Porcupines can throw
their quills not true.

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,100
However,

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,870
if you live near porcupines and you
imagine that porcupines can throw their

22
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:25,440
quills, you'll give them
some space. If you don't,

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,710
you may realize and that they can't throw
their quills get really close to one

24
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:31,590
and it may wheel around and
nail you with a porcupine quill,

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,700
which can be extremely dangerous because
they are microscopically designed to

26
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,240
move in from where they puncture you
over time and they can puncture a vital

27
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,890
organ or you can get an infection.

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,790
So the person who believes that a
porcupine can throw their quills has an

29
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:48,570
advantage that isn't predicated on the
fact that this is actually a literal

30
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:53,030
truth, right? Um,
another one might be, uh,

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,520
people say everything happens
for a reason, right? Well,

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,270
unless you're talking about physics as
the reason everything doesn't happen for

33
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,470
a reason.
However,

34
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,610
if you are the kind of person who believes
that everything happens for a reason

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,990
and then some terrible tragedy befalls
you, you may be on the lookout. Well,

36
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,280
what's the reason that this happened?

37
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,400
Maybe it's supposed to open
some opportunity and you
won't miss that opportunity

38
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,000
the way somebody who was preoccupied
with their misfortune wood.

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,940
So literal falseness,

40
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,210
but metaphorical truth is actually I
would argue the category under which

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,990
religious truth evolves.
Now the problem,

42
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,930
the bitter pill that
I mentioned is that I,

43
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:37,390
I've heard you say that the
truths that are captured in the,

44
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,600
the religious version of
things are basically like, uh,

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,290
you know,

46
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,890
there's an individual truth and then
there's a truth of your family and it's a

47
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:48,850
truth of the population
that you're living in.

48
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:51,690
And these things are all encoded in these,
these doctrines,

49
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:54,840
which is true and you would expect it
to be because the doctrines are carried

50
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,380
along in the population.
The problem is,

51
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,230
what I hear you arguing and
you tell me if I have it wrong,

52
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,470
is that we should therefore expect,
uh,

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,560
the encoded metaphorical truths in
these religious traditions to be morally

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,653
right.

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,530
But there's nothing that actually says
it will be morally right because there

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,010
are metaphorical truth that
might in fact be reprehensible,

57
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,780
but nonetheless effective.

58
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,530
And so what I would argue,

59
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,670
the overarching point here
would be that you're right,

60
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,500
that the documents that contain these
descriptions of things are full of things

61
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,740
that are true in some sense that
is not literal scientific truth.

62
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,810
And our west up there,
their purpose,

63
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,480
what isn't true is that those
things are inherently up to date.

64
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,260
Um, and I wouldn't, okay.
I mean, first of all,

65
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,650
the first thing about that is
that a discussion like that,

66
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,840
and this is also what
happened with Sam Harris,

67
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,510
takes me to the very limits
of my intellectual ability.

68
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,380
And so even in discussing it, I'm going
to make all sorts of mistakes because,

69
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,900
because it's treacherous territory.

70
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,230
But I would say my understanding of the
great myths has that observation built

71
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:16,480
into it. So one of the archetypes is
that of the, of the tyrannical father,

72
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,890
which is the architect by the way,

73
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,460
that possesses the minds of people
who accused Western Society of being

74
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,280
patriarchal.
They're possessed by a singular archetype.

75
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,170
And that's the archetype
of the tyrannical father.

76
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,310
They don't see that there's a tyrannical
father and a wise king because there is,

77
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,330
that's, that's, you can't even
point that out. But anyways,

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,400
in the, in the oldest, in
some of our oldest stories,

79
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:42,310
there's a representation of the dead past.

80
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,760
So let me give you an example
that everyone knows about.

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,650
The Story of Pinocchio is the story
of the individualization of Pinocchio.

82
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,580
He starts out as a puppet.
He's a Marionette, he's a
wooden head, he's a liar.

83
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,560
And he's pulled by forces that he
does not understand. Right? Okay. So,

84
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,410
but he has a good father. That's
Japan. It went, so he's got a good,

85
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,820
and Japan have wishes that he
becomes a real individual. And so,

86
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,640
and he knows that that's an impossible,
what she wishes on a star,

87
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:12,520
that his son could become an actual
individual knowing full well that that's

88
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,580
unlikely and impossible. So
Japan, it was a good king. So,

89
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,380
but the story is also about Japan auto
because what happens is that when Japan

90
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,850
will loses Pinocchio,
loses his son, which will,

91
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:25,420
you could think about as the active
dynamic, attentive force of youth.

92
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,450
Then he ends up stultified
in the belly of a whale,

93
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:30,850
which is a symbol of chaos
at the bottom of the ocean.

94
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,500
And then Pinocchio has to rescue him.

95
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,950
So I would say there is an instantiation
of evolutionarily accumulated wisdom in

96
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,420
the great stories of the past,

97
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,830
but they're still dead
and it requires the union.

98
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,690
This is why in Christian theology,

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,440
the God had has tripartite structure.

100
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:54,040
This is part of the reason there's
God the father, but the father's dead.

101
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,380
The father was right a hundred years
ago or thousand years ago and is still

102
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:01,610
partly right, but he's dead.
He can't participate in the
updating of the process.

103
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,200
So you need an active force.

104
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,640
Now the act of force is the same thing
that generated those stories across time,

105
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,960
right? So it's, it's the same thing
except it's also alive in the present.

106
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,010
And so your moral duty, and
this is another thing that
happens in, in Pinocchio,

107
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,500
is to rescue your dead father
from the belly of the whale.

108
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,650
And that's partly what I'm trying to
do with these biblical lectures because

109
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,780
you're objection is correct.

110
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,340
The reason it's correct is because
even if the solution was correct,

111
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,170
the landscape has changed and it's changed
incrementally or in a revolutionary

112
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,220
way.
We don't know.

113
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,050
And so those old truths are at
best partial and at worst blind.

114
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,060
But that doesn't mean
you can just say like,

115
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,170
like Mao did during the
cultural revolution, we'll
let's just destroy the past.

116
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,300
It's like, no, that would
be like saying, well,

117
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,930
you don't need a body anymore because
your body is the collected wisdom of the

118
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:54,620
evolutionary process across three and a
half billion years. I absolutely agree.

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,580
Because the stories are not literal.
It's impossible to know whether they,

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,630
well not impossible,

121
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,750
but very difficult to know whether
or not the truth that is contained to

122
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,620
metaphorically is still relevant if it's
been inverted and it's now absolutely

123
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:10,740
false. Or, uh, so Carl Young
talked about this a lot. Hey, and,

124
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,450
and one of the things he said was
that your moral duty is to realize the

125
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:18,410
archetype in the, in the confines of
your own life. And so you say, well,

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,700
there's an archetype of perfection
that pervades the west. And for the,

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,880
for the sake of argument, I'm going
to call that Christ the Christ image.

128
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:28,160
It's something like that.
That's the archetypal image.

129
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,110
Now we have a story about what Christ's
historical life was like. Well,

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,153
well,
well,

131
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,600
you can't have that life because you
would have had to be in the Middle East

132
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:40,970
2000 years ago.
That's not your life.

133
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,720
But what you can do is take the
archetype and you can manifest.

134
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:46,730
It was within the
confines of your own life,

135
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:51,560
and what that does is force you to undergo
the difficult process of updating the

136
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,970
ancient wisdom, and you don't just
forego it, you can't, or you can,

137
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:57,320
but you'll pay a massive price,

138
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:01,130
and part of that will be social
disintegration because it's, it's the,

139
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,260
the past is alive enough so that those
of us who inhabit its corpse aren't

140
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,940
clawing each other to death. Well, we're
feeding right? That's the critical issue.

141
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,391
Now,

142
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,390
it's not alive enough because the bloody
thing could fall apart at any moment,

143
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:18,020
and we need to be awake and alert in
order to keep it updated and maintained

144
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,480
well. Not only that, but they're,

145
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,860
the greatest hazards to us in the present
are only partially going to be dealt

146
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:28,850
with in these texts. And that's, that's
my biggest concern is that, you know,

147
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,500
if we take, uh, you know, Dawkins
dismissing religion as mind virus,

148
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,910
this was very dangerous
because it neglects the truth
that you're talking about

149
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,020
and it prevents us from
getting to a conversation in
which we can talk about the

150
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,570
fact that religious texts,

151
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,610
religions are not mind viruses,
they are adaptations to past environments.

152
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:53,570
They do contain a kind of truth that isn't
necessarily literal and is in general

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,790
not literal. Um, but none of them,

154
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,270
no ancient religion is up to date for
Google's algorithms being the hazard to

155
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,490
civilization.
That it probably is.

156
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,500
We need to figure out how to navigate
where the ancestral wisdom is simply not

157
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,770
up to the current challenge.

158
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,500
Let me modify that slightly because
I think it's true and not true.

159
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,240
The stories are, um, erroneous
in detail and write in pattern.

160
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,530
So for example,

161
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,730
there's an idea that one of the things
that the mythological hero does is stand

162
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,290
up against the tyranny of the state.

163
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,970
Now you don't have to specify the nature
of the tyranny of the state in order

164
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:36,420
for that to be a truth that's
applicable across different contexts.

165
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,320
I would say what's happened with the
great religious myths is that they've,

166
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
they operated level of obstruction
such that the abstract entities are

167
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:48,870
applicable in every single environment.
I'll give you an example of that.

168
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,860
It is extremely useful to represent the
phenomenology of your experience as a

169
00:09:56,191 --> 00:10:00,840
domain of chaos and order that works
in every single environment for every

170
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,500
person. And so the domain of order
it, I can describe it technically,

171
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,580
you're in the domain of order.

172
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:10,560
When your actions produce the result
you desire and you're in the domain of

173
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:14,460
chaos when they don't. And then,
and then I could say, well,

174
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:18,360
your task is to straddle
the border between those two
domains because you don't

175
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,970
always want to be where everything that
you're doing is working because you

176
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:24,420
don't learn anything and you don't want
to be where nothing you're doing is

177
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:25,830
working because it's overwhelming.

178
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,280
You want to be stable and
dynamic at the same point.

179
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,700
And The Dallas do that very nicely
because they have a chaos order

180
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:35,820
conceptualization of the,
of the phenomenological landscape.

181
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:40,821
And their claim is the point of maximum
proper being is right at the center of

182
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:46,020
the border between chaos and order.
And I think that's true across contexts.

183
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,130
So I don't think that truth ages,
some of them don't know.

184
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,290
But the question really is one of,

185
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,410
at what point is there so much legacy
code that the taking the package is,

186
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,590
uh, is more harmful than it is
beneficial? And at what point are,

187
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,810
you know,
if God were writing today,

188
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm pretty convinced the first
commandment would be thou shalt not enrich

189
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:13,890
uranium. It would make sense
as the number one commandment.

190
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,040
It's not there because you're any,
um,

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
wasn't a concept at the point that the
thing was written or was the hazard of

192
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,390
enriching it obvious.
And so

193
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,360
the fact that it isn't mentioned
tends to deemphasize it as a risk.

194
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,920
And so I guess the question
is, is it possible, I mean,

195
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,700
is it possible that by recognizing that
these traditions carry huge amounts of

196
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,610
ancestral wisdom forward,

197
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:46,611
but that that wisdom is certain to be
so incomplete that it doesn't address

198
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,980
modern questions that we can be liberated
to move forward and to honor those

199
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,540
traditions for bringing us here,

200
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,410
but to recognize that we actually have
to move forward with something more

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,000
potent and uptodate,
which is not,

202
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,180
not easy because you can't just take
the scientific truth of the moment and

203
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,420
implement a lot of it isn't even right.
Yeah.

204
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,430
It's also not that easy to
rewrite a fairy tale, you know?

205
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,940
And some of these fairy tales that people
are trying to rewrite in modern times

206
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,310
or perhaps 15,000 years
old and people think,

207
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:21,610
well we can just update that so that
the modern version will be better.

208
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:24,460
It turns out that that's very, very
difficult. And there's another,

209
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,670
I'm going to play devil's advocate
against my own position here. You know,

210
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:28,241
cause I say,

211
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:32,830
well the religious texts in code profound
and evolutionarily determined truths

212
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:37,410
that are universal. Okay. Which
religious texts, right? Because,

213
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,270
well because you might say,
well all of them,

214
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,140
but then that means that obscures
the important differences between the

215
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:48,460
traditions. And I'm by no means
certain that all of them do. You know?

216
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:51,910
So I'm going to stick my neck
way the hell out because why not?

217
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,150
It isn't obvious to me
that Islam does because I,

218
00:12:55,151 --> 00:13:00,151
it's very difficult for me to see that
the totalizing nature of Islam doesn't

219
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:04,790
make it unique among religions. So
now good. So while there's that old,

220
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,310
if you don't mind, but it isn't
the issue using the word truth.

221
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,150
Cause we can say true, we could use
tradition and wisdom and were okay,

222
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,930
but as soon as we start saying truth,
then then we run into problems. I mean,

223
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:20,350
and even when you're talking about
porcupines where you're talking about

224
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,540
w what did you say? Metaphorical
truth versus, look, it's not true.

225
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,090
It's real simple.
Just don't go near the porcupine teach.

226
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:30,870
The kid did not go near the porcupine
because porcupine quills are dangerous.

227
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,720
They get stuck in you.
The really dangerous can they throw it at,

228
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:34,740
you know they cannot,

229
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,460
but just stay clear of them because you
don't want them to somehow know they get

230
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,890
in touch with your body.
There's no truth in that.

231
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,260
They can throw their quills at you.

232
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,300
You benefit from being particularly
aware of the dangers of their quills.

233
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,400
But if you tell a kid that they can throw
their quills and so therefore the kid

234
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:56,460
stays clear of him.
Here's a faulty assumption in his head,

235
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,940
you're lying to them for their own
protection and that's not good.

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,833
I wouldn't do it.

237
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,830
I think the same thing can be said of
everything happens for a reason. Well,

238
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,440
here's the problem. We don't know
if everything happens for a reason.

239
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:11,670
Maybe when you die you go to some
auditing room and they go, well, you know,

240
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:15,360
it's all just a part of some gigantic
algorithm that you, impossible.

241
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,320
It's impossible for you to understand
duty or limited processing power of the

242
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:20,220
human brain.

243
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,370
You're dealing with some Semyon sort of
a complex geometry that's really just

244
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,100
designed to keep your body moving and
keep you alive and spread your genetics so

245
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,350
that you can eventually evolve
to the point when you were a god.

246
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,140
Well, first of all, I, I have kids.
I wouldn't tell him that a porcupine.

247
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,800
I'm sure you wouldn't. But how, but why
use the word truth though? Because, well,

248
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:43,770
the question is why do people tell you
that a porcupine can throw its quilts?

249
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,310
I don't think they do. Oh,
they do. Well, if they do,

250
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:48,780
they don't know any
better or they're liars.

251
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,860
And so all I'm saying is that actually
is likely to be the product of selection.

252
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,521
In other words,

253
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:59,930
that those people who had encoded that
they do throw their quills have an

254
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:00,764
advantage.

255
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,130
It's not the way I wouldn't do it and
for exactly the reason that you point out

256
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:08,120
which is if you give a child
the wrong model of a porcupine,

257
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,470
I don't know whether a porcupine is
liable to be the gateway to some more

258
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:17,120
important question, but if it were,
you've just steered the kid wrong.

259
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,410
Here's part of the problem, and this is
part of this is a really big problem.

260
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,620
There's two things I guess that were
brought up by what you described in the

261
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:27,570
first is the terminology of truth.
Now Harris,

262
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,210
his claim with regards to my utilization
of truth was that I was absconding with

263
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,070
the definition of truth
and it false matter,

264
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,970
but he was wrong because the idea of
truth is much older than the idea of

265
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:42,770
objective truth and the original
notion of truth wasn't objective. True.

266
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:46,670
It was like the Arrow flies
straight and true. Right?

267
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,530
It had meant something like reliably,

268
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,340
reliably on its way to the appropriate
destination, something like that.

269
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,600
And when Christ said,

270
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,410
I am the truth and the way what I
can remember [inaudible] yes, yes.

271
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,440
The truth he was talking about
wasn't an objective truth.

272
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:05,441
So Sam's idea that I had somehow taken
the idea of truth that was actually

273
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:10,160
objective all along and done something
crooked with it is just wrong. It's wrong.

274
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:15,260
Well, there's so truth can have
multiple definitions. That's the issue.

275
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:19,070
And that's exactly what we're, what we're
trying to get at here is like there's,

276
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,760
to me, there's two kinds of
truth and, and they may be,

277
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,120
they may be commensurate, you may be
able to stack them on top of one another,

278
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,810
but now and then they dissociate.
And, and this is actually what, what,

279
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,390
what Brett was referring to as well.
So,

280
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,560
so in this is where it gets so
complicated that I can barely manage it.

281
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,960
There's a, there's the truth that manifest
itself in the manner in which you act.

282
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,520
And there's the truth that manifest itself
as a representation of the objective

283
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,354
world.

284
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,260
And sometimes both those truths are
stacked on top of each other and sometimes

285
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:51,651
they're not.

286
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:55,310
So like I could give you a piece of wisdom
that would work well if you acted it

287
00:16:55,311 --> 00:17:00,020
out. That carried within it an inaccurate
representation of part of the objective

288
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,700
world. And you could say, well,

289
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,760
maybe that's actually the case with the
biblical stories because if you read

290
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:07,430
them as science,
they don't read well.

291
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,690
So let's take malaria as a good example.
Malaria,

292
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,560
the root of the word is
mal area, bad air, right?

293
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,050
Malaria is not transmitted by bad air.

294
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:21,170
It's transmitted by mosquitoes that live
in places where you might think the air

295
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:25,310
is bad. So the point is, it's part of the
way there and that's, that's a good one.

296
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,870
And then that,
and that also gets,

297
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,160
see there's another weird distinction
here and that I was trying to draw it with

298
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:32,550
Sam,
but that's a really tricky one.

299
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,690
And we ordered in because we
started to talk about pragmatism,

300
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:40,040
but there's also something like the
truth of a description and the truth of a

301
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:44,750
tool. And my sense is that people's
fundamental truths are tool.

302
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:49,560
Like we use them to function properly
in the world. And you could say, well,

303
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,800
a sharp ax is more true than a doll acts.

304
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:56,000
And actually you can use the word
true in that sense that actually isn't

305
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:59,640
appropriate appropriate
use of the word there.

306
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,940
There are tool truth and there are
objective factors now and in the optimal

307
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,540
circumstance those map onto each other
but we're not smart enough often to make

308
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,570
the map onto each other because we just
don't know enough and there are lots of

309
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:16,410
truths that we have that portray the
objective world improperly that are still

310
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,244
true.

311
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:21,930
Is this problem using the term true when
sometimes you should use the term fact

312
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,470
like like yes,
one plus one is two that is a fact.

313
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,600
One plus one is two is also true.

314
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:32,740
You throw some water on a match that is
and it'll go out. That's a fact. Yes.

315
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,310
Well,
as I see it,

316
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,860
at least there is this overarching truth,

317
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,750
the one that Sam Harris was pointing to,

318
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,130
the one I think you're pointing to
also and the one I I'm imagining we all

319
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:44,900
subscribe to,

320
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,990
right there is the testable truth that
reveals itself in the laboratory or in a

321
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:53,070
careful experiment in the field and
that really is the top level of truth.

322
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,440
But then there are the
truths you can't speak yet.

323
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,520
So let's take the word filth from uh,

324
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,750
from the Old Testament. Okay?
Filth means shit, right?

325
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:08,160
You're not supposed to shit in camp
because God finds it offensive.

326
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,040
Now the problem is the germ theory of
disease doesn't come about for thousands

327
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,990
of years after that truth was written.

328
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,650
That truth keeps you from infecting people
long before you can ever explain that

329
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:25,350
there are microbes that grow in human
shit that are a particular danger to your

330
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,120
population.
So the point is,

331
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,300
would you rather be held back to the
place where you can actually describe the,

332
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,710
the literal underpinnings
of what's going on?

333
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,340
Or do you want to be liberated to say
something that actually results in a,

334
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,270
an improvement in health before,
you know,

335
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,050
literally thousands of years
before anybody had any idea
that it was microbes at

336
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,380
the root of this, you
need to figure out. So,

337
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,230
so an elaboration of that
would be something like
human beings needed to figure

338
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:55,500
out how to act without dying before
they could understand the nature of the

339
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:58,170
world well enough to justify
that. Right? And you be,

340
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,910
be crazy now that we do have
the germ theory of disease to,

341
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:08,390
to amplify that original crude version
of the truth or that crude approximation

342
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:12,390
of what you need to believe
in order to behave safely.

343
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,680
There's no reason for that truth
to, to be promoted. In fact,

344
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:21,060
you don't hear people describing this part
of uh, the, the old testament anymore.

345
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,640
It's not relevant,
right?

346
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,330
This is probably all wad
dietary restrictions were in
the old testament as well.

347
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,250
Shellfish, red tide,
uh, eating pigs trick.

348
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,060
Gnosis there's a lot of lot of issues
that go along with that. Right?

349
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,870
Well there is some intermingling perhaps
of hygienic concerns with also the

350
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:40,930
desire for the groups to distinguish
themselves from other groups. Right?

351
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,540
Cause you can, you can unite your group
quite tightly by dietary restrictions. So,

352
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,910
um, back to your point about
terminology, you know, we could,

353
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,920
we could do something like fact and
wisdom, you know, you say truth.

354
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,210
That's the overarching category.

355
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,960
And then that divides into fact and
wisdom and what you want optimally as you

356
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:03,130
want the facts and the wisdom to be one
on one to one. But often they're not.

357
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,730
And if you find wisdom where
the facts aren't laid right out,

358
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,590
you don't just get to
throw away the wisdom,

359
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:12,100
which is what I think happens in the
case of people like Dawkins and Harrison

360
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,440
Harris makes another sleight of hand move,
which I don't like,

361
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,120
which is that he thinks so let's say,
except for just a second,

362
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,730
the wisdom fact distinction.
He would say, well,

363
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:25,660
the fact is the thing and the wisdom
is a second order derivation of that.

364
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,270
You can ground the wisdom in the fact,
and I don't believe that.

365
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:29,590
And I don't think that he has any,

366
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,980
I don't think that he has any
real justification for that claim.

367
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,750
And this is something I
never thought you would,

368
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:38,320
even by grounding the wisdom in the Fed
thinks if you know the facts clearly

369
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:42,140
enough, you'll know how to act well.
That's not necessarily true. Right? Well,

370
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,910
there's a huge as ways to act with
that are within your best interest.

371
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,030
And then there's ways to act that are
within the interest of all the people

372
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:51,940
around you've been might not
serve you that well. Well,

373
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,140
there's also a addiction is
where ethics come, right?

374
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,050
The consequences are delayed for some
number of generations. Shorter. Yes.

375
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,790
Well that's a big problem.
And so,

376
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,120
so Sam acts as if the process of Mac
mapping facts onto action is simple.

377
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:08,560
If we just got the facts right but,

378
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,520
but it's the weakest part of his argument
and we never ever got to that for a

379
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:15,610
variety of reasons.
But part of the reason it's weak is okay,

380
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,360
while there's like an infinite
number of facts, man, which,

381
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,480
so let's say you're standing in front of
a field and you're looking at the field,

382
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,120
the field does not tell
you how to walk through it.

383
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,830
There's a million ways through the field
and no matter how many facts about the

384
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:30,850
field you aggregate,

385
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,880
you're not going to be able to determine
the appropriate path by aggregating

386
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:36,340
those fats. So that's, and that,

387
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:41,341
that's a problem that I don't think Sam
is willing to take seriously and well,

388
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,940
well I think there, there are two
problems tangled up here. One of them is,

389
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,490
there's a question of are
is one individual supposed
to have all of the facts?

390
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,440
And navigate based on on that sort of
the rationality community version of

391
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,140
things or the,
you know,

392
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,020
the practical truth is we can't
all be experts in everything.

393
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,150
And so we have to go along with,
you know,

394
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,900
guides to our behavior that are
approximate and that that's inherent.

395
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,910
And then there's a question
about civilization.

396
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,580
Civilization should be guided by our best
understanding of what's actually true,

397
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:20,581
but with an understanding that we don't
have a complete map of a lot of stuff.

398
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,240
And so I think what you're pointing at
is that there is wisdom that has been

399
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:28,570
handed to us that is not such
that we can just simply say, oh,

400
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:32,110
here's the nugget at the center of it and
we need to preserve that thing because

401
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,170
we don't necessarily know what it's
doing now, which is, you know, that's,

402
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,240
this is dangerous because some of what
it's doing may not be acceptable. Well,

403
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:43,150
and think about, let's look at the
wisdom end of things for a minute.

404
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,530
And you talked,
you alluded a little earlier too,

405
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,940
like iterations and about the fact that
things are reiterated across time and

406
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:53,090
that's something that works now might
fail dreadfully in a month or two months.

407
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:57,650
So, so here's, here's what
something has to be like to be wise,

408
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,220
let's say, well first of all, um,

409
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,170
let's say it would be good if it
was a new accordance with the facts,

410
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,710
but we'll leave that aside for now.
It has to work.

411
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,950
If you operate according to the
wisdom principal, whatever it is,

412
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,570
it has to work in the world.

413
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,410
But then it has to work in a world
that allows you to maintain your

414
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,020
relationships with people
in the world, right? So,

415
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,720
so it's all of a sudden this wisdom
thing is something that's not only

416
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:22,910
constrained by,
let's call it objective reality,

417
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,570
but it's constrained by the
necessity of a social contract,

418
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,320
a functional social contract.
So you're only able to,

419
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,700
you're only allowed to put forward actions
in the world that would be of benefit

420
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:38,060
to you if they simultaneously don't
undermine the structure within which you

421
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:42,170
live. Okay. And then there's a game
theory element to that, which is, well,

422
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:44,240
if it's wise,
then it works in the world.

423
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,340
So that'd be the constraint
of objective reality.

424
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,880
But then it works for you now and the you,

425
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:53,300
that'll be in a week and the you that
will be in a month and it works for you

426
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,360
and your family and it works for
you and your family and society.

427
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,530
And it works in a way that those things
all line up to be iterated across time.

428
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:01,723
And so this,

429
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,660
this is actually the also the solution
is I'd really like to hear what you think

430
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:09,800
about this. I think this is the solution
to the postmodern conundrum because the

431
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,880
postmodernists, bless their hearts.
So we'll give the devil his due say,

432
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:14,841
well,

433
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:18,110
the problem is there's an infinite number
of interpretations of a finite set of

434
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:22,880
facts. And the right
response to that is, oh,

435
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,590
that's true. That's true, that's not good.
And that's why the postmodern to say,

436
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:30,830
well, you can't agree on a
canonical interpretation of
great piece of literature

437
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,380
because the number of potential
interpretations are infinite.

438
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,860
And so then they say, well, why should
we settle on any one interpretation that,

439
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:39,680
why should we privilege one over
another? And then they say, well,

440
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:43,400
that's all power games. And so that's
you. You got to take that seriously.

441
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:45,800
But what they missed,
and this is a big deal,

442
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,510
it's a big deal I think is this idea of,
of ethical constraint. It's like, yes,

443
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:53,390
there's a landscape of potentially
infinite interpretations,

444
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:56,210
but hardly any of them will
work in the real world.

445
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,960
And hardly any of them will work in the
real world in a way that doesn't get you

446
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:04,670
killed by other people or do mew because
of your own stupidity to failure across

447
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,900
time. And so the landscape of
interpretation has almost infinite.

448
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,650
But the landscape of
applicable interpretation,

449
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,440
functional interpretation
is unbelievably constrained.

450
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,710
And I think that constraint system
is what we regard as ethics.

451
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,880
It's something like that.
Well, at some level, um,

452
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,370
stories continue through
time for a reason. You know,

453
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,910
good stories continue for a long,
you know,

454
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,320
the Odyssey is with us
for some reason and we,

455
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,310
so there is a scientific reason or
scientifically investigated [inaudible]

456
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,390
reason why the Odyssey has been durable.
We may not know it,

457
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:41,510
but in principle it's a question
you could investigate. Um,

458
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,400
so I guess at the end of the day,

459
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,830
the problem with the postmodernists
is that they have a point.

460
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,240
The point is perception gets in the way
of anything we wished to do objectively,

461
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,640
but that point only takes you so far.
And uh,

462
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,060
that's why they turned to
Marxism as far as I can tell,

463
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,940
because what happens with the
postmodernist as they say, oh,

464
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,710
there's an infinite
number of interpretations.

465
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,890
And then the human part of them goes,
okay,

466
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,650
well what am I supposed to do next?

467
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,000
Then since there's an infinite number
of choices and the postmodernist says,

468
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,450
well, my theory can't account for that.
And then they say, well, back to Marxism.

469
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,540
And so that's why I think there's
this unholy alliance between the

470
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:22,050
postmodernists and the neo Marxist
just because postmodernism is a,

471
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,290
is a dead end from the
perspective of applicable wisdom.

472
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,960
It leaves you bereft and nihilistic.

473
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,110
And that's not good because people
can't exist without a purpose.

474
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,310
And so they sneak the Marxism
through the back door and,

475
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:38,280
and jump into this power landscape for
the reasons that we discussed earlier.

476
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,250
Really think that it's because of
an infinite number of possibilities

477
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,680
interpretating things because I've
always felt that it was really just a

478
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:45,120
response to capitalism.

479
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,170
They like that they feel that capitalism
is a very negative aspect of our

480
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:52,110
culture and society and that there's
gotta be some sort of an alternative

481
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:52,981
Marxism.

482
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:56,430
Is it clearly defined alternative that
other people have subscribed to in the

483
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,230
past?
You could point to it.

484
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,150
It's a structure that's already there
already set up and it's romanticized and I

485
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:06,390
think they adopted for that reason because
it has the socialist aspects attached

486
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:06,900
to it.

487
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,100
And they looked at socialism as it's
some sort of a thing that a re regarding

488
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,720
equality and uh, you know, it's some
sort of an egalitarian yep. Approach.

489
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,340
Well it's okay.
So we'd have to take two things apart.

490
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:22,330
We'd have to take Marxism slash neo,
Marxist,

491
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,790
Marxism and postmodernism apart.
So we could do that historically.

492
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,620
And I would say that although there
is a reason for postmodernism,

493
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,590
which is the reason we just discussed,
that the landscape,

494
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:36,860
the infinite landscape of interpretation
problem, it's a real problem.

495
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,360
If you look at it historically,
postmodernism actually
grew out of Marxism.

496
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,913
And so what,

497
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,570
what happened is that the
Marxists laid out there their,

498
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,840
their theory about the human social
environment being composed of a power

499
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:55,940
struggle between the privileged
and the underprivileged, right?

500
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,460
The rich and the poor and
in its initial phases.

501
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,620
And that's a story that's partially
true and it's got a lot of motive power.

502
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,010
Like the motive power is the romantic
motive power that you just described.

503
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,460
I get to be on this side of the oppressed.
I get to be a war.

504
00:29:09,461 --> 00:29:12,320
You're for what's right.
There's the resentment element,

505
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:14,360
which is that son of a
bitch has more than me,

506
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:15,920
so let's cut them off at the knees,

507
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,530
which manifested itself
brutally in the Soviet Union.

508
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,670
And then there's the ideological totality
issue which gives people a sense of

509
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:25,510
security.
That took a vicious hit by,

510
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,450
by the late 1960s because
the murderousness of Marxism
had been clearly laid out

511
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:34,451
as a doctrine and that opened the
door to this move by by mostly French

512
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:39,500
intellectuals to to develop the postmodern
philosophy which has these advantages

513
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:40,850
which we described,

514
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,880
but but also to use that as a a
screaming tactic for allowing Marxism to

515
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:47,770
transform into identity politics.

516
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,940
And so like it's hard to disentangle
all the motivations that are going on in

517
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,091
there,

518
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:56,320
but there's something about it that's
that's truly intellectually pathological

519
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:59,710
because you don't get to be a
postmodernist and a Marxist.

520
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,940
You actually technically cannot be
both of those things at the same time.

521
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,140
And the fact that most people are both
of those things at an at the same time

522
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,070
raises the specter of just
exactly what their motivation is.

523
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,630
And then I would say it's this
resentment driven anti-capitalism.

524
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,120
There's reasons to criticize capitalism,
obviously,

525
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:23,320
but it's this underground resentment
driven anti-capitalism that I think is one

526
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,700
of the fundamental motivators.
