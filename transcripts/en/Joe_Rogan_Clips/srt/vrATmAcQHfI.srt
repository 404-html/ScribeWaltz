1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,440
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,780
Right. And is the same. It
will be at a parent parent.

3
00:00:04,781 --> 00:00:07,660
A lot of parents are really lazy and
you watch it happen when they give their

4
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:11,530
kid an iPad or you know or you know,
put them in front of the computer.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,930
That whole thing just happened
with Elsa Gate, which was you know,

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,120
borderline hilarious that parents were
getting trolled into their kids watching

7
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,320
really fucked up like cartoons.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,080
Yeah. Elsie get, I forgot the name.
The name of it. Yeah that was crazy.

9
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:27,140
We've talked about that a bunch of
times about the babies with the broken

10
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:31,490
bottles over their head kept
having the same scene play out.

11
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:33,800
Kids would get drunk
whether they were a kid,

12
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,920
mice or kid docs or they would get drunk.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,980
A bottle would go flying through the air
and hit the baby in the head and blood

14
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,740
would be everywhere. It was, it
was like a baby's nightmare to,

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,900
those videos were so

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,950
crazy. It was a bunch of
street. David Lynch for sure.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,610
It was a punishment for shitty parents
who weren't watching you know their kids

18
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:53,810
and what they're putting on their TV.

19
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,480
Cause if you were just paying attention
for a minute, you, I'm saying write it.

20
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:59,930
You have to stop paying attention for
a couple hours for a kid to get there.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,170
So it was only really shitty parents
that we're dealing with that.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,000
Is that really true?
It's dude,

23
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:08,450
yet there was no way to like land
on that just by googling Spiderman.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,850
That wasn't the first one that was
coming up. It was, uh, they would,

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,880
I think there were like paying to get
into like a loop of certain videos.

26
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:15,350
Like it was,
it really,

27
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:18,860
I was obsessed with it for like a week
and I just couldn't stop going on under

28
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,410
that sub reddit page.
And it was freaky dude.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,970
They weren't really radio regular porn.

30
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,160
Yeah, there's a Spiderman
ones and all these, I think
they took some of them down,

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,490
but then it gets to this
place where you're like, okay,

32
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,830
are you taking it down because
it's targeting children?

33
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,060
Are you taking it down because you can't
show cartoon babies getting hit in the

34
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:44,570
head with bottles. Because if
that's what you're saying, boy,

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,870
there's a lot of fucking south parks
that you're not going to be able to show.

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,040
There's a lot, a lot, a lot of different
things. Yeah. Where's the line?

37
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:56,900
Because you think this is like creepy
and is luring kids in versus the just the

38
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,460
act of it was a funny,

39
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,510
you know Tim and Eric Sketch and a
cartoon baby got hit in the head with a

40
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:05,690
bottle. You'd be like, what
the fuck? These guys are
nuts. That's what you'd said.

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,530
But you wouldn't be like saying this has
gotta be removed off of Youtube. Yeah,

42
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:11,830
it's hard to pay attention.
What's the intention of it?

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,780
But you could easily say like,
oh well South Park is a cartoon.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,070
So is that appealing to kids?

45
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,130
But I think to Lewis his point that the
solution isn't that this shit needs to

46
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:23,870
be banned. The solution is just like
let parents know always the solution.

47
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,460
Every single time we talk about Louis,
what was the other one we watched?

48
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,890
Oh father, your father, the two kids.

49
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:34,910
And it's really just creepy as shit
dude happen. All right, so this guy,

50
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,570
another like one of those like
that the kids are watching that.

51
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,440
If you watch it for a second,
you're like, this is all

52
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,900
pulled it off. It was a dad
and his channel, I'm sorry,

53
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:43,770
I forget the name of the channel,

54
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,130
but he had his two little girls who were
probably seven and nine years old and

55
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:49,160
they were doing like just
kind of weird shit dude.

56
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,840
They're like eating chocolate bars and
there'd be chocolate all over their face

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,200
and then they'd make weird sounds
and they'd climb up like you know,

58
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:59,280
stairs and they'd showed from like
behind there butt and it was very fucking

59
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,800
pedophilia. I don't even
know. It was fucked up dude.

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,340
And this guy is channel got taken down
and the guy's like doing an interview.

61
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:06,130
He's like, no dude, whatever.

62
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,920
We also millions of subscribers to the
channel making tons of money paying first

63
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,920
house with this channel. Whoa. And
they shut the whole channel down.

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,970
And what did he say when they
interviewed him? I don't know.

65
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:17,650
I've read some thing when it
was just kinda like, yeah,

66
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:19,180
we're trying to get our
channel back and you know,

67
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,320
he was just like very innocent. There
was another thing the same. Oh fuck.

68
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,670
I'm on my own time.
I got to go to Vimeo.

69
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,520
Um, but the same when we were talking
about this stuff, there was moms,

70
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,230
they were regular like mom bloggers,
right?

71
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,140
And they bring like their
daughter to Kmart, right?

72
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,230
This is the channel by the way,

73
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,770
terminates toy freaks channel amid broader
crackdown on disturbing kids content.

74
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,760
Okay.

75
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,910
It is very, like what Jay said,
it's a very David Lynch type vibe.

76
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:53,180
Like you feel like you're
in some nightmare world
where everyone's just acting

77
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,500
not the right human way.
That 8.5 million subscribers,

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,410
gold plaques that you have
amongst the top

79
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,280
most 100 most of you channels on youtube.
That's incredible.

80
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,300
Either while pacifiers in their
mouth it, dude, it's fucking bizarre.

81
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:14,030
You gotta somehow it got somehow
got to that level before.

82
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,810
Can we watch some of this?
Yeah. I can't show it.

83
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,140
We can't show it on TV. Can we watch
it? Is there a way we can not see it?

84
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,370
We're about to get raided. You get
what you figured out. Okay. Yeah.

85
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,600
Don't know what the problem is.

86
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,600
Whenever we put something on youtube
that shouldn't be on youtube,

87
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,100
we get flagged.

88
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,240
Um,

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,360
there was like mommy bloggers and they
would like have a video of them and their

90
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,520
daughter going to like the
supermarket and it'd be like 500

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
views. Yeah, don't do it Jamie. If if
they, I was thinking of Youtube flags,

92
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,990
not planning to see it. Oh, okay. So no
one else could see it on another website.

93
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,900
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry Louis. What?

94
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,850
Okay. So yeah, so then,
and then they do another,

95
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,080
the same mommy blogger would do one called
bath time and she's like bathing her

96
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,780
five year old and it's not anything
like more than her like sitting in the

97
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,643
bathtub.

98
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,830
But those videos were getting millions
of views and then the mom would like

99
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,490
disable the comments and turn off
the thumbs up and the thumbs downs.

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,500
So they were just monetizing,
you know,

101
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,040
pedophiles jerking off to their
daughters in a bathtub. And it was,

102
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,760
this is just like a whole subculture that
was happening on youtube that was sort

103
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:18,430
of just, nobody was really talking about
it and they kind of made it go away.

104
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,510
It wasn't even a big deal.

105
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,110
Cool. So this, I'm watching this, it's
not disturbing and all, it's just dumb.

106
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,710
They just eating weird food and then
and getting like whipped cream and ice

107
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:34,250
cream and cake and nachos altogether.

108
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,190
Well here's what happens. Babies.
This is really targeted toward babies.

109
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,740
They like the colors.
So what happened?

110
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,350
Like they see these flashing crazy colors.

111
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:46,170
Them I'm packaging candy and cake and
eating cake and two year olds love the

112
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:47,510
shit they keep on clicking on it.

113
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,990
But pedophiles are also jerking off to
these girls putting chocolate bananas in

114
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:54,670
their mouth. That was sort of
the issue. So they got, you know,

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,010
the pencil subscribed to whatever
cause the, they want to put

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,170
their kid in front of a TV and
have the TV babysit them. Um,

117
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,370
but it was also another big part of
the people who are watching this.

118
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:06,120
You see the comments and some of the,

119
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:08,870
sometimes the comments were like encrypted
and like in different languages and

120
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:12,680
they were using code words and how
they're using that pizza gate yet it's all

121
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,150
connected up.
It's fucking crazy.

122
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,900
If you make a big complaint though about
something you have to draw a conclusion

123
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,470
to, it really makes it seem like you're
the person thinking that you're like,

124
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,480
come on, you don't think that's
hot. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

125
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,120
You wouldn't want to jerk off to this.
Come on.

126
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,640
We're all jerking off to this then who
didn't jerk off to that a little earlier?

127
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,620
Mitchell that a cheeto with sour cream
on it. I'll check it off to anybody.

128
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,050
You're just in it for the food.

129
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,710
Get these kids out of here or they
have family they didn't notice.

130
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Say what can and can't be on
TV though or on video or on,

131
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,370
you know, when do you say they're
going to want this? But I know right,

132
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:51,500
but whose day? Right. Cause we've all,

133
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,950
we've all got this weird thing about
free speech because if it wasn't for free

134
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:58,340
speech we wouldn't be able to do anything.
Wouldn't be able to do podcasts,

135
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,950
wouldn't be able to comedy.
You'd get in trouble for everything.

136
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,170
It's very important to be
able to express your ideas,

137
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,120
but what if those ideas are, what
if you're a pedophile? Like what if?

138
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,050
What about that? Are you allowed to
do pedophile anime? Like how it would,

139
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,640
where's the, where's the line and why? Why
are we able to draw that line? You know,

140
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:20,630
I draw a Dick Right now when I
will dry deck. Here's the deck.

141
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,300
Now if I say this is a four year
old's Dick. Okay, there you go. Well,

142
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,710
we'll just say the four year old got
