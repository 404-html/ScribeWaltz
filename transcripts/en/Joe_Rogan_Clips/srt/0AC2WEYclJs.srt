1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,060
Oh much money involved in these movies.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,900
If you're going to make a film and he,
you know,

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:11,901
it's some gigantic thing with special
effects and the studio is dumping hundreds

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,300
of millions of dollars into it.
They want a return on their money.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,500
I saw people discussing that.

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,460
I think Johnny Depp was just kind
of kicked off isn't the right word,

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,140
but he's not going to be
in the next pirates movie.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,740
I guess they were discussing under that
like in the comment section like it was

9
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:30,741
the word last one was the worst one
of the of the lot and they spent $330

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,180
million on the budget, but it made 800
million and they're like, that's a fail.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,290
Some people were saying
like that's a failure. Yeah,

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,410
for them it's a fairly a hundred
million as it is not good. Well,

13
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:44,910
Johnny's off the rails right now.
He shaved his head, Johnny Depp,

14
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,880
he looks like he weighs 35 pounds.
He shaved his head,

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,680
he's fallen out of his jeans.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,310
Whenever you get like
two tattoos of a woman,

17
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,880
the only been married to for like six
months. These are all bad signs, joke,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,740
and this is a very rough town to live.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,330
Egos and mother fucker. People blowing
smoke up your ass as a motherfucker. Sure.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,670
I mean this guy is spending a half
a million dollars a month on wind.

21
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,830
I don't know exactly.
Don't quote me on that,

22
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:18,380
but I know that I read that.
Did they say,

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,070
they said that he was spending $30,000
and he goes, it was a lot more than that.

24
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,180
He was joking around about it.
It was a lot more than that.

25
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,070
Like are these pictures of him now

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,550
stay humble or be humbled? He's wearing
a shirt, dude, you're 55 years old.

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,610
Why the fuck would you wear that
shirt? Well, who's walking up?

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,180
Meanwhile I got a Derrick Lewis.
My balls was hot shirt on,

29
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,260
but look, these these like
fucking inspirational quotes
you expect to see on some

30
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,670
strippers Instagram page.

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,030
You're not supposed to be wearing those
when you're Johnny Depp. Okay, this is,

32
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:54,210
this is outrageous. Giant Dep. Why
are you wearing that on a shirt?

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,160
And I heard that this last movie,
the Mucho Mucho.

34
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,580
What? Pro Banglaz which a lot of
problems. What was the moving the Tupac,

35
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,690
but it's on shelf, right? They're not
putting it out. Is he the shelf? Yeah.

36
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,610
They're not putting it out for right
now. It's not coming out. I see a cop,

37
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,110
the cop, that broker, if you
will. I forget them. That's
a good book. Yeah, though.

38
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,130
Whatever. I forgot. I
have it at the house.

39
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,990
He plays the cop in the area that there
was a loan level and the word got out.

40
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,010
That's it.
Well,

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,170
you know Johnny Jab at one point
in time when he had done that,

42
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,390
that movie dead man. Do you remember?
Dead Man? Interesting movie.

43
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:38,340
It was a weird black and white movie
about a guy who was riding a fucking train

44
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,210
across the west.
He was talking in an interview about it.

45
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,740
He wants to do interesting projects. He
goes, I'll, I'll never be blockbuster boy.

46
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,330
Then he became blockbuster boy, but he's
bad ass and pirates of the cow book.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,240
He's fine. I don't give a fuck whether
they be phenomenal, phenomenal.

48
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,410
He's really good. Good. I love, he's
a great actor. They cut him loose.

49
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:03,280
He made a ton of money for them.
They did five fucking movies,

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,600
but you know he's boys with Stan Hope,
right?

51
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,440
Essentially Johnny d this
fucking motherfuckers with there.

52
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,220
Everybody thinks you're going to spend
money on their website. Guess what?

53
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:20,440
We're not, we're not paying
to read your fucking website.

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,230
We're not Johnny Depp. What
does it say? And biggie, Tupac.

55
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:28,840
A movie abruptly pulled from release for
Twitter. Granted it looks like. Mm. Yeah,

56
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,880
like a month before it's supposed
to come out. They just pulled it.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,930
Well in my suck. They don't
pull it up. It's awesome.

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,270
But the point is, you know, Stan
helps boys with him and he's like,

59
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,710
he said that once he did those pirates
movies, he couldn't go anywhere.

60
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,010
It was over. He can't go to
restaurants. You can't go anywhere.

61
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
He just can't go anywhere.
He,

62
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,070
he hit that upper echelon of fame where
it's almost, there's no turning back.

63
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,880
When you know, you get like
Michael Jackson type frame.
You just get crazy. You,

64
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:02,650
your, your world is just,
it's no one can relate to you.

65
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,980
What were they giving them per movie?
He was making like 30 million a movie.

66
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,970
We're back ended everyday. I bet he was
making more than that than that, right?

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,370
Yeah. That's, he's got like 18 houses,

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,120
both 14 houses.
You know,

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,680
I remember when I was in Colorado, someone
said he had a ranch out there. I go,

70
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,920
has he ever go there? He goes,
no, no. Just has a ranch.
