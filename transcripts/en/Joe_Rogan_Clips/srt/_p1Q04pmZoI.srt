1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,320
Yeah. Long story, right? Yeah.

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:04,380
I definitely drank too much
coffee before we get here.

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,820
So if I appear like cracked out, I
swear to God I'm not in pills, but uh,

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,260
glad to hear it. But, um,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,440
so we had a nice conversation on the
phone about d platforming and social media

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,990
and, um, what did,

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,190
what was very obvious to me in talking
to you was that your way more schooled on

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:24,024
this than I am.

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,660
So that's why I wanted to have this
conversation with you because part of what

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,520
was like, I really listened to
my podcast with Jack and, um,

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,790
you had a good criticism of it. I agree
with a lot of what you said. First of all,

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:40,080
I agree that it was kind of boring
and it was, I think in many,

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,110
for many reasons it was my fault.
Uh,

14
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,780
I don't think I prepared enough for it.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,730
And I also don't think I understood the
magnitude of how other people felt about

16
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:54,690
d platforming on Twitter
and a and all social media,

17
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:59,160
youtube and all these different things
and what the ramifications are and how,

18
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,840
how much this means to people
to have very clear and obvious,

19
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,930
obvious free speech outside of very
egregious examples of like threats and

20
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,960
doxing and things like that. Which
I think we can all agree, right.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,750
I think this problem
that might be one of the,

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,100
like one of the worst problems we're
facing right now politically. Yes.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,890
You know that Twitter is where
public discourse is happening.

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,880
It's where journalists are and this is a
problem sourcing a lot of their stories.

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,070
Yes. So if you have somebody
who is completely removed
from public discourse that

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,810
that's exile, you know, I can't,

27
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:36,960
I can imagine why some people kind of
lose their minds and that happens. And um,

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,050
I think going into that
conversation with him, well,

29
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,250
that's what I wanted it to be.

30
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:44,310
That's why I don't really
interview people any kind of,

31
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:49,200
have conversations with them. Occasionally
we have disagreements and we, you know,

32
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:53,890
we talk about things and you know,
but it's not, I don't have, uh,

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,520
uh, like a mandate. My only con,

34
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,370
the only thing I wanted to get out of
the conversation is I wanted to find out

35
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:04,140
what it was like to start
that organization and to
have no idea when you were

36
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,170
doing it that it was going to be
essentially like one of the most important

37
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,770
distribution at a re avenues for
information and act and act as buddy of an

38
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:14,711
activist.

39
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:18,150
A buddy of mine asked me if I knew why
people smash windows smashed Starbucks.

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,010
It's not because they think
they're going to cause damage.

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,360
It's because they want to strike a symbol
down of something they view oppresses

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,720
them. Jack Dorsey is that symbol
to a lot of people and you know,

43
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,620
to see you're here.

44
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:31,640
You know what I was saying earlier is
I think a lot of people look at you,

45
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,730
you're like a real dude. You know, your,
your conversations are real. You have,

46
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,380
you're not one of these
fake news journalists that
people are very critical of

47
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,120
that field.
They're biased or have an agenda.

48
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,000
So when you sit down with Jack
Dorsey and doesn't go anywhere,

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,120
people then feel like the last person
who's not supposed to let us down,

50
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,510
let us down. You know what I mean? No,
I look, I thought you twice as much.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,930
I've felt it and I noticed that I got,
you know,

52
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,480
more hate for that one than probably
anything that I've ever done. And uh,

53
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,250
you know, I'm not a guy who
shies away from criticism.

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,060
I try to figure out what I did wrong
and try to regroup and figure out how to

55
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:08,320
approach it again. And in
Jack's defense, uh, you know,

56
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,840
I think he's very open to
talking about anything.

57
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:14,590
And also he's also very open
for self criticism. I mean,

58
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:19,090
he was openly discussing what they're
doing wrong, where they need to be clear,

59
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,540
where the navy to get better. I
don't believe any of it, you know,

60
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,290
I don't trust that guy. Not at all.
Um, you know, why don't you trust him?

61
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,630
I mean,
first of all,

62
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,910
there's the obvious thing that he's
running these a bunch of companies.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,490
I could be wrong,
but I believe he actually left Twitter.

64
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,770
He wasn't the CEO for a while.
They brought him back in or something.

65
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,960
But it either sounds should
probably check on that.

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,090
I tried to avoid asserting things
that I'm not 100% sure on, but me too.

67
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:48,010
But I do it all the time anyway. Right.
Jack says things like, he said to you,

68
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,470
he said to Congress, I believe
he said, he said to Congress, um,

69
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,790
we don't ban people based on the content.
We ban people based on their conduct.

70
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,903
Yes. Okay. You, you,

71
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,380
you literally have a terms of
service that band specific content.

72
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,770
Like what do you mean you don't make it
based on content? There's a, you know,

73
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,310
I'll just get into naming some people.
Right? Megan Murphy for example,

74
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:08,740
as a feminine, Megan Murphy,
is she okay. She's that woman.

75
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,200
That was the whole issue with
women. Right, right. So, so here,

76
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,110
this is what's important. She
was responding to somebody.
Explain that for you.

77
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,700
So this could be standalone, cause we
talked about it yesterday with Sam Harris,

78
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:23,140
but um, so I don't know too
much about Megan Murphy, but
she's a feminist. She's a,

79
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,270
what they call a trans
exclusionary radical feminist.

80
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,800
But I think that that might be offensive.

81
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,570
Says let's remember why Jack Dorsey was
fired as Twitter CEO. He was fired. Okay.

82
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,860
We'll see what it says.
This,

83
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,330
this is in fortune 2008 that was there
wasn't even what sort of Twitter?

84
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,050
Yeah, yeah. 2008. Jesus Christ. Um,

85
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,070
Dorsey's management was so problematic.
Twitter's board, this is an opinion piece.

86
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,350
Fired him in 2008 offering him a passive
chairman role and silent board seat.

87
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,210
2010 he was founding square.
Square. He went rogue. Okay,

88
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,840
so something happened. You know, it's
funny as you called it, an opinion piece,

89
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,860
but do they, I dunno, that's, that's
where we're at in journalism today. Well,

90
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:03,760
when someone said,
well,

91
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,970
it has to be an opinion piece when someone
says was so problematic. Right. I mean,

92
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:10,690
that's an opinion. I mean, sure. The
real facts are, he was fired. You know,

93
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:13,660
you could state the specific reason
that was stated by the company and that

94
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:17,770
would be a non opinion piece. But as
soon as you flavor it, it's all opinion,

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,780
right? It is, right. Yeah. That is a,
that is an issue, right? With information,

96
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,630
the distribution of information.
It's flavored by opinion
in ideology. All of it.

97
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,360
Yeah. All of it. Well, we can
talk about that. I don't want
to derail it. No, no, no.

98
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,350
I don't want to read thing. Yeah. Okay.
So Megan Murphy, please explain it.

99
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,590
She was a feminist. She said
she's a, so she's called.

100
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:39,130
There are a trans exclusionary, I look,
I understand this is offensive. You know,

101
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,220
I guess calling someone a
trans exclusionary radical
feminist, I'm assuming,

102
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,760
why isn't, why is a offensive, it's
just used in a, in an offensive way,

103
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,840
I suppose to them. To her offensive
against, against people like her. Yeah.

104
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:54,340
So there's intersectional feminists.
They tend to be trans inclusive,

105
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,740
meaning that they believe that,
uh, someone who born biologically,

106
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,370
biologically male can compete with
those by biologically female if they

107
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:04,940
transition, if they take
hormones and things like that
can compete, compete, right.

108
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,470
Like power lifting, racing bikes, biking
and stuff. That's where I step in. Yeah.

109
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,860
You know, I've, I've seen some of
the stuff you've talked about, uh,

110
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,320
the Trans exclusionary group think they
shouldn't and they've said things that

111
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:18,140
are considered to be parked.
I say consider it to be offensive.

112
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:21,650
I'm not trying to assert who's
offended by it, but um, there's one,

113
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:26,300
a recent story where a trans exclusive
radical feminists said that the Trans

114
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,940
Rights movement as a men's
rights movement, right.
They say things like that.

115
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,930
In the case of Megan Murphy, she
responded to someone, she said,

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,180
men aren't women though.
That's not harassment. Right.

117
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,480
That was a conversation
with somebody else. Well,

118
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,750
it's also a fact she was permanently
banned. Well, that's crazy, right?

119
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,760
That just saying men aren't women. Okay.
Out of context, just say it right there.

120
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,930
Men Aren't women.
Who the fuck's gonna argue with that?

121
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,790
Well then when you say trans people, okay,
now you're into gray area, but actually,

122
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,530
but the statement men aren't women. Well
you didn't have to take it in context.

123
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:58,820
Right, right, right.

124
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,500
But this is where we start getting into
the nitty gritty of I guess left wing

125
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:07,820
ideologies. The culture war. If you
go on Wikipedia and you look up, man,

126
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,770
it will tell you a man is
an adult human male, right?

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,750
But if you look up trans man,
it will say a trans man is amen.

128
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,580
And so the transection of Wikipedia is
at odds factually with the man's section.

129
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,820
So there, there was an, I bring this
up is that when it comes to Twitter,

130
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:24,920
then we can clearly see the bias.

131
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,810
Twitter says you can't miss gender someone
and that presumably that's why Megan

132
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,020
Murphy was banned. Okay. That's
a left wing ideology. Right.

133
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:36,920
But that's what she's talking about.
A specific human. I think she was,

134
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,900
I think they were having a
conversation about somebody,

135
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:42,230
I don't know the full details
details, but I gotta say, look,

136
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,460
right now people are being banned or
suspended for saying learn to code. Okay.

137
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,900
That's, yeah. What is that about?

138
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,840
You explained that to me too
and I saw a few people getting,

139
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,170
but should we start one at a time? Should
we, yeah, let's stick with Megan. Well,

140
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,800
I mean, I think we've, we've, we've,
we've reached that point of Megan, right?

141
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,380
She was banned for having a conversation
and saying men aren't women though.

142
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,980
That was the quote, men who
aren't women though. So,

143
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,890
and they're saying that they would
never ban someone for content.

144
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,110
They banned them for behavior.
Right?

145
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,700
So if we use that behavior that
I have no idea. Like, listen,

146
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,260
if you are using Twitter,

147
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,290
the way Twitter was designed to engage
in respond to people is that bad conduct.

148
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,080
It can't be conduct. It literally
can't be conduct. Not only that,

149
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,640
aren't you allowed to have opinions
that are in fact based in biology?

150
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes.
You should be in the,

151
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:33,700
I shouldn't have out before we go any
further before you get called alt right.

152
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,830
You, you're very left.
Right. Um, I, I, you know,

153
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,770
I typically say center left
center like, uh, Oh God.

154
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,600
People were saying how many
times someone commented,

155
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:45,560
how many times will Tim mentioned he's
a social liberal. Lying I'm center left.

156
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,650
Uh, I was a big fan of Bernie,
you know, Bernie Sanders,

157
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,940
he's still one of my favorite politicians.
Uh, people that call me a socialist,

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,120
you know, conservatives call me
left, left, calls me right. You know,

159
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,450
these labels are so fucking toxic.
It's so confusing to people and it,

160
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,980
and it causes so much,
so much division between two sides.

161
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:07,350
It might not even differ that much.
You know,

162
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:11,790
the funny thing about it is I got my
start during occupy Wall Street and

163
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:16,350
conservatives called me far left
because I was reporting on the protests,

164
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,110
what they were doing, police
brutality, the arrests.

165
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:22,140
They said this is a far left activists.
Now that I'm,

166
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,200
I've always been critical of
the more extreme factions.

167
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,540
Like I've got interviews
from seven, you know, six,

168
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,250
seven years ago where I'm
critical of these people.

169
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,550
Now all of a sudden they're accusing me
of being alt right for being critical of

170
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,590
extremists and masks, you know, starting
fires and things like that. All right.

171
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:40,440
Adjacent. That's my new favorite
boot licker outright at Jason.

172
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,780
We'll boot licker boot licker
that's, that's, you know,

173
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:46,590
there's a lot of phrases that people use
that mean literally nothing boot Lifton

174
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,340
um, one, one of my favorites is
to keep in the context of Twitter,

175
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,380
they say freedom of speech,

176
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,600
freedom of speech does not
mean freedom from consequence.

177
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,220
That literally doesn't mean anything.
It literally means nothing. Yeah,

178
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:02,220
well that's just trying to skirt around
freedom of speech. That's what it is.

179
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,820
So what ends up happening,
but, but you agree with that,

180
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,380
like you should be able
to speak your mind,

181
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:11,070
but there's certain consequences
of certain things that you say.

182
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,870
If I throw this bottle at the wall,
there's a consequence.

183
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:16,500
So that's a physical move motion.
If I drink this water,

184
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,780
there's a consequence I to go the
bathroom rights. So to set to,

185
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,790
to point out that actions
have consequences,

186
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:24,180
not actually addressing any of the issues.
It's just literally saying nothing.

187
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,630
But it's, it's, it's
almost, it's just like a,

188
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:32,631
you can predict when someone will say it
and it's usually when a specific person

189
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,420
is band, they'll say freedom of speech,
freedom of consequence, all that stuff.

190
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,880
They don't say it went to their
people. They say, yeah, but,

191
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:42,210
but this is true too in talking
about Twitter censorship.

192
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:44,250
There are people on the left
who have been banned on justly,

193
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,240
and this is where it gets actually
scarier in my opinion. You'll have,

194
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,490
I could name so many people, Jesse,
Jesse Kelly was banned for no reason.

195
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,910
Cj Pearson was bad,
I think to why you say no reason what?

196
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,420
Now they have no recourse. I
was an accident. Oops. They
said it was an accident.

197
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:00,760
Yeah. Then for life or band, he was where
he was a short amount of time. No, I,

198
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,230
so I could be wrong. Um, my understanding
is Jesse Kelly, who's was a conservative,

199
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,650
had his account just band and there was
a huge stink in the media. Like, Whoa,

200
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,790
Whoa, this guy didn't do anything. Who
is Jesse? Kevin's a conservative guy.

201
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,070
You know, he, he, he posted snarky tweets.

202
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:16,650
He doesn't harass people or
anything's a verified Twitter user.

203
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,460
So a bunch of stories came up saying,
what,

204
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:21,170
what is this Twitter then reinstates
and said it was a, it wasn't,

205
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:22,004
it was a mistake.

206
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,460
Now is it possible that
they're just dealing with
blunt tools and that there was

207
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:30,560
a mistake or, well, yeah,
absolutely. Absolutely. Um,

208
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,760
but then I'd have to,
they're,

209
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,220
the reason why I don't think it was
a mistake very simply. As for one,

210
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,560
we can see the ideological
bent to their rules,

211
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,580
but then you look at someone like Milo
Yiannopoulos, like I'm not a fan of Milo.

212
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,410
I have to make sure,
like everybody knows that,

213
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,410
but just because I'm critical of
the actions taken against them,

214
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,020
it doesn't mean I support him, but why
was he banned? Because he tweeted it.

215
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,610
Leslie Jones.
Right.

216
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,390
And the idea was that his tweet
caused his fans to attack her,

217
00:11:55,391 --> 00:11:58,750
which I think is, that's a stretch.
That's, that's, that's just,

218
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,290
that's just ridiculous. He didn't say
go getter. He didn't say attacker.

219
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,410
He was just tweeting at her. Yeah. And
you know, what did you call her ugly?

220
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,240
Did he say something like that?
He was insulting or he,

221
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,074
I think he called her aglow.

222
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,180
He was mocking this feminist
version of Ghostbusters.

223
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,710
Right? That's what he was
doing. He was talking,

224
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,050
it was like a critique of the movie.
Look,

225
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,410
I've had milo in the podcast way
back in the day. I had them on twice.

226
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,550
I enjoy talking to him. He's hilarious.
He's very smart. He's very witty.

227
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,470
He's a character. He's very
much a provocateur. Right.
But he's also, you know,

228
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,810
he's pushing buttons on purpose.

229
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,370
Like he's trying to get reactions from
people and trolling. Yeah. I mean,

230
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:39,790
I almost think like he married a black
guy. Just let people know he's not gay.

231
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,620
Oh yeah. Let people know brother. He's
not racist. It's hilarious in that way.

232
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,230
I wouldn't, I would never say something
like that, but I almost think it,

233
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,410
you know what I mean? We can understand
why my would do that. He's calculated.

234
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,250
Right, right. Yeah. But he
did that. I don't think he
did that. It should be clear,

235
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,440
but I mean that's how much of an act.
A lot of what's going.

236
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,470
But if you talk to him off camera,
he's a very nice guy. Very reasonable,

237
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:07,330
very polite. I don't, I don't trust them.
I'm not, I'm not a big fan. You know, he,

238
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,690
he fat, shamed to do it at the gym. Right.

239
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,880
There literally is a picture of you while
making a ton of photo of a guy at the

240
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:16,660
gym, the gym. And I actually argue with
them about it. At one point I was like,

241
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,320
you won, you won your skin and he's
fat. But no, you, you can leave.

242
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,420
You literally shamed him to the point
where you decide to go to the gym to

243
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,180
better himself and you're still making
fun of them. So did he, wait a minute,

244
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:29,110
he shamed him before the guy went to
the gym. I mean, I don't mean literally,

245
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:32,260
I mean like Milo's rhetoric of shaming
people and getting them, you know,

246
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:32,630
saying they're,

247
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,590
they're nasty and stuff and then it
right back down with the guy listened to

248
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:38,470
them and that's why he went to the gym.
No, no, no. I didn't mean literally.

249
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,870
I just mean like if Milo plays it up,

250
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:43,810
like I'm going to shame people until
they don't work out. Why would you? But,

251
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,790
but I'll say this, look, that's fine.

252
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,640
Milo can can say the nasty things
and be the kind of person he is.

253
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,680
He shouldn't have been banned
from Twitter. That's ridiculous.

254
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,610
Why was this verification badge
removed? That was another. It's, it's,

255
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:57,250
it's plain as day. The verification
one was weird. It's like,

256
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,600
we're going to keep you here,

257
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:02,620
but we're going to take away
the verification lets people
know you're you. Right.

258
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:07,390
So it opens the door to fraud. Right.
And it opens the door to fake my lows.

259
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:09,430
And you don't know who's who
because there's no blue check mark.

260
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,650
That doesn't necessarily make any sense.
