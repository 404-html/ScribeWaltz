1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,720
The argument on the other side
is when people are distributing,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,630
and I'm going to use the big air quotes,
hate speech,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,830
that's when it gets slippery to me
because who's to decide what's hate speech

4
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,880
and what's not? Hate speech. I mean,

5
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,450
I've seen people make some ridiculous
fucking statements about all sorts of

6
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,350
people that are inaccurate and they do
that in order to categorize them and

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:23,640
pigeonhole them in, in an easily
definable and dismissible co, uh,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,930
characterization. You know, you just
decide, hey, that Bill Ottman guy,

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,610
that guy's a this. Oh, he's a
radical that and he believes in this,

10
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:35,590
so fuck him. And they're like,
okay, fuck him, sweep more. I,

11
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:38,640
and then cancel culture comes in like,
we're going to cancel Bill Ottman.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,650
We're not listening to him anymore.
You know,

13
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,170
he lied to us about his source
or whatever the fuck you doing.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Have you heard of Daryl Davis? No, I have
not. Once I forgot Dow. David's your boy.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,110
He's my boy. He, he, you'll, you'll, I
haven't met him, but he's, he's my way.

16
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,250
I want him to be my boy.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,580
So he is a black man who befriended
hundreds of members of the KKK and he got

18
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:04,440
them all to leave.
He got them to leave the to 200 members.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,350
Wow. After he was like, yeah,
I'm just going to talk to you.

20
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,910
Really he would you ever see the n a w
Kamau Bell's a show when he visited with

21
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,720
those white supremacists? Not
that specific one. Yeah, it was.

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,210
It's really good because
he's such a nice guy.

23
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,200
He's so like easy to get along with that.
They were like sort of,

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,780
they let the guard down
around them and you know,

25
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,700
you get to see these people
kind of confused that they
liked this guy. You know?

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,780
That's why I think initiating human
contact via the social networks,

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,590
like that's really important.
But to play devil's advocate,

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,240
it's one of the worst ways for people
to express themselves in a way where you

29
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,390
consider other human beings experiences
and feelings and the way they're going

30
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,720
to receive what you're saying
because there's no social cues.

31
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,150
You're not interacting with them,
you're not looking at them in the eyes.

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,280
It's one of the weirder forms
of communication between
human beings and one that

33
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:07,281
I would argue we have
not really necessarily a
successfully navigated it yet.

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,910
I agree.

35
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,490
I was actually saying that I think we
should use social media more to get people

36
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:19,170
to get together in real life. Do
you know who uh, Megan Phelps is?

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,390
No. She, uh, was uh, with
the Westboro Baptist Church.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,080
Uh, you know, the, the, the
famous one that the protests,

39
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,070
those soldier's funerals and you know,
and,

40
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:36,071
and anything gay and they're
like ruthlessly viciously
fundamental Christians

41
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,450
where,
you know,

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,730
they do a lot of protesting at funerals
and to a lot of stuff to try to get,

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,490
she was with them for,

44
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,550
for the longest time and then got on
Twitter and through communicating on

45
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:49,650
Twitter when you meet her,

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
you would never believe it in a
million years that she was ever this

47
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,480
fundamentalist and that she was ever
some mean person sending hateful messages

48
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,890
to people because their son
was gay or whatever it was.

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,380
Now she's completely cured of it. She's
has no contact with the church anymore.

50
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,870
She's married, has a kid,
she's completely outside of it.

51
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,310
She does podcasts now and give Ted talks
and speaks about radicalization and

52
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:16,720
about how she was kind of indoctrinated
in, grew up in this family and her,

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,440
her grandfather, Fred Phelps
was this, you know, he's like,

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,060
it's a fucking mean guy. Like a really
mean v. He's the God hates fags guy.

55
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,820
You know, they would have those
signs that they would hold up.

56
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,930
But at the soldier's funerals, I mean,
he's like really inflammatory stuff.

57
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,000
But through Twitter,

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,570
through her communicating with people
on Twitter and specifically her now

59
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:38,890
husband,
like he,

60
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,130
he cured her like it just with rational
discourse and communication and she was

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,420
old will change. They will change. And
so that's why banning them. I mean,

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,580
I saw on a recent podcast you've
been talking about redemption.

63
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,470
Yeah. So, but I'm curious,
what do you think people,

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,590
what is, how does that look
like? Well, timber, it, look,

65
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,000
in the case of like Megan Phelps,
that's a real thing, right?

66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,980
She really did change. Um, another
example is Christian peak Illini.

67
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,853
Do you know who he is?

68
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,190
He was a white supremacists KKK member
guy who's been on Sam Harris's podcast.

69
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,890
He's also done some Ted talks who now
speaks out against it and talks about how

70
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,600
he's indoctrinated and
talks about how lost he was.

71
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:29,200
Now he was brought into this
ideology. Um, there are,

72
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,460
there's many people like that
all over the world. Um, uh,

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,320
Majid Majid was another perfect
example. He was an Islamist, I mean,

74
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,240
he was,
you know,

75
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,320
trying to form a caliphate was
literally thinking about radical Islamic

76
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,470
terrorism as being some sort of a
solution. Now he's the opposite.

77
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,850
Now he's trying to get people to leave
and he's trying to get people to be more

78
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,520
reasonable and secular or
see what happened to him.

79
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,820
He ain't got punched in
the street. Yeah. Um, yeah.

80
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:00,280
Some guy called him a
fucking packy I guess,

81
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:03,340
and punched him in the head and fucked
his head up and he's got this giant

82
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:06,400
cotton in his head from a ring
and his face is swollen up.

83
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,400
But apparently they have the
guy on video and um, you know,

84
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,050
they think they're going to
be able to arrest the guy.

85
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,760
I've had magic on the show.
He's a super nice guy. The,

86
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:17,320
the hard thing is that all right.
Yes,

87
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,280
we see these transformations take place.
It makes us feel warm inside and yes,

88
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:25,420
people, people can change, but at
the same time, what are people have,

89
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,460
should people have to go
apologize to Twitter? Oh, I'm
sorry. Like can I come back?

90
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,000
Right. I mean that's not like sometimes
people are going to think completely

91
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,510
differently than you and you just have
to deal with it. And that should be okay.

92
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:42,511
We shouldn't force people to come in
to our way of thinking in order to have

93
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,600
discourse. No, that's a good point.
That's a very good point. Um,

94
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,100
and like who is to decide what this
path to redemption is and whether or not

95
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,810
you've completed it,
right?

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,280
Who was decided like maybe you are a,

97
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,590
a hyper radical lefty and maybe Jamie's
points of view and yours are just never

98
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,680
going to line up. So you're like,
fuck him. He's banned for life,

99
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,350
which a lot of people
have been banned for life.

100
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,070
And when you look at some of the
infractions, they'd been banned for it.

101
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,250
They're like, boy, I don't know about
that one. That doesn't really make sense.

102
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,480
Almost none of the high pro profile
banning cases make much sense.

103
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,740
It's like a short term solution
that's creating a longterm problem.

104
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,530
Yeah,
that's really what it is.

105
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,050
So I just think that we
have to talk about it more.

106
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,800
I don't know. I, it's like why can't we
just get everyone to talk about it? Yeah.

107
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,100
I get the same time. I mean it's
like we're just wasting time here.

108
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,990
Well,
sort of,

109
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,710
but I also think we're figuring it out
as we go along with a bunch of different

110
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:50,270
competing ideologies. Um, you know,
you have yours, which like you dude,

111
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,660
you look like a hacker.
Unlike House of cards,

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
you'll look like a guy you call in

113
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,320
to break into the, the, the
mainframe server. Not that honestly,

114
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:03,610
I believe you're not,
I hang out on to get lab in checkout code,

115
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:07,170
but I did. I cannot code.
I cannot coach bad claim.

116
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,290
I'm not claiming to be a
developer. No, these people are,

117
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,140
I know there's another level.
It is incredible. I understand,

118
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,850
right? Yeah. I get it. Well that's
like if someone says to me like,

119
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,920
you're an MMA fighter, I'm
like, I'm definitely not.

120
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,830
They are another fucking level.
Like there's a different like, yeah,

121
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,210
I know a little martial arts, but
just, just settle the fuck down. Right.

122
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,210
Same kind of thing.
I think though that you,

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,880
your ideology is going to be your,

124
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:37,170
your point of view and perspective is
going to be very different than maybe

125
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,660
someone who's like a radical Marxist,
you know,

126
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:42,360
it shouldn't they be allowed to post
on the site to someone who's like an

127
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:47,100
extreme socialist. Someone
like a AOC. You know, someone,

128
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,120
someone who thinks that we should give
money to people who are unwilling to work,

129
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:56,010
someone who thinks that we should try
to engineer society and tax the top x

130
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:59,520
percent, you know, 70 something
percent of their income.

131
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,550
There's a lot of those different people
and we have to figure out how to,

132
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,160
to make it so that,
well,

133
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:14,190
we have to figure out a way to make
it so all the ideas can compete in the

134
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:15,750
marketplace of ideas.
Right.

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,990
All these different ideas can compete
and we can find out which one is better

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,670
and we could find out which one is better.
Yeah.

137
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,420
You don't always find out which
one is better though. Right.

138
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,700
You find out which one is most people. I
mean, that's what happened with Hitler,

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,340
right? Well, you don't really find
out what's better. You find out what,

140
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,020
what's got more juice behind it.
