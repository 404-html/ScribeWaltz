1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,160
Cause all right. So for
people that know, I,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,290
I met Mike on a flight and it was a
surreal experience, you know, like from,

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,280
from being a kid and thinking
like this is superman.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,500
That's what I thought I was a kid.
It was just, you know what I mean?

5
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,050
Like seeing those when you see it as
a kid too, I think it's different.

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,540
Like you're just like,
whoa, that is so nuts.

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:23,460
Like these 11 second knock out
your periodic leaving to this day,

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:26,040
people come up to me and talk about
the experience that they feel.

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,050
How many talked about meeting
me through what that true.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,280
It's honest. But you're telling me
it's on mostly stories that true. Yeah,

11
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:39,660
mostly stories. And it was a, it was a
surreal experience. And, and you know,

12
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:43,260
we spoke on the plane and, and then like
when I thought we were done talking,

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,220
you know, I face forward and then he came
back and like tap me on the shoulder.

14
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,170
I was like, Oh shit. Like Mike's talking
to me. I'm down here like the seatbelt,

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,880
seatbelt it in. But then we land and he
was like, Oh, where's your show? And, and,

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,970
and I go, oh, it's here. I gave him
the number, never expect to hear,

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,480
hits me up the next day. And he's like,
we're coming to your show. And I was like,

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,190
oh my God. And I really did say like, I'm
amazed that you're coming. And he said,

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,210
it's all love. And I just said, I
love you because I didn't know how to,

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,980
what to say. And then that
was good. He was like, cool.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,890
He's like, all right man. And then I,

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,240
I remember I called the Pittsburgh Improv
manager and I go, hey man, I just go,

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,660
you're not gonna believe this, but Tyson's
coming to the fight tonight. He goes,

24
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:34,200
Mike Tyson, I go, no fucking
Tyson chicken. Yeah, Mike
Tyson's coming tonight.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,440
He was like, I'll corridor off
a whole thing. And you know,

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,610
and I didn't know he was at the show
because the show had already started and I

27
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:45,780
didn't see him arrive. When we go back
to the green light after I the show,

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,100
I walk off stage and he grabs me and
he goes, let's go to the green room.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,820
So he took me to my green room, right.
Like he would like and I was like,

30
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,654
fuck yeah.

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,610
And we hung out in that green room over
an hour and just shooting the shit and

32
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:03,720
talking. And when I forgot, like if at
the time had passed, I opened the door,

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,100
the entire staff,

34
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,760
entire staff is lined up
at the door to meet them.

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,790
Like that's the effect that
he has on the group. You know,

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,900
like they're waiting in a line for an
hour outside of the green room. And I,

37
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,260
you know, we talked about boxing about
life. It was, it was fascinating. Um,

38
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,140
one of the things I really appreciated
about, uh, you as a fighter was like,

39
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:29,000
that you really knew that you
were putting on a show. So that,

40
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:31,680
that's something that I feel
like I miss. You know, there's,

41
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,540
there's no one that put on
the show the way you did.

42
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,620
Like you knew that people bought
tickets and paid for the paper view. Um,

43
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,380
and then it, you know, it's still
like one of my great memories, man.

44
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,350
It was a thrill to meet you. Um, so I
just wanted to stop by and say hi, and

45
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,080
I do it.
