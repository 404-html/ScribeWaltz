1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,480
Her low freak bitches.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:06,480
I've spent a year on porn sets,

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,830
pain research, most research
it did, it was a low,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,620
my wife did say to me once or twice,

5
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:17,340
he really liked you really have to
go to another pawn. So, uh, it, uh,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,991
I've just made,

7
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:22,470
I've just finished making a series for
audible called the butterfly effect.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,570
And the flap of the butterfly's wings,

9
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:27,270
which I'm tracing throughout
the series is, um,

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,930
is this young man called baby in a
WHO's like a tech nerd in Brussels.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,950
And he has the idea to get rich
from giving the world free porn.

12
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,690
So free streaming porn.

13
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:44,250
So the series is about the kind of tech
takeover of porn in the valley. Uh,

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm already real, oh no, this one's
everywhere. Yeah, no, that was back,

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,860
that was back in the day. That
was like in the 90s. So Fabian,

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,870
Fabian gave the world pornhub
okay. Uh, and friction. No,

17
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:02,010
no, this is, this is all true.
So, okay, let me go back.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,110
So in the 90s,
this kid called Fabian good.

19
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:11,390
Like Fabian Tillman as a young boy
in Brussels, like a tech nerd. Uh,

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,860
would like go and compuserve and swap
porn passwords, porn for free like this,

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,730
which is how people got porn
for free back in the 90s. Um,

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,630
and then it, he had like a sort
of Eureka moment, which is I can,

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,530
I can give the world youtube for porn.
Right?

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,390
So he brought up this fledgling
company in Montreal Code, uh,

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,400
um,
it was called Mansef at the time.

26
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,640
It was run by these two brothers up
in Montreal and they had just invented

27
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,320
pornhub.
Uh,

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,350
Fabian bought up porn hub and then kind
of overnight singlehandedly took over

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,600
the valley. Uh, there, it's
an extraordinary story.

30
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:55,980
This massive flow of money went
from where we are now in the valley.

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,490
A community of people who were
making pretty good money from porn.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,110
The money flowed into Fabian's pocket.

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,630
Uh, cause what Fabian
did was, um, well look,

34
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,100
if you're, if you're a porn star
and you go to a bank and say,

35
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:18,120
can I have a checking account? She, a
porn star or a porn star upon, well,

36
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,320
I said a porn star,

37
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,950
but actually aren't brilliant many porn
stars anymore of your porn person. Uh,

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,630
and you go to a bank and say,
can I have a checking account?

39
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,040
The bank manager will usually
say no because you're in porn,

40
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,020
which means your disreputable really yes.
People,

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,380
people like story.

42
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,220
I've written about this a lot about how
they find it very hard to get mortgages

43
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,310
have the kind of hard to get
checking accounts, checking accounts.

44
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,310
That seems unlikely. I mean I would
believe that may be mortgages.

45
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,800
They would think that your,
your business is fairly unstable.

46
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:54,060
That kind of makes sense
as far as investments in
concern and also the idea that

47
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:54,930
other people,

48
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,780
other customers might not like the
idea that they're high street bank is,

49
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,070
is being shared with somebody
who's in porn. I've really, yeah,

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,660
it's called reputational risk. Wow.
That seems really dumb to me. Yeah.

51
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,700
I'm going to make any sense
at all. Right. Well, sure. Um,

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,410
but Fabian was making money from running
a site that doubt in the UN in piracy.

53
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,760
So basically funds would upload,
um,

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,800
porn illegally onto pornhub.

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,810
So Fabian was running the site that
was filled with pirated content.

56
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,380
Uh, Fabian went to a bank
to say I want to expand,

57
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,340
but because he wasn't
extensively a porn person,

58
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:42,580
he was a tech person who was
deemed to be respectable.

59
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,030
This bank gave him a $362
million loan to expand,

60
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,410
uh, to build an empire based in
part on the handling of stolen porn.

61
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,890
So we went to the valet who will,

62
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,710
who will already kind of paranoid they're
all that porn was being stolen and put

63
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,800
up onto porn hub and he bought up all the,
you know,

64
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:06,850
loads of companies that cut price because
the companies were like panicking.

65
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,684
I wanted to sell.

66
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,100
I'm certainly Fabian just single
handedly like took her off upon. Um,

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,910
so I wanna I nobody cares about that.

68
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,950
Nobody was thinking about the consequences
of that because Fabian was giving the

69
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,920
world what they wanted,
which was free porn. Um,

70
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,240
but I was really curious to know like,
well, what were, let me pause there.

71
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,720
You said no one cares about it.
No, but a lot of people did.

72
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:33,721
It was a huge issue and there was a lot
of like moral debate around with it.

73
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,900
Well be,
you know,

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,220
there's a lot of the girls that were in
porn that were really pissed off because

75
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,080
they weren't making any
money anymore and they were,

76
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,330
there was a lot of social
media posts about it,

77
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,520
imploring people to stop
using these sites, which you
know, and listen to. Exactly.

78
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,960
People cat, you know, porn consumers
didn't care. Well it was uh,

79
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,790
it was an interesting tech,

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,290
like a moral tech debate that was going
on for awhile. But the debate is lost.

81
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,950
I mean there was a,
um,

82
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,610
it's really interesting cause there was
a guy who lived down the street from me

83
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,630
and he was a big time porn producer and a,

84
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,650
I actually knew him from my Jujitsu class
and he was a real high role in sort of

85
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:12,790
character.

86
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,630
Like he always had this beautiful
Mercedes Benz and he wore these really big

87
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,430
watches, a lot of, you know,

88
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,260
fancy clothes and he was just making
just tons of money and he had this

89
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:28,261
beautiful house and he was just this ball
or character and then it all dried up,

90
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,670
dried up quick. Yeah, it went,
it went into, he lost his house.

91
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:35,200
His house got repossessed.
Yeah.

92
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,910
And Fabian got so rich because of this,

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
because the money went from the
offense pocket into Fabian's pocket.

94
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:46,010
Fabian got so rich. Oh, how's he
getting rich off of free streaming?

95
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:48,540
So the ads it because,
because of ads,

96
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,770
but partly because he bought up the
paid sites as well. So you know,

97
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,200
because the paid sites were like panicking
because they were losing all their

98
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:59,750
money to piracy. So brought up the
competition. He bought it red tube.

99
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,770
He bought at Youporn say bought up
all the competition to porn hub.

100
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,420
Ariosa bought loads of paid sites,
playboy TV.

101
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,690
So your friend got so poor
that his house got repossessed.

102
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:16,691
Fabian got so rich that he installed in
his house and aquarium that was so big

103
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,690
that it diver had to come every week
and dive in and clean the coral reef for

104
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,270
no, you're doing well when you get
your own diver. That's weird. Yeah.

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,780
So yeah, you're right.
Porn people cared a lot,

106
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,110
but the outside world didn't
care because you know,

107
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,720
the outside world doesn't care
where music's getting pirated.

108
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,060
So they sure as hell don't
care when it's pawn. Well,

109
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,890
they care a little bit
about the music thing,

110
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,350
but the porn thing got almost no traction.

111
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:49,790
And when the porn industry essentially
for the most part collapsed,

112
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,910
or at least there was a
massive amount of loss,

113
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,770
there was no talk about like some sort
of a bailout or anything silly like that.

114
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,180
I was like, no, that industry's
gone. Right. You know,

115
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,240
act like many other
industries were bailed out.

116
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,220
And when you look at that hair smaller,
right?

117
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,160
When you look at their headquarters up
in Montreal or the company that owned

118
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,060
porn, it's not porn, it's
techie. So your work,

119
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:13,250
and Fabian actually said to me
quite telling Lee, he said yes.

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,061
He said it was amazing.

121
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:18,830
You wouldn't even know that we were in
porn unless you went to the wrong floor.

122
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,830
Now he seems like a guy who's
well aware of his crime.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,960
Yeah. I mean Fabian would say, if it
wasn't me, it would be somebody else.

124
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,300
What does that mean?
Um,

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,920
and it sounds like a good thing to say
after you kill somebody. I did say, um,

126
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,680
it's progress. He call it progress,
but it's that he's a criminal.

127
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,630
I mean it's, it's essentially he's lucky
that he's dealing in pirated stuff,

128
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,680
right? The one tag, Fabian
got annoyed with me.

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,780
He was quite game like I wanted to,

130
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,930
I wanted to interview him and then I
wanted to travel to the valley to look at

131
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,230
the consequences and trace
consequence through to consequence.

132
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,850
Like where would I end up if I just,

133
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,000
cause I think people don't think about
consequences on the Internet that much.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,420
They want to just, you know, destroy
somebody and then carry on with their day.

135
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,450
So I want to tell the story about
consequences that the only time Fabian got

136
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,720
annoyed with me was when,
um,

137
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,070
either me or Mike Quasar
director said to him, you know,

138
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:19,430
you uploaded pirated porn.
And he said, no, I didn't.

139
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,590
I've never uploaded pirated porn.

140
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,990
I offer a surface in which of the
people can upload pirated porn.

141
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,230
And if they tell us to take it down,
we'll take it down.

142
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,420
Which is have to find it,
they have to find it.

143
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:39,320
And also there's so much fucking free
porn and porn that it's like cutting down

144
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:43,250
the forest with a butter knife. It's
impossible to yeah, yeah. No, you can,

145
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,160
you can say tech down in my
power to support and they'll
say, okay, sorry. Fine.

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,350
But then there's like a million other
people's report up there anyway. Um, yeah,

147
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,930
so, uh, actually it's
pretty, I don't, by the way,

148
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,120
what I'm about to say shouldn't be
construed as me saying that I think that

149
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,980
Fabian has a psychopath because I don't,

150
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,980
but that thing about not taking
responsibility for your own actions,

151
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,650
I just remembered a lot of book few
years ago about psychopaths called the

152
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:09,651
psychopath test and a psychopathic trait
is that like if somebody kills somebody

153
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:15,030
in a bar, they would say, well, it's
his fault for looking at me. Funny.

154
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,740
So failure to accept responsibility for
our own actions is one of the 20 items

155
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:20,760
on the psychopath.
Jack,

156
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:24,420
do you think he is a psychopath or
do you think it's some sort of a con

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,480
convenient neglecting of certain
responsibility for what happened?

158
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,800
He,
I don't think Fabian,

159
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:35,520
that was very much a tangential thing
cause I don't think Fabian is a psychopath

160
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,530
at all. But, um,

161
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,990
I think that tech people have created
a sort of a moral bubble around

162
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:46,970
themselves. I'd talked to the head
of a porn hub's mobile division.

163
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:49,200
So if you have, if you've ever
watched, he's called Brandon.

164
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,180
If you've ever watched a porn hub on
your mobile, you have Brandon to thank.

165
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,660
And I said to Brandon, Brandon said, like,

166
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:02,640
we never like 99% of porn hub
employees never set foot on a porn set.

167
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,530
Uh, and he said, that's good because
you know, we're designing, you know,

168
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:11,100
we searched engine people were, you
know, we all want to say it would be a,

169
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,470
it would be sort of unpleasant
to set foot on a porn set.

170
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:17,790
It would be sort of intimidating and
unpleasant. Uh, and I said, well, maybe,

171
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,340
maybe it would have
been good if more porn,

172
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,290
her people did set foot on porn sets
because you would be able to see the

173
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:25,650
negative consequences of your
business plan. And Brandon went

174
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,470
their livelihood, which again, is
a very tacky thing to say, right.

175
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:35,670
Because it's all about, it's all about
progress, their livelihood. Yeah.

176
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,530
What does you mean by that? Like, okay,

177
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,650
now you want to talk about their
livelihood, their livelihood people,

178
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,330
they're essentially like
a content provider that's
not paying for any content.

179
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,740
Yeah. And um, yeah, so, uh,

180
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,190
yeah, I just remembered a guy called
David Lowery who's a, who's a, um,

181
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,410
uh, he's, he's interested in kind
of piracy issue in, in music.

182
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,191
And he said,

183
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:07,050
when we look back on the
dystopian movies of the 1930s,

184
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:07,951
when,
you know,

185
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:12,090
machines will take over like metropolis
or something like the moral of the film,

186
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:16,950
like the climax of the film is
when the people, the humans, uh,

187
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,910
defeat say, you know, I, we're not going
to live in a world run by machines.

188
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,970
We're going to defeat the machines
and human morality or takeover.

189
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,630
But now that machines
are ruling the world, um,

190
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,660
instead of us defeating the machines,

191
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:35,661
we are adapting our morality to fit
in with the machines capability.

192
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:40,080
So because it is easy to pirate,
instead of saying let's not pirate,

193
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,440
we're just adapting a morality and saying,
okay and we can watch pirated porn.

194
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,071
It's fine.
Yeah.

195
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:48,510
But it's not as simple as pirating because
pirating is what everybody does on,

196
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,770
you know when, when they're sharing it
through message boards or what have you.

197
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,800
That's sort of pirating right when
they're uploading it to these websites and

198
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,840
servers and stuff.
But what,

199
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,570
what he's doing is massively
profiting off of other people's work.

200
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,650
It's a little bit of a more of
a gray area. Yeah, I'd say so.

201
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:13,651
He's not even gray kind of dark when he
sent and they profited hugely from other

202
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:19,330
people piloting their favorite porn
films onto his side. Has he been sued?

203
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,670
Uh, he got into, he got
arrested for tax evasion. Uh,

204
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,920
and that's how he got out
of the business eventually.

205
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,860
But I think that will go up.
That all got solved.

206
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,160
I'm not sure if he ever got sued like,
cause if somebody says to him,

207
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,060
if somebody said to him that take down
my, my, you know, bad babysitters,

208
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:38,500
volume two is mine.

209
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,190
I say that because I was actually on
the set of bad babysitters volume two,

210
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,210
he tell. Sure. Yeah, sorry, of
course. And it would go down,

211
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,240
but then maybe somebody else would
put it up later that day or you know,

212
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,420
and it didn't matter because
everything else was very, uh,

213
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,470
I tell you one amazing consequence
of all of this though. Um,

214
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,610
so what I wanted to do, and
this audible series, uh,

215
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,490
the butterfly effect was to kind of trace
the consequences of this lie. You know,

216
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,460
what was the tornadoes
that were being created.

217
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,910
And one amazing consequence is like Fabian
surrounded himself with a tech wizard

218
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,790
slap people who knew how
the Internet worked, uh,

219
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,750
including a lot of search engine people.

220
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,790
So instead of making porn films
like they made in the 90s,

221
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,290
this porn director,
Mike Quasar,

222
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:31,660
I said to me that the first film he ever
made back in the 90s was called women

223
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:33,310
of influence.
Uh,

224
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,720
now all the porn films have
to be easily searchable. It's,

225
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:40,810
it's like a kind of arms race
of search engine optimization,

226
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,680
like to get yourself up
the Google rankings. Uh,

227
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,630
so all the porn films in the valley
aren't called women of influence.

228
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,580
Cause how do you search for that?
They're there.

229
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,200
They basically see what the most popular
search terms are and then make films

230
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,220
based on that.

231
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,150
So Mike Quasar was telling me this on
the set of the film he was shooting that

232
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:02,890
day, which was stepdaughter
cheerleader orgy. So I said,

233
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,150
so I said to her, just, it was just around
the corner from here. So I said to Mike,

234
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:07,930
so are there,

235
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,880
cause I thought about like women of
influence versus stepdaughter cheerleader

236
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:16,030
orgy. Uh, I'd look,

237
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,310
I haven't seen women of influence.

238
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:22,060
So for all I know the model of women
of influences that women shouldn't have

239
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,561
influenced,

240
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:26,620
but my guess is that women of influence
as a more kind of holistic poured,

241
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:30,820
filmed and stepdaughter cheerleader orgy.
So I said to Mike Other,

242
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,090
any people in the valley who like,

243
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,680
can't get work because they're
just not a keyword. And My,

244
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,843
yeah,

245
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,870
like every at home porn
actress now between the ages
of 23 and 29 can't get work

246
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,780
because they're not a
teen and then not a MILF.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They're like in this sort
of fallow periods between
teen and MILF when that just

248
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,460
attractive and just attractive
isn't a searchable term.

249
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,290
So if you're not a teen
and you're not a male,

250
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,840
if you're like a 26 year old adult
film actress, you can't get work.

251
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,110
You just have to lie. Well, I
said to Mike, what do you do?

252
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,060
Do you just like sit there until you lay,

253
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,340
become a milf and become employable
again and uh, the answers,

254
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,000
they have to find other
ways to make money.

255
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:23,730
So escorting is going through
the roof in the valley. Uh, yeah,

256
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,411
because if the tech,

257
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,950
because people like Fabian because of
the tech takeover of pawn escort since

258
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:28,641
going through the roof,

259
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:32,990
but also another thing that's going
through the roof is this kind of weirdly

260
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,730
adorable world of bespoke porn. Yeah.
And that's what the article will,

261
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,890
what was the, uh, um, publication who
published that article was the Guardian.

262
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,550
I did like a written version of
one of the episodes. If there's,

263
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,270
if the show I just stumbled upon it,
you know,

264
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,700
knowing that you were going to be here,
I didn't even know you wrote it.

265
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,150
I was reading it and as I was reading it,
I was like, oh, John wrote this. Right.

266
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,990
What an amazing, did you
know about this world? No.

267
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,070
And Rye in porn land here in the valley.
So yeah,

268
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:04,460
it's a pretty hidden salt.
Fascinating. Explain what it is.

269
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:09,461
Like people literally will request some
of the most bizarre things and these

270
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:15,170
people will make custom films based
on their weird kinks just for them,

271
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:18,300
like a team of professional porn people.
Uh,

272
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,430
because the valley's suffering so much
because there's porn happened. So on,

273
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,070
we'll make an entire porn
film just for you now.

274
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,290
How much does something like this cost?

275
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:31,190
Like say if you want to make a film
about girls were in Newton Ninja turtle

276
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:35,480
outfits who kicked guys in the balls.
That's entirely possible, right? Yeah.

277
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,190
Oh yeah.
Anything's possible.

278
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:41,810
But that sounds like something that might
actually sell at the, yeah. Oh yeah. Uh,

279
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,980
they that like a couple of
thousand dollars. That's it.
Yeah. Couple grand. Yeah.

280
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,443
Wow.

281
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:56,870
Okay.
