1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,040
Carlo three bitches,
you know, which is why,

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,550
and Mary goes to the manger. The animals
are not in the manger and not at the,

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,730
so there, there's secondary evidence for,
that's probably happened in the spring.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,230
That's how with the advent of commercial
space travel, no seems, seems it

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,510
seems inevitable, right? Love you. Love
your segues. Yes. No, don't, don't.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,790
Do you think that it's possible that
maybe you can even offer up a flat earth

7
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:33,210
believer tour where you,
you take them like at the very least,

8
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:35,370
take them up to Alaska where it's light.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,400
So 23 hours a day calling into a
tweeting me constantly to me constantly.

10
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:44,760
Yeah, call me a sellout. I'm a
sellout. I'm a round earth sellout.

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,830
Like as if there's some round earth money.

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,970
Why are you on the payroll checks?
I'm getting some ground earth,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
Earth Pale,
or for your show,

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,920
I'm sure you've seen the basketball
player who graduated from Duke,

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,890
from Duke was hitting the
news the last couple of days.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,090
I saw the leaves that dinosaurs are
fake and that the world is flat. Okay.

17
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,380
So here's the thing, Joe. Okay. I've
thought about this. I bet you have.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,330
As an educator, I've thought
about this. Okay, so here's,

19
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:18,420
here's what matters, right?
We live in a free country.

20
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,970
People should be able to think what
ever they want, whenever they want.

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,020
Provided it doesn't subtract away
from someone else's rights. Okay?

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,620
So thinking the earth is flat doesn't
harm anyone unless you want to run for

23
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:40,080
office or you want some position
of power over other people.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,240
That's when it's dangerous.

25
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,720
I thinking of elevator of banks
where they have numbers, you know,

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,550
I have a photo essay of with
what elevators look like inside.

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,200
I know it's just, I mean the
gears and, oh no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, not even that.

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,010
Geeky. Just what are the numbers on the
panel? Oh, without the 13 you mean? Yeah,

29
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,751
yeah,
exactly.

30
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,010
So about 80% of buildings taller than
12 stories don't have a 13th floor.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,640
Okay.
And so this tricks a deck,

32
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:13,230
a phobia is again,
in a free country,

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,360
if you, if you want to be afraid
of the number 13 go right ahead.

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,170
It just seems to me you should not
be tasked with designing elevators.

35
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,700
If that's your fear,
find something else to do.

36
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,270
Holding aside the fact that I'm a little
scared that in this 21st century United

37
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,130
States of America, we have people walking
among us, afraid of the number 13.

38
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,080
What does that mean? I don't know in the
long run, but if you keep to yourself,

39
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,400
don't harm others,

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,050
think what ever you want so that the
rubber hits the road is you now have power

41
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:49,884
over others.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,120
And that's where the failure of the
educational system actually manifests.

43
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,290
Now when you get in a debate with a guy,
like I don't debate be guy,

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,440
I don't debate people. Okay, well
when you discuss the saying goes,

45
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,210
when an argument lasts more than five
minutes, both sides are wrong. Well,

46
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,860
that's a terrible saying.
It was definitely mostly wrong.

47
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:11,820
And the other person's stubborn can
definitely last for hours. Yeah,

48
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,350
that's not true. It's not, it's true
80% of the time. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um,

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,390
but you got into it with that
wrapper that thinks that the,

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,670
here's what I'll tell you why
Bob pause in his Twitter stream,

51
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,310
he was saying he was invoking
physics. And so I, I gotta,

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,650
I gotta deal with this. And so he
showed a picture from bear mountain,

53
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:37,651
which is a mountain and in slightly
upstate New York where Manhattan is in the

54
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:42,010
sight line of the summit of this mountain.
And he says,

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,320
give her the curvature of
the earth and this formula,

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,330
you should not be able to see
Manhattan at all. Okay. Um,

57
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,440
and it depends on the height
that you're viewing. Thank
you. Well, well, so, so you,

58
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:57,160
you do the math and it
turns out Manhattan,

59
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,670
the island would not be visible at all.
That's true.

60
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,670
But any building taller than 15 stories
would rise up above the curvature of the

61
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,830
earth. And you will see it.
And if you look at the photo,

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,220
you see the tall buildings
rising above 15 stories,

63
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,590
it's exactly what the correct
formula shows and not his formula,

64
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,090
which was wrong and misinterpreted a
claims to show, well, let's just bizarre,

65
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:24,810
because snipers had been using the,
the,

66
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:29,560
the literal curve of the Earth
to plan where bullets go.

67
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,250
That's the one at that precise.
You have to, when you shoot a mile,

68
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,700
you know when you're shooting like
well out over a thousand yards, those,

69
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,940
those factors. So let me
think a mile. I have to ask,

70
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:44,590
how much curvature of the earth do you get
after mile? Interesting. Drop question.

71
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,920
You get drop and curb. That should
be gravity drop and then curve. Yeah.

72
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,910
So both of those. Yeah. Well is it good?
Well it's here. Here's the thing to say.

73
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:56,740
Someone if you a have a bullet in
your hand and you shoot a gun, uh,

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,600
which the same faster, right? They, yeah,

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,920
the generally they get the wrong answer
to that drop at the exact same rate.

76
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,500
They'll hit the ground at the same
time, exact same time. And that,

77
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,360
that blows people's minds. They can't
believe you'd do that in physics 101 it's,

78
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,220
it's an expense. It's a physics demo. So
that's why it's physics is so important.

79
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,500
You know, people, oh, let's
take biology and this great,

80
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,130
but don't leave out the physics because
that's where the fundamental operations

81
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:24,760
of nature are to be found of the
physical universe are to be found.

82
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,090
So what you have is you
have a gun at one side.

83
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,050
It's like a thing that shoots out of
projectile and we'll call it a gun at one

84
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:32,950
side of the stage,

85
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,340
and then you have like a little stuffed
animal with the other side's days held

86
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,010
up with an electromagnet
at the top of its head.

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,960
And these two are exactly the same level
as the projectile comes out from the

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,310
boat. There's many cannon it trips
and electric circuit that releases the

89
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,430
electromagnet at the top
of the stuffed animal.

90
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,450
The stuffed animal begins to fall.
The bullets moves horizontally,

91
00:05:55,451 --> 00:06:00,451
but also falls because gravity is pulling
them both and you watch the projectile

92
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,760
curve down,

93
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,690
you watched the stuffed animal come down
and it hits the stuffed animal every

94
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,680
single time.

95
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,600
The only factor that would change that
would be if you put wings in the bullet.

96
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,440
It was dealing with the wind wanes,
right? Yeah. When, when would affect it?

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,040
Yeah. Did they have boats with wings? I
haven't seen that. No, they don't. Okay.

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,220
But if they did,
you know,

99
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,870
if like you shot the bullet and then
they figured out like wings came out on

100
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,240
some James Bond movie, I thought,
yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. It's,

101
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,970
it's just gotta be frustrating for you
when these things come back around.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,060
Like there was no flat earth
theory when I was in high school.

103
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,700
So the other things though, think
about it, when you're in high school,

104
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,390
there was much more astrology going
on. Oh yeah. The President Reagan,

105
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,380
Nancy Reagan has an astrologer.
Uh,

106
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,000
so today you don't see much of it
unless you talked to Steve Maxwell,

107
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,950
but it's still there. It's just not,
it's not manifesting in public policy.

108
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,970
Some people believe in it deeply. I agree.
But it's not up there in public policy.

109
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,530
That's what I'm saying.
Okay, well we're the,

110
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,960
Nancy Reagan was really the only one
that made it with public policy then.

111
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,900
But at the bar to do you hear people
saying, what's your sign? Oh hell,

112
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,620
still a pickup to, Oh hell yeah. 100%.
That's totally true. It's, listen, dude,

113
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:19,310
you're married an American man. I'm
out of it. You don't understand.

114
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:23,930
If you want to get laid, you got to talk
nonsense to people. Well, I'm a Scorpio.

115
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,030
If you're a Taurus, we should just stop
because I miss that. I misled myself.

116
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,260
I thought it was fading,
but Nancy Reagan was the big proponent.

117
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,450
It's nonsense astrology.

118
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:39,200
Now it's not like someone who really
understands astrological charts and can

119
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,670
plot it and the moon's in retrograde and
you were born and you know Celsius is

120
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,050
rising and all that crazy crap that they
try to, I don't know what they're doing.

121
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,600
I was on a talk show with finished
Roger a real one. Apparently. Yeah, she,

122
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,630
she's real or fake one,
right?

123
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,890
She says she's real okay.

124
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,710
And I trust her because she talks
about how fake other astrologers are.

125
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,450
There's a hater. She say,
Hey, don't trust her.

126
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,570
And she was saying that the Kennedys
all died during a lunar eclipse.

127
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,160
Scary. And you know that this
is a very checkable statement.

128
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:18,500
She just says this and everyone's
listening and believing said, wow,

129
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,730
that can't be by accident. Well, I
don't know when other Kennedy's died,

130
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:27,731
but I know when Jack Kennedy
died and it was November 22nd,

131
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,910
1963 so I don't need to know if there
was an eclipse then I just need to know

132
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,800
what phase the moon is in.
Right.

133
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,050
Cause you can only have a lunar
eclipse when the moon is full.

134
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,100
So the moon was nowhere near full.
It was like two weeks away from full.

135
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,200
Even if it wasn't a clips,
it didn't happen during an
eclipse is my point. Right.

136
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:49,730
Okay. So of course because it
was daylight. Well when are,

137
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:52,840
you can have a lunar eclipse
at any time. Okay. You can,

138
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:57,270
it's solar look anytime too. It's
just dark. It's just not for you.

139
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,300
It would be for your world. Right, right.
Don't be so it's so centric centric.

140
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,460
Um, in fact, when there's a lunar eclipse,

141
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,360
anyone on the side of the earth that sees
the moon, we'll see the lunar eclipse.

142
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,740
So the, so by the way, lunar
eclipses, you get several per year,

143
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,933
by the way.

144
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,230
A partial eclipses as a minimum and every
couple of years there's a full lunar

145
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,670
eclipses. So these are not rare things
to start. They're not rare. Okay.

146
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,300
So I said, you know, he was shot
when the, I forgot what Muna was,

147
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,250
first quarter moon, and she
said, oh, well this counts.

148
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,660
If they're anywhere within two
weeks on either side of the eclipse,

149
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,110
why that's a month out of 12.
What does it side?

150
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,400
Let me just shut up here and let
her keep, it was, what did she say?

151
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,110
Sharing the time. It was a ferrel
had a talk. Should we were both so,

152
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,530
and he likes science by the way. And he,
he wore the NASA shirt at the, uh, at the,

153
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,980
at the Academy Award, um, group photo.

154
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,180
So I've got to give him some
props for that. But, so,
but, so I just say I'm, I'm,

155
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,400
I have nothing more to say here.

156
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,120
Hence my arguing with her
lasted less than five minutes.

157
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:15,990
Okay.
