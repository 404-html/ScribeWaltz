1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I had fun though. You were having
fun, it was weird, Oh, last night.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,740
Last night was fun. That sounds fun.
Yeah, I had a good time. It's just a,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,210
it's a different feeling,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,060
but I think people are feeling
differently about comedy now. Uh,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,130
because so many people are really
politically correct outside of comedy and

6
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,490
almost forced into it.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,720
Like you're hearing so many things about
people getting fired from their jobs

8
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,190
because of sexual harassment or
from a sexually harassing joke.

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,850
Like someone would say jokes in the
office that were inappropriate so they got

10
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,610
fired and this is
happening left and right.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,490
You hear about the guy from
Netflix that got fired for doing,

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,260
he's having a conversation about offensive
words that you shouldn't be using in

13
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,720
comedy.
And because of this,

14
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,340
this conversation during this
conversation about this subject,

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,030
he used the word Nigger,
right?

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,860
Because he was in this conversation and
did it one other time apparently because

17
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,090
of that, not calling anybody
to that saying it out loud.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,890
It was fired from Netflix.

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,490
That is crazy.

20
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,380
Unless if he was saying it like he
likes having a good time with, right.

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,350
Like, he was like, you know,
right now, like how was he saying?

22
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,780
Was He, that's the thing,
right? But the thing is,

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
it's very strange that that word is only
for bidden by the people that can't,

24
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:30,360
it can't be used on, right. Like you can't
use the n word on you, it won't work.

25
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,570
But if you can use it on someone and
they happened to be a person of color,

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,460
then that person, you're not allowed to do
that. Right. It's very interesting, man.

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,950
Well, I remember when I would go,
when I'd ride my bike to school,

28
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:43,380
a lot of my black friends
or get on my bike, you know,

29
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,140
and they get on and I would ride
them and it was fun, you know?

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,310
And they used to call me the Nigga bus
whenever I rolled up and they would all

31
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:55,280
call me that. And I honestly felt, and
they were my friends. It was fun. Right.

32
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,520
So, but you couldn't say it, you know, and
I could, I couldn't say it. And also look,

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,020
I find, you know, when
somebody says anything, if it's
something to do with a race,

34
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,250
uh, gender, anything, and they have
malice or ill intent and these days,

35
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,780
I think if you do that, somebody's going
to correct you really fucking quick.

36
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,930
And so I agree. And in a bit,
but in a business setting, man,

37
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:18,970
and that type of setting,
it's just, yeah, you,

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,730
you make people so aware that they can't,
I don't know. That's the fuck it is.

39
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:28,560
It is crazy. But it's also, he was
talking about forbidden words in,

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,630
right? It's his business.
But you're saying he can't
make a sound with his mouth.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,180
This is what you're saying. You're not,
he's not calling someone that name. Right.

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,730
He's using that word and people file
complaints about him using that word so

43
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:43,860
that people that he worked
with ratted him out.

44
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,150
Like he wasn't just allowed to say
the word. Right. But the cra then,

45
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,150
then it gets real crazy.
Whereas if you're a black guy,

46
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,800
you could say it all day and it's funny.
Yeah.

47
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,880
You could say it in front of white
people and they can laugh. Right.

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,030
But they can't say it, but they
can't say, they can't say it. Yeah.

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,570
But have you Chris Rock,

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,600
you can go up with the orr tonight and
just have like 15 different use of that

51
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,980
word in a half hour set. Yeah. And No.
And everyone's like, that was great.

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,010
That was a great show.
Right. But then, yeah,

53
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,250
but then it'll be the same people that
say we should never say or hear this word.

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,620
It's interesting. Some people
learn it from different places,

55
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,210
some people learn it from black people,

56
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:24,910
some people learn it from white
people and has a different feel,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,180
a different meaning to it. Well,
and I was even talking with them,

58
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:32,170
Mr. Peterson the other day,
um, who I was saying, you know,

59
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,590
the toughest thing I find is,

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,010
especially coming from the area
walk came from were, you know,

61
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,380
there was a lot of racism
was probably kind of went to,

62
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,870
it was popular when I was young,
but it was a part of the,

63
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,250
it was part of the t of the cloth in the,
in are in the area, you know, is poor,

64
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:49,300
black and poor white. And you know, poor
people like to fucking fight, as you know,

65
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,670
it's cool. It's everything.
It's like, yeah, it's like, hey,

66
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,650
let's be on the same team for a minute.
You know,

67
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,920
and we can change the love that you have
about white privilege. Oh, thanks, man.

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,220
Hilarious bit. Thank, but did you.
