1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,860
I read the Elon Musk is sleeping
on the floor of the Tesla factory.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,300
These,
they said he,

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:11,301
he's sleeping on the floor of the Tesla
factory while they're trying to get

4
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:16,020
production ready. Ooh. And the
Tesla's finally going to look at this.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,350
Eli Musk is stressed. Oh, son of a bitch.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,630
Elon Musk is stressed,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,710
says he's sleeping on the Tesla factory
floor and has no time to go home and

8
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:30,330
shower. Wow. That guy's
an animal. He really is.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,360
Has there ever been a guy who does
more shit? Benjamin Franklin? Nah,

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,080
but asshole with a kite and the key,
fuck that guy wouldn't teeth.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,850
Now what he's done think of is he's in
the middle of making this boring company

12
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:47,330
that bores holes under
the ground and make,

13
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:50,340
get all of the high speed
train speed train. Yeah.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,050
He's in the middle of the hyperloop.
He's in the Middle Space X.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,450
He's in the middle of Tesla production.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,270
They've got approved for the satellites
to go in the space for the Internet.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,930
You hear about that? Yeah. We'll
hear about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,410
At least can it provide
worldwide Internet, right? That's
the idea. Yeah, Dude. Yeah.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,170
It says,
how does one,

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,830
how's one guy able to do
so much that I don't know.

21
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,800
The crazy thing I was
saying the other day,

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,960
he's so smart that people just let them
drill under the ground in La. Like, yeah,

23
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,000
go ahead. Go ahead man. Nobody else.

24
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,860
Like who the fuck would let anybody just
drill into the ground? Who Do you who,

25
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,430
where do you, what office do you walk
into with that presentation? You know,

26
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,863
it's like people,

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,840
it's like a six month thing to build
a fence in La and he's like nice.

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,610
Go down a bunch like way
far and then make trains.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,290
Like they would never listen to him
if he was like a regular person. No.

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,980
Or even regular genius.
Like you almost have to be like Elon Musk.

31
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:54,180
He's like are, it's like a guy and it's
a brand new tips. He's like our guy,

32
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,290
you know,
Elon Musk plan for high speed car tunnel,

33
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,630
gets initial approvals from La.

34
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,720
I would like to see the
documentary about the presentation.

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,170
I'd like to see what happens
when an earthquake kits
and not think fills up with

36
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:11,190
water rushing towards you and
you're on that scooter, God damn.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,970
2.7 mile proof of concept
tunnel along to pull with the

38
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,140
damn zero emissions,

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,810
high speed underground alternative means
of transit for personal vehicles and or

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,811
single rider use according to urbanize
which reported on the approval man.

41
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,610
I mean, what, what, what motivates a guy
like that to do so many different things?

42
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,520
That's what's so confusing.
It's, it's not, it's um,

43
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,710
it really is that real curious.

44
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,540
He's an engineer at heart and it's that
I think it's the curiosity and, uh, of,

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,320
of the challenge and
accomplishing something that
hasn't been done before and I

46
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,000
want to make it possible. You'd be
like, that has to be the real drive.

47
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:57,450
It can't be the money and
the, the, the stardom of it.

48
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:01,960
I feel like he really gets off on how can
I find a solution to this thing? Yeah.

49
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,060
Well they're all
technologically based things.

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,590
Everything he's doing is like
Tesla, the Tesla, those home units,

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,490
the tiles, the solar tiles that
he's putting on people's roofs.

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,780
And also it all ties into like
better for humanity. Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,980
It's amazing. Yeah. He's
an, he's an incredibly lucky
that we got a guy like that.

54
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,090
I mean he's, he's essentially like our
version of a Tesla. Yeah. You know,

55
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,990
and Nikola Tesla, you know, like a
guy who just keeps coming up with new,

56
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:32,680
crazier shit to just,
it's amazing.

57
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,980
There's only one of those guys though.
That's what's crazy. Of course.

58
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:39,840
The other ones, like you
would think there'd be a bunch
of those kind of guys. No,

59
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,060
he's standing down. Yeah.
Yeah. What if he wasn't born?

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,183
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,690
Like when you have a guy who
has that much of an outlier,

62
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,080
it's just so, it's so strange
because you're forcing it to be like,

63
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,770
how has it kind of canopy and at
a nation of 320 million people,

64
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:59,930
that one individual be such an outlier.
Yeah.

65
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,080
But even I would even outside of that,

66
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,180
there's not even someone like
really like him somewhere else.

67
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:09,460
So it really like no billion, 7
billion people. Yeah. Yeah. Who is,

68
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,850
who is the one person that you think
of when it comes to technological

69
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:17,110
innovation and,
and producing the crazy new inventions.

70
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,150
And we used to seem to the public of jobs
like that, right? I mean, it was, yeah,

71
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,180
yeah, yeah. Sorta,

72
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,570
sorry that he didn't do it the way that
this guy doesn't know he was just within

73
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,630
my company is new shit.
You're going to want, yeah.
