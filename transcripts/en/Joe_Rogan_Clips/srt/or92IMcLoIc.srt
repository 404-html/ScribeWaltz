1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
The ultimate fighter.
Correct.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,120
He really couldn't train properly
with it. Yeah, that's, that's,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,260
it's going to be a different animal in
the future when people aren't worried as

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,660
much about permanent damage.
Right.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,560
I hope I need it because I
do a lot of permanent damage.

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,500
Yeah. The gym most damaged
today's permanent damage.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,450
Wild excursions. I go on.
Tell me about the cave dot.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,580
You want to learn about cave diving.
Kay.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,760
So first of all, Katie wants
to take you, she takes you,

10
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,200
so you learn about all these

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,570
different rules of the water and of the
nitrogen levels that you're taking into

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:47,430
your body. Um, any of the cave
diving is about five years.

13
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:52,431
And I got my certification in high
school and I am a super cave diver man.

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,820
I love it. I love it. I love, I love
diving. I love everything about diving.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,770
I love Shipt diving. Um, so no
days, caves, you name it. I love it.

16
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:06,000
So we were in Cozumel a
couple weeks ago and uh,

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,180
one of my old,
you could almost call him instructor.

18
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,670
He's taught me a lot of what
I know about diving today.

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,510
We a dove three or four days and some
buddies of mine that were down and uh,

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,260
goes and Mel just went through. Some ships
went through, some k are, uh, like, um,

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,210
it's the coral reef just
playing around down with them.

22
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,020
And then we go and do a
s a a serious die always.

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,100
He's getting a little bit older. His
mind is still very, very, very sharp.

24
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:36,790
But his motor skills don't keep up
with it much anymore. Right. And in,

25
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,940
in, in cave diving, it, uh, it's
very necessity that you need.

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,180
So we jumped in this cave.

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,060
Let's rewind to 20 minutes.

28
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:52,080
I just kissed my girl and my
new baby and she's like, don't,

29
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,440
I don't really want you to go like right.
I don't,

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,840
he just, I don't want to say his
name, but the guy you're going with,

31
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:05,790
like I'm worried. I said, what
are you worried about? I said,

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,470
I'm coming home. Come. This is what
I come home every time coming home.

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,900
Fuck. I Dunno. So I pick up
another, I order another,

34
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:19,440
um, cylinder of air just
for x. So I have to,

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,020
originally I'm going with order another
cylinder air. Just, I told her just for,

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,160
just for, just to fucking had it, right.

37
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,180
No one's ever died because they
have too much air in cave diving,

38
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:33,840
you dive in third, so if we have
300 PSI, we'll do a thousand psi.

39
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:38,280
N would do a thousand psi out and we
have a thousand psi in case something

40
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,510
fucking happens. Also in cage
dive in, they have lines.

41
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,020
You run these in a cave.
The law already have a line running.

42
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:49,940
A bunch of guys like me, tech divers
have gone into caves to cover them.

43
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,551
They mapped them,

44
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:54,810
they named him and they put put lines
so you can follow them in case something

45
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,370
happens. Right. Get in and get out

46
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,680
lines and lines and none of the lines
really connect Schaeffer like the main

47
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,750
lines. We'll have like three
or four main lines down.

48
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,030
Big channels of the cave
because caves are huge. Right?

49
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,870
From an intern to the main line.
Usually no one has a cave. You have to,

50
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,160
you have to make it.
It was called a jump.

51
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:16,270
You have to make your own own line
because they just don't want someone

52
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,490
listening on deer today to go find a cave,

53
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,310
jump in and swim down and be able to
get in and out and get lost in there.

54
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,250
Now also, we have a Thailand incident.
We're looking to want him to say people.

55
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,980
So we make a jump tie off.
You put these direction arrows down.

56
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,010
Um, they're called cookies, right?

57
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,180
Pointing out towards the direction out
of the cave is that way if something

58
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,900
happens, you come out, when you
make a jump, you take your light,

59
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,740
you wrap it around your neck, and then
you have two hands that work on the line.

60
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,230
The Guy I was with didn't
follow some of our rules.

61
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,000
And in cave diving,

62
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:56,650
it's kind of an unwritten fact
that you only worry about you.

63
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,670
I'm coming home, right? I'm
fucking staying alive. So Joe,

64
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,800
you mean I were Dave diving.
If something were to happen,

65
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,810
I'm not going in there to get you.

66
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,630
No reason for two of us die
when only ones in there can die.

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,140
So he tries to tie off his points.

68
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:16,750
He fucking hits the roof of the cave,
kicks his feet,

69
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,740
spins analysis in this line
that's supposed to be tied off,

70
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:24,310
which is our fucking lifeline
is now wrapped around him.

71
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,390
So I swim over to them and I try to help
him unhook this line and he goes into

72
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,750
panic and panic kills everybody involved.
Everybody involved dies with panic.

73
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,880
And that's something that
I can't express enough.

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,630
So he starts fucking freaking out, hitting
the roof, spinning silk fucking over.

75
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,590
And I just back out,

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,240
take about four or five
big strong steps back

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,760
when I grab a hold of the main line.
Now it's silting out.

78
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,280
Now when I say something silting out,
there's all this like sediment,

79
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:58,750
the ends on the bottom of, of these caves.
And you were like a little tiny room.

80
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,520
So if you kick your fin hard,
it kicks up like dark dust,

81
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,290
mud, sediment, silt. You can't
fucking see anything, blacks it out.

82
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,640
So I back out of the silt.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,740
I grabbed the line and I see him in
there fucking freaking and panicking,

84
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:18,070
spinning and rolling around and getting
all caught up in this and this line.

85
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,540
And I'm like, fuck, I just stay calm.

86
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,670
This was the exit. I know where it is
cause I know where I am. There's the exit.

87
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,360
He was making a jump to go down
another tunnel. There he is.

88
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,220
Now what I just tell you about the
rule that someone comes home, right?

89
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,230
I broke the rule and I went in to
get him. I said, Fuck God down.

90
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,370
So I let go of the line

91
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,830
and I go into get him because there's
light fucking is off now and I'm thinking,

92
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:52,380
God damn, he spun up in this line.
Is Lights off? Did he drop his ray?

93
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:56,950
He later is he had air.
Is he okay? Soon as I go,

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,260
the sill fucking lose everything man.

95
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,610
Lose my way. Where I am, my up, my down.

96
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,610
I don't know where I am.
A fucking panicky now I'm panicking.

97
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:12,620
Fucking freaking out more than
any I've ever breathing hard bang.

98
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,070
Hit My head on the fucking ceiling and
I just closed my eyes and I'm like,

99
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,190
God dammit Kelly, calm the fuck down.
Calm the fuck down. Calm the fuck down.

100
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,024
Breathe.

101
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,350
Can't even see my hands in front of me.

102
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,330
I have two watches on their glowing right.

103
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,180
Those are my [inaudible] let me know my
death, my time, everything, or I have to,

104
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,830
to, to dive computers.
I check them. I look,

105
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,450
I calm, I checked my lad, I got to turn
my light and burn, burned my, uh, our,

106
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,380
um, pressure gauges, their
glow in the dark, right?

107
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:45,890
So I charged it with my light and I
look at, okay air, check my second one.

108
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,160
Okay air. I know my third one's good
because I haven't even opened it yet.

109
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,370
That's just, just in case I
breathe down, I fucking think,

110
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,050
and I can't even see my
hands in front of me.

111
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,750
And to this day I closed my eyes and
it gives me nightmares. Write him out,

112
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,690
just thinking about it. Cloudy,
dark, can't see anything.

113
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,480
All I can see is the home of my light.
So I turned my light off.

114
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,700
I'm not trying to think of
like, all right, just, just,
just calm, calm yourself,

115
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:11,330
figure this out. Where's,
where's our partner?

116
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,860
I start feeling around and he's nowhere
to be found, right? Nowhere to be found.

117
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:17,991
So I'm now,

118
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:22,991
I've called myself a little bit and I
start feeling the walls and I start moving

119
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,220
around.
I'm trying to think where am I?

120
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,230
But I don't know because we
haven't been down this channel yet,

121
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,520
so I don't visually haven't made
an imprint of, oh there's that.

122
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:34,850
There's this right.
Kind of like a mental imprint in my mind.

123
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:37,220
Cause that's what we're doing as
we're coming in and landmarks, right?

124
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,760
I don't have any of those. I don't
have any field. I don't have any touch.

125
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,320
And I'm moving around,
moving around.

126
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,450
I took a compass reading of the direction
of the front when we tied up at the

127
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,160
first jump,
right?

128
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,510
So I know 126 degrees is the way out,

129
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,730
but in a cave they twist and they move
and they're up and they're big and

130
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,050
they're deep and they're low.
Right?

131
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,690
There's no rhyme or reason
how the water made the cave.

132
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,340
So it's kind of a
direction I can think of.

133
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,590
First thing that comes to my mind
and I start swinging that way. Now.

134
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:11,600
I hit a wall, boom, and I go down.

135
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:15,020
I hit a wall and I'm fucking in panic
mode again. I fucking swimming now.

136
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,480
I just start swimming and
kicking a fucking going crazy.

137
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,170
I make my way out of the silt and I
fucking turned on back on the main line,

138
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,790
right?
I find the main line to the cave again,

139
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,700
which is a hundred yards
to the front to the door

140
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,180
and grab a hold of the main line.
I fucking real it. Anyhow. Okay.

141
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:40,410
Now the entire behind me
deeper into the cave is free.

142
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:45,340
It's no problem. Silt free.
I can see everything's good.

143
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,330
We're I need to go is
fucking self out and blown.

144
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:53,110
Gone and completely fucking wash. I
can't, I couldn't see you sitting there,

145
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,370
but I can see everything
behind us to can't see you.

146
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,300
I have the main line, but I don't have
the jump line to get the fuck out.

147
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,820
So I started thinking,

148
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,790
I was looking in the cave maps to
try and like before we went in,

149
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
just to try to get a visualize
of, of, of the direction.

150
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:12,630
I'm trying to remember landmarks,
but I can't see anything and I can't feel,

151
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:17,610
and I'm like, fuck, there was a split
up here. So I start, uh, go back into,

152
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,470
back into the silt again.

153
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,350
And I started feeling around and I'm
feeling, and I find a hole. And I'm like,

154
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,850
is that the right way? Is that the one I
want to go down? Where does that one go?

155
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,570
Okay. Maybe remind, remember,
remember, remember? That's okay.

156
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,550
Let's go to this next one.
I go into the next one and now this is,

157
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,100
this is where it's gotta be.
I'm going,

158
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,060
but all of a sudden I'm
swimming against the current.

159
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:45,810
And I remember when I came into this cave,
there was this very slow current,

160
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:49,230
which is why the entire caves now
washed out from that point on, right?

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,590
The current is taking out. So I'm like,
fuck, you're swimming against the current,

162
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,610
so you're going the wrong way.

163
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,020
I somehow work that into
my fucking panic mind.

164
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,020
We're all swimming into the car.
We're swimming in the corner.

165
00:10:00,021 --> 00:10:02,670
That's overall going the wrong way.
So I fucking turned swim back.

166
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,700
I'm back on the fucking main line again,
right? A find the main lines clear.

167
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,170
I out into the clear
main line. Fuck, fuck,

168
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,640
fuck. I start like hyperventilating
and panicking and I'm thinking, man,

169
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,940
are you fucking you piece of shit? This
is how he will die. What the fuck are you

170
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,090
right? Keep reminding, kissing
my wife and kid by kid saying,

171
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:28,050
I'm coming home today. I'm
coming home. I'm coming home.

172
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,300
So I'd do it again. I fucking venture
into the fucking great unknown.

173
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,990
Fucking a bis. Total blackout.
Another panic. Panic.

174
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:39,450
Fucking freak out.
Can't find a way hitting my head.

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,170
Chicken losing air by the fucking second,
Bro.

176
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,090
Cause now I'm breathing hard on breathing.

177
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:49,620
Fucking irrational and I'm sucking
my tank's dry right? Mind you,

178
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:53,790
I'm on air, so I don't have, there's
no, there's no answer to this.

179
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:58,380
After I breathe my last breath,
keep checking within.

180
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,000
Keep keeping my time. Look in direction.
Time, time, air, time, fuck slowdown.

181
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,440
Slowdown, slowdown diamond pitch,
fucking black. Can't see anything.

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,070
Trying to figure out where I'm at. What
I'm thinking, what am I doing? Okay,

183
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,250
we're running out of air. How much
time do we have? Kalbi war at 28 feet.

184
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,570
I know we're at 28 feet.

185
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,470
I could probably read on this for about
another hour on this tag. Another hours.

186
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:23,640
We've got another hour. Okay, we've
been in here fucking 38 minutes already.

187
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,980
How?
What are we going to do?

188
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,620
Start trying to find my way out.
I can't. Trying to find a way out.

189
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:36,600
I can't now. I started
thinking, what am I going to do?

190
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,190
I'm not going to drown Joe drownings
like my biggest fear of my life,

191
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,190
so it was a thing that's called
a BC and we carried on her bag.

192
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,470
It's a buoyancy control device.
That's how you,

193
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,080
that's how you control your buoyancy
when you're scuba diving, right.

194
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,980
It probably holds
20 big,

195
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,720
huge strong breasts, so I feel that
motherfucker up. This is my plan.

196
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,910
MOFILM IBC up, which throws me
to the top of the cave punk.

197
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:04,361
Right now.

198
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:09,130
I'm only now I got to flip upside down
and I have like crawl on the ceiling

199
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,630
trying to figure out where the fuck I am,

200
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,740
how I'm at now I've got to get out of
a cave upside down and I'm thinking,

201
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:18,820
all right,
we've switched to our last bit of air.

202
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,240
How are we going to do this, Calvin?
What are we going do? We filled RBC up.

203
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,730
When I run out of air, I'm now thinking
in my mind, how am I going to die, Joe,

204
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,410
right? Tell my wife, tell my kid I'm
not fucking, I'm coming home now.

205
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:39,080
I got to fucking realize
how am I going to die?

206
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,410
I have a notepad that you carry in
your pocket to draw on. Right on.

207
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm thinking of what? What? What
are you going to say? What's your,

208
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,290
what's your letter going to be?
You're writing a fucking death later.

209
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,690
You're awake. You're a
fighter. We figured this out.

210
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,960
They will fucking find a way to Kuwait.
You fucking bitch.

211
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,660
He's the conversation I'm having with
myself while I'm in fucking bleed.

212
00:12:56,661 --> 00:13:00,020
Panic morning, complete darkness, thinking
that there's no, this is how people die.

213
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,910
What the fuck are you doing?

214
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,940
You're going to write a letter to
your fucking kid and tell her how you,

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,580
how you fucked up. I'm sorry,
Daddy's not coming home.

216
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,020
So I'm fucking thinking
I'm not going to drown.

217
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:13,550
I'm not going to breathe my last breath.

218
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,030
So I'm to breed this BC that just fill
up with air and I'm a fucking breathe it

219
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,870
until the oxygen level no longer happens
and I'd just pass out. That's, that's my,

220
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,120
that's what I've come to
realize how I'm going to die.

221
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,370
I'm going to fucking just
slip away and pass out,

222
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,620
keep breathing the same air until

223
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,750
I go away and I start thinking,
you fucking piece of shit.

224
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,510
You're,
you're giving up.

225
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:39,370
I think you're having the legitimate
conversations with myself while fucking NP

226
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,210
complete panic. Like you're,
you're going to quit that.

227
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,870
You're writing a letter and you're gonna
fucking breathe your last air until you

228
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:48,170
pass out you fucking pussy. You're
a fighter. Figured the fuck out.

229
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,780
So I'm upside down and crawling on the
ceiling. And I remember when I came in,

230
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,730
we came in the big cave and as like a
huge fucking crack that runs along the top

231
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,740
turn both of my watches
off now at this point,

232
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,280
because they're giving off light
and I kill my light. I said,

233
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:06,380
that cracked going to
fucking lead to the surface.

234
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:10,490
That cracks going to fucking give us
something. So I just call start panicking.

235
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:14,150
Me Panicking again because I'm panicking.
I don't know what to do.

236
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,170
I'm sucking air and a fucking breathing
hard and I'm hyperventilating and crying

237
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,730
on the sitting,
crawling on the ceiling,

238
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,280
looking for this fucking crack
and God damn it, I found it.

239
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,830
I found the crack and I followed the crack
and the crack got bigger and all of a

240
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,400
sudden I see fucking glow. Like
green glow. Crawl on crawl cron.

241
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,500
Find it. Try to get up.
My tags are too big.

242
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:36,890
I can't fucking get out of the little
hole. Can't get out of the hole.

243
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:41,510
I'm fucking big, big,
big, big fucking hitting,

244
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,710
screaming, freaking out. Calm down, calm
down. Calm down, Kelly. This is the way,

245
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,610
calm the fuck down. Reel it in.
Reel it in. We're here. We made it

246
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,150
grab control,
fall the cracks and more opens up out,

247
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:00,020
boom. There's theK
fucking I'm out made it.

248
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,890
You're coming home. You
are Doug about. Wow.

249
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,630
That was the feeling.
Meanwhile, my guys out there,

250
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,720
I can't be mad at him because he panicked.
He grabbed the line,

251
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:15,920
he fucking ran out the hole.

252
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,060
He looks at me and he says,

253
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,363
MMM,

254
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,480
so we're not diving together ever
again. We, I said, no, that was it.

255
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,210
That was it. And I texted my
girl, I love you baby. And uh,

256
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,710
they was a fucking scary moment,
but daddy's coming home

257
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,940
and it was fucking so crazy
because that was, I mean,

258
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,750
I've almost died numerous times,
but almost dying slowly,

259
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:50,620
which puts it in perspective to me
like these guys on death row. What?

260
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,630
I always thought like, yeah,
fucking killer murderer man.

261
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:57,560
That's fuck him dude.

262
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,490
Knowing the time and how
much time you have left,

263
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,680
that's some scary shit, Joe. Knowing
that you have two hours left,

264
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:10,610
how much air do you have left at the end?
Maybe another hour.

265
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,110
Probably an hour and some change.

266
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,333
But

267
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,490
could you imagine how I had to talk
to myself, how I was going to die,

268
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,450
like to me that fuck me up.
Fuck me up really bad.

269
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,950
Like I probably had to go do some
costumes and ask myself two questions now

270
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:31,490
because that fucked me up bad.
But the inner me, the fighter,

271
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,500
the youth do new fare at the fuck out.

272
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,050
But was I going to write a letter? I was
fucking damn close to write in a letter.

273
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,230
It was crazy, man. It was wild.
Damn. Hold on. I explained that.

274
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:49,030
Good for everybody. You explained
it like a motherfucker. Yeah,

275
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,880
I'm nervous like I was there.
Fuck Dude.

276
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,840
That is crazy.
Yeah man.

277
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,910
And I'm going to do it again.
Like I'm not scared of it like that.

278
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,490
It's just needs to be done better.

279
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,920
I'll run my own motherfucking line.
It also shows you how important it is.

280
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,780
Like what your wife was saying,
you can camp. She, you know,
she, she knew something.

281
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:19,220
She had a sense like right when people
fuck up a lot or when they're just that

282
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:21,440
person that just can't keep it together.

283

You gotta be real careful around those
people. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking crazy shit,

284
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:31,160
man. I mean, that's why people
kill those people in war.

Yeah. You know, they just like, look,
we can't do this. Yeah. We can't.

Everybody killed. Yeah. Your, your,
your panic is sure. Yeah, sure.

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,220
Yeah. You're not hanging in there.
You, you've become a detriment.

288
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,090
Fuck Dude. That is one of the craziest
stories I've ever heard in my life,
