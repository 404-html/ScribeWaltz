1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,810
Oh,
how did you calculate your nutrition?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,610
So the nutrition journey was actually
fascinating and to be honest,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,520
in my opinion, people said, well,
well how come other people die trying?

4
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,110
Or why do other people
not be able to do it?

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,680
Because one other guy ran out of food.
And so when I was looking at this journey,

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,690
you know, we're getting, we're
calling it the impossible first.

7
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:19,090
Like how am I going to make
the impossible possible?

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,660
And I thought that the nutrition piece
of it was going to be huge. I actually,

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,880
my dad's an organic farmer in Hawaii,

10
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:28,150
like whole food health and nutrition has
been a big part of my personal journey.

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,560
And so I found a company, um, that
was really, we're in it with me.

12
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:35,920
So this company called standard process,
their whole food supplement company,

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,920
I'm really involved in
Chiropractic and acupuncture.

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,940
And they presented them with this and
I said, hey, what do you guys think?

15
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:45,850
Like is there a way to like figure
this out? And they're like, well,

16
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,960
we have 20 of the top doctors,
nutritionists, food scientists, you know,

17
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,570
on our staff and this innovation
center around nutrition,

18
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:54,160
like come in the lab with us.

19
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:57,820
And so they'd never done this with an
athlete before, but they were intrigued.

20
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,520
And so I actually went and did a
year's long worth of, you know,

21
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:03,100
a hundred plus blood test,
vo two Max test,

22
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:05,320
all this fitness testing
all around my physiology.

23
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:08,920
And they created ultimately a
custom food solution as a bar form,

24
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:12,640
essentially called the column Bar. That
was all whole food ingredients. It was no,

25
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,820
you know, chemical to rivers or anything.
It was, you know, coconut oil, you know,

26
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:17,140
seeds, nuts, you know,

27
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:20,590
all these different pieces
of macronutrients as well
as micro nutrient blends

28
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:25,120
that I needed. But custom tailored to
my physiology. And that's what I mean.

29
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:28,420
That was the bulk of what I ate.
I ate 7,000 calories per day.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,650
I was burning 10,000 so even at 7,000
I was losing about a pound of day,

31
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:36,610
a way of weight almost to my body's.
That's why I needed to get bigger.

32
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,060
But these column bars just burned
super efficiently and my body,

33
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,250
like it was just the
perfect blend of everything.

34
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,950
So eating the same thing every single day
for 54 days might have gotten a little

35
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:47,830
bit boring, but my body was just,
it was actually pretty dialed in.

36
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,460
Wow.
Now when they did this and they,

37
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,990
they made these custom bars for
you, did they know him? I mean,

38
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,140
how did you know how many calories
you're going to be burning while you're

39
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,740
pulling this 300 pound sled?
Was it dependent upon the conditions?

40
00:02:02,741 --> 00:02:07,741
Like if the snow was more
packed or IC would be difficult?

41
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,240
If it was some soft right.

42
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,440
100% so I mean we had to do as our best
guests, honestly, we had to just say,

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,770
let's use our best gas. I, you guys had
a bunch of smart people smarter than me.

44
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,350
We're in this room, all these
doctors, these PhDs around this.

45
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,410
And we had to make some assumptions
and ultimately they were like, okay,

46
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,790
you're going to burn 10,000 calories.

47
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,950
Let's get you 10,000
calories in these bars.

48
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,050
And we started running the weight
on the sled and we're like,

49
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,780
that'll be a 500 pound sled.
Like we can't carry that.

50
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:33,100
So it's this equation of like,

51
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,720
can you make this led light enough to
pull if we can get the nutrition right.

52
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:40,950
How efficiently does that burn in your
body? How much can your stomach absorb?

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,920
You're hungry the whole time. More
or less? Yeah. Fuck yeah, I was,

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,880
I was ready for a big fucking meal. I got
done. What's the first thing you ate? Uh,

55
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,070
this, the first thing I ate when
I got back was a big burger.

56
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:57,400
But you might call me lame for saying
this, but I'm just going to say,

57
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:59,740
cause it's the truth.
What I craved, salad man.

58
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,830
What I craved was just something cause
I needed this. You know what I mean?

59
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,550
I've been eating like this freeze dried
field, this chunk of Colombar Bar,

60
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,301
which got me through,

61
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,900
but it was like something green and
alive until I let miss big salad with

62
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,190
avocado and Sally. No, I had a big
burger too, but then of course I eat,

63
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,120
my stomach is shrunk, right. I eat
this big meal and I'm like, oh,

64
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,430
my stomach kind of hurts.
But emotionally I was like,

65
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,210
I'm back in the real world
baby. So it was like, it was,

66
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,720
I did everything I could get my hands.

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,090
I went to a buffet and just like my
stomach was hurting, but I was like,

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,110
I'm not going to stop.

69
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:33,010
And I just started eating like
whatever croissants and bread,

70
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,390
it was all the things.

71
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:39,391
So I would imagine your body would like
you probably craving all that life.

72
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,680
Like live things green.
Exactly. Vegetables and fruit.

73
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,450
It's weird to say, I mean like I'm
from Portland, Oregon, you know,

74
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:50,380
it's pretty green part of the world
up there in the Pacific northwest.

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,120
And so not even just the food component,
but there's nothing alive out there.

76
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,060
There's no animals on the coast.
There are. But like in the interior,

77
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:01,090
and I don't see any animals. I don't see
a bird. I didn't see, you know, nothing.

78
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,220
Right.
And so not only have,

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,700
I think as humans we're kind
of wired to see things living.

80
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,070
I mean even here in la,
but have a concrete jungle.

81
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:12,050
But like you see trees on the street,
you see the, Oh shit. Yeah, whatever.

82
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,850
That's what a Nazi, anything alive
for 54 days. It was like, wow,

83
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,170
I want to like smell treats, fresh
air, the trees. I want to eat a salad.

84
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,180
I don't know.
Like that's where I'm like,

85
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:24,640
my mind got to is kind of coming
back to reality and that way.
