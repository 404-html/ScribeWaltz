1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,760
What was this movie in Thailand?
Uh, is my buddy as Seth green was a,

2
00:00:04,761 --> 00:00:06,090
he wrote and directed a movie.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,220
And so he asked me to do something
in it and you know, like,

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,930
cause I don't really pursue acting
like at all off kind of thing.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,540
And I'm not saying it was a
favor or anything like that,

6
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,000
but at the same time it was like,
yeah, it sounds like fun. So, uh,

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,610
schoolcast it's like him, uh, he's
in a brick and Myers and it, uh,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,800
Brenda Song, uh, me.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,300
So do you just like do whatever you want
these days and just occasionally act

10
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:32,890
when it comes up? Yeah, if it comes up,
like, you know, if it's a cool look,

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,460
neat little gig or something like that,
like, yeah, sure. But, uh, like I said,

12
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:37,650
I don't pursue it in any
kind of like any way.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,990
Like I don't have agents
anymore and things like that.

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,270
Is that because you're just not
interested or not interested?

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,110
I don't really like the, uh, the
pursuit of it, you know, like, yeah,

16
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,500
like what it takes to assess.
Exactly.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,910
I don't like being on the circuit kind of
thing looking at. Yeah. So, uh, but yeah,

18
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,790
no, I um, you know, I
write a lot, I paint a lot.

19
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,170
Like I just kind of always have some
kind of projects. And then also, uh,

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,080
like I said, we've got the website,
a bunny ears.com kind of thing.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,250
And what does that, that is a, it's a
comedy website. It's pretty much, uh,

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,940
like, uh, like, you know how all these
celebrities, especially like ladies,

23
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:15,900
they have those, uh, lifestyle websites.
All of them. Well, a lot of them do,

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,380
you know, look. Yeah, like Goop, you know,
just one of them. Is there other ones?

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,030
Oh yeah, yeah. No, it's okay. It's a goop
ones. The most egregious though. Yeah.

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,810
Well that's the thing,
is that, so this is,

27
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:29,610
this isn't like goop meets the onion
soup is like goop meets the onion.

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Yeah, I knew all yet, but accident
it accidentally, you know? Yeah.

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,850
They're telling you to put jade balls
up your vagina. I know. Believe me,

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,020
we had an years. Yeah, we have an, we
have an article beach in a hot, hold on.

31
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,220
What does that just do? That
thing. Oh, annoying. Yeah.

32
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,100
How to have sex on the beach in a hot
tub and other things that seemed fun as a

33
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,540
virgin. It's Hannah, Hannah and Michael.

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,180
He's a hunter.
She's a fantastic writer.

35
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,860
You've got to look a little
scroll and things like,

36
00:01:55,861 --> 00:02:00,670
say you have a podcast as well. Yeah,
we do a podcast also. Um, and we,

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,170
we have, we're revving up some,
uh, more like video content
and things, but uh, yeah,

38
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:09,780
so this is just a fun project.
It's got a lot of really great writers,

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
like comedy writers and stuff.
Yeah. It's kind of just like, oh,

40
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,000
like there's a good article
about a jade egg. Like, oh,

41
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,690
I put a jade egg up my vagina and
I catch a jade bird, you know,

42
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,190
like that kind of thing. You're
like, you know, and then like,

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,910
you know what to do about your bird
living in your vagina. Now look at like,

44
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,310
it's like, you know what I mean? We're,

45
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,090
we're kind of like taking the
piss out of like, you know,

46
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:31,110
some of these kind of like
lifestyley websites, you know,
it's like, um, it's like,

47
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:32,910
you know, they'll have articles
like on coop about like, oh,

48
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,630
the best cabernets like for like $200
or something. That, and it's like,

49
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,160
ours is like the best Bourbon's under $20,
but then like a turn,

50
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,720
like the spelling gets worse and worse,

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,980
and then it turns into a rant
about your ex girlfriend.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,220
So like things like that, it's, it's,
it's some really good stuff. Like I said,

53
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:53,820
we have a really, really great
team of people and uh, yeah, it's,

54
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,130
it's kind of like I said,
taking the piss out of things.

55
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,770
And so you just decided to do this just
for fun? Yeah, I kind of had this idea,

56
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,780
it was kind of kicking
it around and so forth.

57
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,250
And then I felt like I kind of accumulated
enough ideas and then, uh, yeah,

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,520
then I start kind of vultron in it. Like,
just grabbing the assembling, you know,

59
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:13,980
like this, this, this, this, this project,
this giant, giant robot, you know? Yeah.

60
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,070
So there you go. It's, it, it, it's
a lot of fun and it's, it is funny,

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,680
like we have a look.
I said there's actually a look.

62
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,290
Those articles are really well written,
like we have one about, um, uh,

63
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,610
do you see infinity war? Uh,
the, the, the, yeah, the vendors.

64
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,290
Oh, okay. Yeah, because, oh, it's
fantastic. It's fantastic. But were like,

65
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,460
we made our own infinity gauntlet. And
what happens is like in a spoiler alert,

66
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,990
uh, is like, a lot of the people kind of
just vanish. Like they kind of just die.

67
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,351
Like,
you know,

68
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,190
they turn into dust in a movie and the
movie at the end when you start reading

69
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,800
the article, uh, um, uh,

70
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,460
all of a sudden just all the words
just start vanishing and like,

71
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,700
and then you have to go back. And again,
it's like a, even like they'll letters,

72
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,300
like we actually had a, um, we did
one where it was a ransom letter.

73
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,760
One of our writers, she, um, her father
is actually the therapist for a group,

74
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,220
like the extra like psychiatrist,
the official one.

75
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,400
So we do pass their own
therapist, you know? Yes,

76
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,330
but is it like a weekly advice therapist
or is it just like therapy just for

77
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:17,470
being on goop? Like I know you're
here because you're a mass,

78
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:21,610
so here just read this, read this.
It's okay. So we're here for you.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,850
So we got pictures of him bound and
gagged and it's like dear goop, like we,

80
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,190
we kidnapped your therapist.
Uh,

81
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,170
w you can only get him back if you'd give
us your seven hot tips for, you know,

82
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,650
yeah. Like, uh, uh, for
facial washes for this summer.

83
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,560
And you know what?
They actually good on them.

84
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,100
They responded and they actually like
sent us over like a list of like,

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,190
here are the hot, like kind of like,
I was like, you know, good for them.

86
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,260
Like they had a sense of humor about
the whole thing. Look at again,

87
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,740
they have two, they're called
coop. Yeah. We, oh, we almost,

88
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,680
we thought about naming ours.
Puig uh, that's probably sue.
Yeah, I know. I was like,

89
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:57,880
yeah, like, no, no, no. So, um,

90
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,880
so you're basically financially
set from all those movies.

91
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,380
So I do okay for myself,

92
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,030
but do you just put that money away
and just live off the interest so much?

93
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,340
Pretty much, you know?
Yeah. And uh, yeah, I've,

94
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,030
I'm able to kind of live the life that,
you know,

95
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,950
like that I, that my circumstances
afforded me. I'm, I'm, like I said,

96
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,100
I'm very, very, very lucky. You know,

97
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,730
lots of weird things happen to kids all
the time, all around the world, every day,

98
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,090
you know, I have something to show for
it, you know, like, yeah. Like, you know,

99
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:32,630
so it's Nice I can live.
Um, it's, uh, my buddy jack,

100
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,040
he goes to a weird way to
describe a movie career. Yeah.

101
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm pretty much weird things
happen to kids. Yeah. Man,
I got some money out of it.

102
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,040
Look, I'm, I'm not working like the
diamond mines. I'm not a child soldier.

103
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,090
You know what I mean? Like I, like I
got lucky, I came up the other end, uh,

104
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,830
and I have something to show for it.
And I'm very like,

105
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,320
I do feel blessed every
morning kind of thing.

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,610
Let's say you're happy that it
all worked out that one. Yeah.

107
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,210
You can go back and do it again
when you do it the same way. Uh,

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,920
knowing what I know now, I mean
probably, you know, I probably, yeah,

109
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,540
I probably be even more charming.
I do it just better.

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,480
Of course you would,
right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

111
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,070
Imagine if you'd just have your brain, a
little kid's body. Uh, yeah, I know. I,

112
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,040
I would kill it grade school. I would
so kill it. Like in school, like, oh,

113
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,830
psychological warfare, they wouldn't
know what's coming out of fucks.

114
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,580
Mr. A little brains up and nuts. Oh,
exactly. They would. That would be great.

115
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,180
I'm pretty sure that's what
a 30 going on 13 was. Right.

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,890
And that goes up to Jennifer
Gardner movie, you know? Yeah.

117
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,800
I have no idea what any Jennifer garden
wounds are. Well, you know, now you do.

118
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,290
Yeah. Going on 13 yeah. Like a
a brain swap one kind of. Yes.

121
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,200
so it's kind of a freaky Friday with
some time travel. I guess so. Yeah.

122
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:56,390
So you're gonna, you're gonna,

tonight, aren't ya? Nope.

123
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,090
I can tell it. I can, I can see it. I,
you've been thoroughly charmed by, uh,

124
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,150
Jennifer Gardner. I can tell him
interesting life you have then you,

125
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:08,060
so you just kind of do whatever
you want. Yeah. My friend Genx is,

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm a man of leisure. That's the way he
described was like my life and lifestyle.

127
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,790
That's a good way to describe it.
And it's true.

128
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,300
And like I kind of looked at him kind of,

129
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,770
I'm going to spend some time just like
jumping around like Europe or something

130
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,500
like that. Like, you know,

131
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,640
and just look at like you lived
in Paris who were saying, yeah.

132
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,400
Lived there for a number of
years. I mean, I still have,

133
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:29,750
I still have my place there,
but uh, since like 2013,

134
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,270
so many that it's only in the last year
I've been kind of spending more time in

135
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:35,780
the states. Was it that brought
you to Paris? Well, the food sucks.

136
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:40,710
The wines terrible and the women are ugly,
but otherwise it's fantastic.

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,650
Yeah, no, it's okay. It
was an agreeable lifestyle.

138
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,170
I did a bunch of friends out there.
There was always asking me,

139
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,780
when are you gonna move to Paris?
And when he learned French,

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,910
any like your friends in Paris.
And I was there just kind of like,

141
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,800
I was just kind of jumping around
a little bit. And so, um, I,

142
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,990
I thought about it for a second and I
went, you know what, how's next week?

143
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,940
So I said, I'm going to leave my bags
here, I'm going to fly back to New York.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,140
I'm going to going, you know, I'll, uh,
put my affairs in order. And I said,

145
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:15,440
I'll be back next week. I
said, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'm
ready to live here. I mean,

146
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:20,390
I realized that if I could pick up
and just move to France on a whim, um,

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,010
and it wouldn't affect like,
you know,

148
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:23,840
like anyone's life or it
wouldn't hurt anybody.

149
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:27,440
I think that I'd be remiss if I didn't
look, you know what I mean? Like, yeah,

150
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:30,050
like how many, how many times in
my life, I couldn't do that now,

151
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,940
but I could do it back then kind of
thing. So it was like, yeah, like, no,

152
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,250
I should just fuck it. Look, I'm, I'm
good. I'm going to live in Paris now.

153
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,130
And it was, it was great. It was
a lot of people who've done that.

154
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,620
Johnny Depp lived there for a
little while. I know Richard,

155
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,650
he still has a place there for a while.
No, it's, it's a special place. I mean,

156
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,140
what's special about it? Um, I mean
again, food and wine's fantastic. Look,

157
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,230
the girls are pretty like it.

158
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,520
It's the leisurely kind of like
lifestyle little bit like I like,

159
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,690
I like their eating
habits, you know, I get it,

160
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,700
it's like a light breakfast and kind of
gets heavier as you kind of go along in

161
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:07,080
the day. You kind of eat later, which is
kind of like, you know, like, like, oh,

162
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,690
you're American, you must want to
eat dinner at like eight, eight.

163
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,090
I look 10:00 PM 10:00 PM is looking
at, you know, kind of a, you know,

164
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,010
an ideal like dinner kind
of time. Um, they don't like
to work hard either. Right?

165
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,490
I mean, no, I mean they, I mean, they,
they work, I mean, I think, you know,

166
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,540
I like to take their time and everything
is like, yeah, it's like, uh, you know,

167
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,330
I'll set up a card game for like three 30
and three 30 means like five, you know,

168
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,860
again, that's just the way, like
everyone's kind of always late,

169
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:37,440
but it's no big deal. That's the thing.
It's like, I remember one time coming,

170
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,110
I'm like, oh gosh, like, you know,
just like, where are they kind of,

171
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,740
and then I realized, I'm like, wait,
what is the hurry look for real?

172
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:48,030
Like what is the hurry? It's not like I
have other plans. My plan is to hang out,

173
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,680
like, you know, with you guys. And so,

174
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,490
and all of a sudden the stress would just
kind of just melt away. I'm like, yeah,

175
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:56,850
like look, you can just be
more leisurely and stuff, uh,

176
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:00,050
about things out there and everyone's
looking at him. Like I said, it's,

177
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,120
it's really cool. They like Americans
out there. That's a misconception.

178
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,060
And if they don't like, they don't like
the loud, obnoxious Americans with the,

179
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:10,650
you know, Mickey mouse tee shirt
and the fatty. Yeah, no fanny packs.

180
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,220
How dare you.
