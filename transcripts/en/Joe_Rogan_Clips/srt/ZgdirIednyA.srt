1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,350
Her low freak bitches and if
you listen to Jordan Peterson,

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,320
he knows so much about Marxism
that it's it, it shows you like,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,720
oh this is a pattern of human thinking.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,410
It starts off by people that were
really like well intentioned.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,740
They're intellectuals, they're
very kind, they're sympathetic,

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:19,290
they're progressive and they
want everyone to be nice.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,250
So one of the ways they do it is to be
really evil to people they think are not

8
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:23,880
nice.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,570
And then you create this fucking war
cause they look at them as predators and

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,190
there it's, that's that sort
of like infantiles the date.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,540
The problem is that people in the
other side don't look at it that way.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,460
So you're starting this thing and you're
creating two short up defenses and

13
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:41,220
walls of offense. You,
you start, you push in,

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,330
you start Molotov cocktail in universities
that to given speeches by guys who

15
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:46,590
were Republicans,
you create a,

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,750
like that UC Berkeley that
went happened with Milo.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
I just pulled them out of the fucking
building to save his life. Yeah.

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,540
He did $100,000 worth of damage to
the school for thinking. I thought,

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,970
I thought Berkeley was so
tolerant. How, what a surprise.

20
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:03,540
As long as you don't get along hearts
on fire, they make cars. Ireland.

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,520
Milo was there and so we got shadows. Yes.
Some kind of shy bias. Yeah, no, it's,

22
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,450
it's crazy. And if you listen to what
he's saying, he's saying some racist Shit,

23
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:16,530
right? Not nothing compared to the
reaction. And it's getting nothing.

24
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:21,480
He's mostly half of a troll. He's like
half of a comedian when he says things,

25
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,550
he's bitchy.
He's a bitchy gay guy.

26
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,100
They called him a Nazi and
he's a fucking gay Jew.

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,290
It is one of the funniest things ever.

28
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,440
They're calling this Guy Nazi and a
white supremacist slogan of his tour.

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,450
Loates intense, dangerous faggot
tour. But he, but he's gay. He's gay.

30
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:40,630
And he talks about his love of black
Dick. You know, he talks about how no,

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,360
he's up of writer and a troll,
but like a,

32
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,670
an intelligent troll and a
British guy who's got people on,

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,890
if you look at what the athletes yeah.

34
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,790
And they said it was because
he said a rude, racist shit.

35
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,710
Organize some sort of an attack on
Leslie Jones, but he didn't do it.

36
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,050
Like if you look at what he said, if, if,

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,100
how responsible is someone who
cracks a joke about someone,

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,770
like he said something about Leslie
Jones wouldn't be the first time I was,

39
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,960
I was, uh, in Saul turned
down by a black man. Like,

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,450
like something along those lines,
like bitchy but funny. And for that,

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,081
just for that,

42
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,970
for saying that because she was mad at
his review or something along those lines

43
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,130
that his followers started
sending her horrible come maybe.

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
But how much of that can you push
on to him? They can't control that.

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't control it.
So I'm not,

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,940
what I'm saying is if you
look at what he actually said,

47
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,990
if that's grounds for a band, we're
dealing with some extreme censorship.

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,190
So you've got to figure out like, when is
he responsible? See did he say, hey guys,

49
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,580
go get him. No, he didn't. But you
know who did do that is Leslie Jones.

50
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,270
There was a tweet or Leslie Jones,
someone was attacking her and she's like,

51
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,360
go get them to that person. Like
[inaudible] which is like, look,

52
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,500
that's her prerogative too.

53
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,370
If you want to be a cut
and started attacking this
woman who's a very hilarious

54
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,960
comedian for no reason,
she,

55
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,780
I think she should be able to say fuck
you and do it publicly and say go get him

56
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,170
so fence.
So my,

57
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,110
my low never said that Milo
literally never said go get him,

58
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,610
but yet he was sort of held responsible
for things that other people said.

59
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,190
You can't,
there's so many crazy people out there.

60
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,730
The idea that you can control them and
then you could just like say like people

61
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,250
who like Brian Cowen,
you are responsible for those people.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,770
You have to set a good example.
We're going to kick you off our platform.

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,070
That's essentially what this crazy,
it's weird, it's their prerogative.

64
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,670
But pull up 20 actually silence.

65
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,310
I think it's interesting
and yellow actually said,

66
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,710
you know that you're not going to change.

67
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,860
We always have to remember that if
you disagree with the other side,

68
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,520
the idea is to try to get them to agree
with you or try to come up with some

69
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,970
kind of a consensus. So you can move
ideas forward and move the world forward.

70
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,720
And what we have with this kind of
reaction to Milo is if you're going to do

71
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:47,500
$100,000 worth of damage in your protest,
well that's fine.

72
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,350
And Milo have to be escorted out and you
won't listen to them and you close your

73
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:53,470
mind. You're not moving anything forward
or making anything better though.

74
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:55,540
You're just creating a big old division.

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,630
And I guess you guys can
stay in your echo chamber.

76
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,480
They'll stay in their echo chamber and
nobody will listen to each other and we

77
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:06,040
won't learn anything. Well that's just a
product of being raised in this system,

78
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,840
this two party system and this ridiculous
idea that there's us and them and now

79
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,820
that they're in, there's this, you know,

80
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,460
all people have to fight back
and you have to punch Nazis.

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,260
So this crazy shit that people are saying.

82
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,920
But when you listen to what Milo actually
says, even if you disagree with them,

83
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,340
which I do all the time, like I disagree
with a lot of what he's saying, Hah,

84
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,300
there's Sam Harris put it best. He's
like, half of it is like a performance.

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,830
It's like he seems insincere a lot of the
times and he's very acutely aware that

86
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,510
is generating a response and the things
that he's saying that they're saying

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:36,991
like,
you know,

88
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,650
that they're saying that he's racist or
he's just as terrible white nationalists

89
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:45,130
or something like this is they're just
making stuff up so that they can start

90
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,470
attacking him more freely
because it's easier.

91
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,380
What he said is definitely controversial.
Controversial,

92
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,010
he said is some of it is definitely rude.
Some of it is preposterous.

93
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,630
Some of it doesn't make any sense.
Like he's,

94
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,170
he's pro circumcision because he doesn't
want Dick's to have extra skin hanging

95
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:03,160
off of him. He says he'll
fight with you about it. You
know, he's, he's, he's a, uh,

96
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,650
Catholic. I think he is. I'm like, okay,
that's fun. I believe that. He's like,

97
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,910
absolutely, Catholicism is the best
religion. It's the most amazing religion.

98
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,520
I'm super like, he's crazy. Okay.

99
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,580
So he started making front of Jones
and we wrote an article, first of all,

100
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:20,110
let's say one thing that he wrote an
article, uh, where he did a horrible,

101
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,440
like a mean critique of the
new Ghostbusters for women.

102
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,050
And he said essentially that
it was like a feminist film.

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,850
And he pointed out some really
important shit. He's like,

104
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:31,270
every guy in the movie is a fucking
idiot and every woman's saves the world.

105
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,770
And he's like, it's kind of
ridiculous. So He's, he says, um,

106
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,010
he writes this. So she was getting
hate mail from his response,

107
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:42,850
I guess from his thing, racial abuse,
abuse that she was getting. And he said,

108
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:45,430
everyone gets hate mail
for funds for fuck sake.

109
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,090
One tweet read another one called Jones,
barely literate.

110
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,120
Later she shared fake screenshots.
Oh,

111
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,730
he shared fake screenshots
that made it appear of Jones.

112
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,500
We're making profane
and offensive postings.

113
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,270
Twitter didn't say exactly why at Bandy
Annapolis only telling Breitbart writer

114
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:05,240
that he was permanently
banned for violation of the
company's rules prohibiting

115
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,690
participation in or exciting
targeted abuse of individuals.

116
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,720
So what makes that like,
okay.

117
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,950
I could see like if he was
post retweeting things that,

118
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,700
that were very rude.
I will have to see what those things were.

119
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,530
Probably proceed how rude they were.
Maybe they were silly. They were racist.

120
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:28,340
They were bad. They were
bad. They were crazy.

121
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,280
Or on the seat making it appear
that the Jones link there, Jamie,

122
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:34,160
scroll back down to see where it says it.

123
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,930
Made it appear of Jones were making
profane and offensive postings.

124
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,680
Click on that. Let's see what it looks
like. What it, what was actually said.

125
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,580
This was not me. Okay. Okay. Uncle Tom.

126
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:50,420
Fag Nero needs to get his racist ass out.

127
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:55,421
My mentions shit like this makes me think
we need to gas got Goddamn faggots sit

128
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,990
down. Okay, so it's not really hurts
fake. Yeah. Somebody made a fake.

129
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,010
That's kind of fucked up to do to Leslie
Jones. Terrible. Well, how do we know?

130
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,280
Okay, you got to assume that he
knew that that wasn't him. Right.

131
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,250
Posted one that that wasn't her
brother, but hold on, hold on. Hold on.

132
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,680
We got assumed that. Go
back to that again. Jamie,

133
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,710
you got to assume that he knew
that that wasn't really her. Right?

134
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,400
You don't think that he really thought
she wrote that? So if he retweets that,

135
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,160
if that's a fake account,
what's the diff? Okay,

136
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:24,800
so it's just a photo that
someone said or did he,

137
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,270
someone else did it and he tweeted
it. He retweeted it, I guess. Okay,

138
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:30,530
so let's see what the other ones are.

139
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,820
Although it says it looks
like it's verified as well
as dog. Did He retweet this?

140
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,500
If someone sent it to him and he
retweeted. Okay, here's one less dog.

141
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,700
You're Ghostbusters just in the first to
have an ape in it. Oh Shit. Super Racist.

142
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:48,530
That is, whoa. It's awful. So he
retweeted that. He retweeted that. Okay.

143
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,010
Yeah. That's not cool. That's pretty
fucking rude. That's again, what,

144
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:55,070
what else we got. That's, that's,
that's, that's just shitty man.

145
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,690
That makes me not like, just that
makes me want to put this on him.

146
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:02,090
He's definitely got some issues.
He's got some fucking issues.

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,150
We were good. We get it.
You get it. Well that's,

148
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,910
he's definitely got some issues like that.
That's not a cool thing to do.

149
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,440
But what he's doing,
he insights talk and because of that his,

150
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,230
his book is now number one on the Amazon,

151
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,240
the salads you trying to accomplish what's
the property sale and no one knows it

152
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,540
hasn't book isn't even out
yet. Yeah, it's really,

153
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,840
really interesting guy and a lot of ways.
He's very smart. I talked him off hair.

154
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,080
He's a very intelligent guy and he's
very cordial, very good to talk to.

155
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,980
I really enjoyed talking to him and I,

156
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,970
we joked around a lot when we did the
podcast together cause I grilled them

157
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:37,400
about certain things I think are
ridiculous and eventually it gives him,

158
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,810
starts laughing with you.
He's a very smart guy, but I
don't know what he's doing.

159
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:45,530
I don't know if this is a real as the
real him or if this is him doing a

160
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,470
performance or if it's combination of
both or if he's finding himself in the

161
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:51,740
midst of this hurricane of
negativity and popularity,

162
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,200
which would it be just
assuming that he's bulletproof,

163
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,790
that he can't be influenced by this
fucking crazy or deal that he's going

164
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,130
through. And occasionally do
shit that he shouldn't have done.

165
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,580
Like reposting some horrible
racist thing is young.

166
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,240
I mean he's maybe 30 something. Right?
How old is my life? You made a point.

167
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,080
That's a really good point.

168
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:11,430
You just said that made about if this is
like in transition, like so sure he is.

169
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,650
He's a growing just like all of us are.
And even like,

170
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,200
it depends on how you can
catch somebody in, in a,

171
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:20,700
in a moment where they can sound if you,
they already sound not like themselves.

172
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:24,660
So he's young. He's 23. He's
fucking smart, dude. I'm
telling you. I believe it.

173
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,620
I just feel like,
yeah,

174
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:29,490
I definitely disagree with retweeting
that racist picture of Lizzy Jones looking

175
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:33,300
like a gorilla. This one guy who said
something, he was at the, uh, when,

176
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,780
what was the theater in France that
they shot up during a performance?

177
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,750
He was in the band, I believe it's
Christ. Yeah. So remember when,

178
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:44,190
when those guys opened fire
the life contracts deaf,

179
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,440
famous, famous, famous, yeah. Death metal.

180
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,950
And he said something about Islam
right after that he was like,

181
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,920
he's in and he was emotional and people
that dive and it was his concert and he

182
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,960
saw some all kinds of stuff and he said
something that they picked up and he did

183
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,110
an interview cause they just did a
documentary on it and he said something

184
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:07,740
really interesting. They said,
you said something about Islam,

185
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,680
do you have any regret about that?
And it was pretty racist. And he said,

186
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,580
all right, well look, first of all, I
love people. We have a lot of Muslim fans.

187
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Anything else said what happened there
was my emotions were so heightened and

188
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:20,700
there was a,
there was a,

189
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,730
there was a span of time where I
was thinking in a very emotional,

190
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,830
uncharacteristic way that I usually am my,

191
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,640
I had,

192
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,840
I was hot off of something tragic and I
didn't even know how to make sense of it.

193
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,520
I don't want you to reread what I
said because that's not who I am.

194
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,480
But in that sliver of time, that's how
I was feeling and I lashed out in pain.

195
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,990
It's very honest way of putting it is,
and I thought that's,

196
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:52,950
that's why we have to be careful about
taking quotes and then applying that to a

197
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:55,520
person's entire Caribbean Myeloma.

198
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,860
This was a guy in the band after
he said something about Islam, but,

199
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,400
but it made me think about that.
We do this all the time where we say,

200
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,260
you said that one thing,
you said a sentence,

201
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,520
let's let's highlight that and let's
just say that's who the man is. You know?

202
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:12,100
You got to be careful. Sometimes you'll
be held accountable for what you do.

203
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,750
Eating good deal. We can't always
give everyone a pass, but I'll call.

204
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,920
He's just going through a rough
time. It's all good. It's drill.

205
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:19,920
You're going to be held accountable
to. That's true too. That's true too.

206
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,930
But we also have to recognize that like
at 33 years of age, especially, dude,

207
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,070
I was a moron when I was 33 and if I had
gotten drunk and I decided to retweet

208
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:29,490
some shit,

209
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,060
thank God Twitter wasn't around then I
want to say the stern of the ship that

210
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,190
young and if he's a smart yes it is. You
say stupid shit all the time. Hold on.

211
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Just doing stupid shit.
I've never retweet anything racist.

212
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,040
All 33 you know you're not racist.
No, not a Rawls, but with them,

213
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,310
this is the pattern. Maybe you don't
get a free house. Here's the thing, man.

214
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,430
He's his whole thing is
courting controversy.

215
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,950
That's essentially what he's doing
by saying feminism is cancer.

216
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,050
He's organizing a fist fight.

217
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,130
He's calling them out and he's organizing
a verbal [inaudible] probably on

218
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:02,200
Adderall.
So he's talking a hundred miles an hour.

219
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,800
He's really articulate and he's gay and
he looks fabulous and he's got bleach

220
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:10,540
blonde hair and he wears clothes and
when he's killing it, like on stage,

221
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,710
he's a very good order.

222
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,790
So he's engaging them in these debates
that he's got carefully thought out,

223
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:19,720
responses, carefully thought out
sentences about what he's doing.

224
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,880
He definitely knows what he's doing.
He definitely knows.

225
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,150
How was your conversation with Henry
Rollins? Speaking of articulates,

226
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,930
getting a little pointy with this racism
thing. Look at Maria. Oh I love that.

227
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:36,070
He's a good looking guy. Handsome fellow.
Hell, a profound love of black Dick.

228
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:36,970
He talks about it all the time,

229
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,870
which is also one more way that they have
a hard time attacking him cause he's a

230
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:45,160
gay Jew that loves black Dick. Like he's
got the spectrum covered. He's like,

231
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,740
there's a triangle
invincibility that's around him.

232
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,900
Brian's up. These are good talking.

233
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,080
One time Brian's not.
You go off.

234
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,780
Oh Man, I am happy. I'm alright
man. You can't. This is,

235
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,250
this is what fascism is.

236
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,700
You can't enforce your view of the
world on people through violence because

237
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,560
that's what you're doing
when you're a fascist.

238
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,000
And that's what people need to understand.

239
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,270
Like you can't just use the word fascist
when it applies to right wing people.

240
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,280
If you're keeping people
from communicating,

241
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,090
you're keeping a gay Jew from talking
shit on your stage and you can't just

242
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:24,730
counter what he's saying with
someone who's better at talking shit.

243
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,720
That is better points.

244
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,230
So instead you want to throw a chair
through the window at fucking Starbucks.

245
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,740
Look, stop. You guys are fascist. I
know you don't stink your fascists.

246
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,310
Even if you think you're right the
way you're doing it, it's 100% wrong.

247
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,430
This isn't the guys on a Nazi.
He's not someone who's,

248
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,000
even if he had said a racist thing
in the past, he's not the first.

249
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,190
Every fucking comedian said racist shit.

250
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,430
Let's dog had herself had
a bunch of racist shit.

251
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,760
They pulled off her Twitter page.
We don't hate her for that.

252
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,320
She had a bunch of shit
about white people,

253
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:56,050
just generalizing about
white people in in general.

254
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,580
If you ever did that about black people,

255
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,920
you would get blackballed from
Hollywood for life, of course.

256
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,210
But we will allow a certain amount of
stupid shit to come out of people's mouths

257
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,450
if we think that you're not a bad
person. Yeah. And if you disagree,

258
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:10,030
if you disagree with somebody the
way you beat it, I'll say it again.

259
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:14,260
The way you beat a bad idea is with a
better I don't do is you don't start this

260
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:18,520
fucking meme of punch Nazis.
Like everybody keeps saying punch Nazis.

261
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,240
Like don't say that. You're talking
punched on there though. Girls.

262
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,140
You see that girl getting
maced in the face?

263
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,210
She the up make bitcoin great again hat
and they came up and maced Mesa in the

264
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:34,270
face cause it looked like a make America
great again when she fucked up where it

265
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:35,200
doesn't matter man.

266
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:39,790
They know I'm in a fucked up Peter in
the head with a sign and another guy may

267
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:44,620
stir in the face they're ruthless to they
weren't ruthless with is our boy Jake

268
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:48,160
shields. He was at the protest
that I didn't get maced.

269
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,080
He's lucky he didn't get mason the faith
that they ran the tray. You need more.

270
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:55,550
You need more than mace to fight
Jake shields. No problem with Macy's.

271
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,280
You can't see. And if people just jump
on you and you can't just look, Jacob,

272
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,700
probably Jack, 90% of them that come
anywhere near them. If you can't,

273
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,160
if you can't see and someone hits you
over the back of the head, but something,

274
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:07,850
yeah, these fucking people are
doing exactly what they would hate.

275
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,390
And when I see people, like there's
people that been calling out for a COO,

276
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,510
they're calling out for a military coup.
They're calling out for them.

277
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,670
I've seen more than one person say this,

278
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,610
like the military needs to step in and
take our country back. And I'm like,

279
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,630
Holy Shit,

280
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,010
this is a Patrick Swayze movies from the
80s they're shaking exactly the way a

281
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:28,410
fascist would or a tire and would they
just have a different target. Right.

282
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,290
That's what I always say to people.

283
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,440
It's amazing how many people
think exactly like their enemy.

284
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,170
Exactly like their enemy.
I want to kill all of them or whatever.

285
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,710
And yet they're just, the only difference
is they have a different target.

286
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,520
It's crazy when you have a
legitimate contest, right?

287
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,130
You had a legitimate popularity contest
and one guy wins and you're not happy

288
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:50,180
that the guy wins.
So you want to start riots like you might,

289
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,280
you might have fucked up and not voted,

290
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,920
or you might not have done such a
good job of picking a candidate or you

291
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:59,330
might've had the wrong campaign, but
you have to, except when someone wins.

292
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,970
Otherwise, there's no fucking
point in having this contest.

293
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,450
We have this contest every four
years and if you don't accept to one,

294
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,900
as long as it's not this, the cheating,
whatever the cheating happened,

295
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,700
it probably happened on both sides.

296
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,440
Whatever legal shit they got away with
whatever shenanigans and the PR they did

297
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,650
to him with the whole, uh, grab 'em by
the pussy thing and all that. I mean,

298
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:22,520
there's, there's a tax left and right
on both sides. He came out ahead.

299
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,100
People aren't happy.
I understand that people are unhappy,

300
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:29,420
but you can't think that you can start a
riot now because you didn't want him to

301
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,950
be in there. They had a stupid fucking
contest. He won stupid fucking contest.

302
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,580
The problem is you're having a stupid
fucking contest to see who runs the world.

303
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,570
And also it's important to have a little
compassion for the other side in this

304
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,080
terms.

305
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,610
Like I constantly hear Trump voters being
characterized as homophobes rednecks,

306
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,670
dumb hillbillies and all that
stuff cause they're in there,

307
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,820
they're in the mix and they're there.
They're in the mix in every,

308
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,580
on both sides of the categories.
Here's the thing,

309
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,570
it might also be worth taking a little
bit of a human approach and looking at

310
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,260
Trump voters and a maybe a lot of Trump
voters may be a lot of Trump voters who

311
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,120
are good people didn't like
Trump that much either.

312
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,950
But they liked Hillary way less.

313
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,400
Or maybe Hillary's talking the way Obama
has been for the past eight years and

314
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,340
their lives haven't changed for sure
they were and they were desperate to see

315
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,330
anything else work.

316
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,050
Be a little compassionate Wa on why
a lot of people voted for Trump.

317
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,100
Because remember this country voted a
black president and a lot of those voters

318
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:26,780
were white, uh, two times in a row.
Well in order for him to have one,

319
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,460
you have to have some people that voted
for Obama last term that voted for Trump

320
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,200
this to correct.

321
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,420
There's a lot of people that thought
it would be a better thing to have him

322
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,720
other than her. Yeah. So there
were not no racist and not, oh,

323
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,290
you know homophobes they were. That's
why I was always really careful about,

324
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,580
I was always critical of Trump.

325
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:47,630
I was very careful not to be critical of
Trump voters because you know there are

326
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,220
a lot of, but you're not being honest
because are dummies in there too.

327
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,890
Just like there's dummies in the
Hillary camp percent there on this.

328
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:56,280
That's one of those stereotypes exist
when you talk about the either the latte

329
00:17:56,281 --> 00:18:00,240
sipping Hillary supporters who literally
know nothing about what the negative

330
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,670
things she's done. If you say
anything about, or you're a sexist,

331
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,520
I mean there's a lot of that going on too.
Those are real people.

332
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,910
Like the real ridiculous people on the
left and the right. They're all real,

333
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,790
you know? So the, the hillbillies at loved
Trump looped you'd I've seen it, man.

334
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,300
I saw a video where this guy got pulled
over with in an altercation with this

335
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:15,810
guy hitting.

336
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,590
This other guy had gotten some sort of
a traffic altercation and this guy comes

337
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:23,160
up to his window, he's calling them
the n word and he's saying, Trump, man,

338
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm with Trump,
Trump's president now.

339
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,880
And it's that type of person
of course that like there,

340
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,890
there are people like that that want to
let you know that this is their guy now

341
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,380
because they're white and that
this is like a racist thing.

342
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,880
You think that their races winning,

343
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,920
you think there was KKK people that
voted for Hillary? Like a special group?

344
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,610
K K K for Hillary.
How many KKK people are there?

345
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,360
Like let's be honest, how
many just straight up racists
and how many KKK people?

346
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,310
2000 official Dick's.

347
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,430
There are a lot of these $200 I'm
sorry, 200,000 I thought I saw. Okay,

348
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,090
that sounds, I wouldn't doubt
if those a million in the south.

349
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,690
I think there's definitely probably a
million racists fish clan members joining

350
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:13,680
an organization's on knowing like
how many UFC fans are. There's a lot,

351
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,060
but if you had a joint organization to
be a UFC fan, they'd be far less of us.

352
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,700
You mean by an a paper view
hood and go to a fucking flame.

353
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,290
You gotta go to a bonfire.

354
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,520
5,000 what more than 40
different clan groups exist?

355
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:29,280
Many having multiple chapters
or cleverness. That's cute.

356
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,790
Including a few that boast of
presence in a large number of states.

357
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,400
There are over a hundred different
Klan chapters around the country with a

358
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:40,050
combined strength and members
and associates that may
total around 5,000 Oh my

359
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,130
God, they're a little bigger than
10th planet. It's a little bigger

360
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,460
coupler that is so crazy.

361
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,200
I don't even know if they're
smart enough to be anything.

362
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:53,970
I think that they are a lot of them.

363
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:58,830
So people are just sort of guys who
want to be part of a group and you know,

364
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,540
they,
they've been told something,

365
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,810
they don't do any research and
they're just dicks when they are.

366
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:06,300
A lot of just shitheads want
to be part of a hate group.

367
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,200
A lot of the problem with black versus
white as the same problem as left versus

368
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:14,460
right. Black versus white left versus
right. Share that fucking team thing, man.

369
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,340
They share that team thing and white
people want to think that they're on one

370
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,520
team and black people want to think
that they're on another team and we fuck

371
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,460
each other up doing that.
It's so stupid. Human, human,

372
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,590
human beings are very tribal.
I mean,

373
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,290
anthropologist tell you that all the
time that human beings are tribal.

374
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,280
It's about time.
Like this generation has cut that shit.

375
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:41,870
Okay.
