1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,170
The joe rogan experience. Just
too many bongs out there. Right.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,390
People still rock the bong though.
Kind of respect that. You know,

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,620
it's like driving a manual car. I
never was a guy. It's too heavy, man.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,630
I got shit to do, man. I can't, oh,

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,550
the hitch just peeled down or the DAB
thing, the, I got friends in Colorado,

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,310
California now.
The first time I ever did with shit.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,740
This is pretty embarrassing story,
but my, uh, my buddy, you know,

8
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,040
they were all like California,
Colorado guys. They roll pretty hard.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,640
I'm not really a heavy smoker man,
to be honest on the road.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,880
It keeps me occupied from time to time.
But if I'm writing maybe, but at home,

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,710
you know, there's no need. So it,
the first time I did that shit,

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,730
I didn't know what it was.
You know,

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,080
I just pulled it like it was a
big old bong rip and they're like,

14
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,780
everybody's face was like, oh,
you know, it was like, I need,

15
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:55,560
you instantly know you just did something
you shouldn't have. Oh No. And uh,

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,710
I was like, ah, fuck man. So I sat
down and looked at a couple of minutes.

17
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,380
I just started getting really cold
and clammy and I was like, Yep,

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm going to Puke. So I went over
and was like, I'm fucked this guy.

19
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:07,920
So a puke rightness sink. And I
was like, dude, I got to go home.

20
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:12,580
I feel like dog shit now. And I'm
pretty sure I'm dying. So I had,

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,200
we lived in this apartment and I was like
went out the door and turn the corner

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,170
to go down the hallway to my,
and it was full on vertigo like the hall.

23
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,740
Every time I took a step,
the hall we got twice as long was like,

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,790
this is fucked up.

25
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,130
My wife was out of the country on
work at the time and I was like,

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,690
I remember I was sitting down in the
hallway just like trying to get my shit

27
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,300
together, man. Cause I was, I thought
I was having a fucking heart attack.

28
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:37,830
It was just like pat, like sweating.
And I remember this voice saying,

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,240
get up you stupid junkie. Fuck before
somebody comes out here and sees you,

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,471
you know,

31
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:47,460
sitting in the hallway like a dumb ass
and I managed to like pop out of it and

32
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,010
as soon as I got back to my
place and sit down on the couch,

33
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,660
everything was fine but it was
just so initial and the rush.

34
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:59,550
I was just like I don't, nobody
needs to be that stone that fast.

35
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm sorry,
what kind of milligrams he getting?

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,710
He think they just had like
that nail head torch thing,

37
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,780
which is $3,000 glass piece.
I was like,

38
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,300
you guys are taking this
shit way too seriously.

39
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,150
You can be cure and fucking
cancer somewhere right now.

40
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,130
I'm pretty sure if they put the effort,

41
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:22,131
energy and mind power and have you seen
the laser bongs now some I got a video

42
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:26,730
sitting in the dailies guy like
a pressure activated laser bong.

43
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,360
He like shoots a beam and ignites
the flower of Jesus like that.

44
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,360
Why is what the fuck's that guy?
Come on man.

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,040
The thing is they might be curing cancer
space colonies that somebody is going

46
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:40,080
to need to build. You know how many
cancer patients who are taking Dabs,

47
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,520
that might be the key out here. Probably
a lot. Get them on it. If I, if I had,

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,030
if I was dying of terminal cancer,
that's when you want to be that high.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,440
But at this thing, do
that again Jamie. Yeah.

50
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,420
Oh, that's it. Look at this thing. Of
course he had a fucking, it's the light.

51
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,940
This is fucking insane. Now. How do
you not go blind staring at this?

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,290
So he's heating it up. It's
cooking. It's a good question.

53
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,760
And then he takes a big
hit. Wow. Yeah. Anyway,

54
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,140
the, the, the medical strength
stuff. I totally understand.

55
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,610
And that seems like you go blind, like
you were standing at a welder. Yeah.

56
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,700
You know, do you have to wear a
welding mask? Some, some of my very,

57
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,930
very close to my life in my life recently
that went, was dealing with that,

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,810
uh, vertigo, no heavy medical
issues, health issues.

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,180
And we got him some edibles and uh,
he's like,

60
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,760
it's the only thing that made it okay.
That discomfort.

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,780
And so when I had to have a sinus
surgery and we talked about this,

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,410
when we played the grammys out here
last year, I was sick as fuck man.

63
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,260
Like I was getting all year for like
the last year and a half on road was

64
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,990
getting his horrible sinus
infections all the time and I will,

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,770
I just assumed it was allergies.
Tennessee's really bad about that.

66
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,420
And we'd go to Texas or Atlanta places
in in October when they always crazy

67
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,900
dogwoods are kicking off and I
would lose my voice. And you know,

68
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,130
by no fault of my own,

69
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,310
it became very frustrating from a touring
standpoint because I felt like I was

70
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:13,630
always sick. You know, it was, cause I
was so we flew out and did the Grammy's.

71
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,190
I was all plugged up, couldn't sing,
obviously biggest gig in my life,

72
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,030
kind of stressing it.

73
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:24,031
So the label guys sent me to this doctor
who looked up in there and realizing I

74
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:28,180
probably had my nose broken at some point
or just a really deviated septum when

75
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:32,350
I was younger. So I like a broken air
filter. But then when they did the scan,

76
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:37,351
like all of the cavities
were just completely caked
with residual bacteria and

77
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:40,210
infection. He's like, he's like,
if you get on a plane and fly home,

78
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:44,200
you'd probably going to get
meningitis. Wow. So we had
to play the grammys. He put,

79
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,780
he like nuked me with all this shit.
I don't even know what he did,

80
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:51,400
but it opened it up for like a day where
I was able to sing. So the next day,

81
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,490
the whole ban, they flew home. I just
stay out here for like nine days,

82
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:57,970
I think can go in every morning,
twice a day for Ivs,

83
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:00,280
for him to clean that shit
out so I could fly home.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,810
So then we came back and did the surgery
to correct it all and like went in

85
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:09,090
there and scraped and cleaned them all
out and shit. And uh, along with the,

86
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,860
the Septum,
they fixed the Septum.

87
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:13,300
So I haven't had a single
issue since all that happened.

88
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,670
I haven't been sick one time,
which is like changing my life.

89
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,420
But while I was recuperating,
long story short,

90
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:23,740
I didn't want to take any of the opioid
or the fucking pills that they gave me

91
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,040
to deal with the pain. I was like,
I'm not taking that shit. You know,

92
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,630
you're going to give me this
for four weeks. Like no, no way.

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,180
And so I just got a bunch of medical
strength edibles and my wife and the kids

94
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,410
had to come my way to rent a house.

95
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:39,370
We had it bad to be here to like recover
and Shit and man just laying in bed

96
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:43,480
listening to headphones stoned out of
my mind for like a week recovering.

97
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:48,481
And that's was kind of awesome because
you feel like when you're actually in

98
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:54,430
pain or when you need that type
of heavy type of alleviation,

99
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:58,340
what, what it is actually doing
and you in terms of relief.

100
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,550
And it gave me a whole new understanding
and respect for like the medical side

101
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,330
of that shit. Here we are
back on pot again. But um,

102
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,030
and then my buddy who dealt some pretty
serious cancer said it was literally the

103
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,420
only thing that made him feel better. So,
what did it do for you? Like see your,

104
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,080
your terrible agony. Yeah.
Noses off. Fucks all plugged up.

105
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:19,130
I had like all this galls and shit and
I could feel where they'd been in there

106
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:21,320
like behind right. Been scraping
and I could just, you know,

107
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,180
so to immediate like all that was gone
and he just sorta get really docile and

108
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:29,510
euphoric and rely on me
like it's so fucking high.

109
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,740
But like it didn't affect me in a, in
a overdose, he nauseous sort of way.

110
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,310
Like if you need too many edibles cause
your body actually needs it, needs it.

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,120
Yeah.

112
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,990
I laid there listening to headphones and
came up with the record I'm working on

113
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:45,410
now. That's great for me cause it was
like, that's what I want to do next,

114
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:49,970
you know? Um, yeah, it's uh,
it's a crazy ride, those edibles.

115
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,230
But if you can take that Rod,

116
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,160
you get something out of it and sometimes
people take the ride and the feeling

117
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,780
is just to, to self examine Satori
to Karen Paranoia and to sing.

118
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:04,040
Sometimes she just can't handle
it on a mass legality issue.

119
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,080
I mean if anything, I know it's
just going to fuck pot up, you know.

120
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,820
But from a medical stance I do,

121
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,470
I can't see any reason why we're
still doing talking about this. Yeah.

122
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,360
You know,
it doesn't make sense.

123
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:21,200
We were were being fucked over by giant
pharmaceutical companies that are making

124
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:25,940
billions of dollars and they would
realize how much more money they would be

125
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:29,900
losing every year.
If marijuana becomes fully legal,

126
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,430
they've already lost money for sure.

127
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,300
I guarantee you there's people that are
buying edible marijuana right now that

128
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,330
would have bought pain pills. They
know it. Also insurance companies,

129
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,720
you know on the job accidents.
Oh he had weed in his system.

130
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:46,310
We are not going to pay that. So I got my
life insurance now. I man this is crazy.

131
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,500
I did one of the first
interviews I ever did.

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,270
I think I talked about like the first
time I moved to Nashville and how like I

133
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:57,890
didn't really know anybody and it was
just like 2005 and it was a different town

134
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,720
then. So like a, basically I said,

135
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,530
I spent most of my time listening
and playing blue grass and drinking,

136
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,360
which is pretty much what everybody does.
The first year they moved to Nashville,

137
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,540
but then I said like after that,

138
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:15,010
while I moved out to Utah and got this
job and you got sober was working on with

139
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:15,111
them.

140
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:19,550
So somebody put on my Wikipedia page
that I've talked about my struggles with

141
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:22,400
alcohol and those people
read that shit man.

142
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,630
When I had to get a life insurance policy,
like they showed up,

143
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,240
they'd read all the interviews and like,
wow,

144
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:29,160
you've been really open about this
and that. And I was like, yeah.

145
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:32,750
And they're like,
so you do the whole medical test.

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,590
And of course that test positive for THC.
I'm on the road all the time.

147
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,270
And I was like, but I don't, I don't
smoke it. You know, I vape or edibles,

148
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,730
like I don't actually, I'm not a
smoker, I've never smoked cigarettes.

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,710
But they list you as a smoker.

150
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,510
And now I have like a criminally fucking
insane yearly life insurance policy

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,150
because of course like, you know,
they'd say, well a musician too,

152
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:55,980
this guy's going to die. We can't
fucking, I have the exact same thing.

153
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,940
Yeah. It's insane. Like I
don't know, I don't even smoke
but I'm listed as a smoker

154
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,090
earn.
It's like literally $9,000,

155
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,100
some crazy fucking premium just to make
sure my family's okay if I die on a

156
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:07,710
business trip.

157
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,770
Yeah. They um, they tested me and uh,

158
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:14,310
they said well you tested
positive for pot. I go, yeah,
that's cause I smoked pot.

159
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,540
You already know that.
Like what are you doing?

160
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:20,160
And trying to pretend I'm not really ever
died from smoking pot. No, it's stupid.

161
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,023
It's a dump thing.

162
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,490
Unless you think that I'm going to do
dumb shit cause I'm high all the time.

163
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,800
If that's what you think.
But that doesn't make any sense.

164
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:29,680
You need to test how healthy I am. Guess
what? I'm fucking healthy, right? Yeah.

165
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,760
I work out all the time. Super healthy,
eat good. I know what I'm doing.

166
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,870
Like you don't know what you're doing.

167
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,420
The problem is you don't know what you're
doing. You're the insurance guy, right?

168
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,520
You don't know what you're doing.
If you knew what you were doing,

169
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:40,890
you would look at each individual
and go at this guy's fine.

170
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,680
This guy's healthy guys
concentrating on his health.

171
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,440
This guy who doesn't smoke pot
and just eat sugar all day,

172
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:49,570
this guy is kind of fucked though. Oh,
that guy's a real fuck that guy's fucked.

173
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,320
This guy who's on Adderall because he's
got a prescription for add and you'd

174
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,480
have a problem with that. That guy's
fucked. All these other pieces.

175
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,060
There's a lot of people that are fucked
out there and these insurance companies

176
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:02,790
that think that a guy who smokes pot,
it's more likely to die.

177
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,070
There's no statistics to back that up.

178
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,670
There's no statistics that say that
people smoked pot or more likely to get

179
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:13,671
diseases or die of some sort of a fucking
debilitating syndrome that came about

180
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:17,220
because of overuse of THC.
It doesn't exist,

181
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,940
but they're not even testing you for
alcohol. Didn't even tell. They tell you,

182
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,150
ask you how much he drank, but not
testing you. If you can't test you,

183
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,290
it's on your system anymore.

184
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,660
It's really strange because uh,

185
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,450
in the navy and railroad
there were very stringent,

186
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,350
obviously highly stringent drug policies,
but you know,

187
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,570
drinking your ass off every
night is completely fine.
Completely fine. You know,

188
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:36,931
don't,

189
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:39,840
don't smoke a joint at 5:00 PM but kill
that six pack and come in here and build

190
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,200
this train the next
morning. You know, the,

191
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:43,830
those were always the
guys that made me nervous.

192
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,880
Not only that,
there's like a culture of honor behind it.

193
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,450
Like how much you can handle your drunk,
how many,

194
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:52,370
how much can you handle your drink.
And Bobby had 17 fucking beers.

195
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:56,360
A swear to God, Bro. You
would think he had zero. He's
right there. Good for Bobby.

196
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,170
Bobby's an animal. Yeah. Bobby
puts him down like there's like a,

197
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,150
a badge of honor that goes to that.

198
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,170
You Bobby's meanwhile he's taking
something that's completely hindering his

199
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:10,820
thought process is his stability.

200
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,900
His emotions are all out of whack.
Like he's fucking drunk as shit.

201
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,470
He doesn't know what he's
doing. He's, he's wrestling.

202
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,930
His brain is wrestling
with alcohol right now,

203
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,230
which is one of the weirdest
depressants, you know, awful.

204
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,670
One of the weirdest drugs.

205
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,950
It's a why you spend a lot of time
on the road traveling constantly.

206
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:35,050
One, you can't really drink,
especially at our age.

207
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,900
It just does things that when you look
at rooms full of people every night that

208
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:42,670
are Amazon's really drunk or like if
you work with people. Yeah, I don't,

209
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:43,690
I refuse to,
I don't,

210
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,810
I don't like really let people drink
and my band on the road and it's cost me

211
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,880
players cause they'd rather drink
the and be in your band and it just,

212
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,100
what'd you say? You don't,
can they have a glass

213
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,430
of wine with dinner? Well there's,
there's, yeah, well that's like, you know,

214
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,410
a beer or two to right.

215
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,530
There's not getting harmed as tennis
people that shouldn't drink rye.

216
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:03,360
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

217
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,530
Like the guy that has one drink and
instantly turns into a different mother

218
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:09,910
fucker all together and then by the time
he's on that third one and everybody's

219
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,390
like,
how much longer we got to do this?

220
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,400
There's a lot of those guys out there too.

221
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,240
A lot of people I didn't
know that existed until, uh,

222
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,420
the first time I met one one where the
switch goes off and they get generalize

223
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,880
Jekyll and Hyde drunk, they
get verbalize, verbalize. Wow.

224
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,930
That's a good way to put it out
there. And it gets weird. Well,

225
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,390
and they're moving around like
they're a normal, a woke person.

226
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:37,070
Okay.
