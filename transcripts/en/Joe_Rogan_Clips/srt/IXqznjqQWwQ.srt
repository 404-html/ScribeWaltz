1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,250
It seems early that early to
push a lawn mower. That's not,

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,640
I didn't have a lawnmower job when
I was 11. That seems early. No,

3
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:07,750
I don't think so. I think it's, you know,

4
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,090
you tell them where not to put their
feet in their hands and they're good.

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,620
Let the little fella have a
life kind of involved in sports.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,380
They will play, they will play a lot of
Lacrosse. You play a lot of basketball.

7
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,480
They shovel snow yet. Swim team.
Yeah. They shovel snow. Get out there.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,490
The 10 year old, the eight year
olds shovel snow during the winter,

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,880
six year olds like, yeah. Mugs.
He's not doing a lot. Got It.

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:31,930
Figured out a way out of this shit.
He's going to be management.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,220
I think that's what he's gonna do. He's
gonna be management somehow. Uh, but uh,

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,360
yeah. The, the, the work ethic. I think
you're absolutely right. I mean we, every,

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,420
every generation,
right?

14
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,960
Like my parents wanted it to be
easier for me and my brothers. Right.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,920
And their parents, I'm sure want it
to be easier for them, right. Nobody.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:50,801
And so you do that,

17
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:55,540
but eventually you get to diminishing
returns because it becomes so easy.

18
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,950
And you know,

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,870
the kids forget what it is like to
actually have to work for something to

20
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:04,310
compete and to compete. And
you know, we can't all, it's,

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,530
it's like that I saw some story,
not that I troll the social media,

22
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:12,800
but there was a story that popped
up that, uh, some community, uh,

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,470
they had a cheer squad tryout and one
of the girls didn't make it on cheer

24
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,990
squad.
I didn't even know what cheer squad,

25
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,290
I guess the cheerleaders and the mom was
upset and so she went and complained.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,300
And so the school decision was that
everybody who tried out gets to be on this

27
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:31,240
squad. Yeah. You can imagine
what that looks like.

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,243
That's a,

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,940
you got to teach kids the opposite.
That if you didn't do good enough,

30
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,720
you need to figure out what you did wrong
and go back and improve and work on it.

31
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,580
And then if you do get in next year,

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,480
you'll get an amazing feeling
of accomplishment rather
than an amazing feeling

33
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:53,790
of entitlement. Right. You, you belong
in everything you try out for. Well,

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,030
that's going to be a big fat wake up
call when you go out to compete in the

35
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:58,720
workforce.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,020
Right. Nobody's going to,
oh my God, nobody, nobody's
going to cut you any slack.

37
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:06,100
Theoretical fully. Yeah, but no, that's,
that's, that's right. The idea that,

38
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,280
you know, you got to
you, I mean it's like my,

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,320
my two older boys who are people thinking,
okay,

40
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,910
Mike's now talking about his kids
all the time. Uh, my two little boys,

41
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,960
I have gotten to the point now where the
sports thing and they play and if they

42
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:23,740
don't play well, they sit right.
Because earlier than that, you know,

43
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,540
everybody plays right. It's
equal playing time. You know,

44
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,820
that's what you typically go get the
coaches here and that's a good thing.

45
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,370
They little kids are learning how to play
the game of where to stand and all the

46
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:32,740
rest of it. So, but then
they get to a certain point,

47
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,630
it becomes merit based
or it should anyway,

48
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,430
which is how it works in Idaho basically,

49
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:39,550
at least with the teams that were we
were associated with, is that if you're,

50
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:42,460
if you don't play that well then
maybe you don't make the team.

51
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,440
And if you made the team and you're not
playing as well as the other kids and

52
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:47,590
you're sitting on the bench.
And so you know, my kids,

53
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,500
you don't know when it first started
happening, you know, they were just,

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,770
they were complaining, you
know, like, you know, screw it,

55
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:55,750
I'm not getting any playing time.
And I'm thinking, well, okay,

56
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:58,390
what's the next part of that thought
process that you need to work your way

57
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,610
through?
If you're not getting enough playing time,

58
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:05,380
it's because you're not what planning
as well as you should be compared to the

59
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,360
other kids. Therefore,
what do you need to do?

60
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,190
So you have to walk them
through this process.

61
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,130
And that's okay because kids don't
know this stuff inherently. Maybe.

62
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,960
And so you teach them that, but you
don't teach them that while you're,

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,390
you're right. Why don't you
try a different sport, or
you know, or you're right,

64
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,920
we should talk to the
coach about your parents.

65
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,740
They're making it too difficult for the
children and they're not having a good

66
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:29,180
time. And it should be about companionship
and it shouldn't be about competition.

67
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,710
Well, you're setting your kid up for
failure because it can be about both.

68
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:38,000
It can be about companionship, but also
about competition and, right. Oops. Look,

69
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,290
the world's competition, it's filled with
it. If you're not competing, if you're,

70
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,530
if you just decide you don't want to
have anything to do with competition,

71
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:49,910
that's your choice. But if you engage in
something that does require competition,

72
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:52,070
you want special access.
Right?

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,230
Right, right. It does. Yeah. If you
don't, if you're not that nature,

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,800
if you don't have that competitive
side of you and okay, fine,

75
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,030
but then don't go through the
rest of the life thinking what?

76
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,970
Just because life is a competition,
which you know,

77
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,370
may upset you when you find that out,

78
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,730
that you don't get special dispensation
just because you're not a competitive

79
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:12,180
person. It does it. Yeah. So I agree
with it. Participation Trophies,

80
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,620
all the nonsense that's going on today.
Well, I was, I was, uh, I was walking,

81
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:20,250
one of my boys, the oldest went off the
off the lacrosse field not too long ago.

82
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,030
And he said, how'd I do? And I said, well,

83
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,350
you could've done better. You could have
played harder. He just wasn't into it.

84
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,580
Right.
He was tired or whatever.

85
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,580
So he kind of looked at me and I didn't
realize I was walking and there were

86
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:36,030
some parents around me.
And as we were walking across the field,

87
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:39,870
and so he kind of looks at me and I
knew what he was thinking, which is Dan,

88
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,390
that's not right. And so
I looked at her, I said,

89
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:45,270
do you want me to be honest with you and
you want me to just stand here and blow

90
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,260
smoke up your ass?

91
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,340
And I found out afterwards that a couple
of parents who are upset about the fact

92
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:53,040
that I would say that, but he knew
exactly what I meant. And he said,

93
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,620
now you should be
honest. And I said, well,

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,110
the parents were upset at you for
being honest. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And,

95
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:02,880
and you know, it'd be fair Muggsy the
youngest one got called in for, uh, uh,

96
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,570
I tell you this, he got caught if
using the word Douche bag one time,

97
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:07,800
but a funnier,

98
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,970
funnier one was when he and two of
his buddies who shall not be named,

99
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,430
who were out in the playground not too
long ago and there was sitting down in,

100
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,580
they're playing some game, right?
It was recess. And all the kids,

101
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:19,230
all the different grades are
out there running around.

102
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,370
And everybody knows my little kid,
you know,

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,720
Mugsy he's like the mayor of
the town. He's, he's just a
jolly happy guy. He's got,

104
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,210
he's got us, he's going to be the guy
that takes 10 years to get out of college.

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,840
Right? And so he, he and his two
little buddies are sitting there,

106
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,910
they're playing some game where they
got to count with their fingers.

107
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,870
So at one point, Jack has the number
one and he puts up a finger, right?

108
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,340
And one of the other kids starts laughing
and cause he's got an older brother

109
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,530
who told them what it means.
So he tells me what he means.

110
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:46,470
So they start shouting this
out, right? And this word,

111
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,020
they start shouting and well a couple of
the older kids, well by any here, here,

112
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,240
these three kids know six year olds
yelling and laughing up. Roy is like,

113
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:56,070
cause I think it's the funniest
stuck in thing they've ever heard.

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,860
And so they get called into the principal.
Well what happens next?

115
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,510
I have to find out about this,
right?

116
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,860
So now they notify the parents and know
in middle of the principal's laughing

117
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,150
when they,
when they're telling the story.

118
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,120
But now I have to have a conversation
with Mugsy when, when I come home.

119
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,090
So I come home and I said, monkey,
anything happened today? And he goes, Nah,

120
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,730
nothing happened. And you walked right
by me. And I said, wait, wait, wait,

121
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:20,540
come back here. I said, did you get called
into the principal's? He goes, oh yeah.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,430
He said, we were, let me see.

123
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,340
We were playing on the
playground and I went like this.

124
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,780
And you know what this means? I said, no,

125
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,090
I don't need to know.
And I look out of the corner of my eye,

126
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,320
see his two older brothers,

127
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,140
like around the corner just waiting
because they know he's gonna get his ass

128
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,420
kicked right for, for this. And they're
just like, they can't wait. And so I said,

129
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:43,790
no, I don't need to know what it is.
Just don't do it again. Whatever you do,

130
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,510
don't do it again. And he goes, no, no,
no, no. You got to know what this means.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,910
He's really intent on it. And so I said,
and he's two other boys skirts. I go,

132
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,760
they're like, oh, he's going to get
so much it. And I said, all right,

133
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:59,210
what does it mean? And I had no
idea what he was going to say,

134
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,540
but what he did say was mother Fucker,

135
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,840
and that's what they were
yelling on the playground.

136
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,720
All three of them at
the top of their lungs,

137
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:12,630
Gel mother fuckers six that's
six years old. That's a door.

138
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,990
And I started laughing and the
two other boys walked away,

139
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:18,230
disgusted that I was laughing.
And that's the end of my story.

140
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,250
So they're great kids.
So how do you take that gene?

141
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,770
You put it back in the
bottle, do you know? You know,

142
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,010
you just say don't use it all started
screaming motherfucker and there,

143
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,580
there's not much you can do. Throwing
their finger up in there. It's hard to do.

144
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:37,690
I mean, I find myself having to constantly
catch myself. I'll, I'll say, you know,

145
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,480
things like, hey, you'll quit jackass
and around, and then I'll think, okay,

146
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:45,530
I probably shouldn't say that, but
that's fun. I can't get, you know,

147
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,300
my dad was the greatest guy I've ever
known in my life and he swore and I,

148
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,400
it didn't scare me in any way.
I don't have a problem with it.

149
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:57,170
It's part of what I do for a living.
But when I was a wa I was, we were in,

150
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,340
we were skiing with my, uh, youngest
daughter who was three and a,

151
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:06,341
we're packing up the stuff and she forgot
to pack her helmet and a helmet wasn't

152
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,230
packed in the thing.
And she looks down at her luggage.

153
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,680
She looks down at the helm and she goes,
Oh shit,

154
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,840
this is something adorable.
But she was three at the time,

155
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:22,100
about a three year old sage. Let's see
if she could get together with Mugsy.

156
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,670
Then she could have said Shit and you
could have said what happened and she

157
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,750
could said,
I forgot my mother fucking helmet.

158
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,560
Then she's got a completely sentenced.
I mean,

159
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,460
there's something really cute about
kid's swearing. It's just adorable.

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,180
We try to tell them, you
know, don't, don't, yeah, we
try to teach him the basics.

161
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:44,300
Don't swear. If you can have,
the problem is they're going to,

162
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,190
it seems so attractive.

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,040
You know what to do because
they're not supposed to do it.

164
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,720
And when no one's around,
like, you know what I heard,

165
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,350
I remember I found a new word starts with
a C. Yeah. Oh, you know they're doing it.

166
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,700
Yeah. What's that one?
Oh God, yeah. Well, we,

167
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,890
we learned everything we learned
from older brothers. Right?

168
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:06,150
Or from friends who had older
brothers, but it was, it
was a slower process, right.

169
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
Because we didn't have the internet
and all that crap. Right. And,

170
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,260
and so I think what you,
you learned a lot. It took a
little bit longer. You know,

171
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,141
to learn,
like,

172
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,800
I don't think I've really
rolled out douchebag till I
was probably 12, maybe 13.

173
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,650
Well, we were talking yesterday about, um,

174
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,710
access to the Internet where kids see so
much more and hear so much more today.

175
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,230
Like there especially like violent images
and their access to terrible things.

176
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:34,740
And there's just so much that if you
leave a kid alone with a computer or a

177
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,670
phone that's online, oh yeah. Yeah.

178
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,110
They're just going to find out everything
about the world way before the little

179
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:42,720
brains are ready. No, you can't do
it. You've got it. You've gotta be,

180
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,370
you gotta lock it down, right. I mean,

181
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,320
it's a good thing they got
to learn the technology,

182
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:50,010
unlike what I apparently
would, I apparently did.
I'm gonna leave my, my, uh,

183
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,520
my watch here for you since I don't
know how to use it, but a year,

184
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,930
are you going to let them get online?
