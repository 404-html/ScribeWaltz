1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
So we should talk about this,
uh,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,400
the Jack podcast cause
everybody got so upset about it.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,560
And let's clear up a few things.
First of all,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,380
the guy seems to be willing
to talk about anything.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,430
It's not that I didn't want to talk to
him about those things is just he was

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,340
being, uh, I wouldn't say he's evasive,

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,430
but he's basically just saying what
he knew based on the company policy.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,230
I didn't know what else more to ask him.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,560
And people felt like I didn't press him
hard enough and he to his credit reached

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:35,700
out to me and said that he would offer
to do another one to ask more questions.

11
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,670
That's cool. And I said, that
would be awesome. So I said, well,

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,620
this is the thing that people
seem to be upset about.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,570
They seem to be upset about very
specific cases where people showed,

14
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,640
um, like if, if people were right
wing and they were posting things,

15
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,510
they were banned.

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,690
Whereas people who are left wing or maybe
a people of different races or allowed

17
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:02,271
to post racist things or more offensive
things and even docs people and didn't

18
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:06,210
suffer any consequences for it.
This is the argument.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,280
My problem is I don't spend enough
time reading this stuff. I don't know.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,420
Like this is like when people get banned,
like Anthony Cuny is a friend of mine.

21
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,880
I don't really know why he got banned.
I don't know what happened.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,010
There was that incident with that,

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,220
that woman that punched him
and he wound up getting fired.

24
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,550
He was drunk and he said a bunch
of really stupid shit and and,

25
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,200
and Twitter and then
later apologize for it.

26
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:32,010
But I don't know if that's what
got him fired. Kicked off Twitter.

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,053
But he's my friend.

28
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,180
So what I'm saying is all these
other guys that have problems,

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,190
I don't know what the fuck happened, man.
I'm busy. I really don't. I don't know.

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,320
I don't even know what
got Alex Jones kicked off,

31
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:48,240
which is why I asked him because that
was one of the last platforms for Alex

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,230
Jones was Twitter. But something got
him kicked off their take on it was it,

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,710
they never kicked him off before
because he didn't violate their terms of

34
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:59,730
service. And another thing that's
very encouraging that Jack said,

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,330
and I know it's, it's fun to get mad
at things. It's fun to get mad at him.

36
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,480
It's fun to get mad at me for it. I get
it. I'd probably do the exact same thing.

37
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,620
I totally understand it,

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,370
but one of the things that he said was
that he believes that the ability to

39
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:19,380
communicate on the Internet through
Twitter or through these platforms is a

40
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:22,440
basic human right. That's
how he looked. Like I said,

41
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:27,330
do you think of it like a network
like NBC, like if you're an NBC,

42
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:31,530
they can decide what's on and what's not
on, or do you look at it like a utility?

43
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,040
And he specifically said that
he looked at it more like that,

44
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,670
that he thought it was a basic right.
That's very encouraging.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He also said that he would
bring on whoever it is in
his team that's responsible

46
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:44,940
for these things.

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,450
So we could hear from the actual person
who decides who's getting banned and why

48
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,800
they're getting banned and what,
what is,

49
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,070
what's the decision making
behind all of these things?

50
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,950
We can go over all of them. Um, I didn't,

51
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,040
the podcast would create
such a controversy,

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,310
but that's probably poor prior planning
on my part because my thought about it

53
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:12,550
was, hey, I want to say like, it's
fucking crazy to be running Twitter.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,270
Like it's crazy that this thing exists.
The president uses a platform.

55
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:20,200
I want to talk about the dude who created
this and what does this like to have

56
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,300
this thing evolve to
become what it's become.

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,960
Because it didn't start out that way.
It started out like fun shit like, uh,

58
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,140
at Brian red bands going to the movies,
you know what I mean?

59
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,520
Like that's what people used it for.

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,640
And then along the way became this
global method of distributing information

61
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,380
where people use it in warzones man.
They use it to,

62
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,680
to tell people where attacks are.
These are for all kinds of crazy shit.

63
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,280
It's like a,
it's a really powerful but strange medium.

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,880
I didn't think about getting into the
weeds with all the very specific people

65
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,740
that got banned. I just wanted to
find out why they banned people.

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,850
That was my take on it.

67
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,710
I know there's a lot of conservative
voices that have never been banned.

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,780
I don't think Steven
Crowder has been banned.

69
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,180
I don't think Cernovich has
been banned as he'd been banned.

70
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,860
There's a bunch that have not been banned.
Right.

71
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,890
So it's not like they banned all
right wing voices. So what is it?

72
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,110
I don't know what it is.
What he said.

73
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:18,610
People reporting the tweet and then
somebody's looking at it going,

74
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:23,611
well this does violate our policy and
maybe you know all these people that that

75
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:26,860
got banned thigh lated the
policies somehow, you know,

76
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:30,130
it's probably as simple and cut
clean is that, you know, it's,

77
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,450
it's not that simple.
Right?

78
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,230
Because they make their own policies
and it's also not that simple.

79
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,260
If people are allowed to say similar
things that are very racist in an in vast

80
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,270
generalizations about white people,

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,900
which seems to have been the case and
at least a few instances where people

82
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,560
reported that people said fucked
up things about white people,

83
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,550
but there was no repercussions.
And you know,

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,580
that's where the argument becomes these
people are more oppressed and so the

85
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,890
white people were thought
of as the oppressor.

86
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,840
So you have this white privilege thing
that people like to use now as a reason

87
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:15,220
to, to decide to like silent someone like
check your white privilege. That's a,

88
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,110
that's an interesting thing
that's happening. So if,

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,660
if there's this genuine movement where
people think that it's okay to say things

90
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:27,610
about one race, whether you
like it or not, that's racism.

91
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,950
And if you're allowing that from any one
side and not allowing it from another

92
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,010
side, it seems hypocritical.
Look, it's very distasteful.

93
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:40,630
The idea of racism against black people
in this country is very distasteful to

94
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,120
everybody. Almost everybody
who's not a racist, right?

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,640
Because of the history of this country,
because of slavery,

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,250
because of all these things.
It's a different connotation,

97
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,820
but if you just allow people to
say terrible things about any race,

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,040
it's racism. You are allowing, uh,

99
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,580
like a predetermined
attitude about a race.

100
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,370
Some people have done this, they have
made generalizations, generalizations,

101
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,190
racist statements about white people.

102
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,220
The really weird thing that people were
thrown around these days is that you

103
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:21,221
can't be racist against white people
because racism is about power and

104
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,200
influence.
It's about using your,

105
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,810
you're in the booth at that
black people are not powerful.

106
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,180
The white people power from the white
people, the ones who are oppressed,

107
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,860
so it's impossible to be racist against
him. That sounds like horseshit to me.

108
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,020
I'm not buying that.
That doesn't make any sense.

109
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,050
It's not beneficial to
anybody to generalize.

110
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,280
This is what we got to get in our head.

111
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,680
It doesn't matter if you're black
or if you're white or if you're,

112
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,400
whatever the fuck you are.
It is not beneficial to generalize,

113
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:51,401
to take a person out of the group that
we think of as just human individuals

114
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,420
that you, you have to be
an individual. I mean it.

115
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,910
I acknowledged the fact
that people look different.

116
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,630
They have different heritages, they
have heritage's, they have different,

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,660
different ancestry,
they have different occupation.

118
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:07,580
There's different parts of the world.
There's all these differences,

119
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,990
but at the end of the day,

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,080
the only way we're all going to get true
equality and true kinship and comradery

121
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,820
as human beings is if we recognize
we're just all a human being. That's it.

122
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,320
There are very big differences in the
way we look and the the things we like.

123
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,790
That's cool,
but as soon as you say,

124
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
you can say shitty things about
white people or white men,

125
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,060
that leaves everybody who doesn't fit
that description guilty in this weird way

126
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:42,020
or presumed guilty because of a
racist statement. That's all it is.

127
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,340
It's not good for anybody.

128
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,370
I get it that it's different than
racism against black people in America.

129
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,970
A country that was built essentially
in a lot of ways by slavery.

130
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,780
There's a war for slavery in this country
and that is a crazy reality that it's

131
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,730
not your responsibility. It's not
mine. I didn't do it. You didn't do it,

132
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,950
but it's real.
Therefore,

133
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,180
as a person who is aware of his history,
the history of this country,

134
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,120
racism against white
people seems different,

135
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,100
but it still sucks to be racist against
racist against black people rather seems

136
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,590
different. But it still sucks to
be racist against white people.

137
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,500
Sucks to be racist against Puerto Ricans.
It's not good.

138
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,840
It's not good for anybody.
It's,

139
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,460
that's what we have to understand
about this social media thing.

140
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,310
What actually did happen
and what is happening,

141
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:35,030
why is it happening and if it's just
some social justice warrior ethic that

142
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,490
you're not debating,
it doesn't seem fair.

143
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,180
It seems like there should
be a conversation about
this and I bet they're super

144
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:42,014
reasonable,

145
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,270
really intelligent people and
it's possible they can come to a,

146
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,690
a good place that we can all
agree to that is possible.

147
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,920
I'm not a cynical person, I'm sorry.
I know a lot of young folk him,

148
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,180
they just want those to just want,
guess what? They already have it.

149
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,160
They have more money than
they could ever spend.

150
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,520
And my dealings with Jack as a person,

151
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,910
he seems like a very nice guy
and a very smart guy. And,

152
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,800
and a very empathetic guy.
I just think he's in a crazy,

153
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,850
unmanageable situation to be
running something like Twitter.

154
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,291
Yeah.

155
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,460
And there's probably people that did
something that they should have done in

156
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:24,390
terms of silencing people moving
things around. It's probably happened.

157
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,250
It's a weird thing when people have
influence over people and there's,

158
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,670
there have been videos had been proven.

159
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,960
We're executives from a bunch of different
social media corporations have talked

160
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:38,580
about how to silence certain voices,
how to push down certain voices.

161
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,800
Um, this is something that needs to
be discussed. Like is this, uh, uh,

162
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,200
as a policy as a whole, is
it, you know, because you,

163
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,230
you think you're pushing
the right message.

164
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,050
Like as soon as someone thinks
they're pushing the right message,

165
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,810
but they don't have it, there's
no debate about that, right?

166
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,750
They just decide our way's the right way
and they're pushing this and there's a

167
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:05,750
radical opposition to that message
from half the country like that.

168
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,170
Like, but you'd be like, no, no, no, no.

169
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,660
But this is the one that's
in control of the narrative.

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,030
This is the one that's in
control of social media.

171
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:17,031
It's this far left leaning ideology
and the other part gets pushed aside.

172
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,310
That's a very bad situation for all of
us because there has to be conversation.

173
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,840
There has to be debate
because if there's not,

174
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,960
it's just shores up the differences
between two people and they fucking hate

175
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,580
each other even more. I did not take
that into account and I fucked up.

176
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,940
That's my mistake. That is my
mistake when I made that podcast,

177
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,900
but it didn't take it easy on him because
I didn't want to discuss those issues.

178
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,050
I just didn't think
enough of it in advance.

179
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,750
I'm not as involved in
it as other people are.

180
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,820
I'm aware that there's censorship
and social media. I'm aware my,

181
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,510
my ideas going into that conversation
were more about how insane this method is

182
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,740
for distributing information for the
people that have been banned and for the

183
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,540
people that were fans of
the people that are banned.

184
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,190
I can understand whether
it be upset at me.

185
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,940
It has nothing to do with any preconceived
notions that I had is just how the

186
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:15,810
conversation took place. It's all it
is. And if you felt left down by that,

187
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:17,910
you didn't feel like it
was an is extensive enough.

188
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm more than willing to do it and go
further into it and we're going to,

189
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,920
and Jack offered it and he's going to
bring someone else who's gonna explain

190
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:29,340
things to us. I think this would
be very beneficial for everybody.

191
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,910
I also think that there should
be a road to redemption.

192
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,940
I think if you've got something that's
important as Twitter or Facebook or

193
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:43,050
Instagram, if you're not stealing
someone's stuff, like, you know,

194
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,790
using copyrighted music or something on
an Instagram page where you get banned

195
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,590
over and over again for doing it,
but you keep doing it.

196
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,070
If it's not something like that, if it's,
if it's, uh, an ideological difference,

197
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:58,330
if you, maybe you crossed a line
that they decided was a line,

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,190
it should be able to work your way back.
You see the shoe,

199
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,570
there should be a way where
you can sign up again.

200
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,620
Me and I get a new email address.
I don't mean that,

201
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,500
I mean be the same person you should be.

202
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,580
You should be able to be the same person.
There should be a way what?

203
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,030
There should be different levels.
Definitely everybody. People fuck up, man.

204
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:19,930
They they fuck up and they make
mistakes, right? And people also grow.

205
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,990
I mean there's this a guy that
was on Sam Harris' podcast, um,

206
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,950
Christian peak.
Eleni I think is his name.

207
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,960
He was a fucking white supremacist to
full on white supremacist and now he is

208
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:33,920
the exact opposite.
He's,

209
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:38,110
he's like this very progressive
guy who gives speeches on the,

210
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,250
the dangers of racism and that and the
ideology, how it caught up with him.

211
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,730
Now if he got band when he was a young
man and making terrible decisions and

212
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:51,820
then became a better person,
shouldn't we give it a guy like that?

213
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,460
A chance to get back in a platform,
right?

214
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:56,860
And without making a
whole new screen name,

215
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,590
like maybe it would be,

216
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,190
and I don't think there's anything
wrong with the anonymous model.

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,650
There's some things that are
really good about it, right?

218
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,660
Like people like Jack
even talked about this,

219
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,900
that people can report news stuff and
not worry about fear of retribution that

220
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,770
they can,
you know,

221
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:18,520
they can whistle blow and not worry about
fear of retribution if someone's life

222
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,001
is on the line,

223
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,730
but they're trying to provide a service
to the general public or they're trying

224
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:26,230
to give people information that maybe
might even save lives but could put them

225
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:30,250
at risk, especially in like third
world countries or war torn countries.

226
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,950
That could be a huge problem if you
have to post, you know, Brian Red Band,

227
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,240
if there's the only way you
can get this information out,

228
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,140
you have to use your whole name.

229
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,970
But it probably be better
off for everybody if people
had a way of communicating

230
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,190
with each other.
Like it's just person to person.

231
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,380
And I think the real problem
is when people try to
engineer these conversations,

232
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,550
and this is another
conversation about youtube.

233
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,700
People have said that we're
deleting comments on Youtube.

234
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:07,210
We're not deleting anything.
We haven't deleted any comments.

235
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,230
I don't know how it works. I don't read
them. I'm sure people say mean things.

236
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,680
Have a good time. The thumbs
up, thumbs down thing, look,

237
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,600
we don't have to have that on there.

238
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:19,630
You don't have to have comments on their
youtube gives you the option to have

239
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:22,660
comments on and to have the thumbs up,
thumbs down. I'm not taking those off.

240
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,900
Have a good time with it,
but we're not fucking with that.

241
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,880
There's something that they're
doing that's not, it's not,

242
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,030
I post at three 41 and Jamie posts it
three 42 and this is the line of the

243
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:41,860
comments. It's not like that. They've
got their own way of doing it.

244
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,770
The question is why does youtube
do it? What's there? What?

245
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,080
What are they trying to do is are
they trying to block out spam?

246
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,010
Are they trying to block out hate speech?

247
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,810
I tr are they trying to
engineer conversation, comment,

248
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,060
order comments on no comments disappear.
They go away.

249
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,980
A lot of times it's automatic.

250
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:04,970
If somebody flags a comment that will
just take the comment away until it's like

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,090
looked over upon only one person.
Yeah.

252
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,730
On I think on youtube that
that happens quite often.

253
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,680
Probably be as little as
one or two people. Yeah.

254
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,300
So that is probably what's happening to
all you folks that think your comments

255
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:20,660
are getting deleted. No one is
deleting shit. Yeah. Look, I'm,

256
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,080
I'm not attached to what I do in the
sense that I'm unwilling to look at what I

257
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,110
do wrong. I tried to look at everything
that I do wrong, including this.

258
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,370
So if you were upset at this podcast
because you thought somehow or another I

259
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,710
sold out cause I didn't
ask him any more questions.

260
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,090
I just asked him the questions I wanted
to ask. I understand you have more costs,

261
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,180
more questions. And I do too.
I have more questions too,

262
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,340
especially upon seeing people's
reaction to it and upon,

263
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,150
you know, making myself pay more attention
to all these various stories. Uh,

264
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,160
Matt sent us a list of them.
Some of them are really fucking crazy.

265
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,730
There's some crazy things people have
said and not gotten in trouble for.

266
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,090
Whereas other people said things that
really weren't that bad and got in trouble

267
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:08,810
for it. Why is that? That's a
good question to ask. So we'll,

268
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,540
we'll concentrate on that.
We're just going to work out a date.

269
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,280
So my humblest apologies to all of you.
Don't not trying to let anybody down.

270
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,270
I always tried to do my best.
That's it. And, and also,

271
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,020
here's another clear one. No one
tells me what to do. There's no one,

272
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,010
there's no secret person behind the
scenes. If I fuck up, it's because of me.

273
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,670
It's my fuck up. I should have prepared
more. I should have thought about it more,

274
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,300
but I didn't realize like how upset
people would be. I think you did a great,

275
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,910
I thought it was a great interview
and I didn't even think of that.

276
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:41,420
I thought you kind of touched on it a
little when you were talking about Alex

277
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,000
Jones and I think that was like, okay,
you know, this is what happens. Well,

278
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:47,400
it's a very specific group of people
that are upset. Right wing guys, right?

279
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,460
There's a lot of American flags, a lot
of pepe the frog. It's all right people.

280
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Which luck man easily could've been
me at many points of my life easily.

281
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,930
Especially being a troll online, you know,
if you're working in some fucking job.

282
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:07,130
And you're making pepe the frog memes
and you're fucking with people. I get it.

283
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,480
I get it. It's one of the things I
like about the Internet. Like I don't,

284
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,880
I don't want to be
comfortable. I'm like, I don't,

285
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,690
I don't want to be comfortable
all the time. I want, I
want a little bit of chaos.

286
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,810
I like the fact that just people like,
they're like that fucking,

287
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,510
I was upset that that radio,
that podcast,

288
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:26,780
they took it down where they were fucking
with Shiloh laboo with those guys from

289
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:31,190
four Chan. And the way they took it down
was they contacted radio lab and said,

290
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:35,150
those guys are white supremacists and they
support white supremacy. You know, and,

291
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,900
and you just, you know, you made
these people that are awful,

292
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:42,830
terrible people that write terrible
things. You, you, you gave them props.

293
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,590
But the thing about something
like four Chan is no,

294
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:47,960
you might read some terrible things,

295
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,120
but you've got to realize you're also
reading terrible things from anonymous

296
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:53,430
people that are working at
their jobs most of the time.

297
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,150
And they're trying to fuck with people's
head and the trying to get people upset.

298
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,420
They're there. They're having a
good time fucking with people.

299
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,590
If you want to take them as that,
that's like them. You like giving,

300
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,310
giving a talk to a dear friend or them
giving an affidavit in court. Well,

301
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:09,390
you're missing the whole thing.

302
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,180
It's entertainment like half of the
whole reason why they're doing it as

303
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:12,900
entertainment.

304
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,900
They didn't go steal Shiela booze flag
and go and go right to the camera.

305
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,950
Go Fuck Shiela Boob by using coordinates
from photographs of the sky where they

306
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:27,660
figured out where the fucking with the
constellations lie and then drove around

307
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:32,040
honking their horn so that they could
locate where it was by using the Webcam

308
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,850
and listening to how close they got to it.
I mean it's fucking genius shit.

309
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,690
And he got taken down just by this
accusation of them being racist.

310
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:43,560
But the thing about a forum like
four Chan or Reddit or anything,

311
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,860
you have so many fucking people.

312
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,900
You have thousands and thousands
and thousands of people.

313
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,820
If you just have 10 cunts
posting jokes about black people,

314
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,960
that's all you need to ruin the
reputation of thousands of people.

315
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:05,910
So for someone to say that everybody
that was like Fuck Sheil Abou is some

316
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:10,260
racist and the white supremacists, that's
a cheap way out. That's a cheap way out.

317
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,310
I bet. More likely it's some duties board
and he sitting in front of his fucking

318
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:17,970
computer and he works all day
and this is where he escapes.

319
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,670
He escapes and types and writes things.

320
00:19:20,671 --> 00:19:24,060
Then check some later and then it goes
back to it and type thing checks and it

321
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:27,990
keeps him sane and does
stupid fucking cubicle.

322
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,730
That's a lot of the people.

323
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,990
So they pulled that whole amazing
podcast down because of that.

324
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,490
Look what he would, the Shiela booth thing
was ridiculous. He will not divide us.

325
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,230
Come on, stop. Stop. We get
a chance that everywhere.

326
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,640
It's funny what they did. They mock
something. That's their way of mocking it.

327
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,030
Nobody got hurt. They made it out
like it was as like awful crime.

328
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,050
They committed on this,

329
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,150
this amazing person who's just trying
to change the world. No, no, they,

330
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:59,160
they prank Chai laboo and they said,

331
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,190
Fuck Shaya Laboo is that
the buff?

332
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,800
Whatever it is. Shilo Lebouf at
that. Sure. He's a nice guy too.

333
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,780
He probably did something silly. It's
a little silly. He will not divide us.

334
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,500
What they did was funny. It's
a funny reaction. I liked that.

335
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,210
I liked that this is is
important part of this thing.

336
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,570
If it wasn't for people like that,
there would be no podcast.

337
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,050
Now the like to dislike ratio that you
see on youtube videos is fascinating,

338
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:34,830
right? Because it's weaponized and they're
thinking about trying to ban that now

339
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,350
because so many people use
it to fuck with people.

340
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,460
I hate to say this about you folks,
but every time we have a check on here,

341
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:44,490
they get fucking torture.
The like to dislike, right?

342
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:48,550
Like it's ruthless except Rhonda, Patrick,
Cep, Rhonda, Patrick. But it's just a,

343
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:52,030
it's weaponized. It's the, they're
just going to dislike it because,

344
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,980
cause it's fun. It's fun. It's also fun
to throw a rock at a window. It's fun.

345
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,361
Yeah.
I mean,

346
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,940
and some of them probably didn't even
wash the podcasts like thumbs down.

347
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,740
It gives them a low disliking.

348
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,260
It gives a little bit of power
in the algorithm of d ranking.

349
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,860
It affected something.
And then people who liked it,

350
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,570
there's probably a lot of them
that didn't even watch it.

351
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,870
It's a button you can press. People
are weird, you know, but it's clearly,

352
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:17,500
it shows by the amount of dislike the
people moved on it and they were upset

353
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:22,090
about it. Um, so that's basically it.
