1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,870
Because if I was working for a more
sensitive organization, you know,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:06,920
obviously it's a fucking
cage fighting promotion.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,070
It's like how sensitive can you get? But
with some social issues, you know this,

4
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:14,850
like if I was working for the NBA,
I probably been fired a decade ago.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:20,400
Yeah. These are the NMA is definitely
a, or the UFC has definitely a,

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,230
an animal in itself.
How did,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,500
how did you get into that position?

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,510
Did you know the Dana White
and you started for you,

9
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:34,180
I, I always wanted to ask you
this and that at the comedy store,

10
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,930
how did you become kind of the voice of,
of the UFC?

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,450
Well, I started a, in 1997, I
was the post fight interviewer.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,553
That was,
uh,

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,400
it was just a position that was available
in the UFC was very small back then.

14
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:51,000
Very few people knew what it was.
It was off a cable.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,840
You couldn't get it on cable. You
could only get it on satellite. And uh,

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,090
they needed someone to
do post fight interviews.

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,690
So you were in that world to begin with.
I was in the martial arts world.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,320
You know, I used to teach martial arts
for living before I became a comedian.

19
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,970
I used to fight a fight,

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,200
Atlanta taekwondo tournaments and had
some kickboxing fights and I'd always been

21
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,290
a martial artist since
I was a kid. And so, um,

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,640
I just was interested in watching the UFC
and then I started training in Jujitsu

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,760
and when I was training in Jujitsu,
I was just a white belt,

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,603
was just starting out.

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,270
That's when I got hired by the UFC
to be a post fight interviewer.

26
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,030
But I only did that for
two years and then I quit.

27
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:31,770
It was just too much and it was actually
like, it was, I was losing money.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,660
I would make more money doing a weekend
at a comedy club than I would doing it

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,420
doing the UFC.
And it's just got to a point was just,

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,660
it was too much of a pain in the ass.
And so, uh, I still remained a fan,

31
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:43,494
but I backed away.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:49,050
And then the UFC was purchased by
this company called Zuka in 2001.

33
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,270
And when that happened,
um,

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,680
they started putting on shows in Vegas
and I would go there with my friends.

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,670
They got me free tickets.

36
00:01:56,671 --> 00:02:00,240
They reached out and they would try to
get celebrities to go sit there so that

37
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,000
it would, cause they were very small
at the time and they were trying,

38
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:04,890
they were hemorrhaging money and
they're trying to build it up.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,810
And in talking to Dana
White one day, he, you know,

40
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,100
I was talking to him about fights
going on in Japan. I'm like,

41
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,160
have you ever seen Sato fight? Do you
know what, what do you do? You know,

42
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,930
soccer rod, you know, this guy at night.

43
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,440
And I was bringing all these names and he
was like, do you want to do commentary?

44
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,460
I'm like, I don't want to do
commentary, man. I'm, I'm,

45
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm here to get drunk and watched
people kick the shit out of each other.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,570
I'm not here to work.
And he talked me into it for one show,

47
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,710
UFC 37 and a half.
It was a show that was on,

48
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm one of those, uh, Fox sports networks,

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,920
smaller networks. And, um,

50
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,850
I think it was the best damn sports
show period was a part of it.

51
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,560
I did that and the rest is history.
And then I did like 12 of them for free.

52
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,280
Like the UFC didn't have any money.

53
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,340
Well they were hemorrhaging
money and they had,

54
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,980
there were rich people that owned it,
but it was not a profitable venture.

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,480
And I said, look, just get me there. Get
me my friends tickets and I'll do it.

56
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,030
And so that's how I operated
like, oh, like over a year.

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,980
And then I just became the commentator.
It's this weird, that's crazy.

58
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,310
It's just Dana White. He's,
he's a crazy man and he's a,

59
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,830
he's got a weird way of
looking at things that,

60
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:15,400
that's very effective in his crazy mind.
He's like,

61
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:19,240
let's take this guy was never even
thought about being a commentator and make

62
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,630
them our commentator. I mean, I didn't
know what the fuck I was doing. I mean,

63
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,650
I really didn't, I didn't have any
training at all in sports commentary.

64
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,730
I just would see what was happening
and start talking about it, you know,

65
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,710
which is really like the wrong,

66
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,100
I was more even play by play and color.

67
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,560
It was like doing both of them at
the same time. It was really weird.

68
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,640
And as far as you doing that,

69
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:45,110
do you get any notes from anybody going,

70
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,710
hey Joe, a try this, try to add
or you just develop that whole,

71
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,240
that voice all on your own?

72
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,610
100% of my own. So the only
thing that I had was, uh,

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,170
there's like Mark Della Grotto. It was a
good friend of mine. He is, um, he's uh,

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,060
one of the top trainers in the world.
He's in the truck and uh,

75
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:04,240
I can communicate with him.

76
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:07,180
There's a button where I can communicate
with him and we talk about stuff.

77
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,630
Like I can say, uh, does he look like
he's limping to you? And he's like, yeah,

78
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:13,120
there's something wrong with his leg. I go
to the left leg, right? He's like, yeah.

79
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,730
And then I'll start talking about it.
Like I'll,

80
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:17,950
I'll be able to bounce it back and
forth with him. Or sometimes I just,

81
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:22,240
it's obvious and I'll say it myself, then
I'll, I'll ask him like it, am I wrong?

82
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:25,750
Is he dropped in his hand or his is,
this is a nice,

83
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,000
it's a nice thing to have
someone to bounce things off.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,300
It used to be Eddie Bravo, Eddie Bravo
used to do it as well, where I would uh,

85
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,540
be able to talk to him about certain
positions because he would be in the truck

86
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,220
and I'd be able to ask him like, uh, which
his left leg is in jeopardy right now.

87
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:42,400
Right. Or He needs to step over with
his right leg. We'd be able to go over,

88
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,270
cause it's like there's some aspects
of martial arts that are extremely

89
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:48,130
technical,
especially Jujitsu.

90
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,880
When things go to the ground and you're
trying to commentary do commentary.

91
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:55,150
And I have to decipher which is his
left leg, which is his right leg.

92
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,950
Where is he tied up?
Where's he tangled?

93
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,280
And I'm doing it in real time while I'm
trying to be entertaining and talking.

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,190
It's very complicated, you know,
but nobody taught me how to do it.

95
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,270
I just figured out how to do it.

96
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,100
And you're not looking at it like, uh, uh,

97
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,230
Jim Lampley or anybody in the broadcasting
world when it comes to fights of it.

98
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,820
This is something that
you developed on your own.

99
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:17,180
Like sometimes you look at it as a
comedian, you look at other Comedians,

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,190
say the priors are Carlin's or whatnot.
Do you didn't have kind of like a,

101
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,273
a mentor?

102
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,280
No,
not necessarily because there wasn't one,

103
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,250
there wasn't a lot of guys that did it in,

104
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,440
in for martial arts
commentary. There was, um,

105
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,480
John Perretti who was excellent.

106
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,470
He was one of the very best who was
actually the UFC match maker and a

107
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:44,160
commentator when I first
started. He was very good. Uh,

108
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,410
there's a guy named Jeff Armstrong.
He was very good too.

109
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,790
He was there when I first started to,

110
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,910
he actually ran a promotion called
Hook and shoot. He's excellent.

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,300
He really knows what he's doing. And
then there's a few other guys, you know,

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,270
that also did it, but there's like
what I do as far as like stand,

113
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,150
uh, doing, um, uh, commentary for MMA.

114
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:04,400
There's might maybe 10
guys in the world to do it.

115
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,310
Yeah know they're really do it on
a high level. Maybe 10 guys. Whoa.

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,340
I mean between one FC, uh,
between, um, you know, uh,

117
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
brave and then the UFC Bella
tour PFL there's maybe,

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,470
maybe 10 guys on the
planet that are doing it.

119
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,070
She's not a lot of people and
there's a lot in the UFC now.

120
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:28,940
We're fighters are now transitioning
to become commentators and oftentimes

121
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,910
they're the best at it. Like Michael
Bisping just did this past weekend.

122
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,910
He was the UFC middleweight champion
and he's awesome at it. Already did one,

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,080
one show. They know more obviously
because they've been in there, you know,

124
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,860
they've, they have that added element
of actually having fought in the UFC,

125
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:47,540
which is gigantic. Yeah, I could
see, uh, I think Pauline Mala,

126
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,680
Mala noche. Yeah, he seems
to be very fantastic.

127
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,560
He's very good. He's very
good, very technical,

128
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,330
but also very aware and fighters can
see things that maybe the average person

129
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,880
can't see.
Like they see when someone's slowing down.

130
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,210
They see when someone's laying back, they
see when someone got hurt to the body.

131
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:08,360
They see like little things that may
be a person who's never fought before.

132
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,080
It doesn't say.
