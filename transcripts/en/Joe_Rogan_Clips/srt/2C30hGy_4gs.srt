1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,770
Are you,
somebody told me you were doing,

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:03,960
are we saying that you're going
to do your next one independent,

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,130
you're going to do it independent?

4
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,710
Um, no, I don't know how
I'm going to do it. I'm,

5
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,190
I'm exploring all like the options
and all of that. I'm, I'm trying,

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,880
I was trying to figure out
a way to, uh, you know,

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,640
cause there's just a ton of specials out
there was just trying to figure out a

8
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,940
way. But I mean, you know, when
was the last time you filmed?

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,100
Uh, October, 2016. So, um, um, do,

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,230
um, do, um, but it's like, am I do, I
dunno. I Dunno. I don't, I don't, uh,

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,630
it's, it's what it is, is the special has
changed since you and I started. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,610
We're a special was special. Now what
it is is it's just kind of an, uh,

13
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:44,520
an hour long advertisement letting people
know that you're still out there and

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,720
it's like this just doesn't
it, it documents your stuff
though. Yeah, it does.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,170
But there's just such a sheer amount of

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,880
stuff to see, to have like
an impact the way, like,

17
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:01,870
I was trying to think maybe the last
one that really was just like, whoa.

18
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:05,080
And I would say would be like maybe
Dave Chappelle killing them softly.

19
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:10,000
Certainly Chris rock bring the pain
where it was just like, you know,

20
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:13,900
I'm not saying there weren't ones
that like, like people talked about,

21
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,480
but like just that thing where like,

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,410
do you remember when we were kids it was
just like, you know, Friday, Hey man,

23
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:21,370
see you on Monday.

24
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:26,371
And then somehow on Monday everybody
saw delirious or everybody saw dice or

25
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:31,390
everybody saw Sam Kinison on, on the,
um, the, uh, the danger field thing.

26
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,870
And it was just like no one was
talking about it. And then just like,

27
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:38,950
there was only so many channels and that
thing just caught enough people's eye

28
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:43,810
and you came to school Monday and everyone
was just talking about it. Like, um,

29
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,220
okay,

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,850
you know, I'm, I'm still getting
fucking tweets from people saying, Hey,

31
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,950
I finally got around to
watching breaking bad,

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,100
you know what I mean? Or I was talking
about the wire one time, they were like,

33
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,470
dude, you, you could've
said, spoiler alert.

34
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,290
It's like that fucking went
off the air and like 2006,

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,150
like how much time do I have to give
you to watch it? You know. So, um,

36
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,440
I still haven't seen the wire due.
My Buddy, he, his uh, his son,

37
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,180
the number one thing that he, he,
he watches is he on his phone?

38
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,420
He's watching one of these guys
that gets paid to play video games.

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,250
He watches this guy on his phone play
video games. Everybody does that. Okay.

40
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:28,560
So for common. Yes. So now
that's another thing to watch.

41
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,310
Forget about online porn and fucking me
watching Eric, the car guy and all that.

42
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:34,000
Trying to,

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
trying to like find like where you can
like drop the pamphlets of your career

44
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:44,320
basically to be like, hey man,
I'm still around. I think, I think

45
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,290
there's definitely more
content now than ever before.

46
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,230
But for in terms of like the
amount of standup that's available,

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,190
does it never been more great
standup available to watch? Yeah,

48
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,160
I can think about how many specials
there are now. I mean, it's fun.

49
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,130
It's fucking crazy. Yeah, really it

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,900
is. Um, it's, yeah, so
they're not really specials,

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,570
they're not specialists.
They're not special because,

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,830
because it used to be special,
used to be the top comics.

53
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,920
Now arguably it was basically
the top white male comics.

54
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,400
So the fact that they fixed
that is a great thing. But now

55
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,290
though, I mean, Chris Rock, Dave
Chappelle, Damon Wayans, yes.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,540
There was a lot of laws.
There was a lot of white guys.

57
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,270
There was a lot of white guys with a lot,
a lot of great buckeyes too. And really,

58
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:28,410
yeah,

59
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,190
the real problem was women. There
wasn't very many women. Yeah. Women like

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,520
three Asians,

61
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,510
there's a Paches this other people
out there doing standup specials.

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,250
There's gotta be anyways.
But what I'm saying was,

63
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,690
but it was the best of the best,
where now it's just everybody.

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,450
It's everybody. Right, right.
So like, I remember when,

65
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:53,770
I remember when it was changing
while I was doing a club and, uh,

66
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,100
the feature act was complaining that
he didn't get a half hour special.

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,780
On one of these networks and I'm thinking
like you're a feature act and like

68
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,650
what do you,
what are you going to do?

69
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,070
You're going to do your whole act and
you're still a feature and you want to

70
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,460
document that. And it's just like, um,

71
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,370
they used to give out half hour specials
when I started out and it was to like

72
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:16,720
guys who'd been on the road for like 15
years and they will pick up from there

73
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,260
headlining hour. Uh, they
will take an half of that,

74
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,990
like the best bits from an hour and then,
you know,

75
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,700
and that's somehow through time just
became a feature going up and doing his

76
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,260
whole act.

77
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,990
Well, Netflix is doing that now.
They have the degenerate special.

78
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,550
They have a big J did one. Joey Diaz
did. Juan Christina Palicki did one.

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,840
Um,

80
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,910
I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just
saying it's changed so because it's,

81
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:43,610
it's even changed since.
Um,

82
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,360
my last special that I put out my last
advertisement that I put out a hour along

83
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:51,570
advertising. Um, so you
just try to figure out,

84
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,410
cause everything's just fucking changing
so fast. You just trying to navigate,

85
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:59,080
like where can I put this in all of this,
right.

86
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,280
That it's going to blink enough that
someone's going to stare at it and maybe

87
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:04,920
like watch the thing. I just noticed
your fucking lights with the sky.

88
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,560
That's pretty cool.
Pretty cool, right? Yes.

89
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,930
What's the company that makes those octo
lights shout out to octo lights? Yeah.

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,140
Um,
Gaffigan did an interesting thing.

91
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:19,950
He decided not to put his newest one
on Netflix. He puts it on everything.

92
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,110
It's on Hulu and Amazon.
You can get it on iTunes but not Netflix.

93
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,470
He's a smart guy. Well he just
took a chance, I guess, you know,

94
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:32,340
just decided to see what happens if
you just make it available everywhere

95
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,690
instead. Yeah, I'd like to talk to
him, see how successful that was.

96
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,110
Yeah. I love, because I'm
still working out my straight,

97
00:05:40,111 --> 00:05:43,390
I'll talk to you off air about it cause
I don't want, cause it fucks with my,

98
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,900
I get it ability to make something happen.
So I'll,

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,460
I'll tell you what my idea
was. Um, but that got nixed.

100
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,060
I've thought about that,

101
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,970
doing it and just put it right on youtube.
I've thought about doing that before.

102
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,470
He's not paid for it. Just shoving it
right on youtube. Just see what happens.

103
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,060
Yeah. And Youtube. Yeah, yeah. Just paying
for it and just sticking it out there.

104
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,750
Because if it is an advertisement was
the best way to get it out there. Well,

105
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,730
the best way would just be
to put it on Youtube. Right.

106
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,410
And then to segment it into like little
chunks so that people could digest it.

107
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,240
And yet people wind up doing that.
I don't think Netflix takes them down.

108
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,490
I think when you have a bits up
that like from specials that,

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,210
that go up on Netflix,
I think Netflix just let them stay up.

110
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,300
Just depends on what your,
uh,

111
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,790
what your contract is because
you can work that in. Um,

112
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,250
we did a special with Paul Versey
all things calming network.

113
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:41,430
We did a special with him,
which was, did phenomenal,

114
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:46,130
like broke all their
online streaming, uh, um,

115
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,950
records and it was great because he
was a guy that they don't really give

116
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,950
special tools. Right. Right. Now, you
know, who do you do the special for?

117
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,760
A comedy central. Oh, and uh,

118
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,540
so the streaming version was
really successful. Yeah. I
mean he, he, he did well on,

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,990
well now trying to get people to
actually just fucking sit down and watch

120
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:08,070
television. Like everybody tape you
tape shit. That's just how it works.

121
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:09,840
Which is now if you watch like NFL Games,

122
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:13,710
they have this thing now where the game's
going on and all of a sudden the game

123
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,300
slides to the left and then this two
boxes and the advertising box is bigger

124
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,500
because they know that everybody's taping
games and they're blowing through it.

125
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,650
And advertisers somehow can
tell if someone fast forwarded
through and then they,

126
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,170
the NFL doesn't make as much money. So
now they're, they're running like this.

127
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:32,240
It's weird.
I think these two things,

128
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,900
he don't really have to
look at the commercial.

129
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,490
You can just sit there
looking at the game,

130
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,720
but then they're telling you about
fucking whatever at the same time. Yeah,

131
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:43,890
it's weird. That's gross. It's gross.
But is it, I mean, that's how, you know,

132
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:47,910
I make money off advertising. It's
like my, my thing and what's gross is,

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,060
is how your, uh, what, you know,

134
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,800
if you're dumping shit in the water
supply, if you got like all kinds of like,

135
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:59,010
you know, I mean I think they all have
some sort of labor fucking issues.

136
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,520
I would like, I would like to
be able to pay to not have that.

137
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,010
Like if I could Amazon one click,
I'm like,

138
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,620
well how much am I going
to give you for each game?

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,170
Well a don't have to see that.
Yeah, but they'll give you,

140
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,240
they will fit.

141
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,610
But what the advertisers would do is their
pockets are deeper and they're gonna,

142
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,370
they're gonna go,

143
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,370
they're gonna find like what's funny
is when the Internet started out,

144
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,151
all of a sudden you just,

145
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,750
you went from watching seeing all these
commercials to like nothing to now

146
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:27,290
seeing way more than you ever saw.
Like my,

147
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,960
the worst is when you watch an hour long
youtube video and then all of a sudden

148
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:33,500
it just stops and you know,
they try to make,

149
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,530
make a nice break and then you just watch
this and it annoys me. But I'm like,

150
00:08:36,531 --> 00:08:39,680
well, I do advertise on my podcast
helps set about this. Can I get,

151
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,570
um,

152
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,020
you know, I don't know. When you see,

153
00:08:44,021 --> 00:08:47,920
when you look at the line and you see
those little yellow lines on the youtube

154
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:51,420
video, we know that's where the
fucking ads are going to pop up. Oh No,

155
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,040
I didn't know that. Yeah. Isn't that
how it works? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I

156
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,440
mean, look, advertising
is what it is. I mean,

157
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:03,420
it's either that or you do like a Patriot
type deal. We have people contribute.

158
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,350
Like Sam Harris does that,
right? It doesn't, you don't,

159
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,580
there's a million ways to do it,

160
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,430
but like I don't get mad at advertising
because like I said, a standup specials,

161
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,130
me advertising, then I'm going to
be out on the road and you say that,

162
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:18,150
but it's not, it's entertainment. It's
people that watch it. They can enjoy it.

163
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,430
Like no one's thinking about it that way.

164
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,190
It's a way also to do advertising
entertainment like way back.

165
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,810
Those less filling
tastes. Great. Bud lite.

166
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,440
Miller lite commercials were fucking
great. Funny. They were great.

167
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,330
And you wanted to see them and you love
them. Um, or at least I did a self. Yeah.

168
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,860
This ways.
There's ways to do everything.
