1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,060
How did you guys feel when I
was going through all of that?

2
00:00:03,061 --> 00:00:06,310
Like what was the effect on you
guys? I was very nervous. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,850
I was very nervous about
you. Um, cause I don't, um,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,160
I didn't know what to do
and I knew I could do,

5
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,360
I knew I could help you financially.
I knew I could do that.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,320
So I did that immediately, but I didn't
know what to do. I don't, I didn't,

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,450
didn't know what it feels like and I
didn't know what would it be the path to

8
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:27,811
take.

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:31,440
But when you offered that you were having
problems with your psychiatrist and

10
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:34,860
the medication and I said, okay, well
let me, let me get ahold of Matt,

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,410
who I know will know the right people.
I see people don't tell me anything.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Yeah. You were like, oh,
I was like, you were,

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,710
you're such a non complainer that I knew
when I always tell people this story,

14
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,290
but we're playing pool and Ari's
limping around the table. I'm like,

15
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,940
what the fuck happened to your leg man?
Fucking spider bite or something. I go,

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,520
what? Let me see your fucking leg.
And he pulls his pants up like a dude,

17
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,620
you got to go to the hospital right now.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,470
You have a very bad staph infection
in this could fucking kill you.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,880
And you're like, come on, you're joking.
I'm like, I start unscrewing my cue.

20
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,180
I'm like, we're going to the
hospital now. It was so bad.

21
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,250
But the fact that you're so stoic,
you will,

22
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,251
you never complained once while you have
this gigantic plus fields on your knee

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,940
killed. It was horrible, man. One posted
the juke clay and video and they were,

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,440
he was like, do you know that there? And
he's like, ah, it's bogging you. Not me.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,210
What?
So when you were,

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,630
when you were telling me that
you were doing bad and it wasn't,

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,600
you weren't feeling good and you were,
you were telling me you were suicidal.

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,850
I was like, okay, stop. We got to now
this is, we're going to figure this out.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,830
You know, I don't know what to do. We're
going to figure this out. Maybe nervous.

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,280
Cause I was nervous that I wasn't going
to be there when you needed me to be

31
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:57,120
there. And you know, and I would just,

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,620
I would just get the call.
It's just get the call. Yeah.

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
I mean as a friend that's the last thing
you want to do is have some situation

34
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,350
when you feel like maybe you could have
called them and you could have made them

35
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,060
feel better and you,

36
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,780
they would've just gotten over that
hump and then they would have been okay.

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,970
Like you became okay man.
I mean,

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,260
you were my most depressed friend and
now you probably one of my happiest

39
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:22,050
friends,
even after I started seeing that guy,

40
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:26,370
it's still took months before finding
the right pill and the right dosage and

41
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:30,210
then he would talk to me every like
30 days or whatever it was you,

42
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,370
I remember you describing the process
and one of the things that was

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,880
disconcerting to me was how random
it seemed to be. What do you mean?

44
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,970
Which pills they chose?
It's like they're guessing.

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,850
That's what seemed insane to me.
I felt like if you like,

46
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,800
say you know you got an infection,

47
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,410
they know which antibiotic works
best on that infection, boom,

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,980
they give it to you. But this one
wasn't that cut and dry. It was,

49
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,250
they were just trying stuff out on you.
Yeah. It's like, oh, you need Ibuprofen.

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,610
You have an inflamed thing. It'll took
it down. But they know generally. Yeah.

51
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,070
This is like there's,
from what I get gather,

52
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,150
those two things could be wrong with you.
You either have too much dopamine,

53
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:09,010
too little dopamine, too much something
else, or too little something else. Huh.

54
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,720
And so each of these pills,

55
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,680
I think they're into two categories
or four categories, and they either,

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,620
they either affect the dopamine
or they effect the other thing,

57
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,340
either limited or push
more in and then the other,

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,820
so they don't know which
one's doing it to first. Uh,

59
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,380
and then once they narrow that down,

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,140
they've got to decide if it's like
getting too much of it or too little.

61
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,130
I don't know if you're bipolar is a
separate thing. They're just guessing.

62
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,530
And then while you take this shit,

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
you've added the horrible feelings
and then added some awful side effect.

64
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,880
You're just like,
ah.

65
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,030
This is one of the things that I really
wanted to point out when when Bruce

66
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,840
Roseanne was going to come on,

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,500
I wanted to really talk about
medication and how we're,

68
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,460
we're asking this really,
you know,

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,520
she's an elderly woman who's taking
an incredible amount of medication.

70
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,790
She takes.
