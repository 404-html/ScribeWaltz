1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:06,810
Gear for Steve Bay and Francis and Ghana
was so scary when the light is a John

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,600
Jones. Ooh, I don't know man.
I don't think they've reached
any sort of conclusion.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,890
I don't know if, um, they
have some sort of an excuse.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,920
I don't know when the trial is.
I think it's a,

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,650
it's got to be some time coming up soon,
but it hasn't been in the news.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,060
See if you can find out when the trial is.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,550
It's going to be interesting to see what,

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,530
what they say or what
they think it could be

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,600
that tell you the craziest rumor about it.
Talked about it on the podcast before.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,870
The craziest rumor was everybody
knows John Likes to party.

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,920
I'm not throwing them under the bus. I
mean, he's even joked around, he said, uh,

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,220
to DC when DC was talking shit. He's
like, I beat you after I did cocaine.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,100
Yeah. I mean, which is fucking hilarious.

14
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:52,101
But the craziest rumor was that
they cut Korea teen with cocaine.

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,330
It's one of the things they cut cocaine
with and that they use some cheap

16
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:01,890
Chinese creatine that was steroid tainted,
which is apparently very common.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,790
Apparently there's a lot of uh, Korea
teens and different things that you take.

18
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,430
They have trace amounts of steroids.

19
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,980
It'll show up in a test because the
same vats that they make that shit in,

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,080
they make steroids in and
they make everything again.
Then making them in China,

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,790
these really shitty bulk places and you'll
occasionally get tainted supplements

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,270
happens all the time. Maybe they were
purposely tainted. That could happen too.

23
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,100
We talked about that. The
greatest creotine ever. Yeah.
This should yokes me out.

24
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,690
Yeah, right. Yeah. Probably. Maybe
that's just the way to sell steroids.

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,340
You just sell creating.
But what's interesting,

26
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,730
it says California State
Athletic Commission, right?
Because it was in California.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,620
So who gets to decide?
California gets to decide,

28
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,770
is that how it works? Cause it's the
California State Athletic Commission.

29
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:49,140
So they apparently get to decide
what happens in his future.

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,930
Oh, you Sada, you saw if
found guilty this time,

31
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,610
he faces up to a four year ban.
Holy Shit. What's the minimum now?

32
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,260
I don't know.

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,660
I mean it really depends on whether
or not he's got an actual excuse.

34
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:06,810
If he could get that fucking deal or
to get them some coke and it's got the

35
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:07,644
steroids in that,

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,420
I bet you'd never, the problem is
you would only have a decent excuse.

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,410
You wouldn't, you wouldn't have,
you wouldn't be exonerated.

38
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,810
There would still be some sort of
a penalty. Wait a minute. Match.

39
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,100
Did you say they're cutting in China?
That cutting creatine with coke or what?

40
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:30,150
Steroids.
They're using creatine to cut cocaine.

41
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,700
So if you buy cocaine,
see if you've got a kilo of cocaine.

42
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,580
You want stretch that shit
out, man. Kalona quarter. Oh,

43
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,950
I got the thing brow super fucking muscle.

44
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,951
Dick creatine and Super Muscle Dick
Create team has some steroids in it and so

45
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:48,420
when they're cutting this cocaine with
this Korean team that has steroids in it,

46
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:52,290
he's snorting the coat. This is he
not meaning John Jones a person.

47
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,950
I'm making this up, right? This is, I
don't know what not your cap. No, no.

48
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,960
This is the room.
Could be.

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,960
The rumor is that this has been to task
positive that he did at coke and it had

50
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,300
creating in it and the creative
team had steroids in it.

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,480
The rumor is that is what people think
could be a possibility because if John

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,040
Likes to party and we
know John Likes to party,

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,870
it is entirely possible that he might
have partied and that he might've just had

54
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:21,590
a little bit of that and in that was this
creating cause like if you think about

55
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,730
it, they're cutting with all kinds of
different stuff. Right. They cut it with,

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,350
I mean I'm not a cocaine doctor,

57
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,190
but I gotta imagine they take some white
shit that looks like coke and he can

58
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:32,950
make more coke. Right. That's
what the cutting is. Right.

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,630
But to cut it with Korea team,
apparently it's comic. We looked it up.

60
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,150
We actually do with it. Yeah. Damn.

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,600
I thought you were saying that he
was taking Korea team and it had,

62
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,620
it was tainted with steroids.
No,

63
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,580
because that would be better
for him if that was the case.

64
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,050
That would be good because that way you
could take that creatine to Usada and

65
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,180
you'd have to have it on a list of
shit you were taken. He said, look,

66
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,180
it's just says it's Korean team. It's
all I took and they tested. They're like,

67
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,280
oh shit,
this does have steroids in it.

68
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,360
And then they'll go and find another one
that's like from the same that they can

69
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:07,210
find like the VAT numbers.
I guess they'll find one independently,

70
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,520
hopefully from a store if they test that.

71
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:13,600
And if they find a trace
amount of steroids and that.
And that's what God, um,

72
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,130
a dirty bird to means. He got off
of that. That's how he got off.

73
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,930
He didn't take any steroids,

74
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,750
just took some fucking over the counter
normal supplement that wasn't supposed

75
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:27,520
to have steroids in it. And then, um,
he tested positive. He was stunned.

76
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,830
And you've looked at Tim, he
doesn't live, he even lifts weights.

77
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,060
He doesn't even remotely look like a guy
he used to steroids and they tested the

78
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,300
stuff that they found just randomly
in the store and that tested positive.

79
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,920
So he only got a short
amount of a suspension. Hmm.
Yeah, it was pretty quick.

80
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:44,230
Like six months or something like that.
But even then,

81
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,480
if you didn't do anything wrong,
why would you get six months?

82
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,460
And so you're saying that the steroids
are in Korea team on accident,

83
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,910
not like they're not doing it on purpose,
right? No. Well, here's the thing.

84
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,270
This is just speculation, right? All
I'm here, I'm hearing a rumor, right?

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,540
But the speculation is that these
labs where they make creatine,

86
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,930
they also make a gang of other things,
right?

87
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,110
They'll cook up some steroids for ya or
whatever the fuck the order is, right?

88
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,360
And they're not cleaning those vats out,
right?

89
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,470
So if they're just pouring another bag
and they pour out the steroids and they

90
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:20,890
pour back creatine in there for the next
batch and they're mixing everything up,

91
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,450
it's entirely possible to trace amounts
of those steroids are getting into that

92
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:29,950
stuff. When we first started
doing alpha brain, we had um,

93
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,340
some of the early versions tested and
when we got the stuff mixed from a place,

94
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,000
the place didn't do a very good job of
cleaning out their equipment and we had

95
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,910
vitamins in our alpha brain,
the weren't in there.

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,890
We had some stuff that's
not supposed to be in there.

97
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,070
So when we tested and we
found trace amounts, we had
a switch. What we're doing,

98
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:51,100
we had to change how we,
how we have the things manufactured.

99
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,180
That's a super common thing when you're
dealing with these overseas laboratories

100
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,750
that are making tea all your shit
together. So that's one possibility.

101
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,220
Another possibility that I've said before,

102
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,430
the lot of people say I'm fucking crazy.
Somebody could have given him something,

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,320
somebody could have given him
something to fuck with them.

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,500
Somebody could have not liked him.
So we could have done that too.

105
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,970
I'm not saying that's what happened,

106
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,480
but I'm saying you have to take into
consideration all the possibilities.

107
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,440
If John is telling the truth and
he's totally stunned by this,

108
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,250
there's a lot of different possibilities
and one of them could easily be

109
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,610
somebody giving it to them.
It also could be that he took steroids.

110
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,760
That's possible too. I don't know.
If you owned a creating company,

111
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,010
you'd kind of want,
you're creating to be you.

112
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,270
You guys are making steroids there too.
Right? Okay, cool. Can we use the same?

113
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:39,260
That sucks. That shit. And then you could
always just say, hey, you know what?

114
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:43,390
I didn't, I don't know what it's
true. Yeah. You know they Perth,

115
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,730
those Dick Pills,
apparently those gas station Dick Pills,

116
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,710
they have like a generic Viagra on him.
That's why they work so well. I know that.

117
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,940
He's just used to say, that's your honor,
your honor. We, they, we didn't know that.

118
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,830
They use the same vats.
Yeah,

119
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,100
they do that and they also put steroids
in those things to do. You know,

120
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,760
Brian Red Band was the first one to call
that Jon Jones had take a dick pills.

121
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,350
That's why I tested positive ray ban.

122
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,030
Put it together in his head because he
does coke. He's like, look, you do cookie.

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,930
Dick doesn't work.
Do Your Dick doesn't work.

124
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,360
You take those gas station Dick Pills.
He probably took one of those pills.

125
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,210
He goes, I take those pills. I feel
like a fucking animal. He's like,

126
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:20,210
I feel like I've got steroids in
me. I'm like, really? He goes, yeah,

127
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:24,710
you get real aggressive. Dick is hard as
a fucking piece of metal. I'm like, okay,

128
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,190
all right. Turned out he was
right. Hmm. That's crazy.

129
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,830
And it was the same thing
with Anderson Silva.

130
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,750
When Anderson Silva tested positive,

131
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,270
it was from some sort of
Chinese dick pill stuff. Hmm.

132
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,850
And they found it and they tested it
red. That does go hook. He's done it.

133
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,160
He doesn't do it all the time,
but he's done it.

134
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,010
So he knows what it's like to party. And
that's what he was saying. He's like,

135
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,800
I know what it's like if you're partying
and he's like, your Dick doesn't work.

136
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,820
He's like, he parties, right?

137
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,750
Well he probably did cause he
tested positive for coke. He's like,

138
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:56,450
you probably does that red band totally
nailed it. Or maybe he was doing ecstasy.

139
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:01,120
People take my Agora on ecstasy, you
know? Yeah. It could be that too. Yeah.

140
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,750
Looked he, he's a wild motherfucker
and he likes to party. The question is,

141
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,320
did he actually take a steroid
with the intention to cheat?

142
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,960
That's what we don't know.
He says he didn't.

143
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,310
I wished there was a weight
that you a hundred Blake,

144
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,210
100% could tell someone's
lying 100% your watch,

145
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,290
that Black Mirror episode
where everything's been
videotaped with her contact

146
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:25,220
lenses. Yes. So they just like
reviewing everything they've said. Yeah.

147
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,480
That freaked me out.
That's coming.
