00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,750
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,170
So you were asking me before this about
the fights this weekend he goes whether

3
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:11,370
where counter starker that's why they,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,460
they keep the distance and
they'd know exactly that.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,110
This is what I think a lot of people
were like pissed off. It was boring.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,320
But I think that's because they just
want to see people beat the fuck out of

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,080
each other, which I understand that's
why you tune into cage fighting.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,260
But to me the way I always described
martial arts is it's high level problem

9
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:35,400
solving with dire physical consequences.
And if you run in on Tyron Woodley,

10
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:39,360
you got some dire physical consequences.
He's a fucking powerhouse.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,370
And if Woodley charges at Thompson
this dire physical consequences,

12
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:46,230
cause he was getting tagged when he would,

13
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,060
he needs said it to me after the fight,
he's like,

14
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,760
he caught me a few times as
I was charging towards him.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,970
So Woodley has a different style than
Thompson Thompson has that wide stance,

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,660
that karate style and he's excellent at
moving in and moving out and almost like

17
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,340
point fighting you. He's just jabbing
you, hitting you with these, uh,

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,490
clean left hand, sliding out of the
way. Occasionally throwing kicks.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,900
But mostly what he's doing is making you
wonder what he's gonna do and when he's

20
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:16,350
coming at you and Woodley had to pick
his battles and figure out when he could

21
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:20,730
launch himself at them. So at any
moment something could have happened,

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,530
but a lot of shit didn't happen. So
the people watching at home, look,

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,370
that was more boring fight ever. It's
because those moments are so critical.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,220
Those moments are so dangerous.
You can't just,

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,660
they would like it to be like Frankie
Edgar Gray Maynard just fucking chaos or

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,170
punches throwing wild.
Not going to happen like that.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,870
You can't do that with Wonderboy.
You can't charge at him like that.

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,000
He will fucking counter you and you look,

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,190
you will be one of those
people on his highlight reel.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,090
So Tyron Woodley was very smart and that
he knew that he couldn't charge Adam

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,080
and Wonderboy. He's not going to
charge at Woodleigh either. I mean,

32
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,510
he got an almost knocked the
fuck out in the first fight.

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,220
He almost got knocked the fuck out in the,

34
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:03,540
in the fifth round with the second
fight to Woodley's a powerhouse man.

35
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,350
He hits so goddamn hard,
so everybody had to be on their toes.

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,040
They both had to be minding their p's
and q's and that translated for a boring

37
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,700
fight to a lot of people, but
not to me. To me, I was like,

38
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:18,650
anything can happen at any moment in
the fifth round or almost did when when

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,820
Woodley connected and Thompson's knees
went out, I mean he slumped, he was out,

40
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:26,430
man. He was out for at least a half
a second or a moment. You know,

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,160
there was a moment
where his legs gave out.

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,550
His body went limp and they could
have stopped the fight right there.

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,530
I'm glad they didn't.
They glad they kept going.

44
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,790
I talked to a big John McCarthy
in the cage after the fight ago,

45
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,370
how close we were to stop in
that fight. He goes, he goes,

46
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,800
I wasn't close to stopping that fight. I
go, what? You were looking right? He goes,

47
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,620
I was looking. I feel, I go, you
were looking at clothes. He goes,

48
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:50,250
I'll never admit it. I goes, but it was,
I mean, he was almost out right. He goes,

49
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:53,150
he was almost out. It might've
been out for half a second, but he,

50
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,130
I gave him a chance. I go, you did
a great job. He did an amazing job.

51
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,950
I mean that's why big John
McCarthy is so important.

52
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,900
The guy with that kind of
experience and if he fucked that up,

53
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,650
everybody would be so mad at him. But
he did it perfect. It was perfect.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,610
He has the most difficult job in
the sport. Other than the fighters.

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,630
Fighters have the most difficult job.
Second most difficult job is the referee.

56
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,950
Third most difficult job is a judges
at least. So I think so. Yeah.

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,210
I believe it's going to interpret
the trauma. Yes. Out of the people.

58
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,210
Well he has to be, he has to look,
he has to be at the right angle.

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,320
Like they're moving around and they're
fast and they could go to his left and he

60
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,990
can be over here, but something
could be happening on there. Right.

61
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:35,110
And he doesn't even see it. You
know, you don't know like sometimes,

62
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,700
sometimes guys don't see taps.

63
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,600
Sometimes guys don't see a
certain I pokes or groin shots.

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,220
There's a lot of things that can happen.

65
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,250
A referee's job is insanely difficult and
they only get praise when they fuck up

66
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,810
or they only rather get
attention when they fuck up.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,370
They don't get any praise when they do a
great job and just just they need more,

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,170
you know,
the the need more.

69
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,230
More people need to understand
like how difficult that is.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,440
So that moment where Tyron finally did
connect on Wonderboy and everybody's

71
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,980
like,
why didn't you do that earlier?

72
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,660
Because he could gotten
knocked the fuck out.

73
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,610
Like that was where the opening was.

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,240
Woodley was so aggressive because
he was down on the scorecards,

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,310
at least in his corner,

76
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:18,370
his eyes and in my eyes he was as well
and he had a charge forward and he had to

77
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,880
connect and he did.
But to make that happen,

78
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,920
a lot of things have to be in place.

79
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,720
You have to understand
one of the boys timing,

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,210
he had been fighting him
for four rounds already.

81
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,090
He was getting a sense of what
Wonderboy could and couldn't do.

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,620
He also knew the consequences.

83
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:36,370
He'd been tagged a couple of times so
he knew like I can't just rush at him

84
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,160
cause Wonderboy was trying to
time him with that right hook.

85
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,920
He was standing on the South Pole
position with his right leg forward.

86
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,820
He throws that front leg side kick to the
body, throws it really well because he,

87
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,280
he picks it up from the
ground like low and, and,

88
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:53,140
and it's sort of scoops up so you don't
see it coming until it's too late.

89
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,840
It might not be the most powerful
application of the front leg side kick,

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,873
but it's very,

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,410
it's very sneaky because he slides in
with that foot low and then it comes up

92
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:05,920
and stabs you and you don't know if it's
going to come up as a sidekick or if

93
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,290
it's going to go up and over
your shoulders around kick.

94
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,750
You don't know what he's doing.
He's so sneaky.

95
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,550
So Tyron had to be very cautious and for
a lot of people was very boring because

96
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,160
of that. But I didn't think
it was boring was happening.

97
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:21,190
I was on the edge of my seat. I
was just like, there are moments,

98
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:24,910
there's going to be moments when the
shit starts flying. And in those moments,

99
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,560
that's where the fight becomes amazing.

100
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,180
But those guys are smart and they're
not dumb and the belt is so God damn

101
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,940
important. When you have
the belt, you get to decide,

102
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,960
you fight all the best fighters, you,
you, you, you make the money. You know,

103
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,110
you get the opportunities for the big
money fights like the Conor McGregor type

104
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:43,840
fights. Those only happen if you have
the belt. If you don't have the belt,

105
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,620
nobody gives a fuck about. Yeah.
So for a guy like Tyron, man,

106
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:51,940
that belt is everything. For a guy like
Woodley or a guy like a Wonderboy, rather,

107
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,860
that belt is everything.
If you don't have that belt,

108
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,840
you make a fraction of what you make.

109
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,930
Like think about that fight that
flight's insanely close. It was so close.

110
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,700
Dominick Cruz afterwards said,

111
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,800
that's basically the same fight
as the first fight, right?

112
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,230
It's like you could call if you've
called the first fighter to draw,

113
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,380
you could easily call this fight
a draw and I agree with him in.

114
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,410
So that means that Wonderboy and Woodley
are essentially like so closely matched

115
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,300
stylistically that it's a wash.
Right.

116
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,810
But meanwhile Woodley's the one who's the
champion Woodley's the one who has the

117
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,501
potential to fight.

118
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,890
Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who
has a potential to fight Michael Bisping

119
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:25,370
or whoever,

120
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,030
who else he fights at whatever weight
he fights at and that is where the money

121
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,250
is. All right, so he's the guy
who's going to get the money.

122
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,490
Whereas Wonderboy who essentially had a
draw with him prove that he was at least

123
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,360
close enough on one fight and just
a hair under the second fight,

124
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,140
he ma,

125
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,140
he's going to make a fraction of
what Woodley mix likely so that those

126
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,870
consequences have to be
taken into consideration when
you're watching these guys

127
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:55,850
fight is that they know there's a wind
bonus and there's a loss. Like if you,

128
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:59,930
if you lose, you get your show money,
you don't get a bonus. But if you win,

129
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,520
you get twice the money.
Like a lot of guys have that,

130
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,310
the way their contract is structured,
you'll,

131
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:09,311
they'll make x if they win and they'll
make x plus x if they'll make x plus x if

132
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:12,650
they win. But if they lose, they
only make x. So they might have,

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,430
they might be getting $200,000 for the
fight, but another $200,000 if they win,

134
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,040
that's a giant swing.
That's a big deal.

135
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,740
So they have to be really fucking careful.
They don't make mistakes.

136
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,580
I don't like when bonuses,
man, I don't like it.

137
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,850
I think those guys are trying to win
anyway. They're trying to win. I just,

138
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:31,670
I just think like, especially in
particular in situations like that,

139
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,670
when fights are like that fucking clothes,
I could judge,

140
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,300
can decide whether or not you make
an extra 200 grand or don't like,
