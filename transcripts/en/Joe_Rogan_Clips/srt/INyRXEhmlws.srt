1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
Cause I, I can't even, I don't even
feel alive and I'm out of breath.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,810
That's what I get for being a musician.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,710
I lose a pound a night on stage
sweating with Aerosmith. Right.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm up there with standing next
to fucking Joe Perry. Really?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,180
The last of the real rock stars you,
you stood across from him.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,630
It's a bad motherfucker. I don't know
if he was stolen is with you, but he's,

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,370
when I get text messages from him,
like, Holy Shit, I fucking the text.

8
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:30,540
And I saw him in the beginning
and I knew he was there. Well,

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,930
you something special. I knew he was
that. He's got a, he's got a recognizable,

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,860
there's like certain people that
have a sound, you know, and Joe has,

11
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:43,400
he absolutely has a sound, you
know, as a sound. Gary Clark Jr Ooh.

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,480
Like you hear Gary Clark Jr
Play Guitar. You Go, oh, okay.

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,200
That's a Gary Clark Jr riff. You know,
there's certain people that have a sound.

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,420
Joe Most certainly has a sound.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,550
It's like he's expressing himself through
that guitar in a very recognizable way.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,250
You know, you two together, man.

17
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,770
What a fucking combination that was
with his guitar and your voice and,

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,340
but here's, but here's, and here's
the trip. In the beginning, you know,

19
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:11,490
the first album, people who've
said, who sat on the second album,

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,370
good on a second album.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,890
I kind of like that
peewee Herman Chocolatey

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,890
parking. Cause I want to sound
black. Oh fuck. I'm not stupid.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,940
I get it. I wanted to put some
fucking soul soul in my voice.

24
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,340
I knew I had it and force
it out. No, no, no, no.

25
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:38,020
What I learned was, you know,
like from a Nat King Cole,

26
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,770
he's the kind of music I listen to
when I was a kid, when I met Natalie,

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,870
I walked up behind her and I went
chemo, chemo stairs, stair my,

28
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:51,040
my Ho Marum take a pump and soup,
bang, nip cap on. And Mitch Cameo,

29
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,290
I love you.
She went,

30
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,810
no one is song that ever to eat up.
My Daddy who said to dad passed obviously,

31
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:00,140
but way before.
But that's it.

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,690
Those are the records I listened to that
was not singing his best shit. And, um,

33
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,360
well,
here's what I wanted to sound.

34
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,770
I wanted to sound more like
Joe Perry was playing. Ah,

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,040
it's singing really sweet and Nice,
isn't it? Dream on sweet and Nice.

36
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,880
I kind of go, I kind of went there and
when we wrote a song on a waterbed,

37
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,510
you'll Perry and I were sitting
around smoking a big fatty and um,

38
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,700
Mark Lehman was there. He was our road
manager. And, and show goes Brownlow

39
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,970
parallel Mohan Barcelona alone.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,510
Oh Man. [inaudible] anywhere near me.
Me and me, ma'am. Ma'Am, ma'am, ma'am.

41
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:41,950
[inaudible]

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm looking at him and that was the
sentence he spoke to me and I said,

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,200
we all live on the edge of
town where we all live in.

44
00:02:56,201 --> 00:03:00,430
And so Lou Brown people started calling
me and all do just a grin. And Sam,

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,020
I'm gotta move out. Goals hit him
moving in some saying he, she told,

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,520
he spoke to me and you I
answered, translated it. I, yeah,

47
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,830
I would listen to the bit,
we would sit around and we were jam.

48
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,820
That's what we did the best.

49
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,950
And we would create this music and I would
put the headphones on later cause I'm

50
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:22,870
the lyricist and I were in the melody.
I see when I heard Joe's band,

51
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,180
I thought I'm going to take my dad,

52
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,630
Vic Talerico who went to Julliard
in New York and a coping the Bronx,

53
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,240
56 10 Netherland Avenue,

54
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:37,420
you six g department and I grew up
under the piano and I listened to,

55
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:40,390
my dad would practice
every day on a Steinway.

56
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,110
So who lived between the notes show you
and saying I love you [inaudible] name's

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,953
Joe.

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,670
I just love Joe's fucking
love Perry fucking love.

59
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,840
You know he's my bro. You go eat yo,
what the fuck man? It's always been that.

60
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,700
So,
but anyway,

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,220
so I took my melody and you know what
I hear when I listened to him playing.

62
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,960
Whoa Shit.

63
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,920
So when you guys did your second
album and you did that little sort of

64
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,880
affectations that how you would
call it a new voice, did you,

65
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,090
after you heard it and you listened
to like people talking about it,

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,900
did you decide to change it
for the next album? Wow, I did.

67
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:24,670
Just go away for a minute, didn't
I? Yeah. I love it when I do that.

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,100
Yeah.
The,

69
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,230
the melody that I learned from my
dad and then listening to the music,

70
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,020
we listened to, you know, Dorsey and, uh,

71
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,470
Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole and,

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,240
and then Janice Joplin and the Phillies
fugs who were the first ones to put on

73
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,370
the back of their album, uh,
lunatic vagina. That's who.

74
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:53,020
So who sang the song is 61,
the mothers of invention.

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,270
He's fucking bands. And I went, what?

76
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,540
So I thought sing and really like my
dad taught me in the notes and write on,

77
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:05,060
and you know, c, d, e f, g, a, B.

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,370
You don't have a fuck you
no wrong, wrong, wrong.

79
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,210
You've got to, not only that, but if
you don't put inflections into it,

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,640
there ain't no feeling.
And there ain't no meaning.

81
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,330
I got you lack,
I do last time Beta.

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,930
Whoops.
Right where he say it.

83
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
But you have to feel,
it can't be something you trying to feel.

84
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,520
It's gotta be something you actually feel.
Does that make sense? Yeah. But I think,

85
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,910
you know, Joe Hat's off to him, man,

86
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,850
the way he played his
guitar practice at night,

87
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:45,540
he'd fucking nod out and he'd be sitting
in his chair and the fucking chair,

88
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,850
the couch caught on fire to,

89
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,430
since I walked in with a pot of water and
he's laying there rooms full of smoke.

90
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,680
I went, Yo, what the fuck man getting,

91
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:56,700
he's playing this riff and we turned
it into a song and this kind of stuff

92
00:05:56,701 --> 00:06:00,530
happens so much. And he did it
away to me. Fucking they obviously,

93
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:05,420
you know Tom Hamilton, du Du, Du,
Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du,

94
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:10,300
Du Sui a motion. That's how
band comes together, you know?

95
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,800
And I can't tell you any other way than
that magic and every inch of the way,

96
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:19,640
the reason it doesn't feel like
I'm 70 and I don't feel the time,

97
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:23,870
and it feels like yesterday
we just started is because
every time I'm on stage,

98
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,760
I'm singing in those same fucking
songs again. Same way, same feeling,

99
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,290
same looking, same people,
different people, different people.

100
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:37,130
But I'm singing the same songs. Do you
know the guy that's looking, it's, anyway,

101
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:41,540
so to answer your question, second
album sounds a little bit more Raunchy,

102
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:46,010
more in tune with Joe's guitar. And I
think we found our sound second home,

103
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,080
third, fourth, fifth, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
We got it right. But it took,

104
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:55,400
that first album, had songs on it
like walking the dog because we were,

105
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:59,090
we ran out of songs with,
that was all we played in clubs.

106
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,250
I remember we had a contract, what are
we going to do? So we're moving out.

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,630
Then the guys would get stoned and drink
Boone's farm and I go, come on you guys.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
We fucking wrote this song.
Fuck you. And flick the joint.

109
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,750
So I remember getting
pissed off walking out.

110
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,040
They hate me when I tell this story,

111
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:20,420
but I remember being really fucking angry
walking out to his piano and writing

112
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,090
one way street.
Um,

113
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,510
I don't play guitar and I wrote
about him and doing it. Um,

114
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,960
make it, don't break it
first of all in first album.

115
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,490
So some great shit because I
feel like, you know, in anger,

116
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,360
you know, I didn't know what to
do, but I just put a use that.

117
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:42,440
So I wrote a bunch of songs and
I think it lit everybody's fuse.

118
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,100
I think that Joe certainly lit mine.

119
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,020
Tom Hamilton is outtakes, as
he called him. Sweet emotion.

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,940
That's Tom Hamilton.
