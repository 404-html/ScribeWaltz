1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,850
Well, tiny women would be into a, no, just
like vagina would be like, you know of.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,480
I know I've never,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,410
I never thought that like Asian
pussy was that much smaller than like

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,840
stem research. You know, I have
a spiritual evidence, you know?

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,540
Well, you know, this doesn't
make 100% sense. Okay.

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,590
But I've met girls that were tiny
that you could not fuck hard enough.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,260
Yeah. And it just open up.
Yeah. But not, not just that.

8
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:34,740
It's just like they want it like
that. They want, they want savage,

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,980
they want to get fucking smashed.
Why is that?

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,890
Is because I think they realized
that they, they're tiny.

11
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:45,060
They have small genes so they want to
get savage genetics inside them so they

12
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:49,650
have survivor children. I really believe
that. I think it only makes sense.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,670
Oh, the horniest girls irritated
in my life weigh about 104 lbs.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,500
And these big brand a talks, chicks want
it real soft. No one when I used to be,

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,500
they want to because they know that those
are the little girls are fucking giant

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,160
dudes making Doyle sites kid
and they're going to keep going.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,400
It's a never ending battle
for genetics, dude. It really,

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,990
it is fun to 100% it's a never ending
battle of genetics and if she denies girls

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,940
fucking these like Beta dude's not. Did
they do, they do it for a little while.

20
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,520
They barely fuck them. They always
say they have headaches. Listen, I,

21
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:22,680
I know a lot of Beta dude,

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,000
the girl does like I can't sleep.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,180
They don't want to fuck the guys.
Dude.

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,440
I had a friend of mine who was dating a
guy like that when she was a really like,

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,490
I just do not want to fuck him. And
I was like, wow, cause why would you,

26
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:41,160
I was like, that was rough. I'm
like, what are you going to do?

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,000
Just don't fuck him dude. It's,
it's dude, it's insane man.

28
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,650
It's like I see this all the time.

29
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:51,210
Like these like hardcore perceivably
hardcore feminist chicks. Yeah.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,140
Here my comedy could be
the opposite of that.

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,610
And they're in the DMS, right?
Saying, I don't know why I'm here.

32
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,540
I swear to God it's a trap house

33
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,930
because I think feminism in general is
a direct result of a failure by men.

34
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:18,600
To be fair and by a failure by men,

35
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:23,601
to be actual men and to raise actual
men who treat everybody with respect.

36
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,090
The when men are abusing women,
those men are bullies. They're,

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,370
they're weak men.

38
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,150
The kind of man that would do that to
a woman that would be like physically

39
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,520
abused, a woman. That's a weak man, right?

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,510
That's the type of man that would eat
up a smaller man or take someone from

41
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:42,600
someone with four. Since security needs
to feel powerful, he's a bitch. Yeah.

42
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:47,250
He's a bitch. Right? The antidote for
that is to be a strong man, right?

43
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,130
Like do one of the things I've been
telling people like this is how you fix

44
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:54,870
bullying in school. Teach
them out of fight. Not the
bullies. I mean, not just the,

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,410
not just the victims, but the bullies
themselves. Everyone had a fight.

46
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:00,940
When they feel confidence that
they can defend themselves.

47
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,630
They don't have to nicest fucking people
in the world. Yeah. Martial artists,

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,560
you go and go to martial arts gyms, go
to a Jujitsu gym. I'll take you there.

49
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:12,190
All fucking nicest people as they know,
hugging everybody in friendly,

50
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,910
then they're going to choke each other
half to death in about five minutes and

51
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:19,180
before that, they're
all fun, happy, playful.

52
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,600
They're so secure and outside of their,
they're so secure and relax.

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,720
There are different type type of person,
obviously not all of them.

54
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,650
Maybe there's people over the
moon. We vary wildly, right?

55
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,700
But almost always to a human.
The mean ones,

56
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:37,000
whether it's mean women or mean when male,
weak,

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,570
weak women.
Women will tell you this.

58
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,260
They work at an office and they've
got a female boss. That's a con.

59
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,090
That is one of the worst fucking cause.
You can't even fucker nothing.

60
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:52,420
You can do nothing you could
do to make that bitch happy.

61
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,330
She wants to take from you.
She wants to squeeze your blood.

62
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,520
At least if you're cute and you're boss
is disgusting and he's a fucking asshole,

63
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,150
you could flirt with them a little bit
and you could like maybe get them to like

64
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,960
you more. Don't do it. Obviously
don't do that, but with a female boss,

65
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,220
you have to have a personality to
shit. Shocking what? The female boss,

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,850
not even that. A lot of women
don't like women. Right.

67
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,600
One of the things that I love more than
anything is when I talk to women and

68
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:22,750
they'll do this thing where they look
around to make sure no one's looking,

69
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,690
no one's around, and I go, look,
I would never say this publicly,

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,310
but some bitches are fucking crazy.
That's what we do with like racist shit.

71
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,680
It didn't burn. Have that bit of that
like I look around and then you slide it.

72
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,050
The thing about these,
yes,

73
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,340
will this women feel like they've got
momentum in this little war of ideas with

74
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,010
the me too movement.
Bill Cosby getting arrested.

75
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,120
Are Kelly getting arrested and
Harvey Weinstein? I, in my opinion,

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
and I bet you think this too.
These are good things. Yeah.

77
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,060
When shitty men get put away or they
get arrested for abusing people,

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,570
whether it's their physically abusing
men or physically abusing women,

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,120
it's always good. You shouldn't
be physically abusing it.
I'm out of here. Yeah,

80
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:11,230
to beat those guys up.
I mean this is handled in the community.

81
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,600
When we were younger, teenagers,
Hey, bottled blood, you know,

82
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,250
it was rough with this, the
whatever who was rough. Right.

83
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:19,450
And we went over there and if you were
married and Harvey Weinstein tried to

84
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:23,200
fuck your wife and she went in on audition
and you knew that there was all these

85
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:28,201
security guards and all these fucking
levels before you got to him and your wife

86
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:31,900
got into that level and he was treating
her like shit and being mean to her and

87
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,400
telling her,
if you want to work in this town,

88
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,430
you've got to suck this little fat
dick. You'd be, it's over Harry.

89
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,780
That's over angry.
I'm shocked.

90
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:43,270
Like someone told him it didn't Brad
Pitt try to step to him or something like

91
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,970
that did step to him. And did he swing
on him? I don't know what he did.

92
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,470
Cause you guys,
right?

93
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,140
Like well that's the other thing
that's fucked up about this. It's like

94
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,080
there's going to be Weinstein's. Yeah,
like these people are going to exist.

95
00:05:55,081 --> 00:05:57,110
This man, they still
exist. Yeah, they still do.

96
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:59,120
Is hearing about one last
night someone was to,

97
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,450
I can't tell you the
comic cause I don't wait.

98
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,310
He's a television personality
who was apparently a closeted
homosexual. Oh, what?

99
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:09,260
He's out there and he's
out there like dudes. Yeah,

100
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,830
just going on our list.
I don't know.

101
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,820
He's trying really trying and making
them uncomfortable. Really? Really?

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,830
How well known. I don't know the
bullshit and later we'll talk later,

103
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,070
but what I'm saying

104
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,660
to him after it was crazy
fuckers out there, there's
still rolling it old school.

105
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,620
They want to get caught.
Kwame Paltrow.

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,750
V's Brad Pitt threatened to kill Harvey
Weinstein. But you got to swing on hand,

107
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,190
but you got to swing on him,
Bro. You got to leave some marks.

108
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,060
I believe it so well it depends
on what Harvey did versus what we,

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,910
if he grabbed her,
it did anything to her physically,

110
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,110
then you got to swing on him.

111
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,260
But if he just said something creepy
and you tell them I can get him,

112
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:55,520
we have word, take your fucking
life, I'll take your life.

113
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,910
Well I think the issue with these things
is like we know we're going to have

114
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,900
Weinstein's,
but the people that protected Weinstein,

115
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,670
the second you complain about a guy for
grope in or doing something crazy right,

116
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,760
that woman is doing exactly what
she's supposed to do, right?

117
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,810
She experienced sexual assault and she's
telling right now if you silence her

118
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,280
and shot her up, that's where
the system falls apart. Right?

119
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,190
So whoever is protecting him throughout,
he got it.

120
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,090
They got to go to because she then went
and did exactly what she was supposed to

121
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:30,880
do. Right. There's going to be Weinstein's
throughout life, unfortunately.

122
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:34,040
A question. What about the support
staff? All that many people,

123
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,710
all of them are almost, they're not
worse cause they're not doing it,

124
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,830
but they're so bad because they strip
the person who was assaulted from

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,990
like not only equality,
but like they stripped her from,

126
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,830
from life in a way like they
made that person go, oh shit.

127
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,340
Life isn't fair.
And I don't have a shot.

128
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,860
Do you know the expression
diffusion of responsibility? It's,

129
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,370
it comes when there's large groups
of people that watch something,

130
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,510
someone's going to step in. It's like
that lady, uh, Jenna vcs or something.

131
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,750
Remember that there was some woman who
was getting raped and queens and she was

132
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:11,390
screaming for like 40 minutes and there
was all these neighbors around like,

133
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:15,620
yeah, I heard it, but I thought Ted was on
it. Oh Jesus. You didn't hear about this?

134
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,770
No. Think Katie, Jenna vcs or
some shit. It's the old story,

135
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,330
but yet everybody was like,
oh, I'll get it. Yeah, it's
the same kind of thing. It's,

136
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,420
well, it's just how corporations work.
So if you're working for a corporation,

137
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:30,800
the Corporation's dumping pollutants into
the river, you know, you feel like, well,

138
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,230
it's not my responsibility. I just
work here in accounting. You know,

139
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:37,430
like somebody else is going to
handle this right now. This is,

140
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,511
and I think when you,

141
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:41,990
if you are working in like the Weinstein
Company and you knew Harvey was out

142
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:46,010
there slinging Dick, first
of all, in their defense,

143
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,780
you probably didn't know the specifics,
right? Because it's like, oh,

144
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,680
Harvey's a dog. He's always
out there trying to fuck.
Yeah. That's sort of normal.

145
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,960
Like a lot like people
have to understand this.

146
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,350
Why does a guy like that get rich?

147
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,790
Why does he get rich is he likes some
patron of the arts who loves creating

148
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,900
Nabi? There's a little bit, maybe
he likes power. Yes. You like power.

149
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,180
Why do you like that power?
What are you getting out of that power?

150
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,500
Once you have a Ferrari, once you have
a Mercedes, once you have a manager,

151
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,660
what are you getting?
You're getting post sandy pussy.

152
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,130
Pussy.
So it's about power right?
