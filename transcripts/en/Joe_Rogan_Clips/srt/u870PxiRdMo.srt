1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,290
Thanks. I'm losing it, but it's what's
left of it is still working on right.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,500
And we're live. Gentlemen. Hello Sean.
Hey, how are you? Hello Tom. Hello Joseph.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,410
What's cool? You guys did a movie.
Did you make a movie? We made a movie.

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,860
Did you guys do movies? We
do. We're moving. Guys. How
many movies have you made?

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,200
A one. Well, I bet you've made. How many
of you made before? I like six, but yeah,

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,630
but we've made one. We made one.
Yeah. What's your favorite one?

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,740
Other than the one that's right now?

8
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,490
Which is definitely your favorite cause
you're promoting it right now. Uh,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,030
sex drive. Sex drive is the
one. Nobody knows about it.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,930
Nobody knows about it. I mean, it just,

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,250
it was one of those movies that just
opened and nobody knew about it,

12
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:38,250
but it was a, it was a really, really
fun movies. Maybe we can change that.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,660
It's on iTunes or Netflix. Yeah. Yeah.
It's all are James Marsden's in it?

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,910
This is the one. Is this the one that you
like when you made it? You're like, ed,

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,500
maybe I'll go back to working fucking
construction or whatever. Yeah.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,200
So I thought, I thought it was over after
that. Did you finance it or anything? No,

17
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,580
no. We made it, um, we made it with
summit pictures and it was, it was,

18
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:04,410
it was just amazing. They, they, uh, we
were in town trying to get a career going,

19
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,330
you know,
try and try and make things happen.

20
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:10,290
We were making a TV pilot at the time,
which was a living hell. And, uh,

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,820
and we had gone out and pitch this idea
to a bunch of places and nobody bought

22
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,250
it. So then in the middle
of our, uh, editing,

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,600
our pilot summit pictures
called and said, um, we really,

24
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:24,660
we keep thinking about that pitch.
Would you guys be willing to write it?

25
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,610
And I said, you know what, tell
him I was really busy. I said,

26
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:28,170
tell him I'll write it if I can direct it.

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,320
But I figured that would make them
go away. And they said, all right.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,710
And so we went in and we wrote it and
we turned it in and they green lit it.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,180
It was this crazy,

30
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,630
it was just this crazy process where
we've got this movie green lit and I think

31
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:42,930
we wrote the draft and like a month. Then
we turned it in and they, they loved it.

32
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:47,610
And they said about, it's a, it's a, it's
a teen road trip movie. It's about this,

33
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,450
these kids that, uh, it was kind of
in the early days of the, you know,

34
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:54,630
Facebook and all that stuff. And it
might've even been, I don't know,

35
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:58,680
I can never track the, it might've even
been like sort of my space into Facebook,

36
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,320
that era, you know. Um,

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,330
but it was about a kid who meets a girl
online and goes to lose his virginity on

38
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:08,810
a, on a road trip. It's funny.
It is funny. Yeah. Marzano in it.

39
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,540
James Marsden, he's really funny. Clark
Duke. And um, I had a good cast and ah,

40
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,140
there it is. Yeah. Wow. Good. Um,

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,460
but it was a really great experience.
It was really fun. And then we, we,

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,390
we tested it, we did the test
screenings and it just murdered,

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,720
like it was just the, and the studio got
really excited. And I thought, oh my God,

44
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,250
like I'm going to have a huge career.

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,820
And then movie came out and didn't do
anything I need to do any business at all.

46
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:35,560
It was like, okay, I'm going
to go back to Wisconsin and,

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,080
and not have a career at all.
So is it true that instant family,

48
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,910
you hired Tom Because Bert Kreischer
wasn't available? Yes. The damaged,

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,670
don't tell me that, man. That's what
I heard. Well, and he was asking,

50
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,560
he was asking for a lot of money, a lot
more than where it is. It's lofty with,

51
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,670
it's like he's like, whatever
Mark's gets, I want double up.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,520
And then they were like,
we can't do it.
