1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,450
Yeah, those are the old days,
man. We used to have a guy,

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:08,310
I remember they had a guy who chiseled
some tits into a, um, mine, a pine tree,

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:10,440
maybe a birch or something and people,
we'd go out there.

4
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,860
And do you recall whether that no
joke off at the base of the tree. He,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,620
I think he used like a step stool
or something or sat on a barrel.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,160
That's when you found all the
magazines and the woods. Oh yeah.

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:20,994
We used to have that.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,330
But you go out on the train and somebody
will be using the tree and be like,

9
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:29,130
Oh fuck, I've got to walk
back home now. It's 100% real.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,760
You're making this up. You have
photographs? This tree? No. Why not?

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,780
Do you know where it is? Could you
take us back there with a film crew?

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,120
I could take you back there with
a film crew. I bet. I bet it's,

13
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,240
it devolved now though.
How long does it trade live?

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,760
Go back there and touch the thing and
all of a sudden you can't find your way

15
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:49,020
back home. Where the fuck are we?
How does we're going in a circle

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,140
like it turns out that the tree got tired
of people jerk off on it so it evolves

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,460
some sort of a neuro toxic.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,610
Then when you touched it,
it got into your bloodstream.

19
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:07,611
It distorted your perception of distance
and time and then they go skiing,

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,480
but do what if you would've come,
could divide.

21
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,490
They would've seen and could defy gravity.
What do you think about that? I don't,

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,330
but you know what I do think.
Imagine if it wasn't,

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,800
if come didn't just get humans pregnant.
Yeah.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,580
Oh No.
That's what I think of a mass.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,790
Calm frogs to chickens I
give everywhere you went,

26
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,010
you found God. Let's do it. Fucked a
turtle. You following some turtle person.

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,280
He got a rocking.
You can't think about that man.

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,700
You imagine if anything
could get anything pregnant.

29
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,980
Then a new combination was
born turtle people too. That's
what's next. Coy People.

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,290
Some do fucked a coy. Yeah, busted into
that. Cory. Mom knocked that point.

31
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,870
We imagine you're out there throwing
bread on your Koi pond. You're like, hey,

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,840
it has legs. What the fuck, man?

33
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,040
Somebody fuck one eat
fish up on the shore.

34
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,390
It's got a sign for you.

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,360
People see people see you at the pet
store shopping and they're like, Whoa,

36
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:10,980
this guy's shady is smashing.

37
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,640
If Ari fucked it and it came out and
we knew it because that always knows.

38
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,080
So it's like always knows on a Koi fish
with legs and it comes out and you're

39
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:23,720
like, oh sorry your business.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,790
I'm going to Bali. You
Imagine? Yeah, I'm going to,

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,890
can we go find where we're turtle
babies on the other side of the world,

42
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,870
but if you had to make love to an animal,
what would it be?

43
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:38,430
If you think he had to go in and they'll
be something I could brag about. Yeah.

44
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,820
I'm not fucking anything sedentary. I'm
not fucking anything that's like a basic,

45
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,150
something ends up in the poultry
section or anything like that. No.

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,280
Be have to be a female.
What have you had gay sex with an animal.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,130
Which animal would it be? That's not
gate a fucking animal, Bro. It's not.

48
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,180
I don't think that applies to your
fucking an animal that's more important.

49
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,780
If it's a like a male gorilla.
I think it's both. Aw Dude,

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,340
gay beastiality. Nobody's
going to be like, oh, remember
when you yes, they would.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,770
They haven't let you off. The
people are mean. They going to go.

52
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:10,630
Not only did he fuck a chip, he fucked a
mail chimp and everybody would be like,

53
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,890
Jesus, Theo, bro,

54
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,350
you would never buy a beer again. You
put, you want to break the Internet.

55
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,770
You put a fucking video of me sneaking
up on a Cheetah and fucking it wrap,

56
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,950
wrapping a noose around its
neck and you're banging it
while it's clawing on yet.

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,220
Just trying to get away and you'll nut.
Nah,

58
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,400
I'm talking about putting on some Eddie
lavert or some Gerald levert and playing

59
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:37,960
some sweet music and just working on
their plan on holding it in place.

60
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,870
While that's all happening, I think if
you're good enough and general enough,

61
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,960
it'll stay. Wow. You don't think so?

62
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,360
Think about it to you for
a 10 match in it though.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,150
I love to look at the
world through your eyes.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,840
10 when they take you right to the
hospital. Whatever medication we're on,

65
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:57,430
we got to change it. We've got to fix this
pro. You should meet yourself then, bro,

66
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,850
you are extra terrestrial man.
