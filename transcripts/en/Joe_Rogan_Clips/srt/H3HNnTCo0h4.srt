1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,110
The joe rogan experience.
You know what's crazy like?

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,840
I always say to you like,
oh,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,980
I don't mean to pronounce his
name wrong and let them go. Right?

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,800
Like when he fought steel picking
Dano Ugad on when he fought my mat.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,100
Immigrant mentality. Like
a motherfucker. Yeah,

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:18,960
he hits hard and all that stuff like that,

7
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,750
but now that dude's still
going to be more dangerous.

8
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,890
Now he's gonna fucking take that loss
and come back down man fucking machines.

9
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:30,330
You gotta think how crazy it is that he
went from being a guy who was homeless

10
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,900
too five years later fighting
for the heavyweight title.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,560
This is like a total amount of training,
five years of elementary training,

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,860
fighting for the heavyweight title,
and he's the favorite.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,690
He's the favorite over guys.
He defended it twice. I mean,

14
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:49,890
it's crazy. That's how talented
he is. That's how terrifying is.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,080
That's how special he is.
But Oh,

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,090
a loss like that to a guide like that
to a real champ like Steve Bay at that,

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,980
once you realize where the top
of the game is, there's another,

18
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,930
there's a few more things to learn.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,380
There's a lot more days to get in and
training, but that guy has just begun.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,680
He's just began five years ago.
He didn't know shit.

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,850
He's way better now than he was two
fights ago. Yeah, I see the difference.

22
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,940
I see the difference in the way he moves.
When he fought Overeem,

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,170
it was since significantly different than
when I saw him in his first and second

24
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:23,670
fights as first second fights.

25
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:27,210
He was very good but just insanely strong.

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,920
He would hit guys with these combinations
and clean technique to man. He's like,

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,560
he's not just a physically strong guy.

28
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,390
He's also very smart because he's
learning to do everything mechanically.

29
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,440
Very good.

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,280
It's not like a guy who's only been
striking for like three or four years,

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,700
so they look a little tight and weird,
but they can if they land,

32
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:51,760
they got a lot of power. Nah Man,
everything is clean. Like you said,

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,680
some Gig of those trenches, Jack. Oh
Dude. That type of work gets you a tough,

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,730
he's tough. He's just a special
athlete and if he keeps going, man,

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,650
I mean sh boy,
that guy.

36
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:05,040
Learning more to think about how
little you learn in five years.

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,690
Most of these guys have way more
time in way more time in wrestling,

38
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,010
way more time in kickboxing. The
average guy, by time it gets to the UFC,

39
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:18,120
I would like to know what the number
is like how many years of training and

40
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:22,980
competing they have, but it's
gotta be more than two like he was.

41
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,160
He was like right in the
UFC and smashing people.

42
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,230
It's his amazing story, man. It's an
amazing story and for a lot of people,

43
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,910
the way it ended is a good lesson for
martial artists. It's a good lesson.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,540
See what, even if you weren't in Gyn,
who fan, you're bummed out that he lost.

45
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,200
I appreciate that. I'm going
and gone. Who Fan the fan too,

46
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:46,920
but I'm more of a fan of
mixed martial arts. I, I'm a,

47
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:50,890
I'm a fan of an honest,
like extreme,

48
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,440
like I wanna I want to know what it
is. Like what, what is this like?

49
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,740
What's this? What's this
contest right here? What's,
what's actually going on here?

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,380
What's going on here is
phenomenal athletic talent,

51
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,240
massive potential.

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Like Super Alpha athlete versus one of
the toughest guys ever who's been in the

53
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,970
game longer. Who knows more. He's
wrestled. He's been fighting way more.

54
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,820
He's been in the trenches way more times.
He said dig deep.

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,040
He knows what it's like to be really
hurt and tired in a fight. She,

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,040
I appreciate the strategy of like how
do you go into fight a guy like perfect.

57
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,090
It was like rocky against Mr T.
Yeah, that's what exactly was like.

58
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,630
So it was like heart and
fucking a little smart.

59
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,040
Stay away from that punch. It had to be
and I, I haven't watched the full fight,

60
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,770
you know I was working then man.
I don't want them fucking stage.

61
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,450
My brother getting hit by France.
It's in Ghana. We put MMA gloves,

62
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,860
worst thing that can happen to a person.

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,740
He's terrifying and Steve Bay got
cracked multiple times in that fight.

64
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:58,300
It sounds like you didn't get hit. He
got cracked, but he had made up his mind.

65
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,950
He was going nowhere. He knew what to
do. He'd been there before. That's an,

66
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,990
that's an incredible lesson,
which just for the overall, the,

67
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,680
the sport for the,

68
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,740
for mixed martial arts in general and
the lesson is like he figured out like he

69
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,380
had like the craziest end of
video game character ever. Right?

70
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:20,860
And God was like the big, like the big
boss in a video game that like, fuck,

71
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,310
I got to fly.

72
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,050
I got to play against this guy that's
in Gado and steep a figured out how to

73
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,880
beat him being 20 plus pounds
lighter than him, you know, way,

74
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,310
way less intimidating in terms of his
physical presence. All those steep based,

75
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:39,670
pretty fucking intimidating,
but in Ghana was so intimidating.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,440
He's so next level two 65
natural giant crazy frame.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,820
You look at it when you're
next to steep batch,

78
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,510
when you realize how big
is too big fell on TV.

79
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,770
You don't look that big when you're next
to him. Be like, this guy's a big fuck.

80
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,420
He's a big fuck you. You're walking around
his asset is his mind though, James?

81
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:01,340
Yes. Yes. Come on. Yeah, I've been
talking to him. I get mentality. Fucking,

82
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,580
you talked about the Wikipedia page dog.

83
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:07,210
I told you immigrant mentality
with media page. Listen,

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,190
American ingenuity is fucking brilliant.
And with the immigrant mentality mix,

85
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,750
like let's say you're still am American,
but it that could have called you Steve,

86
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,760
but he could still call them steep and
Mayo chick to remember where the fuck do

87
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:24,180
you came from. You understand me? His
father came. That's really a weird,

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,380
okay.
