1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,860
Try My day, Joe Rogan podcast
by night all day. Do you think,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,980
what's the short drive?
It? What's the shit?

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:11,790
You've had a long career in MMA long and
successful career, but it's very rare.

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,580
It's very rare for someone to be
operating at the same level that you're

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,430
operating in is like the cutoff.
Like once you get to about seven,

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,020
everything starts to just rapidly
declined. Like he'd just fall to shit.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,220
Do you think it's an injury thing? Is
it a training thing? Is it just a life?

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,240
They didn't, they didn't, uh,

9
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:33,830
or at least they weren't able to single
out any particular factor in, in general.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,820
But you know, there was a lot of
theories as to why that might be,

11
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:42,710
but they were able to track, uh,
professional fighters careers, uh,

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,640
over length of time. I think they had
some metro having, I don't remember,

13
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:50,430
but it's on the, it's on
the Internet. Uh, it, uh,

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,580
I do believe that they accounted,

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,300
they were able to account for a number
of fights too and weigh that against that

16
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:58,520
metric and see how that
may influence things.

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,150
But seven years was this magic
number, like six, seven years.

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,390
And once you start going over
seven years, your, your success,

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,690
your percentage of success
started just crumbling.

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,950
Like it was dramatic about how a guy
would be like 13 and three and he'd get to

21
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:16,910
seven years, then all of a sudden
it's like 13, six, 13, seven, 13.

22
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,810
He just starts losing just
about everything. Yeah.

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,110
Bj Penn's good example of that. Right.
You know, look, there's certain,

24
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:28,350
there's a certain drop off where the
person just looks totally different and,

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,700
and you know, we could
honestly look, it would be,

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,430
we would have to isolate a lot of
different factors to figure out any one

27
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,264
particular thing.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,680
But there's so many elements that go into
being a professional fighter and being

29
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:43,280
successful at that. And so for let's
say we'll take Bj, you know, maybe,

30
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:46,490
maybe it is physicality,
maybe he's lost a little bit of a step.

31
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,830
His reactions are a little slower,
uh,

32
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,250
through any number of
reasons why maybe his,

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,490
his strength has diminished
maybe slightly or is flexibility,

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,500
maybe certain physical elements regardless
of injury or not have diminished

35
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,560
enough that at where they used to be.

36
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:06,190
It was an edge where it is now is,

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,280
is evened out or is or is below what is
necessary for him and how he fights to

38
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:16,070
be successful. Uh, maybe could
be beyond physical deterioration.

39
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:20,060
Maybe it's just mental. Yeah, exactly.

40
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,780
So maybe he's just not as motivated to
push in the same ways that he was or

41
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:28,440
maybe he's not able to,
I dunno, recognize, uh,

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,210
things that he was five years ago,
six years ago,

43
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,390
and seeing those opportunities and
being able to react on them quicker. Uh,

44
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,590
there's a number of things and
especially when it comes to mental now,

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,390
now you're getting into such a
subjective area that, you know, go,

46
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,260
go, pull that apart.
That's a really good point.

47
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:52,220
The mental aspect is a really good point
because who knows, you know, the only,

48
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:55,760
the only the person that's competing
knows, we really never have any idea how,

49
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,950
what's going on inside a
person. Yeah. I mean, for me,

50
00:02:57,951 --> 00:03:02,951
I decided to take a after my Arlovski
fight and that was somewhat physically

51
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:07,240
based, but uh, most of it was
mental. I, uh, I just didn't,

52
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,590
I had no interest to go into any kind of
training camp to put myself through all

53
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:15,550
that again to then to fight again.
You know,

54
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:20,170
it's just for one when you start off
fighting and what those goals are too,

55
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,860
as you get further in and further
in and further in and, you know,

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,060
getting it 20 years of being a
professional fighter and being a top 10

57
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,680
heavyweight, uh, and arguably
and top five most of the time for

58
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,240
Shit, 16 of them, something like that.

59
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,520
At a high level competition. Yeah.
And uh, it's just, and youngest,

60
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:47,350
every UFC heavyweight champion,
that's right. Until that,
that, that son of a bitch,

61
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:51,280
Jon Jones came and beat me out by a
few months. That talented bastard.

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,060
Now you're the youngest ever.
Yeah,

63
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,490
just heavyweight champion instead of
the youngest ever UFC champion. But, um.
