1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,410
When,
when you,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,330
when you sync that these jobs are going
to be automated and then universal basic

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,470
income is going to supplement their in,
it's going to give them some money,

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,040
$1,000 a month. But where do
they go from there? I mean,

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,550
how do people exist on $12,000 a year?
Like what do they do?

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,620
Like how do they adapt to this new world?

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,760
Right?

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,910
So the first thing you have to do is you
have to look at what lies ahead if we

9
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,980
do nothing, right? Uh, so the,

10
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,330
the way it's going to play out is that
self driving trucks are slowly going to

11
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,610
start hating on highways.
Amazon's testing them out right now.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,330
And the first stage is going to be that
there is a human driver just sitting

13
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,500
there as a fail safe and the
truck's going to drive itself. Uh,

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,090
now my friends in Silicon Valley
are working on tele operators, um,

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,230
which is, so the trucks have right
now, like a 98% accuracy level,

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,850
which is not very high because you can't
have 2% semi trucks like running into

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,290
things like the roads.
So,

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,350
so the way they're trying to get the
last percent or so is there equipping

19
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,070
trucks with tele operating software,
which means that a trucker,

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,590
a tele operator in Nevada or Arizona,

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,590
we'll beam into the truck and just be
able to see out the front like a video

22
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:13,920
game, uh, like uh, let you
know it's like drone operating,

23
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:18,320
but instead of the truck and you beam in
and then you just steer the truck until

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,310
the computer. It's like I got it
from here and then you beam out.

25
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,010
That's what they're working on to try and
catch that last bit of uncertainty. Uh,

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,110
so the innovations are
happening and again, Joe,

27
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:30,060
we're talking about $168 billion a year.

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,680
Like everything becomes possible when
you're looking at that much money.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,380
So in the absence of
anyone doing anything,

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,940
the robot trucks will start
reducing shifts of various truckers.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,120
I would say six to 10 years from now.

32
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,240
And so then there'll be a
bunch of reactions. Now,

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,320
trucking firms already
have massive shortages.

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,880
They can't find enough people.

35
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,290
That's one reason why they're trying to
automate this job as fast as they are

36
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,300
because they're literally like,
you know,

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,840
they're short like a couple of
hundred thousand truckers right now.

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,260
And people don't want to go into
this field for a variety of reasons.

39
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:11,460
The main thing being it's
like extraordinarily brutal
on new, physically very,

40
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:15,820
very bad for your family life too, because
you're away all the time. Yeah. Uh,

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,850
something like 88% of truckers have an
early marker for chronic disease, like,

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,940
oh, like substance
abuse, diabetes, obesity,

43
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,890
high blood pressure or
something along those lines.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,950
And now people think that the jobs going
to disappear in the next five to 10

45
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,430
years. You can't get people
in. So if you play out,

46
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:35,610
what happens when the robot
trucks start reducing shifts,

47
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,000
then there'll be people trying
to flee the field of trucking.

48
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,050
And then if it becomes really dramatic
where the robot start driving,

49
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:48,051
let's say between western Pennsylvania
and Nevada and then human beings get in

50
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,530
in those states and then take it the rest
of the way because the robots won't be

51
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,720
reliable enough to drive an urban areas.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,110
There'll be reliable enough to drive on
an interstate or they just have to make

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,550
a few decisions,
uh,

54
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,900
then there'll be a massive depletion
of truck driving opportunities.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
And then in my mind,
a lot of suicides,

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,070
a lot of self destruction.
And I don't say that lightly.

57
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,040
I say that based upon the fact that
that's what happened in the manufacturing

58
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,580
workers where if you unpack what
happened to the manufacturing workers of

59
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:21,370
Michigan, Ohio, Indiana,

60
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,990
suicide rates spiked to a point where
now our life expectancy as a country has

61
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:30,370
declined for the last three years because
of suicides and drug overdoses. Uh,

62
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:35,140
it's the first time that's happened since
the great flu pandemic of 1918 like we

63
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,260
are actually coming apart
as a country by the numbers.

64
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,560
So what happened to the manufacturer
and grooves will then happen to the

65
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,890
truckers,
but at a it even more dramatic scale.

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,820
So you'll see truckers just going home
and drinking themselves to death or, uh,

67
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,630
doing drugs and overdosing
or killing themselves. Uh,

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,910
and then eventually there'll be an
outbreak of violence because some truckers

69
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:01,840
will say, instead of killing myself, how
about I go bust up a robot truck? Uh,

70
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,130
and there are already truckers that
are doing things like blocking Tesla

71
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,380
recharging stations
and electronic vehicle,

72
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,800
a battery stations because they
don't like electronic trucks. Sword.

73
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,430
Those are pickup trucks though.
Those are assholes.

74
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,430
I mean this is not like
people doing it because they,

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,850
they think that these Tesla recharge
stations are taking jobs away.

76
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:26,830
They're just being dickheads. Exactly.
Joe. So if you're going to be a dickhead,

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,110
even though it really has
nothing to do with you,

78
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,770
imagine when you actually think your
livelihood is being threatened. Right.

79
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,710
Good point. Then you can see
it getting revved up, you know,

80
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,380
to like a much higher level.
So,

81
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,220
so I'm running for president in large
part because I think we need to get in

82
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,130
front of this set of problems.
We have to say, look,

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,130
if we're going to save
$168 billion a year,

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,970
maybe some of that should go to the
truckers and give them a soft landing.

85
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,140
Maybe we should have this universal
basic income where everyone feels like

86
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,810
they're getting 1000 bucks a month,
which is not a work replacement.

87
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,930
It's not going to make their lives easy.
They still need to work,

88
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,290
but at least it takes the edge off. It
takes like the existential threat off. Um,

89
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,430
and also their kids getting
it. So they feel like, okay,

90
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:13,270
my kid actually has some kind of path to
the future and it's not like if I lose

91
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,770
this trucking job, not only am I going
to, you know, struggle and suffer,

92
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,230
but my kid will too. So, uh,

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,390
my plan as president is to install
a trucker. Transitions are and say,

94
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,440
look, it is your job to try and manage
this transition for the three and a half

95
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,000
million truckers.
And Joe,

96
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:35,620
we haven't even talked about the 5
million Americans who work at truck stops,

97
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,440
motels,
diners,

98
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,090
retail establishment is all the places
where the truckers stop every day just to

99
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,960
get out,
eat a meal and live a life mean.

100
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:51,250
If you imagine those communities,
when the trucks don't stop,

101
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,820
there's going to be a drying
up of economic vitality.

102
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,100
On a level that's unprecedented.
Many of these communities.

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,810
This is something that I,
I'm just becoming aware of
over the last year or two.

104
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,250
Um, how, when when you were out on
the campaign trail and you know,

105
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:09,800
you're talking to media and you're
discussing this with people,

106
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,490
how many people have no
idea that this is coming?

107
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,180
Well, what I say to
people, Joe, is I say, Hey,

108
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:19,840
have you noticed stores closing on your
main street? And then they say yes.

109
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,310
Then I asked them why is that?

110
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,730
And then they reflect for
a minute and then they say
Amazon. And I was like, yeah,

111
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:29,620
that's right. It was us getting
$20 billion of commerce every year.

112
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,880
And it's now tipping your malls and main
street stories into oblivion and like

113
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:35,230
is that going to get better or worse?

114
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,110
Cause so some people say
it's like hop the robots,

115
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,090
the robots are years away
and then you're like, no,

116
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:43,300
it's not robots actually like walking
around your neighborhood. I mean,

117
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,680
of course that's unlikely.

118
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,940
But Amazon soaking up the business
that used to go to your mall.

119
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,340
If you go to their fulfillment center,

120
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,450
it's robots as far as the eye
can see if you go to their uh,

121
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,410
their warehouse, you know, it's also
robots as far as far as the eye can see.

122
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,100
So when you ask how aware are
people that this is happening,

123
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,360
it's one of those truths that as soon as
you pointed out, they're like, oh yeah,

124
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:07,741
like I,

125
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:12,430
I knew that was what was up is just for
whatever reason I'm like the only person

126
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,690
just laying out the facts and being
like, guys, it's not your imagination.

127
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,580
Like we actually are getting rid of
the most common jobs in the U s economy

128
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,780
filled by high school graduates and then
replacing them with a handful of jobs

129
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:28,540
for higher skilled people
in different places.

130
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,490
And then we're pretending that the first
population is somehow going to access

131
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:37,990
the new opportunities when the odds of
them getting up and moving to Seattle or

132
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:42,991
whatnot and becoming a web designer or
like logistics manager or a big data

133
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,020
scientist or something
like essentially near zero.

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,550
And so this is what gave rise to a
lot of the anger that got Donald Trump

135
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,340
elected because they looked around
their communities and we're like, hey,

136
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,470
I used to work in this
manufacturing plant.

137
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,040
This manufacturing plant no
longer exists for whatever reason.

138
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,300
Like I'm being told that it's somehow
like my fault that I wasn't adaptable

139
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,920
enough. Like I didn't, you know,

140
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,110
I didn't somehow become a
coders or something ridiculous.

141
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,221
Then I have to say,
Joe,

142
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:15,670
and this is like something that
I've picked up from Dennis and part.

143
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:19,460
So I'm with this trucker in Iowa
and he says to me, he says like,

144
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,910
I don't think that Democrats
care about people like me. Uh,

145
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,320
and he says that to me while I'm
in his truck and I'm just like,

146
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,270
I can understand why he feels that way.

147
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:33,271
But that's incredibly destructive because
there is a point at which Democratic

148
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,440
Party used to be very, very heavily
aligned with working class Americans.

149
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,700
And there's now it's some kind of a
pathology that if the person who is

150
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:48,160
suffering is a white man of a certain
background than the suffering somehow is

151
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,080
like somehow like diminished.

152
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,070
Like it doesn't count as much
if they're a trucker. Uh,

153
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,710
and that's something that
I find really destructive.

154
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,060
It's like we have to start acknowledging
the source of the problems.

155
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:04,200
One thing I'm saying to people is like,
look,

156
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,090
it's not immigrants that
are taking these jobs away.

157
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,400
Like just facts that is not immigrants.

158
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,320
It is the fact that technology is pushing
our economy in a direction that makes

159
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:16,770
it harder and harder for many Americans
to get by based upon this current,

160
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,040
I trade my time for money model now
truckers seemed to be the big one,

161
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:27,240
right? Yeah. A cashiers are another
one. Yeah. Um, what are the other job?

162
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,570
The jobs that are going to be
killed by automation. So the,

163
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,490
the next obvious one is call
center workers. Of course,

164
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,760
where there are two and a half million
call center worker is still in the United

165
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,730
States. Generally high school
graduates, they make about $14 an hour.

166
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,690
Now when you and I call a company were
like pounding keys trying to get a human

167
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,740
because the AI is so annoying, you
know, it's like, Hey, but you know,

168
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:53,850
just like gimme gimme a person. Uh,
but over the next number of months,

169
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,320
AI is going to become industry
indistinguishable from a person. Yeah.

170
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,170
Like the new Google answering service
that comes with the pixel phones.

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,580
It's amazing.
Yes.

172
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,200
And so that two and a half million call
center population is going to shrink a

173
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,150
ton because after you get AI software,
that's better than one of them. You know,

174
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,570
it can be most all of them, you
know, that's not like 5,000 jobs.

175
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,760
That's potentially 500,000 jobs.

176
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,510
I was at a conference of CEOs and I asked
how many of them are looking at having

177
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:27,270
AI replace back office workers
like various clerical functions.

178
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,540
Every single hand went up.
There's going to be a lot of

179
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,240
clerical work, having systems talk to
each other that's going to disappear.

180
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,570
And one CIO type of like a major bank
said that his estimate was that's about

181
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:46,320
30% of the bank's workers
fall into that category.

182
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,150
So you're looking at call center workers,

183
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,390
you're looking at back office worker
as you're looking at insurance brokers.

184
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,440
Insurance is a very highly automateable
industry cause it's a lot of information

185
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:59,790
getting passed back and forth.
Cashiers, as you said, truck drivers,

186
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,110
delivery drivers, Uber drivers. Uh,

187
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,160
did it goes even as far
as medical procedures.

188
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,780
There was a recent automated a medical
procedure where they did surgery on a

189
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:12,960
grape. Yes. Yeah. You see
that? Yeah, I saw that.

190
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:17,961
And China's already had just a complete
automated dental implantation because

191
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:23,420
China actually has a real shortage of
surgeons and so their incentives to try

192
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:27,510
and automate this are very, very high.
Now the interesting thing here, Joe,

193
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:30,210
is that let's say I made a robot
surgeon tomorrow that was awesome,

194
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,430
could do better work than a lot of people.
Um,

195
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,940
right now the economic incentives still
are not necessarily for everyone to use

196
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:40,680
my robot surgeon because the regulations
aren't there yet in the u s and so

197
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:42,270
healthcare is a really interesting one.

198
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,420
Another one that's very clearly going
to get taken up by Ai is radiology and

199
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:52,320
looking at tumors on a film because it
turns out that AI can see shades of gray

200
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,770
that a human eye cannot.

201
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,540
And it can reference millions of films
where the most experienced doctor can

202
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,680
probably reference thousands.
And so radiology, I'll tell you,

203
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,040
medical students are running from
radiology as fast as they can because they

204
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:09,550
know that's going to get taken up by Ai.
Man,

205
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,370
this is such a bleak forecast.

206
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,490
It's very strange when we stop and think
about all the different things that

207
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:20,470
human beings find value in as far as
their occupation. Like, Hey, I'm a this,

208
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,670
I'm a,
that this is what I do.

209
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:25,120
And that the idea that these things
are all gonna go away, it's very,

210
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:28,300
it's kind of disturbing. Oh, and when
I was digging into the research show,

211
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:32,050
it's been happening and it's tearing us
apart. I mean, I referenced the fact that,

212
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,690
so here are some things that
are all taught at halt all time.

213
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:38,650
Our multi decade highs right now in
the United States of America, suicide,

214
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,510
drug overdoses, uh,
anxiety and depression,

215
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,170
mental problems, uh, financial insecurity,

216
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,180
people being unable to pay their bills,

217
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,530
all of these things are at
record highs in one thing I,

218
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:55,300
I know you've talked about in the
past that I think you'd really find

219
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,720
fascinating.
So there has been,

220
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,990
there have been studies as to what happens
to your mind when you can't pay your

221
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:05,920
bills and when you can't pay your bills,
you're like stressing out. It's like,

222
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:07,360
if I pay this,
I can't pay that.

223
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,520
And there was like always the time
money trade off. It's like, Oh,

224
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:13,720
if I spend extra time commuting,
maybe I can save a couple bucks. Uh,

225
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,260
and so what it does is it actually
constrains your bandwidth to a point that

226
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:21,850
your functional Iq goes down by 13
points or one standard deviation.

227
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,060
So just if you say to someone,
Hey, here's a bill you can't pay.

228
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:26,300
And then you give them an Iq test,

229
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,770
their score actually goes
down by 13 points a lot.

230
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,580
That's like a really huge effect. And
so what we're doing right now, Joe,

231
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:38,200
is we're actually making our population
less rational, less reasonable,

232
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,700
more impulsive, more subject
to bad ideas, Nastier,

233
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,780
more subject to things like racism and
misogyny too because it turns out what

234
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:51,130
happens with most of us is
you need executive functioning
to resist like racist

235
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,200
and massage,
misogynistic impulses.

236
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,710
And so if I make you cash strapped and
make it so you can't pay your bills,

237
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:01,090
you're actually more likely to be like,
yeah, like, yeah, like blame them.

238
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,220
So what your, what we're talking about,
again, it's not the speculative future,

239
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,760
it's that we've been doing this for
years and it's actually pushing our

240
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:13,390
population into a mindset
of scarcity of nastiness.

241
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,430
And that's why universal basic income is
so crucial because it gets the boot off

242
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:22,480
of people's throats and it replaces the
mindset of scarcity with a mindset of

243
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:27,481
abundance and rationality
and optimism and capacity.

244
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,780
Like I'm an entrepreneur. You're an
entrepreneur. I'll tell you, very,

245
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:35,560
very few entrepreneurs start businesses.
At a scarcity where they're like, oh,

246
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:38,950
I can't pay my bills. I guess I'm not
like starting a new company like that,

247
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,180
that like most of them,

248
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,560
but $1,000 a month isn't even enough
money for most people to pay for the rent.

249
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,400
Well, the great thing is, again, this
thousand dollars is yours no matter what.

250
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,980
So right now, let's say you're,
you're doing a normal job. Um,

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,900
so if you make $1 million a year, he's
still got $1,000 a month. Yes. Yes you do.

252
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,540
I mean, it's opt in so you
could opt in and take it,

253
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,810
which most Americans would because
it's still 1000 bucks a month. Yeah.

254
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,290
People get greedy. Yeah. For sure. Yeah.

255
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:11,180
Thousand Dollars to get my
nails done. Yes. Or give it
away. If they were, you know,

256
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,810
they felt like it. Yeah.
Yeah. But the, this,

257
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,660
so those are the things that
are at like all time highs.

258
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,460
It's like all these
negative social indicators.

259
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,150
Here are things that are at all
time, lows, getting married,

260
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,610
starting a business, having
a kid, moving for a new job.

261
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,810
All of those things are at historic lows
in the United States of America having

262
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,040
children. Really? Yeah.

263
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:37,790
We're at record low birth rates right
now and it's largely because people feel

264
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,820
too strapped to have kids.
I mean that's literally where we are.

265
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,050
When you say record low by
like what percentage you can
look up right now, Jamie,

266
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:46,340
I don't know if you want to look this up,

267
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,750
but stories have come out over this last
year or saying that Americans are now

268
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,030
at the lowest rate of childbirth.

269
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:56,360
That has been the case in decades or ever.
Yeah,

270
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:59,180
that's a conversation that I have with
people whenever they say that they're

271
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,500
worried about population,

272
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,550
that the population is growing so
fast and overpopulate here it goes.

273
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,360
1.8 births per woman,

274
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,790
2016 what does that mean?

275
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,970
So it's dropping from 1970 at a high.

276
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,760
Well, it seems fairly, fairly
similar from 1980 to today.

277
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,140
That's still,
I mean that's,

278
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,760
it's actually like if it
goes from 1.8 till like uh,

279
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,940
if it goes from even something like 1.9
to 1.8 is like a pretty significant drop

280
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,530
us birth dip to 30 year low fertility
rates sink further below replacement

281
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,280
level.

282
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,660
And so you think it's about the thought
is that this is because of education and

283
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:48,200
this is because of people are waiting
longer to have children and that this is a

284
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,210
byproduct of industrialization and modern
world and that the more educated and

285
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,260
affluent people get,

286
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,100
the less likely they are to have
children then it's not the site.

287
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,620
As far as what everything I've read about
it is that that it's not a symptom of

288
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,550
people doing poorly.
It's a symptom of people doing well.

289
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,230
You know there,

290
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,260
there are definitely cases where Richard
countries just have fewer kids and

291
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:14,570
that's cool because they concentrate on
their careers, right? It's not the idea.

292
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,880
But the darker part of this,
Joe,

293
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:21,881
is that right now if you're a non college
educated person in the United States,

294
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:26,150
the odds of you are ever getting married
less than 50% now for the first time

295
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,600
ever. And then people are
having fewer kids. To play
devil's advocate though, the,

296
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,770
the marriage thing might be
people looking at it and go, God,

297
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:37,280
my parents got divorced, my brother got
divorced, everybody else got divorced.

298
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:40,720
What the fuck am I doing? There are a
lot of good reasons for it. It's just,

299
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,810
you know, as a, as a happily
married man and myself, me
as well, I always tell them,

300
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,180
don't do it. I tell people don't do it.
It's just, it's too risky. Yeah. So,

301
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,860
so you can look at,
to me,

302
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,060
certainly to me getting married and
having kids like an act of like prosperity

303
00:17:57,061 --> 00:17:59,730
or optimism, there are reasons
why it's going down otherwise.

304
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,160
But if you look at things
like starting a new business,

305
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,520
I mean that being at multi decade lows,
there's like no positive spin on that,

306
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,470
right? People moving between
states is now at multi decade lows.

307
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,200
Uh, people moving for a
new job, multi decade lows.

308
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,330
They think this is the product of
automation or it's a product of a bunch of

309
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:23,331
different factors like Internet purchasing
and marketing and think people buying

310
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:29,130
most of their goods. And it's a range
of factors. But one of the big problems,

311
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:29,970
and keep in mind,

312
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:34,971
I spent seven years helping entrepreneurs
grow businesses in 18 cities around

313
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:38,970
the country, between 2011,
2017 that was actually my job.

314
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,860
My job was to be the job creator guy.

315
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,040
And so when you go out to these places,

316
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,400
you see that the dynamism is getting
sucked up by certain markets to a level

317
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,500
that's unprecedented in
our history like that,

318
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:57,501
that the disparities between Cleveland
and San Francisco or Saint Louis and La

319
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,420
are much, much higher than they've
been at any other historical period,

320
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,530
both by the numbers. And like after you
actually go to the places you're like,

321
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:11,310
wow, like this is not a
flourishing the way that you hope.

322
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,520
Do you feel like an economic
Paul revere in a certain sense,

323
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,900
like the robots are coming, the robots are
coming? I do. Uh, it's weird, man. Well,

324
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:23,370
what the comparison I make is that if
the United States economy is like an

325
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,850
elephant, you know, the parable
of the people, like, you know,

326
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:31,350
blind people touching the elephant.
So I'm, I'm an entrepreneur.

327
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:35,460
I sold a company to a public company
that was a national education company,

328
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:39,050
is based in New York. What
does the parable, blind people
touching an elephant. Uh,

329
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,450
so what happens is a,
they're,

330
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,590
they're like seven blind men and
they get asked like, what is the,

331
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,940
what does an elephant look like?

332
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,940
And then one of them is touching the
trunk and is like an elephant looks like a

333
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:50,850
snake and another one's touching his leg
and it's like an elephant looks like a

334
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,350
tree trunk.
Uh,

335
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,410
so that's the way most people experience
the economy is that they're like

336
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,060
touching a part of the
economy and they're like,

337
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:58,890
this is what it looks like or feels like.

338
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,470
So I've had this really strange set
of experiences where I sold, uh,

339
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,060
a national education
company to a public company.

340
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,470
I lived by coastally between New York and
San Francisco for the last five years.

341
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,070
I've operated in 18 cities
around the country. I was, uh,

342
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,220
I was an appointee in the
Obama administration in DC.

343
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:21,120
So I've actually seen the elephant, if
you know what I mean. Like I holo. Yeah.

344
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,610
Like I'm, I'm like hanging out with, uh,

345
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:26,760
the tech wizards and Silicon
Valley and I'm like, Hey, you know,

346
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:29,270
we can automate these jobs
away. And they're like, oh
yeah, we're going to the job.

347
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,260
Like it's, you know, so it's not a mystery
and they're not bad people. It's like,

348
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:35,610
Hey,
it's my job to like made stuff.

349
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,620
And if you gave me a choice between
making things work better and creating

350
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,470
abundant opportunities for the
other people, I would choose that.

351
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,410
But I do not have that choice. I have
a job to do, you know, this is my job.

352
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,540
And what I tell people is
like, whose responsibility
is it to go tell the people,

353
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,280
look,
it's technology.

354
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:57,970
It's transformed the economy
in fundamental ways and
we need to make it so that

355
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,260
everyone benefits.

356
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:02,480
And it's not just that this like hyper
concentrated set of winners and then this

357
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:04,600
like huge army of,

358
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,690
of relative losers and
it's the government's job.

359
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,840
But at this point we've given up
on our government as anything,

360
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,410
like it can't really do anything.
And so now it's no one's job.

361
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,690
And so somehow Joe, it has become my
job and it blows my mind too. Sometimes.
