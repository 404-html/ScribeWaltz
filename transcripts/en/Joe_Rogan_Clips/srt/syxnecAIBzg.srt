1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,850
I got that in Mexico.
I was hoping it holds joints.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,170
Does it do anything it takes to open hall
would be a good size to hold joints or

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,133
not.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,920
So is that a joint
or is it a cigar?

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,330
No.
Okay.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,510
It's um, marijuana inside
of a tobacco. Okay.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,270
So it's like plush plot tobacco
pause. Never had that. Yeah.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,040
I think I tried one once.
Come on man.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,820
Probably camp cause stockholders,
right? I mean it's legal, right?

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,640
It's totally legal.
Okay. How does that work?

11
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,950
Do People get upset at you
if you do certain things?

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,600
A backhoe and marijuana in there.
That's all it is.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,033
Okay.

14
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,180
Did the combination of tobacco
and marijuana is wonderful?

15
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,980
First turned onto it by Charlie Murphy
and then reignited by Dave Chappelle.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,940
Hey plus whiskey. Exactly. Perfect.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,730
Balances it out. Oh yeah. Alcohol is
a drug that's been grandfathered in.

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,380
Well,
it's not just a drug,

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,650
it's a drug that gets a bad rap
because you could just have a little,

20
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:15,940
it's crate fine. Yeah.
Little sip here and there.

21
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:19,900
And you just see your inhibitions are
relaxed and it shows your true self and

22
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:23,800
hopefully you're more joyous. And
friendly and happy and everything's good.

23
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,610
The real worry is the
people that can't handle it,

24
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:32,020
like the real worried about people who
can't handle cars that can go zero to 60

25
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:34,270
in 1.9 seconds or anything.

26
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:40,260
Have you ever considered something that
like imagine if one day everyone has a

27
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,030
car that's on the same,

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,090
at least technological standard is one
of your cars and everyone agrees that the

29
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:53,590
smart thing to do is not just to have
bumpers but to perhaps have some sort of a

30
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:56,140
magnetic repellent device,
something,

31
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,820
some electro magnetic field around the
cars. As cars come close to each other,

32
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:05,821
they automatically radically decelerate
because of magnets or something.

33
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,190
Well, I mean now cars brake automatically
brake. Yeah. When they see things, yes,

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,650
but look a physical barrier like

35
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:16,680
okay,

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,560
uh, well the wheels
work pretty well. Yeah,

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,870
no pretty well decelerated at one point,

38
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:26,150
one to 1.2 gs,
that kind of thing.

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,410
Is there a concern that one day all
your cars would be on the road and there

40
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:35,411
they'll still be regular people with
regular cars 2030 years from now,

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
that will get in the mix and
be them the main problem.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
Yeah, I think it would
be sort of like, yeah,

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,670
it was a time of transition where there
were horses and gasoline cars in the

44
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:53,110
road at the same time. I been pretty
weird. Ah, that'd be the weirdest. Yeah,

45
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,120
I had, horses were tricky. You know, back
in Manhattan had like 300,000 horses.

46
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,860
You figure like Hello
Horse Lives 15 years,

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,150
got 20,000 horses. Dot. Robin Dad
every day. However, every year,

48
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,940
I should say every year is 20,000 horses.

49
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,860
If this 300,000 was his 15 year lifespan.

50
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,090
Okay.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,080
Bagging in the gangs in New York days.

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,223
That movie.

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,450
Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of dead horses
and then you need a host move the horse.

54
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,530
Right.

55
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,300
The probably a good [inaudible] pretty
freaked out if they have to move or Ted

56
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,820
hose because you think they know what's
going on. Yeah. I mean it's pretty weird.

57
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,760
No, I would imagine my dragon, this
dead horse around and I'm a horse.

58
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,640
Do you ever stop and think
about your role in civilization?

59
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,890
Do you ever stop and think
about your role in the culture?

60
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,850
Cause me as a person who never
met you until today, when
I think of you, you know,

61
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,020
I've always thought of you as being
this weirdo super inventor dude who just

62
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,210
somehow or another keeps
coming up with new shit.

63
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,850
But there's not a lot of you out there
like everybody else seems to be. I mean,

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,410
obviously you make a lot of money in.

65
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,460
There's a lot of people that make a lot
of money. He liked that clock. Yeah.

66
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,240
Pretty Dope. Right? This is a great clock.
Yeah. He want one. I'll get you one. Sure.

67
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,480
Okay. Dawn, I like weird
things like this. Oh,

68
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:17,410
this is the coolest is TGT promotion.
What is his TGT studios?

69
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,110
Tgt Studios. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

70
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,750
to a gentleman who makes all this
by hand. Yeah. It's really cool.

71
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,640
Let's study is filled with where
devices. Well, get ready for another one.

72
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,180
All right. I'm sending it your way.
You want to Werewolf to hook you up.

73
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,950
All right. I, I'll take one. One,

74
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:43,810
a werewolf and one clock coming up. Do
you think about your role in the culture?

75
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,030
Cause me as a person who
never met you until today,

76
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,220
I've always looked at you and like,
wow,

77
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,280
like how's this guy just keep
inventing shit. Like how do you,

78
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:55,330
how do you keep coming up with all
these new devices and what do you ever

79
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,580
consider how anew?

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Like I had a dream once that there was
a million Tesla's instead of like one

81
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:08,110
Tesla, there was a million, Tesla's
not Chesley the car, but Nicola.

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,573
Oh yeah,
sure.

83
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,580
And that in his day there was a million
people like him who were radically

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,100
innovative. It was a weird
dream, man. It was so strange.

85
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,570
And I've had it more than once resulted
in a very rapid technology innovation,

86
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,000
that's for sure.
It's one of the only dreams in my life.

87
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,680
I've had more than one time.
Okay.

88
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,950
Like where I've woken up and it's in
the same dream, in the same dream.

89
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,750
And in this dream,

90
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,810
it's 1940 [inaudible] 1950s but
everyone is severely advanced.

91
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,340
There's flying blimps with
like LCD screens in the side
of him and everything is

92
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:47,341
bizarre and strange and it
stuck with me for whatever it,

93
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,350
obviously this is just a stupid dream,
but for whatever reason,

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,360
all these years that
stuck with being like,

95
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:57,361
it takes one man like Nikola Tesla to
more than a hundred inventions that were

96
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,870
patents. Right? I mean
he had some pretty great,

97
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,020
pretty fucking amazing ideas.
Yes.

98
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,510
But there was in his day, there was
very few people like him. It's true.

99
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,500
What if there was a million? Like what
is this advanced? Very quickly. Right?

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,850
But there's not a million.
Elon Musk's is one motherfucker.

101
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,560
Do you think about that?
Or you just try to not,

102
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,683
hmm.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,900
I don't think, I don't think
you'd necessarily want to
be me don't think. Well,

104
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,350
what's the worst part about you?
People would like it that much. Well,

105
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:48,040
most people wouldn't, but they
can't be you. So that's like,

106
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,060
that's like some superhero type shit.
You know,

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,540
you wouldn't want to be Spiderman when
others sleep tight. And Gotham city.

108
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,970
I hope he's out there doing his job.
It's very hard to turn it off.

109
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,420
Yeah. What's the hardest
part? Might sound great,

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,060
but what if it doesn't turn off now I
showed you the isolation tank and you've,

111
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,950
you've never experienced that before?
No.

112
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,690
I think that could help you turn it off
a little bit just for the night. Yeah.

113
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,130
Just give you a little bit of sleep.

114
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,790
A little bit of perspective is magnesium
that you get from the water as well

115
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,620
that makes you,

116
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,390
it makes you sleep easier because
the water has Epsom salts in it,

117
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,230
but maybe some sort of strategy for
sacrificing your a biologic or not

118
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:37,411
sacrificing but enhancing your biological
recovery time by figuring out a way,

119
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,490
whether it's through meditation or
some other ways to shut off that,

120
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,260
that thing at night.

121
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,840
Like you must have like a
constant stream of ideas.

122
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,130
It's running through
your head all the time.

123
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,370
You getting text messages
from checks? No. Uh,

124
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,190
I, I'm getting text
messages for, from friends.

125
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,950
Like what the hell are you doing smoking
weed? Is that bad for you? It's legal.

126
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,960
It's got to be an approved,
it's not, you know, uh,

127
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,630
I'm not a regular smoker if we'd,
how often you smoke it?

128
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,443
Almost never.

129
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,643
Hmm.

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,430
I mean it's, it's, I don't actually
notice any effect. Well, there you go.

131
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,600
There was a time where I think it was
Ron doss or someone gave some Buddhist

132
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,360
monk a bunch of acid.
Okay.

133
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,560
And he ate it and it had no
effect on them. I doubt that.

134
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,270
I would say that too,

135
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,780
but I've never meditated to the level
that some of these people have where

136
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,730
they're constantly meditating all day.

137
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:47,731
They don't have any material possessions
and all of their energy is spent trying

138
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:52,480
to achieve a certain mindset.
I would like to cynically deny that.

139
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,160
I'd like to cynically say Tay
just fucking the same way I do.

140
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:01,110
They just hang out with flip flops on
and make weird noises. But maybe, no,

141
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,620
you know, I, I know a lot of
people like weed and that's fine,

142
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,130
but I don't find that it is very good
for productivity for you. Not For me.

143
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,070
Yeah. It's D. I mean, I would
imagine that for someone like you,

144
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:21,290
it's not someone like you,
it,

145
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,030
it'd be more like a cup of coffee. Right?
You want to, you have a latte. Yeah.

146
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,720
It's more like the opposite
of a cup of coffee.

147
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,870
It's like a cup of coffee and
reverse. Oh, weed is, yeah, no,

148
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,560
I'm saying you would like more,
more like what would be beneficial to you?

149
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,760
It'd be like coffee. I like to get
things done. I like to be useful.

150
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,440
Um, that is one of the hardest
things to do is it will be useful.

151
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,450
When you say you like to get things
done in terms of like what get done,

152
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,460
you satisfaction when you complete
a project, when something,

153
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,510
something that you invent comes to
fruition and you see people enjoying it.

154
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,460
That feeling yes.

155
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,390
Doing something useful for
other people that I liked doing.

156
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,150
That's interesting for other people.

157
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,350
Okay.

158
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,870
Yes.
So that,

159
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,010
do you think that that is maybe the way
you recognize that you have this unusual

160
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:18,011
position in the culture where you can
uniquely influence certain things because

161
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,270
of this? I mean, you
essentially have a gift, right?

162
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,390
I mean you would think it was a curse,

163
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,520
but I'm sure it's been fueled by many,
many years of discipline and learning,

164
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,270
but you essentially have a
gift and that you have this

165
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,760
radical sort of creativity engine when
it comes to innovation and technology.

166
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:42,780
It's like you're just,

167
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,070
you're going at a very
high rpms all the time.

168
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,250
What does that Alexa stop?

169
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,460
I don't know what would happen if I
got into a sensory deprivation tank.

170
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,460
Let's try.
It sounds more concerning.

171
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,930
It's like running the engine
with no resistance that

172
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,310
maybe it's not. Maybe it's fine. I
don't know how I'll try it. I'll try it.

173
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,290
Have you ever is fine? Did we
experimented with meditation or anything?

174
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,710
Yes. What do you do or
what have you done? Rather

175
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,310
I read,

176
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,310
just sort of sit there and be quiet and
then repeat some mantra which acts as a

177
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:32,230
focal point. It's does still
the mind. It is still the mind,

178
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,150
but I don't find myself
drawn to it frequently.

179
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,123
Okay.

180
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,290
Do you think that perhaps productivity
is maybe more attractive to you then

181
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:50,930
enlightenment and like, or
even the concept of whatever
enlightenment means. Like,

182
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:54,310
what are you trying to achieve when
you're meditating all the time? Did you?

183
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,370
It seems like almost like
there's a frantic notice to
your creativity that comes

184
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,750
out of this,
this burning furnace and fruit.

185
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,900
In order for you to like calm
that thing down, he got through,

186
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,470
he may might have to throw
too much water on it.

187
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,140
It's like a never ending explosion.
Like what does it like?

188
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,020
I try to explain it to
a dumb person like me.

189
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,900
Yeah.

190
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,740
What's going on in her end? Never running
explosion. It's just constant ideas.

191
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,540
Just bouncing around.
Yes. Whew. Damn. Yeah,

192
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,700
so when everybody leaves, just Ilan
sitting at home brushing his teeth.

193
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,970
Just bunch ideas bouncing around
your head. Yeah, all the time.

194
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,180
When did you realize that that's
not the case with most people?

195
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,500
I think when I was, I dunno, five or six
or something, I thought I was insane.

196
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,310
Okay.

197
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,790
Why'd you think you were insane? Because
it was clear that other people did not.

198
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:03,250
What? Their mind wasn't exploding
with ideas all the time.

199
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,750
They were an expressing it.

200
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,630
They weren't talking about it all day
and you realize by the time you were five

201
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:11,440
or six like oh they're probably not even
getting this thing that I'm getting.

202
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,810
No. It was just strange. Who was like,

203
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,900
hmm,
that's strange.

204
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,100
That was my conclusion.
I asked range.

205
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,600
But did you feel diminished
by it in any way?

206
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,960
Like knowing that this is a weird
thing that you really probably couldn't

207
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,400
commiserate with with other people,
they wouldn't understand.

208
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,070
You hope they wouldn't find out. Cause
I might like put me away with something.

209
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,500
You sought that for a second.
Yes. When you were little. Yeah.

210
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,600
And the other people are wearing,

211
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:47,440
what are they put me away like when you
were little, you thought this? Yeah. Wow.

212
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,970
Like you thought this is so radically
different than the people that are around

213
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,670
me. If they find out I
got this stream coming in.

214
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,060
Yeah.
Wow.

215
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,610
But you know, I was only like five
or six. So do you think this is like,

216
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,390
I mean there's,
there's outliers biologically.

217
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,550
You mean there's people
that are seven foot nine.

218
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,750
There's people that have giant hands
is people that have eyes that are 20,

219
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,580
15 vision.
There's always the outliers.

220
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,523
MMM.

221
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,650
Do you feel like you like caught this?

222
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,980
Like you have got some
you like on some weird

223
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,170
innovation,

224
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,220
creativity sort of wave
that's very unusual.

225
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,230
Like you, you tapped into, I
mean, just think of the, the, the,

226
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:42,230
the various things you've been able to
accomplish in a very short amount of time

227
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,360
and you're constantly doing this. That's
a weird, you're weird person, right?

228
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,890
I agree. Yeah. Like what if
there's a million Elon Musk's?

229
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,240
Okay,

230
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,830
well that would be very weird. Ooh,

231
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,440
Woo. Yeah. It'd be pretty weird.
I agree. Real weird. Definitely.

232
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,860
Yeah. What if there are a million
show rockets? Oh, there probably is.

233
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,090
There probably too many.
And

234
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,050
I mean, I think that's the case
with, uh, a lot of folks. Yeah.

235
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,940
I mean, but like, uh, you know, my
goal, I was like, try to useful things,

236
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,490
try to maximize the, probably
the future is good. Um,

237
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,980
make the future exciting. Something
you look forward to, you know,

238
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,840
you know with the,

239
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,290
you know with Tesla were like try
and make things that people love it.

240
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,550
I was like not okay,
I can't how many,

241
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,440
how many things can you buy that you
really love that really give you joy?

242
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,040
So rare, so rare. I wish
there were more things.

243
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,870
That's what we're trying to just make
things that somebody loves. Okay.

244
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,780
When you,
when you think about making someone loves,

245
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,640
like do you specifically think about
like what things would improve people's

246
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,230
experience?
Like what,

247
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:14,231
what would change the way people interface
with life that would make them more

248
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,730
relaxed or more happy.

249
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,060
Okay.

250
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,900
You really think like when you
thinking about things like that,

251
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,850
is that what one of your considerations?
Like what,

252
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,300
what can I do that would help people that
maybe they wouldn't be able to figure

253
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:28,134
it out?

254
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,043
Yeah.
Like,

255
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,550
like what are the set of things that
can be done to make the future better?

256
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,460
Like you know,
like,

257
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:42,461
so I think the future where we are a
space fairing civilization and out there

258
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,040
among the stars,
this is very exciting.

259
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,720
This makes me look forward to a
future just makes me want that future.

260
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,410
You know,
the things that need to be,

261
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:58,370
things that make you look forward
to waking up in the morning.

262
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,640
You wake up in the morning, you look
forward to the day before to the future

263
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,040
and a future where we are
spacefaring civilization and
out there among the stars.

264
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,740
I think that's a fair, exciting.
That is a thing we want.

265
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,650
Whereas if, if you knew we would
not be a space frank civilization,

266
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,320
but forever confined to Earth,
this would not be a good future.

267
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,060
That would be very sad.
I think

268
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,110
it'd be so that you're sure of the,

269
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:27,790
the just the finite lifespan and the
earth itself and the solar system itself,

270
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,150
that even though it's possibly,
you know what I mean? How many,

271
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,380
how long do they feel like this sun
and the solar system's going to exist?

272
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,150
How many hundreds of millions of years?

273
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,770
Well, it's probably, if you're saying
that, when does the sun boil the ocean,

274
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,613
right?

275
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,490
About 500 million years. So is, is it sad

276
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,300
that we never leave because in
500 million years that happens?

277
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,170
Is that what you're saying?

278
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,190
Okay.

279
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,510
No, I just think like if there are two
futures and one futurists were out there

280
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:05,590
among the stars and the things we read
about and see in science fiction movies,

281
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,790
the good ones are true and we
have these starships and we're,

282
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,140
which we're going to see
what other planets are like.

283
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,200
And we're a multi planet species and
the scope and scale of consciousness is

284
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,134
expanded.

285
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,210
Okay.

286
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,500
The Cross many civilizations in
many planets and many star systems,

287
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,240
this is a great future.

288
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,570
This is a wonderful thing to me and
that's what we should strive for.
