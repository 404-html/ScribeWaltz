1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,310
Yeah, I'm one of the, I have this theory

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,080
and we see it in sports and I saw it when
I talked to him and he's been a friend

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:14,520
of mine for a long time and I was talking
to him about his psychology is he goes

4
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:18,960
into a football game and he says he plays
a movie in his mind of the entire game

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,500
before he plays it.
Because you know,

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:26,480
in a football game you're going to have
11 or 12 possessions during the game and

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,020
you just throw that football game.

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,840
You can get that ball 11 or
12 times and he would say,

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,840
and I'm going to carry that ball
three or four times per possession,

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,010
and he knows which plays he's going to
run. He would run him through his head,

11
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,950
he would see it, he would know who was
going to be there to tackle him. He would,

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,321
you know,

13
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:46,320
he'd run everything through his head and
he's one of those guys that wants the

14
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:47,650
ball when the clock's running out.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,360
But I have this theory that situations
do not make heroes situations expose

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,080
heroes.
And I saw that in Katrina,

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,130
the hurricane that so devastated
that that one neighborhood,

18
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,770
what ward was it does it the ninth ward,

19
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:13,940
and I forget which ward it
was that got so wiped out, uh,

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,950
when Katrina hit New Orleans and there
was a guy down there that had been really

21
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:23,550
quiet. Nobody had ever heard anything
out of him. He was an older guy,

22
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,470
lived in a house,
stayed to himself.

23
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,760
And that night when the
water was at rooftop level,

24
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,890
I mean he swam rooftop
to rooftop and save six,

25
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:39,450
seven, eight people got 'em out of
there and he didn't make it out,

26
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,740
but he got seven or eight people out of
there and you go back and you check his

27
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,580
history and he was a military hero.

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,130
He just sat quietly in his home.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,910
And when the situation came about,

30
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,110
it revealed who he was.
And I think that's what happens.

31
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,170
I think if you've got a hero,
they just sit there,

32
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:05,010
sit there and sit there until the
situation reveals who they are.

33
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:09,570
I don't think it makes him a hero.
I think it reveals that they're heroes.

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,230
And I think that's what happens to people.
They,

35
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,790
they are who they are until they get in,

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,990
in the opportunity to comes along and
they're going to show you who that is and

37
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:23,130
they may show you are a coward or they
may show you that they've got the focus

38
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,250
to hang or they may show
you that they're a hero,

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,150
but life circumstances are going to come
along and we're going to show you who

40
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,760
somebody is. Yeah, I completely agree.

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,390
And I think what's also interesting is
when someone does get revealed to be a

42
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:42,960
coward, they can become
a hero. It's very hard.

43
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,860
It's very hard to get past the
memory of you being a coward.

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,510
Well, I'll tell you why I think that's
true. If you want to know please.

45
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:55,530
I mean maybe I'm going away,
going off on a tangent.

46
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,630
Come on now I think.

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,550
I think learn about ourselves and yo
everybody talks about self esteem and self

48
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,384
worth,

49
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,640
but nobody ever talks about what
it really is or how we get it.

50
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,210
And I think I think about it in terms
of self attribution because you know how

51
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:21,710
you form opinions of other people.
Like if you look at this guy and you,

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:26,260
you maybe you work with this guy and so
you watch him across a couple of years

53
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,610
and maybe this guy shows up to work
every day and he's there 15 minutes early

54
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,270
and he unlocks the place, gets
everything ready, puts a coffee on,

55
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,260
has his desk ready,

56
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,590
he's all buttoned up and Ma'am when the
bell rings he's ready to go. And you,

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,730
you just learned that this
guy's buttoned up, ready to go.

58
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,950
Dependable never misses.
He's always there.

59
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,930
So you attribute certain traits and
characteristics to him based on your

60
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:54,520
observations of him and your experience
of him based on that you assign certain

61
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:55,930
traits and characteristics to him.

62
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,890
But I say that's exactly the same way
we form our own self image and our own

63
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,380
level of self worth.

64
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
We watch ourselves go through life
and we watch how we handle certain

65
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,270
circumstances and situations.

66
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,040
And that's why I say overindulgence is
one of the most insidious forms of child

67
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,300
abuse Mellon to parenting.
Uh, it's not the worst.

68
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:27,301
It's just insidious because
if you overindulge your
children and do everything

69
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:32,440
for them, you never let them observe
themselves, master their environment.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,300
You never let them step back
and say, wow, I did that,

71
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,760
I built this, I overcame that,
I handled this, I did that.

72
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,590
And so we,

73
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,700
that's the same way we make our own
self image and level of self worth.

74
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:52,300
We watch ourselves
overcome the third grade.

75
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,910
We watch ourselves stand up to a bully,

76
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,911
we watch ourselves handle a test with
the information that intimidated us or we

77
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:06,451
watch ourselves make it onto the little
league baseball team and actually get a

78
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,390
hit when we needed to.

79
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:14,391
Where we watch ourselves get on to the
debate team and actually argue something

80
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:18,760
successfully, whether it's
academic or athletic or musical.

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,560
We watch ourselves do it. And so we'd
go back and say, Hey, I did that.

82
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,000
I attribute to myself the ability,
I can hang, I can do this,

83
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,530
I can rise to the occasion.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Or we watch ourselves fold like a
pup tent in a windstorm and say,

85
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,330
I can't hang out.
I don't have it.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,780
And we make those
attributions to ourselves.

87
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,140
And so we strength from the challenge
for the rest of our lives until like you

88
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,351
said,

89
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:49,351
it's hard to overcome that and something
pushes you up until you finally observe

90
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,820
yourself overcome something.

91
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,570
And I think that's how we form our level
of self esteem and our identity about

92
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:03,050
who we are. And I don't think most people
think about that. Look back and say,

93
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,830
okay, how did I, how did I get to be
Joe Rogan has a sit in that chair.

94
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,820
You have a self image, you have a
level of confidence, ego, strength, uh,

95
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,800
a level of self worth that's attributable
to things you've watched yourself do

96
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,690
or not do, achieve, not achieve,

97
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:25,070
overcome or whatever throughout your life.
And,

98
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,130
and I think to know yourself,
you have to know what those things are.

99
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,930
I think you're 100% right.

100
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,250
And I think for children participating
in things that are going to test you so

101
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,880
critical, giving them this
opportunity to realize that the, the,

102
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,810
there's a line between success and failure
and that you could push through that

103
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,800
line and you could,

104
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,180
you could become successful at
something and learn watching kids at.

105
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:49,250
That's why I think sports are
so important for children.

106
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,200
I think that's one of the more insidious
things about having these participation

107
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:58,310
trophies for kids where that nobody
wins the game. Yay. Everybody plays,

108
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:02,130
but nobody wins. We don't keep score.
Well, why the fuck are you plan? Yeah.

109
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,620
I mean that just goes down as an
environmental non event. Yeah.

110
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,400
I mean that that contributes nothing to
your definition is just something to do.

111
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,240
It's also psychologically it's coddling.
It's very,

112
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:19,220
it's very damaging for your potential
education that you would get from that

113
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:19,940
situation.

114
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,500
The bad feeling that you get when someone
scores on you is motivation for you to

115
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,730
be better at defense.

116
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,070
Yeah.
You know,

117
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,980
I think we cheat kids when we do that
and of course you gotta play everybody.

118
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,960
I get that not everybody is meant
to be an athlete, so, okay, look,

119
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,370
go do something else.
Be Good at what you're good at.

120
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,570
Yeah. And if you really want to do
it well, you've got a long road.

121
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,480
It's a greased hill start running.

122
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,520
Yeah.
It's just everything's not for everybody.

123
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,230
So find what you're good at and
watch yourself achieve in that lane.

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,420
You know, that's like I could, I
can't carry a tune in a bucket.

125
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,070
I, I can't even, I can play
no instrument. I can't sing.

126
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,940
I can play a radio if it's got
a big on off knob. That's it.

127
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,960
And so I don't try, I mean
that's, I'm just not good at that.

128
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:17,280
So I go into lanes that I can do
stuff and observe myself in that.

129
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,510
But I think you cheat kids if you
don't let them observe themselves face

130
00:08:21,511 --> 00:08:22,680
adversity and overcome it.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,230
Absolutely. And it's also an interesting
lesson to learn that life isn't fair.

132
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:27,981
I mean,

133
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,981
if you're a kid and you're playing
basketball with a 15 year old Lebron James

134
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,680
and you're my height, you go, Huh, yeah.

135
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,510
This ain't gonna work out at all. Yeah,
you're looking at a towel boy here.

136
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
This is not fucking happening.

137
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,700
And you have to be able to
understand that and appreciate that.

138
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:51,290
And then conversely, if you're
very physically frail, you know,

139
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,650
maybe wrestling's not for you either.
You know, maybe, maybe you, uh,

140
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,530
we need to do something about your
body before you engage in any sort of a

141
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,170
combat sport. You know,
they did an experiment,

142
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,640
I think it was the 60s they did
something called teaching machines.

143
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:08,780
Have you ever seen that? It was
a short period of time, but they,

144
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,710
they took students in the class where
they put the steps of learning the

145
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:17,510
information so close together that
there was never a failure experience.

146
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,850
It would say like the war
of 1812 happened in 1812.

147
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,390
Then the next thing would say the
war of 1812 happened in blank.

148
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,330
You fill in 18, 12. I mean, come
on. Potted plant could get that.

149
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,550
So they've put it together and they would
teach the information and they would

150
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:40,970
teach it to criteria where
you mastered the information.

151
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:45,710
You had it 100% and I
said, wow, this is great.

152
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,180
Everybody learned it. So everybody made
a hundred, everybody got the information,

153
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:52,490
they truly did learn it.
There was no question about it.

154
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,550
They learned the information
and so they did great.

155
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,240
And then they took him out of that
program and put them back in the regular

156
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:03,350
classroom.
And the first time they came to questions,

157
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:07,850
they didn't know the answer to the first
time they didn't get a hundred they

158
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:10,640
came apart like a cheap suit.
They panicked,

159
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,950
they didn't know how to handle adversity,

160
00:10:12,951 --> 00:10:17,060
they didn't know how to handle it when
they didn't have the right answers,

161
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:20,510
they didn't learn how to not be perfect.

162
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,940
And so they scrapped the whole program
because he said you can't do this because

163
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:29,880
that's not the way life is.
Right. And if I mean it's,

164
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,810
you're not teaching how
the real world works,

165
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,170
you might as well teach them to go on
red and stop on green and then give them

166
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,000
the keys and put them out in life.
Cause that's not the way it works.

167
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:45,530
And those kids were absolutely screwed
up when they got into a truly competitive

168
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:48,290
environment.
It can't be success only.

169
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,470
Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. It's
not healthy. It's not good for you.

170
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,960
You don't learn from it.
I mean,

171
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,630
the whole idea about school is you're
supposed to be setting kids up for the

172
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,930
future. He supposed to be teaching
them not just information,

173
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,420
but teaching them how to learn and

174
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,860
prove. Yeah, and that
worries me. You know,

175
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:08,310
I read that story not long
ago when you students,

176
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:10,380
I think it was at Ucla in law school,

177
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,760
complained and got a professor either
disciplined or fired because he required

178
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:25,491
them to take a counter argument over
something controversial like Ferguson.

179
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,920
He said, I want you to, you know,

180
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,750
I know you that you're
all on this point of view.

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,180
Now I want you to prepare an argument for
the other side. And they all said, ah,

182
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,940
that's, that's upsetting
to us. We just can't do it.

183
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:43,920
And they went to the
administration and complained.

184
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,780
Wow, that's crazy. Because you
may have to do, as a lawyer,

185
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,560
you may have to represent someone who's
done something you don't agree with.

186
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,800
If that's what you want to do for a right.
I mean,

187
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,420
are you kidding me?
They were like needed therapy.

188
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,580
Uh, my, what the hell has happened here?

189
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,780
Oh my God. That's so crazy. That's nuts.
