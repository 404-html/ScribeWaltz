1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,690
Why,

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,750
why do you think the way you think and
why are you going to say the next thing

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:07,110
you're going to say and is it,
how much of it is biological?

4
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,640
How much of it is your life experience?

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,730
How much of it is information that's
dancing in your head? How much is it of,

6
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:16,530
is you interacting with me? The last thing
that I've said to you? Yeah, so I had a,

7
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,860
I was on the same Harris's podcast be a
long conversation about this because he

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,550
is very anti freewill and I think
that it's, I disagree with them,

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,460
but I don't care.
I think it's had a blog to be honest,

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,570
cause he think he's born with it.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,590
I think it's boring because here's why
I think it's boring because there's two

12
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,840
questions.
One question is how does the world work?

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,230
The other question is what words should
be attached to how the world works?

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,900
And the first one is interesting and
the second one is kind of boring.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,520
I see what you're saying. I see them and
I agree on how the world works. Right?

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,170
But I am what philosophers
call a compatiblist when it
comes to freewill, which,

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,183
which is,

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,200
I don't think that I have some ways of
thinking my way into overcoming the laws

19
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,560
of physics, right? Like
I'm made of atoms made, uh,

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,540
particles that obey the laws of physics.

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,930
If I talk about myself as
a large collection of atoms
and particles obeying the

22
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,520
laws of physics,
then clearly there's no free will.

23
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,880
There's just the solution to the
equations and sometimes the wave function

24
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,310
branches and there's now two of me,
but that's whatever it is.

25
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:18,810
There's no spark of consciousness that
lets me overcome what the equation side

26
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,970
is going to happen.
But guess what?

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,480
That's not a fruitful way to go through
your life in terms of talking about

28
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:28,350
human beings. When you meet somebody
for the first time and you say like,

29
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,670
you know, what do you do? Who are you?

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,600
They don't give you a list of their atoms
and say what every atom is doing and

31
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,570
say, let your let go ahead
and solve Schrodinger's
equation to figure out what's

32
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,110
going to happen next. Right? You tell
a story, you say like you're a person,

33
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,320
you know you grew up in a certain place,
you have a certain jobs, stuff like that,

34
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:48,321
and you dramatically condense the
information about who you are into a few

35
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:53,640
salient points and among those salient
points are I am a person who thinks and

36
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,310
makes decisions.
Every person in the world,

37
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,880
no matter how anti-free will they are
talks about people as if they make

38
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,270
decisions and the reason they do
is because that's how people are.

39
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,480
That's the best way to talk about people.
It's not like just a compromise,

40
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:11,310
like if you don't know
the atoms and molecules in
somebody's body and you're not

41
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,000
infinitely computationally powerful
so you can predict the future,

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,870
then it's correct to talk about
people as agents who make decisions.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,100
We call that freewill. I
call that freewill. Most
philosophers call it free will.

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,250
If you don't want to call it free
will be my guest. I don't really know.

45
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,770
It doesn't really matter to me.
I agree with what you're saying.

46
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,980
I think that makes a lot of sense and
I think that really simplifies a very

47
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,000
complex issue.

48
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,200
I when I looked at it and I have had
this conversation with Sam as well,

49
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,030
I totally see his point and
I think he makes 100% sense.

50
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,420
It's just no arguing with it.
I really think it's,

51
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,160
it's very rational that approach,

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,960
but I also think that it's very much
like what we were talking about earlier,

53
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:55,710
that it's not necessarily just a one or
zero that it's a combination of these

54
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,380
things. Frey will, there has to,

55
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,410
there is some mechanism that chooses
to do one thing versus another.

56
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,080
There's some computation,
there's calculation, there's
debate, there's discussion,

57
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,410
there's a thing inside of you.
Whatever it is,

58
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,760
whatever that process is
that's causing you to, I mean,

59
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,530
how many times have people stayed up
all night going over and over and over a

60
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,010
certain idea, trying to find a rational
conclusion? Oh yeah, all the time.

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,820
What is that? Right. Well, what is that?
Is that this will, is that, is that,

62
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,560
this is where the, it actually becomes
interesting to talk about the vocabulary.

63
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,110
We use rice because it becomes very,

64
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:40,111
very hard to know where to attach the
word I or you when you're talking about

65
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:45,280
this, like you, we tend to say I made
a decision. Okay that's fine. Right?

66
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,090
I decided to have this can of pure
caffeine that you put in front of me and

67
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,530
drinking. Um, I could have decided
otherwise. So that's the question.

68
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,010
Like does it make sense to say
I could have decided otherwise?

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,550
And if you define yourself as the
following list of atoms and particles in a

70
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:04,960
certain configuration,
then no.

71
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,360
Then the laws of physics said
that that was going to happen.

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,900
But I don't know what all that is.
That's not a useful way of talking.

73
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,250
So there's a whole nother way of talking
that says I'm a person and I kind of

74
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,610
like coffee, but I already had a gut this
morning and you know, there's a chance,

75
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:21,840
there's a probability like you say that
I would drink this and it probability

76
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:26,200
that I would not. And those are completely
compatible, although they're different.

77
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:30,100
The only way you get into trouble is if
you mix up those two different ways of

78
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:30,551
talking.

79
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:34,600
If you say like I chose to have the
coffee because my atoms were in following

80
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,130
configuration or something like that.
Right.

81
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:39,300
That's like talking about us as
humans and then switching vocabulary.

82
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:42,290
He's talking about us as Adams and
that's where you get in trouble get.

83
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,840
It's a weird reductionist take on what it
means to be a person that thinks. Yeah.

84
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,770
Yeah. I think you know, if,

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,860
if you say like there's no freewill
and your atoms than I'm with you,

86
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:54,900
I'm on on board, but no one in the
world goes through life that way. Right.

87
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,030
For good reason and they never will.
It's not going to happen. Yeah.

88
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,050
Well he and you could break that all
the way down to creativity. Right?

89
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:06,310
Like what when someone sits down and
writes something like where's all that

90
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,580
coming from? Again,
there's feminism as well.

91
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,370
There is an interesting question about,
you know,

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,390
how much we will ultimately be able to
unpack and understand about that. Right.

93
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,051
Like right now,

94
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,430
the brain is kind of just a mystery box
to us and there's so much we don't know

95
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,950
about how people make decisions, how
they remember things, how they, uh,

96
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,490
come up with new ideas.
So,

97
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,540
so where it matters is how
we treat people, right?

98
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,100
Like the obvious case is responsibility.
Blame.

99
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,980
Like if,
if you think that a person makes choices,

100
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,520
then you can assign responsibility to
them for making the choices they made.

101
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,910
That's what we do in the world.
If someone chooses to rob a bank,

102
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,240
we choose to put them in
jail, right? And someone,

103
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,340
someone could come along and say,
no one ever does this,

104
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,900
but someone could come along and say,
well,

105
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:56,500
they're just a bunch of atoms obeying
laws of physics. How can you blame them?

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Right? That would be dopey though,
that that doesn't make any sense.

107
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,200
But what if you were a minority report,
right?

108
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:07,310
What if you could like put someone in
a Mri in a brain scanner and say, yeah,

109
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:11,840
you know what, tomorrow they're going to
rob a bank. Do you arrest them? Is that,

110
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,630
is that enough? The fact that
their brain was hooked up to, uh,

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,500
to violate the law in the future.

112
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,620
Is that enough to sign personal
responsibility to them for that or do you,

113
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,470
or do you do the opposite and say, well,
it's going to happen no matter what.

114
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,790
We can't really blame them.
Well,

115
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,791
and also if you do catch this thought
process is before the actual action takes

116
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,280
place,

117
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,010
is it impossible to correct that thought
process with education or some sort of

118
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:41,880
awareness training or something where
you could shift the consciousness and a

119
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,970
abruptly sort of disassembled determinism
at its most problematic point?

120
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,450
Yeah, so there's a, there's a
whole kind of, uh, interesting, um,

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,650
set of ideas that are very popular
among philosophers right now,

122
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,560
which is the question of moral luck.
Oh,

123
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,420
so if you're driving down the street
and you're buzzed, you're drunk, right?

124
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,670
Maybe you get home fine.

125
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,210
Maybe someone jumped in front of your
car and you run them over because you

126
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:15,110
don't have the, uh, agility or the
reflexes because you're drunk. Right?

127
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,330
So you're the same person. You went home,
you're drunk and you're driving home.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
But depending on the outside world,

129
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,030
you ran someone over and killed them
where you didn't. But in the world,

130
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,400
we blame the person who ran somebody over.

131
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,300
We punish them much more severely than
the person who got home safely. Right.

132
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,650
That's not their responsibility.
They sorta got unlucky there in the world.

133
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:40,750
So should we blame people who
had the chance of doing it? Uh,

134
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,950
would no one knows the answer
to these questions. These are,

135
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,110
these are tricky things.
Like we're not very good.

136
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,010
We human beings at the thinking about
these probabilistic counterfactual

137
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,880
questions. Yeah. That's a
good one. God is. Yeah. Hmm.

138
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,230
Yeah. What, who are you then? Yeah.
You lucky. Oh yeah. Right. I mean,

139
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,870
so much of what happens to us in life,
we don't get responsibility for,

140
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,020
we were interfacing with randomness
every time we step out the door.

141
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:11,000
That's right. But uh, can you
treat people that way consistently?

142
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,310
It's hard. Right? It's tricky. I'm not
giving the answer cause I don't know.

143
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,130
I mean there isn't good, right?
Yeah. This is, this is tricky stuff.

144
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:21,131
We're certainly not like if you lived
in a world where you thought that what

145
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:25,430
happened in the world was preordained
that there was all the great playing out

146
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:30,431
as a master plan or at the very least
that there was some sort of a karmic

147
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,500
influence that made good
things happen to good people,

148
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:37,170
bad things happen to bad people, then
the world makes more sense. Right? Yeah.

149
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,810
I don't believe any of that stuff,

150
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,020
but at least then the world seems if if
there's something random you can attach

151
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,440
a reason why it happens.

152
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,490
There seems to be something to Karma
in that when you do good things,

153
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:50,750
you make people feel better,

154
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:55,220
they feel about you better and then they
interface with you in a more positive

155
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,230
way and that sort of like has
this outgoing effect Karma.

156
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,990
That's just a smart thing to do. Yeah,
I think, no, I think that you're right,

157
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,550
that we,

158
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,510
and maybe this is just sort of a Western
posted enlightenment way of thinking,

159
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:14,000
we tend to sort of think about immediate
consequences for our actions for better,

160
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,610
for worse,

161
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,990
and in the real world sort of generally
trying to be good can often pay back in

162
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,490
good ways,
but the comp,

163
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,570
the woo woo thing is that we're
putting out this good energy,

164
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,890
right and the good energy is coming
back to us and it's a fun way to look at

165
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:32,460
things. Yeah. Although there's no
evidence that points to it. Yeah, exactly.

166
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:36,570
Like if I'm in a yoga class and my yoga
instructor is talking about different

167
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,780
energy flowing through different
chalkers or whatever, I don't care.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,660
Like it doesn't bother me like
as long as it makes me, you know,

169
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
do that exercise I role, there's
a little, little, little,

170
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,440
but I'm not going to speak up. Let's
put it that way. Right. Of course.

171
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:53,040
You're not going to stop the class telling
bullshit. I would rather have that.

172
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,030
Then you know, if people want to come
up with an excuse to be a good person,

173
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:00,360
that's okay. It's funny that
Yoga class is always the base.

174
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,380
That's always where people
go to talk about like we're,
we're, we will comes from.

175
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,970
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's there because I've
had, you know, I mean if you've done yoga,

176
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:10,920
you know, like there's
a whole spectrum, right?

177
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:14,910
Like there's teachers who are basically
just physical therapists and there are

178
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,370
people who are complete crazy hippies.
You know,

179
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,540
you have to think the right
thoughts, you know? Yeah. It's,

180
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,541
but people are always searching for some
understanding of really complex issues

181
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,530
and behavior is very complex issue.
Sure.

182
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,570
Behavior and how you feel like,
uh, you like whether you feel good,

183
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,700
whether you feel spiritually enriched,
whether you feel positive about humanity,

184
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,940
like the,
all these things are like,

185
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,540
we're trouble was trying
to manipulate these states,

186
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,590
whether it's through meditation,
a mindfulness training,

187
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,660
trying to figure out a way to positively
in the interface. You know, it's true.

188
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:59,070
And it goes back to where
he started talking about
youtube comments because like

189
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:03,180
I said, I do react badly to bed too
stupid. Youtube what you are being, well,

190
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,220
I mean human being,
but I think,

191
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:10,221
and I think that the internet does a
magnify some of our bad tendencies,

192
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,840
right? And I think that,
you know, among these,

193
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,880
until I totally include myself as a bad
actor here in the sense that it's just

194
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:22,650
so easy to be sarcastic and
put people down and you know,

195
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,270
uh, disagree in sort of dismissive
ways and I don't think that's good.

196
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,330
I would like to live in a world
where people, including myself,

197
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,460
even when we disagree with people,

198
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:35,490
even when we disagree with people who
are stupid and we're not trying to engage

199
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:38,220
them or improve their
lives, just, you know,

200
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,030
get on with our own lives rather than
trying to have a snarky comeback.

201
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,290
Like I get that there's a purpose
to snark and sarcasm and whatever,

202
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,910
but it weighs you down, right? Yeah.

203
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,510
This is why people complain
about Twitter and social media.

204
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:55,170
Like it's so much like psychic energy
just gets sapped by reading all of these

205
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:58,170
complaints on either side has no,
you know, political bias, right?

206
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,030
Like whatever your feelings are,

207
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:03,030
someone else is making you feel
down on the Internet somewhere.
