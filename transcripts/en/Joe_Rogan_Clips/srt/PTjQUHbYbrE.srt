1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,430
Yeah,
I'll delete.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,400
Didn't hear a lot about Neal
Brennan special from people
that watch three months

3
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:08,090
while he was on there. That's
right. He was medians of the world.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,680
Yeah.
Neil Brent Hill.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,350
I want to say anything about his new
stuff because I'll give away the premises,

6
00:00:16,351 --> 00:00:21,210
but he's murdered. He's super impressed
with Neal Brennan. I was like, Whoa,

7
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,960
this is the funniest I've ever heard
them. I love that. Oh, he's a monster.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,200
He's very good. He's definitely the
best one I've seen so far on that,

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,180
on that species. He's very smart, man.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,490
He's very smart and his
new stuff is excellent.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,670
It's an analogy of Isis to talk,
don't say, but yeah. Yeah. Good.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,650
He pushes up a lot of people.
Your favorite comedians. Shit.

13
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,650
He Punches Up Ellen's rock.
Chris Rock.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,900
Dave Chappelle. He was Dave Chappelle's
writing part. I get, you know,

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,820
for the Chapelle show. Come on, was
back when we were friends with him.

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,230
He hadn't even done standup yet.

17
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,880
Remember that when we hung
out with them in New York,

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,140
Eddie came with me when I did, uh,
the fear factor, Chappelle sketch.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,480
We did a weird ass warehouse.
How long ago was this?

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,710
2004. It was a long time ago. What's
it even, it might've been three.

21
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,850
Could have been three.
It was,

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,040
so we fly out to New York and they're
filming all day in this fucking old ass

23
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,740
warehouse with no windows and it's
freezing. Everybody's in winter coats.

24
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:24,120
And we had a like one
of those burner here,

25
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:27,180
things those portable like
inferno heater things.

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,140
Eddie and I were fucking huddled by
this time. Everybody was the camera man,

27
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:35,730
the grips. And um, he did,
um, the crackhead character,

28
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,730
Dave Chappelle stayed.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,100
He stayed in character
the whole fucking day.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,520
And he's trying to tell him about me.
Like he introduced me to Dave Chappelle.

31
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:51,540
He goes, this guy, he just tapped
toilet Gracie and he was like,

32
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,390
hi Gracie. Damn. Still
the whole bill all. Yeah.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,090
So all, every time we ran into
each other throughout the day,

34
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,360
he'd look at me and
goes, you tap wise, crazy

35
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,930
ass over and over.

36
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,450
He would say the same shit.

37
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,090
I wonder why it took so Neil
so long to get into stand up.

38
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,970
He's such a brilliant room.

39
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,880
I think he sat back and watched it and
probably thought he could do it and then

40
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,260
said, no on, let me just give it a shot.

41
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,960
And he just took to it like
a duck to water. Yup. Yeah.
