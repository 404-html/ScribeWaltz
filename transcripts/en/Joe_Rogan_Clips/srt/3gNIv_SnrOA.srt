00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,170
Hello Freak bitches. And we were just
talking about Chris Cornell. We uh,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,670
found out last night at the comedy store
that he died and then this morning and

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,440
found out that he hung
himself. Just fuck. It's,

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,820
it's hard to even comprehend.
How do you comprehend that I'm,

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,160
I'm living in a parallel universe.
Doesn't make any sense.

6
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:24,060
Like how could someone like,
you know, it's easy on the
outside looking in. I like,

7
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:27,480
I like that. But you're like,
that guy was one of the best ever.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,630
Like how does a guy like that
even want to kill himself?

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,870
How does the lead singer of sound garden,
to me,

10
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:38,850
it just really kind of reveals of
the complexities of human life.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,960
Yeah,
exactly what you're saying.

12
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,530
To have a guy that is at
the pinnacle of his skill,

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,160
the Pinnacle of fame,
the pinnacle of money,

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,590
and for him to say, you know what, not
going to do it anymore. Yeah. I don't,

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,260
I don't know what was going
on in his head obviously.

16
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,670
Who knows if he was on medication, if he
had some sort of an issue, health issue,

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,320
who knows? I mean, I would
never speculate, but it
just, I don't understand.

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,960
I mean, again, I don't know his life,
but I couldn't even comprehend it.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,700
I can't even imagine it. Well, it's,

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,770
that's one of the really hard things
when you start talking about suicide for

21
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,790
people that for someone like me and
I haven't had suicidal thoughts,

22
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,230
right.
So when you,

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,440
when you go from that to somebody that
not only has the thoughts but then goes

24
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,160
ahead and executes it, it's
very hard to comprehend. Yeah.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,090
I've met people that have done it before
of I've added a few friends that have

26
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:37,170
done it. I just have never understood it.
I don't get it, but I don't know them.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,730
You know what I mean? Everybody's got
their own unique mindset and it's just,

28
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,740
you, you know what's really crazy, man,

29
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,850
as I read this statistic the
other day about suicide, um,

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,910
that people in poor neighborhoods are
far less likely to kill themselves.

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,000
People that are in the
struggle. Yeah. Well,

32
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,940
I actually believe that because
they're fighting for something. Yeah.

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,560
And someone that's already got everything
and then they end up with no drive

34
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,650
with no goal and nothing left to achieve.

35
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,360
And so then all of a sudden they're just
staring at the mirror without anywhere

36
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,280
else to go. You know, and May,

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,380
I'm not talking about Chris
Cornell in particular,

38
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:17,940
but for some people I know one of the
things that happens is that when they

39
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,120
become very successful and
they're still not happy,

40
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,150
then they get hopeless.
They just feel like, well,

41
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,330
I have everything and yet I'm
fucking miserable. You know,

42
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:31,710
I have a nice big house, I drive this
fancy car and I still am miserable.

43
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,260
Like there's no hope like
this life is meaningless.

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,750
I don't even know what to say to that.

45
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,260
I don't know what to say to be honest
with you. And you hear, you hear that,

46
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,540
you just don't even know what to what to
say to that. You know, one thing that,

47
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,230
why I don't understand it,
I liked struggle. I like it.

48
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,230
I think it's important. No,
there's no doubt about that.

49
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,320
There's no doubt about having something
that you're striving for some goal.

50
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,303
And like you just said,

51
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,370
all those goals had been achieved and now
you're sitting there at the top of the

52
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,800
mountain and you now you don't feel happy.
What do you do?

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,750
Just pick up a fucking Hobbie man.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,070
Find something you suck at and get better
at it. I mean, that seems so simplistic,

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,210
but, um, uh, you know, I just,
you and I are, we share this, uh,

56
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,730
this is very important,
uh, part of our lives,

57
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:17,530
which is a intense exercise
indeed. And I think that, you know,

58
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,640
I go to your Instagram almost every day
to look at your watch. It's hilarious.

59
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,780
If you go to Jockos Instagram,
it's a fucking Timex watch advertisement.

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,340
It's all that iron man watch at four 30
in the morning, the occasional three 30.

61
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,980
This is motherfuckers up at three 30.
And you know,

62
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,710
and you working out like that's

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,260
his fucking Harry gorilla arm and
a Timex ironman triathlon watch.

64
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,280
But that's what's up, man. That's what's
up. I mean, just fucking doing it,

65
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:48,940
getting out there and struggling. And then
once you do do that, here's the thing,

66
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:53,010
like, you know, like a friend of mine
said that he's just like a w I was a,

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,780
I was saying something about you
could come on the podcast and he goes,

68
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,650
can that do take another
picture of his fucking watch?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,510
I hope he takes a picture of his
watch every day until he dies. I go,

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,440
it's important. It's
important. It's, it's,

71
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,750
it's sort of in a lot of ways
it's symbolic of what we're
talking about. Like, no,

72
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:12,490
it's not fun to look at your watch every
day, but you fucking doing it every day.

73
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,690
Like that's what's important. Yeah.
And I actually, early on I had someone,

74
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,600
you know, say something along
the lines of on social media,

75
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,550
on Instagram or on Twitter, you know, oh,

76
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:24,730
you just going to post another picture
you're watching. I was like, unfollow me.

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,850
Like, just don't follow me. It's no big
deal. I'm not making you do it. And,

78
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,220
and now it is kind of turned
into something where I'm,

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,590
I'm doing it every day regardless of
anything else in the world. Fuck them.

80
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:36,424
I like looking at you.

81
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,830
I want to know when I get up at seven and
I think I'm getting up early human for

82
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,750
hours. You already gone to work now.
I like it. I think it's uh, it's,

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,050
but it is a lot of ways. It is, it's
symbolic of what we're talking about.

84
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:52,930
It's a struggle. Yeah. And you know,
you know who doesn't complain about it.

85
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,660
And I always make this point too,
there's like a,

86
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,710
a single mom somewhere in the valley
here that's working three jobs that's

87
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:03,490
getting up at three 30 in the morning so
she can go work as a waitress somewhere

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,670
before she's got her other day job that
she's got to go through so she can feed

89
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:11,040
her kids. I get up almost as a luxury
at this point. I mean, you know, I'm,

90
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,780
I'm a retired guy from the,
from the military,

91
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,910
so I can kind of get up whenever I want.
I get up early as a luxury sort of,

92
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,560
but you also get up because that's who
you are. Yeah. And I get up because it is,

93
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,380
it is a way to maintain
discipline in life for sure.

94
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,730
Get that stone out and sharpen
that blade every morning.

95
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,550
It's the grind that sharpens the ax.
Indeed does no other way.

96
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,271
There's no other way,

97
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,970
and I don't want to say that this would've
saved Chris Cornell or anybody else

98
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,140
that did it.
I'm not saying that,

99
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:43,560
but I mean for some people out
there that aren't feeling good man,

100
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,670
if you just fucking struggled more, you
get over that struggle, you feel better.

101
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,820
It sounds so simplistic,
but I swear by it,

102
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,660
I felt shitty myself and then
force myself to work out.

103
00:05:54,661 --> 00:05:57,290
And then after I get out of there
I'm like, Whoa, what a percent, fuck,

104
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,290
it's 100% guarantee. And you know,
actually I had, I had, you know,

105
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,470
I had Tim Ferris come on my podcast
and when he came on he was like, Hey,

106
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:06,050
I don't know if I'm the right kind of
guests for your podcast because you know,

107
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:10,700
my podcast is like about war and
death and killing and all that stuff.

108
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,730
And so, you know, Tim's are about
being better and stuff like that.

109
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:17,450
So it's easy to raise your voice.
But that's what was right.

110
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,650
Tim's Tim's podcast is about improving
yourself and mine was about war and

111
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,830
genocide and horrible things.
And he said to me, you know, hey,

112
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:27,360
I don't know if if I come
on the podcast but you know,

113
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,370
maybe I'm not the right type of
guest or whatever and I, and I,

114
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,420
and I wrote back to him and
I said, hey man, you know,

115
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,700
you've been through some dark stuff in
your life because he wrote a blog post

116
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,230
years ago about him being suicidal and
him contemplating and planning commit

117
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,220
suicide. This is Tim Ferriss.
Did he really? Yeah, he
went through a full motions,

118
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,430
you know, typical Tim Ferris
methodology. What did he do?

119
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:49,970
He went to the library and got out a bunch
of books on killing yourself and then

120
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:52,340
did the research and how he was
going to do it and planned it all.

121
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,040
And then when was this,
how long ago he was going,

122
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,730
he was like just done with college.
And so, I mean, what does that,

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,030
what is he 35 or something?
So maybe it's 20 he's 15 years ago,

124
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,280
Christ and he was under all this pressure,
you know,

125
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:07,970
he was an ivy league guy and
he was trying to finish school,

126
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,370
but then it wasn't working out
and it was just problematic.

127
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,190
And so he started saying to myself, okay,
well how am I getting out of this? Well,

128
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,920
there's one way to get out of it.
And luckily he didn't do it,

129
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:20,420
but when he came on, you know, that's
what we talked about and what he said,

130
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,270
you know, as he was making
recommendations from again,

131
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:27,170
from a guy who's been there was like,
hey, if, if you're trapped in your,

132
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,080
in your mind and you're starting to
feel that way, go do something physical.

133
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,910
Get in your body,
you get out of your mind.

134
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,220
The same thing you were saying
it when you're feeling bad,

135
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,054
when you're feeling down,

136
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,840
go out and swing a kettle ball around
and you will feel better. Yeah,

137
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:39,680
this is just too much.

138
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,090
For some people especially they're just
experienced in way too much pressure and

139
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:48,020
that pressure a lot of times it's just a,
an imbalance and perspective.

140
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,730
And some of it's in like a, I
was talking to this mom once, uh,

141
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,120
her daughter does gymnastics with my
daughter and we were talking about, um,

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,460
kids killing themselves
where she used to live.

143
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,560
She still live in one of the
really wealthy tech areas
outside of San Francisco.

144
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,090
And a bunch of kids that went to school
with her daughter that were like 15, 16,

145
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,560
we're jumping off bridges and chin.

146
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,550
Like it was a like an epidemic and they
were trying to figure out what the fuck

147
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:14,180
is going on.

148
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,150
And they're literally calling it Affluenza
that these affluent kids and their

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,490
families are literally worth
$1 billion. You know, I mean,

150
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:26,150
everybody's super rich and they're
having this insane pressure.

151
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,770
It like before high school and in high
school to be an Ivy League schools and to

152
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:33,020
get 4.0 is and all and they're fucking,

153
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,800
they're not having any fun and they're
not experienced in life and they don't

154
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,431
have any hope.

155
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:40,340
And their parents are all on fucking
pills and they're just killing themselves.

156
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,020
And as you said, it really is a piece of
perspective because if you think about,

157
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,950
think about some,

158
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,040
when you watched one of your
buddies go down the downward spiral,

159
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,140
maybe it's not the suicide,
but whether it's drug addiction,

160
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,380
a lot of times some female,
the girlfriend, the ex wife,

161
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:58,590
we'll just take them on the
downward spiral and theirs,
they can't get out of it.

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,480
And if they were to step back,
if they were,

163
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,420
if it was you and your buddy watching
one of your other friends go down this

164
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,700
path, they go, oh my God, I can't
believe he's doing that. That's crazy.

165
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,340
But when you're in that spiral,
people get caught in that and they can't,

166
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,920
they can't get the perspective of
what it looks like from the outside.

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,030
Okay.
