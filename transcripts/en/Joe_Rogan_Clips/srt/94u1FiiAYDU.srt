1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
An absolute beast with free speech.
I and, and I know the fucking line.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,900
It's a private company.
It could do what they want.

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:10,650
Freedom of speech is about the
government and it's like, yeah,

4
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,300
but are you okay with that?

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,620
Are you okay with a faceless corporation?
Uh,

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,450
deciding what you can watch and see and
hear and who can speak based on nothing

7
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:26,430
but this arbitrary ideology that comes out
of a building. Like, I don't like that.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,410
I want anyone to have the ability
to speak about anything they want,

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,240
no matter how repugnant it is. Like,
like meet it with a lively debate. Well,

10
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:40,110
here's the, here's a perfect
example. Forget Alex Jones.

11
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:41,310
Let's talk about what
we talked about earlier.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,850
Laura Loomer versus Louis Farrakhan.
You, where's your consistency?

13
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:47,010
You've got to explain to me
how that works. How does,

14
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:51,120
how is it okay for the guy on Twitter
to be calling Jewish people termites?

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,360
I mean that that is, that's
something you exterminate. Yeah,

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,210
this is Nazi Germany type. Yeah, exactly.
How is that? Okay, that's okay with you.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,040
But then, I mean, how about look, it's,
it's works that way on the left as well.

18
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,380
Like how about that guy that
just got kicked off of CNN?

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,500
Cause he was talking about the Jewish
posers against Palestine and that he's for

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,220
Palestinian liberation and they were
like, fuck you, you're done. Like this,

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,320
this decision that,
or the,

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,040
the thought processes involved in
decisions that they make is not based on

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,950
rational thinking and objective
reasoning. So arbitrary, uh,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,250
you just don't know. It's based on which
way the culture swinging, you know,

25
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,640
and the culture is,
is swinging in a way that avoids any,

26
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,660
any possible accusations of racism. If
you think in, in any way she performed,

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,030
you're going to be thought of as racist.

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,080
You avoid that because there's some
people that say horrific shit about white

29
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,120
people. Oh yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,990
They don't get van literally calling
for their death and, and yeah,

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,320
they don't know that girl that got hired
by New York Times and it was a massive

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,610
uproar because she had so many anti white
things on her Twitter. Oh yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,160
The Asian girl. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

34
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:06,450
just all that ridiculous
left wing woke nonsense.

35
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,800
You're allowed to be completely
racist against white people.

36
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:15,450
Massive generalizations against
white men in particular. Yeah, it is.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,280
It absolutely is discrimination.

38
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:21,240
And it's absolutely what you're
doing is you're being prejudiced,

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,500
but you're being prejudiced with a stamp.
Well, you've got to stamp of approval.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,260
Yeah. You're allowed
to be. And I love the,

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,900
the just rules that are made up
that are ridiculous. It's like, ah,

42
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:35,220
you're a racist. I can't be
a racist. I am this or that,

43
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,160
or I can't be sexist. I
can't be this. I mean,

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,560
it's like who's making these
fucking rules up. Exactly.

45
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:43,200
And how come I am not privy to
any of them? Of course I can.

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,120
I can call on any of these roles.
Did.

47
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,210
The beautiful thing about that is that
hypocrisy will eventually bite them in

48
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,360
their ass. And people who are rational,
who listened to the argument against it.

49
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:55,540
And so you, you absolutely can be sexist
against men. Yeah, absolutely. Ken,

50
00:02:55,541 --> 00:03:00,100
of course. And you are a lot of
feminists are 100% against men.

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,640
There's this feminist that I
fall her fucking Twitter picture,

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,740
the image of the big one. The banner
one says trust. No Man. Great.

53
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,030
Okay, well good fucking luck. Good luck
and cutting out half the population.

54
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:16,090
Don't trust them. How about trust
is all women you're going to do.

55
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,070
That will be great.
Congratulations.

56
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,570
Cause you got about 15
to 20% cunts and that's,

57
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:26,980
you're going to have to trust all of them.
Yeah. Yeah. Good luck. You got 80, 80,

58
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,570
85, 90% may be good gals and you've,
you got uh, your, your polluted.

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,570
We'll get a polluted population.
Just like men,

60
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,110
population of men is a polluted
population of women. If you,

61
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,790
if you thought that you were going to
get pure drinking water without dropping

62
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:45,100
in those, uh, purification tablets, you're
going to get charged some shit in there.

63
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:49,950
Yeah. You're going to get,
you're going to get sick. The,
yeah, that I, there's no, um,

64
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,760
there's no 100% on any of that.

65
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:57,060
So when we saw the whole believe all
women thing that happens during the cabin

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,100
hearings and whatnot, I didn't do that
bit the other night. Did A, uh, uh,

67
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,070
now tell it to you off air. Oh, okay.
I'll tell you something off here. That's,

68
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,320
it's, it's, it's crazy. Like
the idea that anyone would say,

69
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:13,160
believe all women is as mental is saying,
believe no women.

70
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,510
It's the same stupid thing because there's
going to be assholes is going to be

71
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:21,440
pieces of shit.
I was saying on the show the other day,

72
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:25,430
like no one really wants equality.

73
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,680
No one equality isn't good.
The,

74
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:33,530
the fight for equality is where it's at
and you never want to attain it because

75
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,970
then you're not special anymore.

76
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,530
If you're fighting for equality that
you're always a victim, there's always a,

77
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,930
an oppressor and you're
fighting that once you're equal,

78
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,820
you can be called a shithead. You could
be called stupid. Everything else.

79
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:49,940
You're just another face in the crowd
with another stupid voice that probably

80
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:54,500
shouldn't be heard. Uh, so no
one ever really wants equality.

81
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,720
No matter how much they're
clamoring to get achieved,

82
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:59,870
you're going to find some reason why
it's not right. Why it's not valid.

83
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,660
And you can still say that you're,

84
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:05,870
you're being victimized by something that
currency in it. Yeah. Yeah. There is.

85
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:10,610
There's, there's definitely equity and
being a victim and not being equal yet.

86
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,350
Wait, but you're fighting. You can say
things that other people can't sit. Right.

87
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,240
We see all the ties.
You can be completely prejudice.

88
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,660
You can do a lot of things you could
never do if you were another race.
