1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,940
I don't think it was science is saying,
hey,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,850
nobody comes back from the
dead after three days. Hey,

3
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:10,230
people can't really walk on water. Hey,
uh, why did he turn water into wine?

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:13,230
Why didn't he just make wine?
He's fucking magic.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,260
I never thought of that. Stop
with the magic trick, Bro.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,460
We're trying to get fucked up.

7
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:25,230
Just make us why camp tied a wind gunny
whiskey in that and those magic robes

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,820
get the miracles were sort of
like stupid fucking parlor tricks.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,840
His miracles are horrible.
He knows the best.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,640
There was a thing back in the 80s called
the power team for Jesus and what they

11
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:41,870
were with these dudes that would do
like feats of strength for Jesus.

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,350
Like they would, uh, they would
fucking break bricks with their head.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,080
They would rip phonebooks and half,
they would lift up heavy weights,

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,930
do it for Jesus. Wow. But Jesus gave him
the power. Yeah. But it was also like,

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,710
hey dude, Jesus's, he's
magic. He's got magic.

16
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:00,890
Like he's not going to be impressed by
you breaking a board with your extra

17
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:05,600
thick skull. You fucking, yeah. Well
look at one of my children down there.

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,170
If you never heard of them. No, I dude,
I used to watch them all the time.

19
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:12,950
They were all like this religious channel
and I used to watch the power team for

20
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:16,610
Jesus going, what in the fuck is
this? That's amazing. It was. So,

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,020
have you found anything on it? I found
a lot. There's got to find that good.

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,020
A good one. Those guys are the
third street promenade. Oh,

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,060
Deep Virginia. Jesus. Yeah.
See? Oh, a break bricks.

24
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:33,660
Yes. What chooses a frog?
This brick for the load

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,110
star roads for sure. Devil. Ah,

26
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,420
yeah, I do use my head. Oh yeah.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,010
Oh, Max kicked it. Whoa. Whoa.

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,070
It seems a little too
easy to break though.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,380
We're really making the best for
Jesus. Ooh, drops it elbow low.

30
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm gonna blow up this balloon for Jews
or they blow it up until it explodes.

31
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,740
That's why they have to wear goggles
on. It's like a whole lot. But yeah,

32
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:06,370
it's a bladder. That's not,
this trick is not great wax.

33
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,130
You're right in the face. It's just
so stupid song. Boom. Here comes, go.

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,850
Boom. I ripped a phone book. What's
that? What's that thought it was pot.

35
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,130
That's saliva pod as a Christian pod.
Pod payable on death.

36
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,820
What was the goal of the Christian
rock? Yeah, that's like, um,

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,840
they have some great fucking
songs. Yeah, here comes the boom.

38
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,350
Yeah, it's Brooke's ripping and phone
books and half for Jesus. Look at this.

39
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:37,270
He's bending a bar for Jesus is going
to love us. And by the way, this is a,

40
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,020
this is a newer power team.
This is not the original power team.

41
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,170
Power came 2.0 is it? Well, the
older guys are dead from steroids.

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,570
1990 Jesus now is, this is a 1991. Yeah.

43
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,140
Those huddle look at is,
look at the fucking mullet Bro,

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,320
and shaved armpits, by the way.
Notice that right? That use it.

45
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:03,160
Shaved armpits. Look at the
pants. Those puffy pants,

46
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,120
those gym pants. Hold on. What
is he saying? I was walking in.

47
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,610
All my friends were inside the door
shut behind me. Like the door shut.

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,580
Jesus took the blinders,

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,260
enrolled them right off
my eyes and inside them.

50
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,240
That bar for the first time in
my life I saw the world would,

51
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:31,650
it really had to offer me, he
would. It was a big fat zero.

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,380
I got in my car, I drove home with
my wife. We got inside our apartment.

53
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,180
My wife went and sat on the couch,

54
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,780
high paced back and forth in the living
room because he's like a lion who would

55
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:46,910
chain down everything. The world
pass by him and I was chained down.

56
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,190
I said, well, I've looked all my life.

57
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,370
This is for people where they put
pro wrestling's little too game.

58
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,520
It's pro wrestling without the other guy.

59
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,310
It's for people to think
progressive is too complicated.

60
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,790
Like I don't get what they're saying and
pro wrestling. There's too many people,

61
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,540
too many moving pieces. It hurts
my brain. I like this. Yeah.

62
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,860
That was a huge crowd, dude. That's
like 25 plus thousand people.

63
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,520
That plays a giant. Oh, I'm in
the wrong business. Yeah. Look,

64
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,520
they lift things up for, for the Lord.
Oh, what happened? The mullet, Bro.

65
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,570
Gorilla Mullen. The fuck is, he
didn't jump rope. It looks bigger too.

66
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,210
He did more roids and got rid of them
on his head. Grew his foreheads larger,

67
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,600
multiple people. Are they going to
throw him into a, a pet or something?

68
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,950
This is crazy.
Oh,

69
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,220
I wonder if it has the same speech or if
he gives a different one every time. Oh,

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,990
well that's the same guy, bro.
Molokais right behind him now. Yeah.

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,800
He's got the chains on
there. The same human. Yeah.

72
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,730
They're the same guy that it's a clone
tech team partner. Maybe they're twins.

73
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,830
They're tag team partners. Oh,
Christ. Ladies and gentlemen.

74
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,460
The more you committed to God, the
more you'll be committed to each other.

75
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,470
You'll never understand commitment.

76
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,870
The first time I ever saw them was
like on Jerry Springer or something.

77
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,390
Maybe they had a smash peep. Jesus
on Jerry Springer. Sometimes.

78
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,660
You know, they had to find out who's
the baby Mama. That's Maury. Maury was,

79
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,040
who's the baby daddy?
Yeah.
