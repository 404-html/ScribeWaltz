1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,990
I want you to just to fucking hold nothing
back. And then I went up after him.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:05,700
You know how I did fine,

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,030
didn't do good then do did fine
because I knew how to handle myself,

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:15,810
my professionalism,
the craft of what I know one out.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,150
But there's no following that with
what I do, which is totally different.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,380
And having the audience go, oh this
takes it to a whole new place. No.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,540
Did you ever listen to the
day the laughter died? Rick
Ruben with them? Yeah. Yeah,

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:34,230
yeah. Fucking phenomenal.
Great album. Just eating shit.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,210
Right until hours. He showed up at
danger fields for people who don't know.

10
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:44,040
It's literally, I will never forget, I was
just starting out. I think he did this.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,710
Look this up when that was,
I want to say it was like 1989 1990 no,

12
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:51,210
it was after that.
It was fairly early.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
It was fairly early because I
was very young in my career.

14
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,300
It might've been then cause I was
still living in Boston. No, no.

15
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:59,880
It might've been then because 89 yeah,

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,420
because I was thinking about
me living here now. But it was,

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,600
it had came out the first
time I lived here. Well,

18
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,800
I was living in Boston and I was just
starting out and there was a great

19
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,480
comedian named Mike Donovan,

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,140
who to this day is one of the funniest
guys I've ever seen in my life. And uh,

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,170
Mike Donovan was laughing to the point
where he couldn't breathe at dice doing

22
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,700
this set while he was doing
fucking stadiums. I mean,

23
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,330
dice was doing enormous Nassau Coliseum.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,400
What's in the bowl,
bitch? Oh, 20,000 people.

25
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,120
He was the biggest comedian of all time
and he just decides to show up at danger

26
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:43,500
fields in New York city randomly on
like a Monday and a Tuesday night.

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,510
It doesn't tell anybody he's
going to be there. I mean,

28
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,550
there's 1320 people in the crowd.

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,680
He records two different
sets and he has no material.

30
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,030
I mean fucking none.

31
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,830
He's making things up as he goes along
and people are getting angry at him and

32
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:03,831
they're walking out and he did a bit
about Richard Nixon about how he eats ass

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,040
and when he eats ass he does it
like Richard Nixon. He was like, Oh,

34
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,720
I love this fucking house.

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,430
He was doing this Richard Nixon impression
of eating ass and for whatever reason,

36
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,830
Mike Donovan thought it was the funniest
thing he'd ever seen in his life.

37
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,690
He was wheezing, like couldn't breathe,
talking about dice doing this impression.

38
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,130
And I was like, wow, this is
like comedy for Comedians.

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,920
But for the people that were in the
audience, like a guy got up, he goes,

40
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,780
you're about as funny
as our glass of milk.

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,840
The Guy said that to him and then left
and that's one of the best things on the

42
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,690
album. These people from like
Kansas getting your about.

43
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,520
It's funny as our clause on milk and
walking off and dice shitting on them,

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,450
but the two to have them
mindset to be at the,

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,700
not just the top of his game,

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,060
but literally the top of standup ever.

47
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,450
No one before him had ever sold out
Madison Square Garden multiple nights in a

48
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,360
row the way he did.
I mean you guys have done it since then.

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,160
You know Dane and Louis and this
been a bunch of guys who've Aziz,

50
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,720
but no one did it like he did. Then.
He was the first ever to do that.

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
And to do that and then to record these
fucking awful sets and then put it out.

52
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,550
We're gonna fucking pull.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,920
I guarantee that was Rick Rubin's
idea. Do you think so? Without a doubt.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,140
But you know, does dices like
Dyson? I know Rick Rubin.

55
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,420
I bet it was both of their ideas.
Well maybe you didn't fight Rick Ruben.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,620
I'll have to ask for a group of
next time I see him. Yeah, asked,

57
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,840
never asked him that. But that sounds to
me like Rick Rubin going, let's do this.

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,830
Interesting. Yeah, but it
was such a crazy bold move.

59
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:45,910
I remember thinking at the time because
I was terrible in 1989 when it came out

60
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:48,400
and I was just like confused.
Like how does one do that?

61
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,980
One is so confident they
released something that sucks.

62
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,320
Cause I had as I was when I was
19 it's me and my girlfriend,

63
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:01,321
Mark De mi and Marta were sitting in
my car and I had a cassette player and

64
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,760
we're listening to dice. It was just
called dice and crying, laughing,

65
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,180
crying, laughing. It was before I'd ever
done stand up. And I remember thinking,

66
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:15,130
Wow, this guy is fucking something.
Like what? What? Like the, the,

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,280
the amount of power that he had like
onstage and these roars from the crowd and

68
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,220
we're sitting in my car laughing
our asses off to this seat.

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,250
This cassette wasn't even CD that couple
of years later he decided I'm just

70
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:34,270
going to put out something that's sucks.
The day of the comedy died.

71
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,770
Did they? Laughter died. Yeah.

72
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,930
And he's got like one of them fucking
paper Boi hats on the cover. Oh,

73
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:45,700
it's a old man. Black point. And there's
the little picture of him on there.

74
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,980
Is that what it is? I can,
yeah. Small picture I think.

75
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,920
Or maybe it's a big picture of him there.
It doesn't really remember.

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,290
Oh that was a big picture.
We should get up. Oh yeah.

77
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,310
So it is small in comparison
to the actual CD. Yeah.

78
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,010
See if we can get Jamie,

79
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,660
let's get a framed copy of that
and put it on the wall somewhere.

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,300
Was it released as an album
like, I dunno, guarantee image.

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,680
I guarantee there's vinyl
guarantee. Yeah, let's get find it.

82
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,360
See if we could buy it.
And Vinyl.

83
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,030
Look on the very right now for
the day that they did it again,

84
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,240
get it three years later.

85
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,290
I've seen him do that at the store.
I seen them go up late night at the store.

86
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:30,881
I'm like, look, good.

87
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:35,881
You look at you over there and just
start talking shit to people like me.

88
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:36,611
What does he wear?

89
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,640
Weightlifting gloves whenever
he's like touching people's hands.

90
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,790
Is that what it is? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,250
And Big Jay Oakerson whereas weightlifting
gloves in Omaj to guys. Yeah,

92
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,130
no, that's great. Yeah. I was trying to
get the two of them together in a podcast,

93
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,660
but scheduling wise, it never
really worked to shaking the dice.

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,520
Doctor's hand photo on the final,
Oh for 400 bucks on Amazon.

95
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,140
Oh, by that shit. No, no, no. We're gonna
frame hundred bucks. I'll go to dice.

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,270
He might not have it. Yeah, I guarantee
he's got it. Yeah. You pay for lunch.

97
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:11,540
I'll give you the, the, uh, the album.
Have you ever seen his Instagram?

98
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,920
If we go to dices Instagram? No,
it's hilarious. It's just so random.

99
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,440
It's like an older rich,

100
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,040
famous guy who does whatever the
fuck he wants. Opposed to IV,

101
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,320
had coffee or lunch with
them a million times.

102
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:29,290
I had never had one of those
things. Never happen. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,400
He um, he used to, I miss him like with,

104
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,800
with a gold's gym tee shirt on with
crazy sunglasses and he'll do like these

105
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:41,290
little sketches, but they're so random and
weird. Like him talking to a girl, look,

106
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,690
maybe we should do something later in the
girl's like, okay, like click on this,

107
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,730
play this, this is like
his, this is his whole thing

108
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,700
like skateboarding.
I was thinking about it.

109
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,940
Maybe we should do that.

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,160
Can you cook dinner for her? Here's
the question. What are you? Stay on

111
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,850
the phone. What's your name? Nicole.

112
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,840
Nicole. All right. I'll call, I'll
call you. I've got to go take this.

113
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,030
Oh, it's the end of it. Afterwards
he goes and he's got another one,

114
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:24,660
a follow up when he gets mad at himself
for not doing anything about it.

115
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,840
Like go to the next video
that's sided.

116
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,660
There's another there. Play this
one. What a beautiful night. Huh?

117
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,270
Beautiful.
That's it.

118
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,720
It's out in the Lord.
It's just this little beautiful

119
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,280
Eleanor Kerrigan. Yeah,
they're so random. The videos,

120
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,780
I guess the text in that video was like,
I should've done something.

121
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:58,740
What's wrong with me? Yeah, but this
is him. Why did I leave? I'm so dumb,

122
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,880
but they're so random. It's like,
what is he doing? He's just been dice.

123
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,890
He used to do that at the store.

124
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,520
He used to have comics do
these little sketches is, okay,

125
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,360
you're going to run through the door
there and you're going to knock him over

126
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,700
and you're going to go,
what the fuck? Okay,

127
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:21,860
go and the guy would do it and you run
into the door and knock the the guy over

128
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:25,260
and go, what the fuck? Go. Perfect.
Do it again. And he would just,

129
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:28,020
he would just film this with
like VHS tape, you know,

130
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:31,560
like an old school one and then
he would edit it together himself.

131
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,360
But he did nothing with it.
And this was like dice was giant,

132
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,790
just fucking top of the world.
China.

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,580
And this is what he's doing to
amuse himself and love comics.

134
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,760
The comics would just do it. Oh
Jesus Christ. You're just so happy.

135
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:48,180
Dice is talking to you. He's the
reason why I started doing the road.

136
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,620
I would just do the store all the time.
It was constant.

137
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:53,080
The store one time were in the bag goes,
oh you're funny.

138
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,940
You know you should do the row.
I go, yeah. He goes, Eh, it was,

139
00:08:56,941 --> 00:09:00,360
you don't want to rely on these
fucking assholes for money. He goes,

140
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:03,120
you could fucking do whatever you want.
Go through the road. I was like, yeah,

141
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,660
why don't I do the road? Cause I was
just doing TV shows and then you know,

142
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,630
do you, you're doing TV shows,
you kind of trapped in this,

143
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,010
this is how you make your living.

144
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:15,390
You got to kind of always be acting and
always be going on auditions. I was like,

145
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:18,270
yeah, I was cause I wasn't making, you
don't make real money at the store.

146
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:21,540
You make like 15 bucks a set or whatever.
We make, you know, I, I've spent.
