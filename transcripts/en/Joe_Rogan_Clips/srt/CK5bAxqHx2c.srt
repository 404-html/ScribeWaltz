1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,330
But at least in something
like hosting the today show,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,560
you are just talking once you put these
sort of diversity standards or something

3
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:11,830
like mathematics. Oh yeah. That's, that's
when things get super squirrely. Yeah.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,260
They're trying to do that a little bit.
I mean,

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,910
you retweeted that thing I wrote about
mathematics and they wanted people to

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:21,060
sign an equity, which is another
word that they've cooperated.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,450
They wanted folks to sign an equity
statement and a diversity statement.

8
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:27,530
And the thing is, explain that. Explain
what they're trying to, that you, you,

9
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,940
you have a commitment to diversity.
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:34,050
You have a commitment to diversity
and you have a commitment to equity.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,230
And so equity does not mean
treating people equally.

12
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,060
It's not like you have a
commitment to equality,

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,900
which is what we should all have a
short material quality. Uh, it's,

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,090
equity is defined differently.

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,090
It's to make up for past
injustices are to make up for,

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,580
um, some deficiency that has occurred
somewhere along the line. So,

17
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,830
yeah,
affirmative action is an equity movement.

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,370
It's to treat people differently in
order to level the playing field. Yeah.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,520
So it's not treating people,
it's not treating people equally.

20
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,630
And that's the key thing. It
sounds like it is, but it's not.

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,480
It's a word that Dave smuggled in
straight out of the literature. Again,

22
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,820
it's again on all the stuff
comes back to the literature.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,380
So if you look at the word equity in the
dictionary, you'd get one definition.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,850
But if you look at the word equity as
they're applying it and sociological

25
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,540
definitions,

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,380
it's a very specific thing that means
something slightly different from what

27
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,900
people assume. So here's the
question you should ask somebody.

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,250
Anytime you hear someone used the word
equity, just ask all I'm, I'm curious,

29
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:39,130
why didn't you use the word equality?
Can, can you, can you think of it?

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,360
Would the sentence be the same
with the meaning be the same? Well,

31
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,540
the meaning is not the same. That's
why they used equity and not equality.

32
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:49,060
Equity is a finance word. That's why
it's weird. It is also fun. Yeah.

33
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,130
So they don't make up new words,
right? They go up. Yeah. They call up,

34
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,170
they change and then they smuggle
diversity inclusion, right.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,150
These academic papers and
they come up with these ideas.

36
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:02,100
They start with their conclusion,
they push it through,

37
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,350
it gets published and that's just like,

38
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:08,940
it's like the academic equivalent of money
laundering does money laundering work.

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,920
Yes. You take some money, you got
ill gotten money, you put it through,

40
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,310
you know this shell company or this thing
or the other thing and it comes back

41
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,490
to you and now it's had illegal
trail that makes it legit. Right.

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,000
Well here you take some prejudice,
you write it down as an academic paper,

43
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:27,390
you published a thing,
it gets the academic standard stamp on it.

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,510
It's the gold standard of
knowledge now and now this is,

45
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,330
this prejudice you started with now looks
like legitimate knowledge that can go

46
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,610
straight in the classroom.
It can go straight to exactly.

47
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,730
Activists or policymakers.
It's a real problem. Yeah,

48
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,830
and when then really funny though that
you're just saying it's like can't get

49
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,000
DEMEC Moneyline it is. Yeah. That's bread.

50
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,840
That's just for our Weinstein said that
Bret Weinstein said that and that's what

51
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:51,270
it is.
It comes out the other side is knowledge.

52
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,270
So then they think they have knowledge,
right.
