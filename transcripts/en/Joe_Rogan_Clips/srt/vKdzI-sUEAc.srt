1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,490
It's just like, like, uh,
by publicly saying this,

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,050
you can speak to your respective group
and you have an immediate reward for it.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,000
So it's like, you know, it's like, I
don't even know if we're more sensitive.

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,300
We're just more outspoken about,
you know,

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,990
things well because we have
an athletic more outraged.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,990
They're looking to get outraged.
That's,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,460
that's a really common thing now
that just didn't exist a few days.

8
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,650
I don't even think it's a, I don't even
think it's outrage, you know what I mean?

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:31,820
Like I really don't think it's outrageous.
Much as it cause outrage.

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,200
We've seen what outrage looks like at the,

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,860
when at the peak of,
uh,

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,920
like the black lives matter movement where
people at a course by people outrage.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,380
Yeah. But that's in the streets. But
that's what I'm saying. But that's what,

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,060
that's what outrage is. And I don't
want to confuse that with like,

15
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,600
you know, recreational outrage. Right.

16
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,750
And it's really important to draw that
distinction. Right. And so it's like, it,

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,640
it's, again, people are vocal
about things, some issues, real,

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,170
a lot of things we started getting
upset about there. Like certain,

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,230
we get upset about certain cultural
appropriation things of the week because

20
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:18,480
it's a Sushi restaurant on
a college campus. Right. You
know what I mean? Like we,

21
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:23,070
we get caught up in those things but
[inaudible] and not focus on, you know,

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,790
like I dunno,
it's like real outrageous.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,750
The thing that corporations
or afraid of isn't outrage.

24
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,220
It's trending.

25
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,880
You don't want to trend negatively for
like whatever period of time when when

26
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:40,970
people are upset with you and you've
done something genuinely wrong,

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,920
they'll show it beyond. It will extend
the scent that if it makes sense. Yeah.

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,010
Yeah. I think that a lot
of what outrageous is like
comedian trying out chokes.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,940
You know, you try out jokes and 30%
of them are just straight bullshit

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,520
fucking work man. You try
him, they stumble out,

31
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,840
you gave it a shot or you'll ad Lib
something in the moment on stage and even

32
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:06,620
after you say like, what the
fuck did I just say? Yeah.

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,960
I think there's some of that
that people are trying to,

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,360
like I was reading this article the
other day about some woman who was saying

35
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:17,361
that yoga is supporting white supremacy
because it was the dumbest shit ever.

36
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,290
Some Indian lady,

37
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,670
she was seeing the cultural appropriation
of yoga by white people is supporting

38
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:27,840
white supremacy and you know,
it's really fun.

39
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,630
What are we doing exactly
what the fuck are we doing?

40
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:34,890
But that's what she did is she
tried a bad joke. You know she's a,

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,813
she works on,

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,910
she's a professor and some
bullshit college where
they're just just drowning in

43
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:46,920
liberal arts and she just figured out a
way to say something outrageous that she

44
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,740
thought made sense in
her own weird bubble.

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,430
But this got published in a newspaper
and then the whole world went just

46
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:58,260
collectively. What the fuck are you
talking about? But that's what it's like.

47
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,500
It's like you are,

48
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:04,400
I try and a bit late
night at the store you do,

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,450
you just just riff something and it just
goes into a corner and just get stuck.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,820
Roomba vacuum cleaner things is bouncing
off the white like this is not working.

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,820
I got to bail out of this. Yeah, yeah. No,

52
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:22,830
it's funny because it is
like people people's age.

53
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,400
It's a creative force. She's
like, she tried to make
outrage where it didn't exist

54
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,750
and sometimes it catches
right like hoop earrings.

55
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,410
Like girls can't wear hoop
earrings anymore. Wait, wait.

56
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:38,680
Girls are scared to wear hooping hearings
because they're getting called out for

57
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:42,520
cultural appropriation by which
is hilarious by Latina chicks.

58
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,180
This is particularly Latino chicks are
saying and it's just all social justice

59
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:50,280
warrior bullshit. But what's really
funny is so I had, cause I'm an asshole,

60
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,800
I had to Google it. Well who the fuck
invented earrings? The Sumerians, the,

61
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,190
the oldest version of hoop
earrings is for 2,500 BC from Iraq.

62
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,320
So Iraqi's are the only ones who really
can claim cultural appropriation.

63
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,520
People wearing hoop earrings, not
Mexicans. So Mexicans settled down.

64
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,360
He does white girls alone cause you
stole a tail that was black girl. Shit.

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,620
Everybody Shit. It's like who invented
pants? Your culture appropriating.

66
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,000
You're wearing pants.
Who invented pants?

67
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,530
You were on a Korean phone bitching
about people doing, oh man,

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,140
talking about man. And it goes deep.
It's crazy. People are losing their mind.

69
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,590
They're looking for things to get outraged
that and so that they're trying jokes,

70
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,180
they're taking swings, you know, that
trying on pitches out there, you know,

71
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,320
you're spit balling. Well, I mean,
and eventually if it's like, if you,

72
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,780
you're gonna run out of ways to
approach it, you know what I mean?

73
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:53,800
Like you run out, we run a
places to, to stab the thing.

74
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,280
Well they try some that don't stick or
some stick for like a couple of days.

75
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,960
Like you remember Bossy, they were trying
to say, you can't say bossy. No. Why?

76
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:05,890
Why can't call girls bossy? It's sexist
crows, girls bossy. Don't call them bossy.

77
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,850
He was a thing where they were trying to
stop the use of the word or the phrase

78
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,680
bossy. They were saying bossy.
Sexist. Yeah. See, but like,

79
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,090
like can I ask a question? Where
did, uh, when, when did, uh,

80
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,080
when did cunt become a bad word?
It depends on who

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,990
you're in. England, man, they don't give
a fuck. Is that [inaudible] got hurt?

82
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,130
The herd used until like, I mean, nobody,

83
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,500
I didn't grow up around it.
I didn't hear people saying this.

84
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,900
I don't even think I heard it used
until like, I mean, I was probably theme

85
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,020
like a Hollywood bad word. Yeah, yeah.
No, it's word that when you used it,

86
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:51,760
you fucking really were angry. Yeah. Yeah.
It just, I don't know where it came from.

87
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,290
It's like the new bitch. It's not
new. I mean, it was around a long,

88
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,010
it's been around for,
so that was in high school,

89
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,290
but you called someone a cunt and high
school when you were a fighter brother.

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,310
Oh, shit would get deep. You couldn't
say con. You could say, bitch,

91
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,110
you're a fucking bitch. Fuck you. You're
a loser. You know, like you're a con. Oh,

92
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,280
dude. Well, there'd be like, what the
fuck did you just say? That's, yeah, I, I,

93
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,720
uh, yeah, I didn't hear it a lot at all.

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,660
And I could never imagine myself
casually called and some yet.

95
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,330
But if you lived in England, you could
oil, especially living in Australia,

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,340
they call someone a good con. Hey, he's
a good con. Oh, so it's a nice word.

97
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,690
Yeah. He's like, he's a, he's a,
he's a good dude. He's a good con.

98
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,130
Like people have, uh, my friend, uh,
Israel at a Sandhya style bender,

99
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,670
he wears a shirt that says good
con and he just wanders around.

100
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:50,240
It's from New Zealand because
they don't want people,

101
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,380
they think it's funny when people
get upset about it. He's a savage.

102
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,380
You better be careful.
Get upset with him. But

103
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,880
he's a UFC fighter. Oh, okay. All
right. Yeah, he's a, I mean, he's,

104
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,090
he's from another country.
It means a different thing in New Zealand.

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,680
If you say con in New Zealand,
it's a, it's like, I mean,

106
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,160
what's the equivalent? What would be
equivalent of con, the way they said,

107
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,530
good dude. He's a fuck good fucker.
He's a, he's a cool motherfucker.

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,910
He's a good con.
Where you asking because their style,

109
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,210
he wears that everywhere. No
one says shit. Yeah. Well, yeah,

110
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,510
but they sell those shares to look good.
I don't know.

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,490
Why would you ship Hashtag fuck
censorship Hashtag make co great again.

112
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,140
Well, I was going to say,
is it, is it that, uh,

113
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,580
what just like people's reaction to it
just kind of bothered me. Yeah. I'm like,

114
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,890
I'm like, oh, that's a,
it's a terrible battle.

115
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,500
Not a terrible bad word
like that where it sucks.

116
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,810
Like it ain't no motherfucker. You don't
like it. Don't think it's fun to say,

117
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:06,730
you know, rhythmically it's
just trash. Just like, bye.

118
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,640
I was going off of what we were
doing interesting shit. Trash.

119
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,190
I don't know if you went
to Australia though. They,

120
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:17,060
they would say it so many times it would
just slip in because this gets normal.

121
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,930
Yeah, I guess, yeah, it is just,
it's just one syllable. Like

122
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,700
it means dude over there sometimes like,
and this fucking con,

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
he goes over there and they'll,

124
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:29,570
they'll start talking about
it like this fucking dude.

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,500
They'll still literally say it in the
same way you would say this fucking guy.

126
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,143
Yeah.

127
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,060
It's just a different thing. I mean, look,

128
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,210
they're all just sounds that convey
expression, the world problems.

129
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,450
When you demonize one you say, you
know, you can't say the c word anymore.

130
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,400
Don't say the c word. Well, yeah,
I mean again, it's just like,

131
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,800
I just want us to have
like adult arguments. Yeah,

132
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,050
right. Well, it's hard to
have adult arguments, even
forbidden words. Well yeah,

133
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,730
we'll book has,
that's like the,

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,740
the shit that your sister got mad at you
about growing up. Right. He called me,

135
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,250
you know what I mean? Like is kind
of like, that's the thing. It's,

136
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,380
I mean you were saying intention earlier,

137
00:09:13,381 --> 00:09:16,820
but I mean there's always
like intentionally, what
do you mean by I get an,

138
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,100

it. And I, I her on all the time,

141
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,520
I'll always do just because we get
into the argument while simultaneously

142
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:40,320
respecting, you know, her views and
beliefs. It's also like, you know,

I grew up non suppressed.

147
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,860
My parents were hippies and they didn't
give a shit where we said we just do,

148
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,410

it at school, but you know,

149
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,340
there was no like language restrictions
in my house. I'm allowed to say anything.

150
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,710
That's great. Yeah, it
was weird. That was great.

151
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,050
And my friends would come over the house
and you just say fucking funny your mom.

152
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,340
I'm like, yeah, fuck it.

around people that like used to just talk

154
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:31,320

I had a friend,

156
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,480
my friend Alex is still one of
my favorite moments of life.

157
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,650
It was just like we came,

158
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,450
I came to this house after school and
his mom's name is Patricia and she was

159
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:49,380
just like, I'll take out the
garbage. It was like, go to hell pat.

160
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,940
His response, cause mom passed.
She caught it off. I like,

161
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,640
my mind was blown.
Told his mom to go to hell.

162
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,800
It was like amazing. And she just
argued back like it was. Yeah,

163
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,370
I was so mama was a dad
around. Uh, he knows that,

164
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:10,200
but it wasn't around like,

165
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,810
it was always so amazing. It was
amazing. That's a struggle that,

166
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:20,320
who's the man? When did you start
cussing around your mom? Um,

167
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,860
it's been a few hours. No,
I probably started, uh,

168
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,470
I mean I moved out when I was
a teenager, so I, I probably,

169
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,450
I mean she's heard me say it to kind
of throughout, but just in kind,

170
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,290
like not stopping it in conversation.
It's been years. I mean I just, Oh,

171
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,410
it's just kind of float. I'm low key,
still afraid to cousin from mine.

172
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,860
I cut it from my mom,
cuts in front of my niece and nephew.

173
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,050
How old are they? Well, all
of my knee, I have a, uh,

174
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,040
an 11 year old niece or nine year old
nephew, a couple of two year old twins,

175
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,120
a three year old niece,
like just,

176
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,050
and I am myself and speak exactly
how I normally speak around it.

177
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,770
You're an adult longer than you're a
kid, you know, and so it was just like,

178
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,800
why am I going to pretend the world
sounds different? Look, I, I'm with you.

179
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,220
But, and for like his kids are that
your brothers, your sisters? My brother,

180
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,040
my brother and sister in law.
Everybody cool with that or
they get upset? Uh, fake.

181
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,160
I mean they go like a come sometimes,
but it's also they get it.

182
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
They might my brother that they're very
understanding while they, they get it,

183
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:33,220
they get that. It's just like tell people
talk. It's how real world. Yeah. Yeah,

184
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,000
yeah. I mean I think that's
important. Again, you don't want to,

185
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,030
that's the thing man.
Just like don't even know you fucked up.

186
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,330
If you're at a job where
you're not on keen, not swear,

187
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,570
but you can't swear off job with the
people you work with or does that help or

188
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:51,550
they'll get, yeah, you
can get trouble. Yeah. He,

189
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,910
if there's certain jobs where people have,
where they,

190
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,150
they got off work and they went out with
some coworkers and they told a dirty

191
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:02,230
joke or start talking shit like that
will get back to human resources and

192
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,064
there'll be fired.

193
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,040
Bosses are now following their
employees online and shit. Like Twitter.

194
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,570
That girl that got fired from NASA,
fucking hilarious.

195
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,490
She got fired from NASA yesterday. She
was like, Holy Fuck, I got a job at NASA.

196
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,640
And some guy tweeted her, he
said, language, and she said,

197
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,590
suck my dick and balls. I work
at NASA. And he said, yeah.

198
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:25,670
And I am,
you know,

199
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:30,671

at Nasa and then [inaudible] are not,

200
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,480
well, she was about to be an
intern working at NASA and
she was like, here it is.

201
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,590
Everyone shut the fuck up. I got
accepted for a NASA internship and look,

202
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:42,560

00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:46,790
I'm working at NASA and he says that
I'm on the National Space Council that

204
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,900
oversees NASA.

205
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,120
Yeah.
