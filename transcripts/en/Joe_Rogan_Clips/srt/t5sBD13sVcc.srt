1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,410
You know,
when you get off of like,

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,560
you had like one of the most
spectacular fights with Jon Jones,

3
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:06,610
I mean down to the wire,

4
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:11,260
like is as close as it gets and when
you get out of a fight like that,

5
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:15,760
will you all most won the title against
the greatest of all time? Like what is,

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,430
what is that feeling like and
where do you go from there?

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,040
Uh, you know, uh, it was tough.

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,180
It was really tough because I
know everybody was saying like,

9
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:31,600
you're winning this fight, winning this
fight. You had three rounds against him.

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,010
Are you winning this fight tonight?
If it felt like, like you said,

11
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:40,520
it was something, it was just, it was just
right there at the goal line. You know,

12
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,600
I didn't really pass that
goal nine at all. Um,

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,670
I just felt like I knew it
was tough. It was tough, but,

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,780
but, but like now I'm sitting here
now talking to you. It's a big,

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,110
it's a really good experience for
me. And, and you know, I really,

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,090
it's a good time for me.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,570
If I was a w e is a highlight in my
career for sure in my life for sure.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,450
Well,
it's such a close fight when the,

19
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:08,010
when the scorecards are being
tagged and you, uh, you know,

20
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,470
you're just sitting there waiting for
the decision. Did you think you hadn't,

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,070
you know, I didn't know. Right. I
didn't know. I didn't know much chaos.

22
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:19,000
Could you even remember what had happened
over the last five rounds? I remember,

23
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:23,680
I remember, I remember the, I
remember the fight, uh, and I got,

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,710
I remember almost the whole fight, but it
was just John. John's just such a basis.

25
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,510
He, I'm telling you, just
for me, John Jealous,

26
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:38,920
winning over John Jones is bigger than
taking the belt. I'm filling that guys.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,380
The guy is such a beast and, and uh, yeah.

28
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,243
What was the question?

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,090
No, it's okay. Being Express yourself.
That's fine. I mean, I agree with you.

30
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,080
He is a beast.
You know,

31
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm very disappointed with all the
stuff that's happened to him obviously,

32
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,180
and especially the most recent one,
which I really,

33
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,020
I really believe based on the
evidence as a mistake, I think,

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,780
I think he got ahold of something
tainted because of they,

35
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,300
they tested him before
that he was negative.

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,720
They tested him after that he was negative
and what he tested for with such a

37
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:12,920
minuscule amount, there's no way it was
something that he, yeah, there's no way,

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,180
like according to Novitsky and according
to Usada according to like how they

39
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:20,180
test people, what, whatever he consumed,

40
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,030
it must have been an
extremely small amount.

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,290
It wasn't an amount that would have
had any benefit whatsoever in terms of

42
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,090
performance,
performance enhancing.

43
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,460
Well they know their thing. So,
you know, just let the, you know,

44
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,560
expert handled that.
I don't know what to say.

45
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:41,360
I know for a fact that he's been in
that same situation a couple of times.

46
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,740
This is not the first time.
So

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,370
he definitely is a wild motherfucker.
Hayes Hayes.

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,640
He definitely does some Shitty, probably
shouldn't do but a hundred percent man.

49
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,610
But, uh, I mean, but the thing is, it's
so stupid because he's, what is he?

50
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,040
He's the best guy, pound
for pound out there.

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,890
He's done things nobody
else has done is he,

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,920
he's just a beast and still
shit just comes up all the time.

53
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,330
He doesn't even need that steroids.
He doesn't even need that shit in them.

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,280
He's still the best out there. I don't
think he took anything. I really don't,

55
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,780
but I, but I agree with you on that.
And I think you need a guy like that.

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,000
You need a guy like that out there.

57
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,500
Like to bring you to your full potential.
Do you agree? Yeah, I agree with you.

58
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,820
I agree with you. Yeah. No. Like I said
to you, fighting him and beating him,

59
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,750
that's bigger than taking the bumps right
now. That's how I feel. Because he's,

60
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,750
look what it did to DC, man. Yeah.

61
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,050
And do you see is tough history that he
finished DC? Yes. That's just insane.

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,280
It's just insane.

63
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,940
And he finished him with a kick that DC
said he's never going to hit him with.

64
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,750
Yeah. That's crazy. That's insane. Yeah.

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,600
You Never gonna hit me with that
left thigh kick. Oh, blam yeah.

66
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,980
Just look for the opportunity to
fix it. Yeah. Tendencies are crazy.

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,120
It's just some of them just get so
ingrained in the way your body moves.

68
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,650
No, he's, he, he's an expert at what,
of course, what he's doing. And he's,

69
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:12,120
he's studying his opponent very well.
Uh,

70
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,050
everything is just such planet in
details for the fights and he just,

71
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,540
he knows exactly when he should
go for that or that or that.

72
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:24,160
And staying creative and use news fantasy.
And it's amazing to see.

73
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,970
Yeah. That Jackson Winkeljohn team
is truly exceptional team. I mean,

74
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,860
they really did do phenomenal with him.
