1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,770
Just a come and meet the family.
Please don't make me meet your family.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,160
How did you meet Joey? How'd
you meet Joey Diaz? Uh,

3
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:14,280
I think Heidi set that up.
You'd never met him before?

4
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,380
He didn't show us via
Heidi. Via you. Ah, yeah,

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,260
I knew who he was and um,
he's a really lovable guy. Uh,

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,490
as soon as I met him,
I liked him just by seeing them online.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,750
But when I met on my route, there's
nothing not to like, he's so honest.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,150
He's full, full exposure.
Like who, who he is.

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,490
You get it in 60 seconds.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,470
But I think it's why people like him
because there's no bs and like, you know,

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,070
there's the good,
the bad of anybody.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,900
He lets you know who he is in the first
five minutes and you can take or leave

13
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,850
it,
but there's no ambiguity.

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,540
And I really like being around that
because you can be yourself because he has

15
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:00,960
shown enough being himself,
he's not holding back.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,550
That's a really good way of looking at it.

17
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,940
You can be yourself because he
is being himself. Totally. And,

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,650
and he's not going to judge you on that.
He's going to give you the free,

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,900
and he's going to be himself,

20
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,790
but give you also the freedom to be
yourself unlimited. Yeah, I mean, it was,

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,900
we spoke for a while on his podcast,
had a great time,

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,900
and he's one of those guys, if he
called me at three in the morning, Hey,

23
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm in trouble. I'm in San
Diego. I'm like, hold on, give
me three hours. I mean, I,

24
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,300
I'll help you and come and
meet the family. I please

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,520
send it to send a card.
