1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,360
Uh, anything else? Yeah. So I was going
to bring this up at the beginning,

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,030
but the golden snitch,

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,190
that's first of all, that's Brendan
Shop's name. He gave it to you.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,390
So taking on a life of its own.
And I think, I think, you know,

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:19,920
the last time we talked about Donna asking
Alexa, who won the gold is the gold,

6
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:23,290
isn't it? Yes. Let me see that. We'll
see what Siri says. Hold on a second.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,550
Let's see what Siri says, but I've
never tried this. Hold on a second.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,710
Okay.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,180
Who is the Golden Snitch?

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,660
Yeah,

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,120
he's some inflammation. Wow. Oh yeah.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,870
Quiet itch. It's something
in Harry Potter. Yeah.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,690
Which I didn't know is that the last time
on? And I mentioned, you know, it was in,

14
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,490
I think my Wikipedia profile.

15
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,030
It had me as Aka the golden snitch
and somebody took that knows,

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,230
Hey Siri,
who is the golden snitch?

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,993
Okay.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,770
Oh, Siri. Siri keeps
going with the quad itch.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,890
So someone took it down from,
what did they do that well,
I think we talked about,

20
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:07,170
you're like, Eh, I dunno. They,
they just did it very valuable. Um,

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,620
so I think I told you about us backup
already. Coworkers call me at, yes,

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,410
my family calls me. They call you
the goldens friends calling me.

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,750
I was at the MMA awards last year and
some Yahoo had a few pops of back at me is

24
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:23,230
screaming in between presentations,
the golden snitches.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,580
I'm slinking down in my chair,
my girlfriend and I are,

26
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:30,430
it is damn the golden
stitch is backup already.

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,540
See on the end that the popped
up. Beautiful. Just, just
fucking when they do that,

28
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,500
just put your hands up in the air.
Make a shake you one. So you know,

29
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,110
definitely should make a shirt during
shows all sit pretty close to the cage.

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,430
Go out in between a fight into the
bathroom and it's not Joe Rogan level half

31
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,660
the damn arena standing up.

32
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:49,240
Excited to see you walking in
and out of the fight or walk.

33
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:53,020
But two or three people in that walk
when I go backstage to check on each side

34
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:56,740
of the golden snitch.
So give them wrecking,

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,770
you know Steve Reed, you know,
so you've read our bald security,

36
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,500
that bad ass looking guy on stage.
He'll come back stage just mate,

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,970
they're calling me the snitch out there,
man.

38
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,810
I think I'm you that for God pays for it.
Um,

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,900
we were in teams. A scary
guy, dude. He's a great dude.

40
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:15,480
That guy is at the top of his
game. Insecurity. Just background.

41
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,570
Fucking unbelievable. Yeah. I saw him
one time in Las Vegas during a fight.

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,560
He was sitting on the floor.
Something's happened in the fight.

43
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:28,120
The crowd goes fucking bananas and
everybody stands up on the floor.

44
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,630
Steve stands up and just motions sit
down in the entire fucking section.

45
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,650
Sat down 200 plus people.
I'm like toot if you can,

46
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,660
without even having to touch somebody,

47
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,870
just stand up by your presence alone
and control something like that. I mean,

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,960
the best I've ever seen, he's
legit. As it gets down to,

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,050
are you going to do anything
to market this? Well,

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,250
that's getting to my story here.
It's not marketing,

51
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,880
but let me finish the story here.
I'm in Chicago this year.

52
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,890
I think there was a paper view.
You were there, right? Yes.

53
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,000
So something happened and I was late to
the arena and they had cut off kind of

54
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:04,600
the loading dock. I couldn't get to it.
So I had my oldest daughter with me.

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,820
And so we're having to walk through
where all the crowds walking in and you

56
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,720
know, Dude's all of golden snitch. Hey,
can we get a picture golden snitch.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,160
My daughter's like, what the fuck is
going on? How old is your daughter?

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,930
So she's 22 so two days ago,
Christmas morning,

59
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:27,310
I'm opening up presence.
So I get the presence for my daughters,

60
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,770
the three of them,
and my middle daughter's very artistic.

61
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,970
And so they create these cool sculpted
beer mugs and there's four of them.

62
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:38,500
One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing
Novitsky something and one of them says

63
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:42,110
golden snitch brewing company. So
it's cool looking thing. And she,

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,160
she drew me a black and white
kind of rendition of all four,

65
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,680
which I'm gonna hang up really cool.
So then my girlfriend's there,

66
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,190
so she hands me the box and she's
been telling me all launches.

67
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,530
I got you the best fucking present ever
in the history of presence. I'm like,

68
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,500
the hell is this?
So I opened up the box.

69
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,710
Yeah.

70
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,680
Oh my. She's got this series
of tee shirts and I think,

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,550
what size are you? Large.
Large. There we go man. So you,

72
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,990
since you created it, you literally
and figuratively have to wear it. Now

73
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,260
this is outrageous. So that
picture there, there's some,

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,303
oh,

75
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,130
say who you go baby ladies,
gentlemen,

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,730
circle close.
Look at that.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,600
So I posted a boot on this or something
that's can king series Moscow,

78
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,950
I think I can say this.
Hopefully they'll let me back in,

79
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,951
but it's out in front of KGB or FSP
headquarters to that building in the

80
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,270
background is KGB. F has
now known as FSB. Oh Wow.

81
00:04:56,271 --> 00:05:00,410
So yeah. So I posted a picture
of, she got me like 20 shirts.

82
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:03,890
I put them on not to private Instagram,
Facebook. Everybody in the world's like,

83
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:07,460
take my money man. Where can I get one?
I'm wearing the weigh ins tomorrow.

84
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,343
Alright,

85
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,670
you guys create it.
You've got to own it now.

86
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:17,550
I got one for shop too that you can throw
the shops mad at you. Is He? Yeah. He's,

87
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,190
he called you the golden wrap now changed.
I thought maybe you got him in here.

88
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,400
He's in for misinformed. He thinks first
of all that you were an employee of,

89
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:29,120
you saw it. Oh, there you go. And that
now you're an employee or the UFC. Uh,

90
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,740
he's misinformed about that and I
think he, he likes to call skeptical.

91
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,820
He skeptical hippo. I am
skeptical as well, but I,

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,290
one thing that I've learned from doing
this podcast over the years is that

93
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,270
there's no fucking way there's,
it's an,

94
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,260
it's impossible to know everything.

95
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,710
It is impossible and you have to rely
on the expertise of the people who have

96
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:59,060
spent a lifetime studying these things.
It's very important. Here's another thing.

97
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,630
There's no way these people could be
lying about this and it wouldn't massively

98
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:10,360
damaged. There we are going forward. It'd
be done. They, someone would find out,

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,540
someone would get to them,
the other scientists without them.

100
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,970
There would be studies done,
there would be papers done.

101
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,640
The Internet would find out
about it. Everybody would
know. There's no way. It's,

102
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,770
it's pretty unprecedented in writing
with the lack of the studies.

103
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:26,920
There were Chenko one being the my
sanding even right. How do you say it?

104
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,190
[inaudible] yeah,

105
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,950
it's pretty unprecedented that they
would put these absolutes in writing. Um,

106
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,310
you know, with this law, you know,

107
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,600
I think they looked at it very hard
and detailed and obviously they weren't

108
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:41,350
quick and turning it around and we would
have loved this decision to be made a

109
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:44,710
lot earlier so we could have
rooted and vetted out with Nevada.

110
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,060
But they did indeed,
you know,

111
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,570
sign their names to these pretty
absolute statements and what,

112
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,420
what else can the UFC and I do,
um,

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,790
when these experts are putting
those absolutes out there
and I get the people go,

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,100
oh, could you actually do,
you got to understand folks,

115
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:03,290
this would be career suicide.
This is, this is the,

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,600
this is cutting edge science we're
talking about there's too many people that

117
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,690
would have a vested interest
in calling bullshit. It's,

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,390
it's not something they don't fuck
around when it comes to these things that

119
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,000
people that are at the,
the front of the line,

120
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:21,490
when it comes to catching people on
these things and the science that they're

121
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:25,600
important, they're, they're, they're,
they're involved with. It's, this is not,

122
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,950
you get, you can't like gas on
the outside with no education.

123
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,450
It's just not wise.

124
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,530
And this is what I keep seeing over
and over again is people that have some

125
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:39,060
knowledge, a little bit
of knowledge, and they're,

126
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:44,050
they're pretending that they're,
they have a phd in this shit go.

127
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:47,080
I mean, for those that want
to do more detective work,

128
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,140
go read Mclaren's written
decision on John's July,

129
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,180
2018 July,
2018 tests.

130
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Go read the rich Hank off study on the
DHC empty and the metabolites and go read

131
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:05,050
the recent clomiphene, um, study where
it shows is chlorinated substance.

132
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:09,070
It's pulsing, it goes away,
comes back higher than before.
It goes away, comes back,

133
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:13,330
lower, goes away, comes back
higher. Crazy stuff. Okay. Um,

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,080
we're good.
