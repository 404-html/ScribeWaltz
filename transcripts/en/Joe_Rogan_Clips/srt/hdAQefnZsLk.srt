1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,100
Uh, we didn't hit innovation in other
careers. Worries. No. No. Here's one. Oh,

2
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:09,240
we never even gotten the cars flying
cars. Why? They'll never be foreign cars.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,120
Yeah, man, man, I started
with this please. Okay.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,530
Since we're two hours and 40 minutes
in, does that allowed? Oh my gosh. Yeah,

5
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:20,610
we're flying. People don't have
full three hours to do they, oh,

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:25,350
we did it all the time. Really?
Yeah. Oh, are you sure? 100% yeah.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,090
This is not you. Sure. Yeah.
Average podcasts right now.
Like average. Really? Yeah.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,050
I'm honored to bleach your average,
the ones we've done.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,530
We've all been like close to three
hours. Okay, here you go. Here you go.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,610
Is that a ding? I don't dare. I was
rude. Okay, so let me, I flipped it.

11
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,440
I turned that goddamn switch on.
Okay,

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,390
so let's go back to flying cars.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,290
Let's go back to why anyone would want
a flying car in the first place because

14
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,250
they're an asshole. Okay, go here. It
is stuck in traffic. So here at Edison,

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,180
everybody just watch, let's say
there's only one road. Okay. Okay.

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,450
There was the width of your car and
you're driving on this road and the cars

17
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:11,181
behind you the fastest you could go on
that road is the speed of the slowest car

18
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:16,020
on the road. Right? Makes Sense.
Yes. This is travel in one dimension.

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,150
That sucks. What you really want
is travel in two dimensions,

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,060
so you take the road and widen it.
Let's make two lanes,

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,420
two lanes in one direction.
We can have two of the other way as well.

22
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,750
This doesn't matter.
Here you have two lights,

23
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:37,751
so now I can go around
you your slow ass car.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,850
Okay,
but and that's fine.

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,390
This was a great improvement
on one dimensional travel.

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,450
Now it's two dimensions.
Okay.

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,930
I can shift left or right as well as
move forward or backwards to move and the

28
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:00,930
more lanes you have, the more
two dimensional that is. Okay.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,410
The four oh five here in Los Angeles.
What does it six lanes each.

30
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,900
It's 12 fricking lanes.
Okay.

31
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,770
You are fully exploiting the
two dimensionality of travel,

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,940
but you still have so many
cars that you say to yourself,

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,310
I want to bypass this traffic.

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,860
If you went from one dimension
to two dimensions, bypassing
is just another lane,

35
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,050
but now all 12 lanes are plugged and you
want to bypass it. So you're thinking,

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,360
I need to travel in another dimension.

37
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,430
I want to travel in the third dimension.
If I do that,

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,730
I can bypass all these cars.
I want a flying car. Yeah.

39
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,660
Okay. Well the point is we
already have flying cars.

40
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,610
They called helicopters. Well, the
helicopters originally invented for that.

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,500
They called helicopters.
They're noisy.

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,730
They have to create a downward thrust
of air equal to its own weight.

43
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,620
If you're going to have a
flying car, that's what it's
going to have to do. Right?

44
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,650
They're noisy.
They're,

45
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,060
they completely disrupt the
terrain wherever they fly.

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,620
So the issue is not that
you want a flying car,

47
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,270
you want to travel in that third
dimension. Mm. We already do that.

48
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,500
How do we do that? The call
tunnels, they called bridges.

49
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,110
When you have a huge intersection,
you don't move people through one another.

50
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,200
You build the,
you build one road over the other,

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,210
you build one road under the other.
You are exploiting three dimensions.

52
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,630
So that traffic can go in perpendicular
directions simultaneously.

53
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,000
That's what the flying
cars would have given you.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,960
But we do that at intersections because
it would be impossible to move 12 lanes

55
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:00,840
of traffic through an intersection
that crossed another freeway.

56
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,370
New York City has done this.
We do this.

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,080
The New York, you're in the streets,
there's too many cars you can't move.

58
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,460
Let's move in the third dimension.
Let's build a subway.

59
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,060
This sounds like a guy who's
trying to sell me something,

60
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,530
telling you better than a flying car.
I'll just like listen man,

61
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,890
that flying cars bullshit. You
could buy a flying car. The new,

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,890
I want you to appreciate moving in.

63
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:34,891
The third dimension to New
York City subway system
moves a billion people a year

64
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,990
and they all go in the third dimension
beneath the ground through tunnels,

65
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,960
tunnels that are layered on
top of one another. Well,

66
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:45,790
the New York City subway
system is amazing.

67
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,450
How doubt about you couldn't move
that many people. It's great,

68
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,610
but it's not as good as a flying car.
It's not as cool as a flying car,

69
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,500
but it's as effective as a flying car.
The flying car,

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,390
personal flying car has to have to get
in line, he'd have to get on the subway.

71
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,240
You don't have to have a token and
you'd have to go through the turnstile.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,201
You have to deal with.

73
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:09,900
Some guy was rubbing his body up
against yours flying cars. So Shit,

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,960
you just fly around.
I'm just saying it's like a boat tunnels.

75
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,570
But for the air and
bridges or flying cars,

76
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,050
the beautiful thing about a boat is
you just go wherever you want to go.

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,290
Now here's the thing,
it's kind of,

78
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,130
you don't have to call air
traffic control turning left.

79
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,510
I would take it to another dimension.

80
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,780
Not someone will have to know where the
hell you're flying cars going just the

81
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:31,150
same way.
Traffic rules then matter in the street.

82
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,550
You know it is with boats and you don't,
what happens if a car fails?

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,340
False. It's just on the, on the
ground. It just stops. Right?

84
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,580
Flying car fails. You're
dead. Right. Okay. So, uh,

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,810
I want to add another dimension to this
conversation. Oh, he redlined mosquitoes.

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,410
Tunnels. Okay. Ready? Exactly. Exactly.
So Watch, here's a desk in front of me.

87
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,660
Okay. I, it's a physical desk and I
have a lot of sheets of paper and I,

88
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,140
and so I lay them side by side. I tile
the desk with all my sheets of paper.

89
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,000
Then there's no desk surface left.
I ran out of two dimensional space.

90
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,970
If I want to store more pages on my desk,
what do I do?

91
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,130
I get one of those organizers.
I've just introduced a third dimension.

92
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:25,090
So now I could have pages in another
dimension sitting above the page that was

93
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:30,950
previously occupying another place
that I couldn't have put another sheet.

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,310
That's three dimensions. Yes. Okay.

95
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,920
If we were two dimensional people,

96
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,330
we would wonder what happened to that
sheet of paper cause we have no access to

97
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:45,830
that third dimension. You would, it would
just left our universe at this point.

98
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:48,800
I'd be trying to back out of the
showroom and I'd say thank you,

99
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,830
but I'm going to go to the
flying car place. So now watch.

100
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,570
But look at how much you've increased
your storage by introducing another

101
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:00,920
dimension.
Now imagine a fourth spacial dimension.

102
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,290
We don't have access to that,

103
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,270
but we're now filling all three dimensions
and afforded mentioned creature will

104
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,670
say,
well just put it up in this direction.

105
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,860
What would be the fourth
dimension in that regard?

106
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,920
You can't imagine it because our brain
evolved in three dimensions. We haven't,

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,520
we can describe it mathematically.
Maybe a hole in Pasadena. Racism.

108
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,170
So our storage needs would
be con you can open a door,

109
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,790
put it through this portal to the fourth
dimension and closed the door and look

110
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:39,230
on the other side of the door
and nothing would be there. Yeah,

111
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,720
just the way on the surface of the desk.

112
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,820
If you live in the surface and
that's someone opens a door,

113
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:46,130
they put the paper through the door,
close the door,

114
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:49,010
and you look around and you say,
where did it go? I have no idea.

115
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,920
Cause you can't even see. You can't
even imagine that third dimension.

116
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,440
We cannot imagine a fourth dimension.

117
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,700
But if the world one day gets so crowded
that even three dimensional space has

118
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:05,690
traffic, access to a fourth
dimension would greatly help that.

119
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,450
That's all I'm saying.
Yeah. Good luck with that.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,470
Getting people to step through ice tea.
What is this Jamie?

121
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,020
Some flying thing that just came out last.
Oh, look at this thing. Wait, that's CG.

122
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,790
That part seems CGI, but it's actually
flying over grass that's moving it.

123
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,880
Look at this thing. What is it? Solar
powered? I don't know. The trailer,

124
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:31,130
like showing it, describing it makes it
have sound. Does it make sound? What?

125
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:34,230
It looks like? It looks like
a human sized. A drone. Yes.

126
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,320
That's exactly what it looks like.
Okay. What about something like this?

127
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,980
What about something like this
with really powerful magnets?

128
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,140
All side of the outer edge.

129
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:47,120
So it repels against other drones
to want a maglev flying cars.

130
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:50,520
So if you get so close. Oh, I see.

131
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:53,430
It'd be like forcefield Laminar
each other. Oh, so it'd be like,

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,650
it'd be like a bumper cars. Yes, but
with, with cushions? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,000
Some sort of electromagnetic
force field that you know,

134
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,110
everyone agrees that you don't have
ones that are attracted to each other,

135
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,620
but are opposed,
by the way,

136
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:11,790
see how big that human north
human sized drones drone is.

137
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,760
Have you ever heard how loud a
drone? It fucking loud. You can't,

138
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:17,640
you can't even have a conversation. Yeah,
I've got an asshole in my neighborhood.

139
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,890
Flies on around you. That's
what shotguns are for. Yeah.

140
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,950
I wish I had never fired a gun in my
life for the first time I ever used one.

141
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,030
It's to shoot the drone that's going
to be looking through my window at my

142
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,670
apartment. Oh yeah. This is
fucking asshole in my neighborhood.

143
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,510
He flies all over people's
yards and I can't uncork.

144
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,350
They already think I'm crazy. No Way. I,

145
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,430
and if I shoot it with a bow and Arrow,
I'm not sure I'll hit it. By the way,

146
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:45,090
did that video have a sound accompanying
with it has some, some a little bit.

147
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,920
There's music and some
description of it was music,

148
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,210
but it's not the actual sound of those
propellers they have on their webpage

149
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,740
here that it's quieter than
a car on a freeway. What?

150
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,920
It's quite an electric
car nor at 150 feet away.

151
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,690
Measured at 150 feet. That's incredible.
Oh cause it's about the same as,

152
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,480
as as a car. Well, it says
motorcycles don't count.

153
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,920
So they're counting that as an electric
car though. Oh, they are? Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:12,660
Gasoline cars. But cars today
are not in top. Wait, wait,

155
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,860
just to be energy consumption.

156
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,080
I don't know if they're using
the same icon to represent. See,

157
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,120
they're using the same show.
It's an electric electric car.

158
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,910
So it's the sound of an electric car.
No, no. There's no engine. But no,

159
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,100
don't get deceived there because
that's energy consumption.

160
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,890
The energy consumption uses the
same icon for electric cars.

161
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,880
It does for gasoline car and
then down. No. See it says noise.

162
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,820
It shows highway, just car. It doesn't
tell you which of those DBA. Right?

163
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,371
There's no way.

164
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:40,371
76 DBA says sound because electric
cars far quieter than a regular car.

165
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,710
You, all you hear is the
drone of the tire. So,

166
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,540
but what happens is above a certain speed,
the,

167
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,770
the aerodynamic noise is greater than the,

168
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,710
so it'll landing airplanes. Here's,
here's what you do. You live in la,

169
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,540
go to the in and out near lax,
which is right near a landing strip.

170
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,980
Okay. Yeah. And listen to the
sound of the planes as they come,

171
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,260
as they come in for a landing. Most
of that sound is air foil, noise,

172
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,640
not engine noise. Uh, yeah.

173
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,970
Which is why you can pretty much
still maintain a conversation.

174
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,930
You're old enough.

175
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,400
We remember a plane would fly overhead
in a city and you'd have to halt your

176
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,400
conversation until it
finished. Why? What happened?

177
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,700
Engine's got quieter and quieter,

178
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,470
which enabled people to build real estate
closer and closer to airports and not

179
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,860
have not have a sound problem. It's poor.
Fuck. But it didn't happen overnight.

180
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,480
It was slow and steady. No kidding.
Yeah. I never, I forgot her foil noise.

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,970
I forgot that you had to stop
talking when I remember it. In fact,

182
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,300
Shea Stadium in New York City
near near Laguardia Airport,

183
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,310
the announcers had to stop. Anytime
I plane flew overhead, they couldn't,

184
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,810
couldn't announce the game.
That's crazy.

185
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,400
And when the mets won
the world series in 1969,

186
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,520
mayor Lindsay redirected the airport
traffic to not fly over the world series

187
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:04,450
games. Wow. I thought that was a bad
ass move of him. Of his mayor, Lindsay.

188
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,500
1960. Yeah. I completely forgot
how loud planes you do submit.

189
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,030
Correct. And now they're, now
they're, it's a sound that's in the,

190
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,480
in the noise of the street.
You don't even stop and notice it.

191
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,450
You didn't even pay attention. All
you barely hear, you barely hear it.

192
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,870
And so next time you're at a
runway and when it's landing,

193
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,700
it's much noisier taking off cause
it's got a gain altitude. Right?

194
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,020
But coming down, it's, most
of that sound is glider noise.

195
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,830
And evidence of this is, uh, is uh,

196
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,270
the noise of air going over the air
foil of the, the fuselage. If you do,

197
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,020
you know, the moment they
deploy the, the landing gear,

198
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,860
next time you're in an airplane,
when they say we are clear for landing,

199
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,310
just listen,
listen to the ambient sound of the plane.

200
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,540
Then listen to the sound.
After they deploy their landing,

201
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,220
it's for three times as loud.

202
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,430
It ramps up hard part because of the
sound of the air going around something

203
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:02,860
that's not aerodynamic. Uh,
the fricking wheels. Oh yes.

204
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,660
Yeah, yeah. I just never,
for whatever reason,

205
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,610
I never remembered that airplanes used
to be louder. I think about all the time.

206
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,470
So why can't I have a flying
car? It's still, you want
the drone flying car? Yeah.

207
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,060
Yeah. So you need, if
you wouldn't want it,

208
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,090
that would look ugly if two of
those collide and in the sky.

209
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,210
But what about my magnet theory?
But now,

210
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,260
now it's got to have more power to
lift the way to the magnet solar pro.

211
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,520
Plus he gets some testosterone infuse
guy who doesn't want to let you ahead of

212
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,810
them to bump. You break the propeller
and then you both fall out of the sky.

213
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:45,550
Sky Rage, sky rage. Ah, it's a
lot of Dirage. We know it'll do,

214
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:49,450
it'll call the herd of testosterone
driven men. Okay. But what if they do it,

215
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:53,230
but the only way they work is through
like the same sort of Tesla system that

216
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,930
allows them to have,
you know what cars,

217
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,850
I don't know if you have automated cars,
you don't need flying cars. Yeah you do.

218
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,450
Because first it'll be too many of them.
There'll be fewer cars on the road, but

219
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,070
okay.

220
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,820
How do you figure that? Oh my gosh.
Automated cars. Any fewer cars?

221
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,840
Yes. How so? How so? How so? Because,

222
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,610
because what your second
greatest asset your car,

223
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,090
most people second greatest asset
spends 90% of his time doing nothing.

224
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,220
You drive to work in his parked you
come home and it's parked right.

225
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,780
90% of his time doing nothing. Okay.
I come to work 10 minutes after you,

226
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,260
I half hour after you and hour
after you I'm using your car.

227
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,980
You ain't using my car. I'm telling
you right now. You're not using my car.

228
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,070
No one's using it anyways cause I forgot.
This is la.

229
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:47,190
Did you go to New York habit for people
steal your car is a utility rather than

230
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:51,730
uh, uh, something to try to get chicks
with on the street corner. Oh stop.

231
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,040
He will try to get chicks in New York too.
Don't put the cars.

232
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,640
There's a lot of people that do. Nobody
has cars. But if you do, you're a baller.

233
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,660
You got one of them spots.
It cost you 1000 bucks a month baby.

234
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,640
I've seen some fancy cars and I've been
in New York, so there's some fancy guns,

235
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,210
but that's not, it's not it.
It's not 100% it's not 100% yeah,

236
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,500
but that's just that one stupid spot
where everybody could still own the car,

237
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,870
but you'll be delegate relegated to a
lane where you won't be able to drive as

238
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,300
fast as the automated car.

239
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,090
Consider that if you were in a self
driving car and it wants to change lanes,

240
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,750
it communicates that to other self driving
cars near it and they've self driving

241
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,180
cars tell you to fuck off because
you have the program. But like that,

242
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,620
I have a rude assumption that Joe Rogan
upload some rude Russian Bot called.

243
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,810
It's not letting anybody in
the Joe Rogan upload that.

244
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:44,780
I feel like it wouldn't change anything
if there's automated cars in Los Angeles.

245
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:48,020
I really do. I don't think, I don't
think there'd be any less traffic.

246
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,810
I just think you're going to make a lane
that'll take automated cars and it will

247
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:55,811
go 120 miles an hour and watching
everybody with their wasted horsepower in

248
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,530
their, in their, in their can
trapped, stuck in traffic.
