1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,320
Be like American idol auditions. I
would be crazy than that. It'd be that.

2
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:07,650
Have you seen that? A Guatemalan
volcano eruption? Have you seen that?

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,540
Where people are running from the smog?
It's fucking crazy girls.

4
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:17,541
Guys like that much pussy coming
down the mountain headed towards you.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,420
It's, it's that Guatemala
eruption is fucking scary man.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,860
There's nothing like that in, in comedy
other than Chris Delea. Yeah, he's close.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,370
He's close.
But even looking at us Guatemala,

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,790
most violent eruption in more than a
hundred years, 25 people already dead.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,350
And just, I think it just happened
yesterday. It's fucking crazy, man.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,520
Dozens of people have died after erupted.
Yeah. Sunday is getting back at us, dude.

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:46,290
That's too right. Hawaii and this one,
I mean we gotta be real fucking careful.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,450
Surprise. New Zealand hasn't
had a couple of options.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,680
Did they have like a live volcano in New
Zealand? I just know that. I think I,

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,780
can you double check fact check this,

15
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,880
but I think New Zealand has the
most volcanoes in the world. What?

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,130
I was just the air those tours
and they're like, you know,

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,280
what'd you do over there? Well,
I want you to cook islands. Ooh,

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,250
Captain Cook Islands and the
Cook Islands pirates showed up.

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,940
Beautiful vacation and
there's no Americans,

20
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,710
which is what I love you and I can't get,

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,850
I can't stand going someplace
and it's just all American.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,540
Like I don't go to answer Nada, you
know, go to Venice beach. You know, I,

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,290
I don't want to be around
the same time Maui is. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't like going to,

24
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:30,270
while he's basically Beverly Hills,
Beverly hills gone fall.

25
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:34,950
Kaino map of New Zealand. Jesus
Christ. He's fucking fault.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,020
You know, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

27
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,810
15, 16, 17, 18 volcanoes
that right. You're like,

28
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:46,620
you can't lie on this show because this
guy's going to fact check you right away.

29
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,980
That is insane. But I'm telling you
right now, beautiful vacation. Oh, I bet.

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,390
I didn't like actually like do Zealand,
like I went to Oakland,

31
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,380
I thought I'm driving around downtown
La. Oh, like cs or something.

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,780
I didn't like to sit down, not a
city guy. I liked this kind of shit.

33
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:07,560
Like outdoors nature of beaches. Yeah.
Well, the nature of their stunning,

34
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,650
I want to look out my hotel window and
the sliding door and like there's sand

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,060
and then like the water's like
right there. Or mountains.
Yeah, he exact something.

36
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,190
Rain forest,
something,

37
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,670
something that's different from this
urban jungle that we live in all the time.
