1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,200
The Guy was trying to do that,

2
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:04,080
but with like some Winkeljohn
strategy coach these young,

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,560
he's only like 26 right?
He's going to be a prom dress.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,230
Super Crystal.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,400
I am interim belt stun,

6
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:18,060
Holby POC talking about Colby just had
to get a nose operation for sinuses,

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,780
but this the thing Colby goes and I
spoke to someone very close to Colby.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,170
Colby goes, dude, I'm down for the
fight. I just went five rounds.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,070
Willie's been out for how long? Give
me, I can do it in October, November.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,150
Just let me get ready.

11
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,580
I just said I'm going to have sinus
surgery is fair and they went, nope.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,490
Stripped me of the belt until you
want it until it's like, fuck yeah,

13
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:36,960
I'll take it.
See that.

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,990
That seems to be a problem for anybody
that's considering taking interim title

15
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,870
fight in the future.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,450
That's what Paul Ryan Ortega Ortega
saw that and he was like, listen,

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,270
they're offering him before that when
his flight got canceled because Max

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,750
Holloway was running to
all those medical issues,

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,330
they offered him a fight
for the interim belt.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,400
And I think it was against Jeremy
Stevens is fighting this weekend.

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,210
They offered Frank Yeager, Andrew
Stevens, and so he, Frankie Edwin's crazy.

22
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:05,440
That doesn't even make any sense.
That's what Brian said. Yeah.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,380
And so then Jeremy and Jeremy
Stevens is fucking dangerous.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,380
He is sleeping dangerous for anybody.

25
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:17,100
He's doing such a good fighter for
antibody. He and he is guns blazing.

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,640
He's fighting all of this weekend.
So on. I know that's a great fight.

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,300
So at 55 right? All those 40 45
so they offered him all those,

28
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,910
those offered him or take up or take
a fight with Jeremy because Jeremy is

29
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:32,850
already cut and wait for this fight or
you know it training for this fight,

30
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:36,960
which is only a few weeks later. And
he says, well, it's an interim title.

31
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:40,050
It doesn't mean anything. I want the real
belt fighters. Don't take it serious.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,260
Well, here's why they shouldn't now.
Right. Well, this is the base example.

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,110
Like why would I fight for interim belt?
You just strip Kolbe.

34
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:49,380
Now this is us assuming that
we know the whole store. Right?

35
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,680
I don't know the whole story. I haven't
talked to Colby. I haven't talked to Dana,

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,710
but I don't,
I think the conversation,

37
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,690
I'm not a fan of the idea of an interim
title unless there's extenuating

38
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,910
circumstances.
Like someone's got a broken leg,

39
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,420
they have to be out for six months,
but it should be a year out a year.

40
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,820
You got to do something so you
wouldn't lose out a year. Correct.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,290
So that's why it made RDA. It made sense.
And also just to play, if I'm Dana,

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,250
hey Woodley,

43
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,470
we need you to fight and you want
the super fights turning down fights.

44
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,800
What can we do? Let's force the
Sand Creek. This interim belt,

45
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,710
he's been out a year, which I
like. I wasn't talking about that.

46
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,860
I was talking about sign
Ortega. Okay, Gotcha.

47
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,410
Let's talk about Brian or Tayga because
Max Holloway's defended fairly recently

48
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:31,290
and he was getting ready to fight Khabib.
It's not like he's been out of law.

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,790
They offered him that Khabib fight.

50
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,150
He tried to cut weight for it and he
might have fucked himself that way.

51
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,430
Is that what it was? Yeah,
it's entirely possible.

52
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:39,990
They're still trying to
figure out what happened.

53
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:43,770
Well one of the pieces of speculation
is that his body started shutting down

54
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,770
because he went through
a real bad cut for the,

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,550
when he was trying to make the cubby
fight at 55 on super short notes.

56
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:55,040
That's a hard thing for him to
make. 55 is a huge, huge one.

57
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,050
85 what? Yes dude. Max is a big fella.

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Bribe or Tayga is fucking huge to
it goes up to 85 I couldn't really,

59
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,310
I stood next to him. I was like,
how big are you in the is bigger,

60
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,250
Holly's bigger and so this is
the problem with these guys.

61
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,920
They need a lot of time to get
down to this weight. Right?

62
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,900
So how all the way trying to do that. This
is one, this is pure speculation, Holly,

63
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:19,300
we to do that is it was very hard for him.

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,510
His body broke down and then in
cutting weight for this fight,

65
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,220
once his body started the water load,

66
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,120
his body knew what was going on and
start shutting down. This is speculation,

67
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,530
pure Spec,
but here's my point.

68
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,890
You can't make me and let and let until
you know that he's going to be out for a

69
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:33,760
certain amount of time.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,680
It seems like an interim title belt is
almost disrespectful. Like he's, he's,

71
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:42,760
the champ makes zero sense. But I think
it was a corporate decision find out,

72
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,130
but I feel like it was a corporate
decision where they went, okay,

73
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,950
we have to fight. We need to fill
this gap. We have to fight. Well,

74
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,920
it has to buy somebody.
Of course we get,

75
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,800
you're talking about something different.
Yeah, but I'm saying, I'm saying they go,

76
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,400
they go, we want this gotta be a
ton of fight. How about use? Okay.

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,393
How about you have this,

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,690
how about you give you the Colby retains
his interim title because there's

79
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:05,320
extenuating circumstances with him
medically. He had to get nasal surgery.

80
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,440
He's out until November.
Colby gets the next shot.

81
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,140
Whoever the fuck wins his fight.
Colby fights neck straight. See,

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,390
but you haven't talked to her boy Dana.

83
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:18,010
Maybe he's saying that maybe
every same stripped UBB. Listen,

84
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,470
fuck your belt,
but you will get the next shot.

85
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,780
Everyone's just taking your
buy it hers and they did some,

86
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,580
well maybe it was Uzma Uzma and wants
to fight till next and he's like,

87
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,500
let's do this for the real
number one contender spot.

88
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,270
Cause Uzman is a guy who has quietly been
beating everybody they put in front of

89
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,460
yes.
His last one he has and I love him.

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,970
His last fight I wasn't the most exciting.
But if you go through,

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,290
you know who my has fought, you look at
the way Colby. Did he look prior to that?

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,620
You know, you Uzman would have the
worst argument but he has the eye.

93
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,870
The most potential
probably like he's a not,

94
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,500
no one wants to fuck off
for the Damien Maia fight.

95
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,580
I wouldn't agree with you because both
guys beat Damien might before that was

96
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:00,300
not good. I'm saying that their
decisions right. It's not like he was,

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,900
he wasn't telling people I meant the,
before the Damien Maia fight with Colby,

98
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,070
Colby didn't have a lot of big names
on his resume. He had one decision.

99
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,560
Damien Maia. So like, what do we got here?

100
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,860
I beat Damien Meyer as
well in his last fight.
