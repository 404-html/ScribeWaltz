1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,130
Have you ever, uh, have you
ever met Jamie Kilstein?

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,090
So Jamie and I have a checkered history.
I don't know if we,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,660
maybe you and I have spoken about
this. I've never met Jamie, but Jamie,

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:13,020
when Jamie was social justice
warrior number one, he went hard.

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,230
He went hard on me.
Yeah. Like he, he just,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,290
he just was dunking on me endlessly
in ways that were totally unfair.

7
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,780
I mean, he was just, you know, he was,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,140
he was working very hard
to become an enemy. And,

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,960
um, then he had his, his
epiphany, you know, the,

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,470
then the social justice mob came for
him over something with almost nothing

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,590
right over him trying to get laid.
I mean,

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,750
like they were saying he was a
creep or something like that.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,120
Just try hitting on girls. Yeah. I miss
the details there, but then he came then,

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,110
so then he's since sent me very,
um,

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,980
friendly and apologetic emails about
just, you know, I'm sorry what I did and,

16
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,340
and you know, he, he wants, he wants to do
a podcast. I haven't taken him up on it,

17
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:02,860
but, um, you know, that, that maybe
that could be an interesting comment.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,070
Sincerely apologetic. Yeah,
he's a good guy. I mean,

19
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:10,230
he and I had our own issue
at one point in time, um,

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,710
over a podcast that we
did versus, uh, it was,

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,630
you remember when the Daniel Tosh
rape controversy like, uh, do you,

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,200
do you remember this? I know who Tom, I
missed that joke. I should say rape joke.

23
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,010
Um, some woman in a crowd, he was,

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,570
he was on stage and he wasn't supposed
to be there. It was at the laugh factory.

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,590
And Dom Irrera put them on stage and, uh,
he goes, look, I don't have any material.

26
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:39,340
What do you guys want to talk about?
And uh, some guy yells out rape.

27
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,740
And uh, that's always helpful. And so he,
you know, it's like some drunk in a crowd.

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,840
He goes, Jesus Christ. And so
Daniel Tosh, his take on it. Okay.

29
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:53,770
What, what's funny about that?
Humiliation. Violence. You know, he's,

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,180
he's like berating this guy and trying
to do stand up while he's doing this.

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,160
And some woman yells out, actually there's
nothing funny about rape. And he goes,

32
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:07,300
wouldn't it be funny if someone who just
raped her and everybody starts laughing?

33
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:07,871
I do remember.

34
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:11,200
And so this woman wrote a giant blog
about it and she wanted him to apologize

35
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:16,200
about it and Jamie went after Daniel Tosh
as a con fellow gas as it felt comics

36
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,720
saying that it's, you know, like,
and I was like, well she's a heckler.

37
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:24,520
The woman heckled, like while he was
trying to do to stand up and he's like,

38
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't, I'm not going to support
rape culture. And he's like,

39
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,360
how the fuck is that rape culture?
Like he's,

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,130
he's clearly making a joke about
something she said that was very,

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
very patronizing.

42
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,570
Like obviously he doesn't think there's
something funny about rape. This is,

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,860
he's just trying to work
through this ad libs set.

44
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:45,340
Then he's doing with some guy who yelled
out something that this whole crowd has

45
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:49,180
to respond to. He can't just ignore
the fact that it happened and go,

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,020
how about firetrucks, folks? Why? They
always read, you know, he can't do that.

47
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,330
He's gotta,
he's gotta deal with what this guy said.

48
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:58,090
And so that's what he tosses out there.
And everybody laughed by the way,

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,860
but also isn't the part of his
persona persona just ability.

50
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:06,450
He takes it to the edge, right?
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, he's,
yeah, he's edgy comedian.

51
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:11,370
He's fine. And you know, and Jamie and
I had this little tit for tat about it,

52
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:14,790
but he,
he's very honest about his mistakes.

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,650
Like when you talked to him and he's,

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,160
he's got great insight because
he was that guy, you know,

55
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:23,760
he was that guy that was going back and
forth with people online all day and

56
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:26,700
checking his mentions like couldn't walk
down the street more than five steps

57
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:30,240
before he'd pull out his phone and check
has mentioned how people responding to

58
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,960
his latest Dunkin heart take
down or you know, it's just,

59
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,830
it's a toxic thing that people are
doing. It's this, this, you know,

60
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:42,240
looking for people that are, that are bad
and looking for things that are wrong,

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,090
looking for wrong speak.
It's very toxic.

62
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,710
It's toxic for the
people that are doing it.

63
00:03:46,711 --> 00:03:49,140
It's toxic for the people that
are receiving it. It's just,

64
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,070
it's not a way that human beings would
ever communicate in one on one. I mean,

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,440
I tried to,

66
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,460
to communicate with people the same way
online as I would if they're right in

67
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:02,460
front of me. I don't always
succeed, but I try. That's my goal.

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,770
My goal is to try to talk to someone
as if they were right in front of me.

69
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,010
That's clearly not how everybody's
handling no. I think road rage as the,

70
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,180
as the best analysis of what's happening
on social media. Yeah. I've adopted that.

71
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,670
I've adopted that way of
looking at it too and,

72
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,710
but the only difference is it road rage.
You know,

73
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:20,730
there's like a physiological reason
for road rage because you're, you're,

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,630
you're in a dangerous situation
that you're subliminally
taking stock going fast.

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,350
You're going to have a metal machine with
a bunch of assholes that are probably

76
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,710
looking at their phone and everybody's
going fast and you could die at any

77
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:32,730
moment if someone goes wrong.

78
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,510
If you're on a highway like the four oh
five when you have five lanes going 70

79
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:41,280
miles an hour, it is a fucking miracle
that no one dies. And every day we do it.

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,270
Every day everything's fine. Yeah. Well,

81
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:49,090
so let's go back to this idea of what the,

82
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,220
the actual normative response would be
when somebody puts their foot in their

83
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:58,250
mouth or something from their past gets
disclosed. I mean, the, the, the, the,

84
00:04:58,251 --> 00:05:02,900
the stupid and indefensible thing
they did as a teenager, right? Yeah.

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,910
You know, and you know,
like this, you know,

86
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,630
you've got these guys who are now having
their careers destroyed for having

87
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,640
dressed up in black face or in a,
in a,

88
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,900
in a hood for Halloween or whatever
it was. I mean, I, you know, I think,

89
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,820
I think this, that one, um,
politician said he's not even in the,

90
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,421
in the photo,

91
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:26,210
but the photo was on his yearbook page
or like whatever you put on your yearbook

92
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:30,650
page in high school, right? Um,
you find out this thing that,

93
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:33,920
you know, adult is going to defend, right?

94
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,600
But what is the path back? What like
what, like what is the reboot that will,

95
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,860
that should be acceptable because
we don't even know. It seems,

96
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,970
we don't even know what

97
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,240
could conceivably work to
rehabilitate somebody career.

98
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,300
And yet on this other side,
we've got people who again,

99
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,960
are being let out of prison for murders.

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,140
Admit they committed,
right? Or rapes, they admit,

101
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,220
admit they committed and they're
rehabilitated. And we, and these are,

102
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,210
these are stories we're supposed
to feel good about, right?

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,670
So we have to figure out how to
square this, um, on the left.

104
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,200
And you know, I don't know. I mean, the,

105
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,310
the way I've been thinking about it
is that it has to be intelligible.

106
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:23,330
How you are different from the person
who committed that thing. Right? Right.

107
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,940
So like if you, if you did
something that was, let's say,

108
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:30,730
legit racist when you
were 20 and like mark,

109
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,070
Mark Wahlberg as an example of this
[inaudible] he was running around just

110
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,050
beating people senseless. Right.
And for avowed racist motives.

111
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,820
I believe when he was a teenager, he
would got lost his eye. Right? Yeah.

112
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:45,400
I mean it's less. Yeah. So,
but, and I think that was a,

113
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,940
I think I was a Vietnamese guy.
He attacked or uh, but, um,

114
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:54,530
he was just doing truly indefensible
things. Now I don't know what sort of,

115
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,510
you know, PR moment he has had since
or how he's apologized for it or,

116
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,390
but I mean, that was a, that was a
very different time. I think if it was,

117
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,880
if all of that stuff was
being discovered about him,

118
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:09,881
now there may be no way back
is with this day and age,

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,170
it could be reignited.
Right.

120
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:16,310
Like even though he's apologized for it
and even though that it's been addressed,

121
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,230
it absolutely get reignited.

122
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,980
Just me talking about it on your podcast
is fucking him over. Right. Good. Yeah.

123
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:26,750
I mean, and also people have to recognize
that there's some things you can't

124
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:31,751
retroactively instill today's ideas of
what constitutes racism on 1985 so if you

125
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:39,170
were in high school in 1985 and you
dressed up as Mr t, right? That you know,

126
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,900
I don't know if that was racist back then.
I never did it,

127
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,310
but I don't know if that's racist.

128
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,580
Like if you had a bunch of gold chains
and you made your hair black and are you

129
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,860
making you made your face black
and gave herself a Mohawk? He said,

130
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:52,310
I'm Mr t for Halloween and
the pictures emerged today.

131
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,440
What you did when you went door to door
when you were 15 or 12 or whatever,

132
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:00,140
you were knocking on people's doors
and everybody was laughing. Oh,

133
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:04,870
you're mister T. Nobody thought it
was racist, but today let's take that.

134
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,390
Let's take the hard case. Let's
say you were racist, right? I mean,

135
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:12,650
so like I had this Guy Christian Pitch
Julinia on my podcast once who's at x,

136
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:16,490
Neo Nazi, they just legit racist, right?
He's got all the tattoos to prove it.

137
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,180
And now their major problems with
Christian pitcher Laney as, as,

138
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:24,760
as I think you know, uh, that I
discovered after that podcast. But, um,

139
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,040
so this is not an endorsement of
him, sorry Christian. But the, the,

140
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,140
the, there is a path back. I mean, so
like he is celebrated on the left. Yeah.

141
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,930
He's a former Neo Nazi
and he's, you know, I, I,

142
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,100
I discovered him on Sarah
Silvermans show on wherever that is,

143
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:47,180
Hulu. Um, and, uh, you know,

144
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,740
he's a darling of the left,
right.

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,820
And Darlene of Msnbc for
this redemption story. So,

146
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,010
but what is the,
you take someone,

147
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,520
any of these politicians who have
something in their backstory that is ugly.

148
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,060
Uh,
my feeling is all there has to be,

149
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:11,061
is a transparent and intelligible account
of how you are now different of how

150
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:16,950
you can actually honestly look
back on this thing and say, yeah,

151
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,820
I am as embarrassed by that as you think
I should be. Right. That's not like,

152
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:25,260
that is nothing that, that does not
represent how I view the world at all now.

153
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,980
Uh,
but there's just,

154
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,340
there's a s the spirit of the
time on social media, again,

155
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:37,341
especially on the left and to our total
dysfunction politically is to never

156
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:43,560
accept any of that. I mean, there's,
there is no apology good enough. And,

157
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,310
um, or the, or there's, you know,

158
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,870
the most cynical possible interpretation
of your, uh, of your apology.

159
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,440
It's like you're just trying to, you're
the only reason why you're apologizing.

160
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,200
It's because you want to
save your job. Right. Um,

161
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,800
and that we have to figure out how to,
I mean, we just need some, you know,

162
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,330
recovery disk that we can reboot
from here because it's just not, uh,

163
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,940
it's, this is going someplace
terrible. And again,

164
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,780
to look at it through the Lens
narrowly politically of, uh, you know,

165
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,460
over the next two years, it's, it's to
the massive disadvantage of the left.

166
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,940
It certainly is,
but I don't see any way to fix that.

167
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,750
Like with the current climate and
this current attitude where people are

168
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:32,040
engaging in this recreational outrage,
it fits the climate. I don't mean,

169
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:35,700
I don't know what would have to happen
for people to come to some sort of a

170
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:39,240
realization. I mean, it would have to
happen to them like it did to James.

171
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,780
Like what happened with Jamie Kilstein
is it, they turned on him and he's like,

172
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:47,220
oh my God, this is awful. Like
I'm [inaudible] [inaudible].
And then he realized,

173
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,790
you know, I mean, I don't know what
other thing could happen. Well, I mean,

174
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,380
what weird, the game we're
playing is part of it. I mean,

175
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,080
you and I are in a position
to take risks that, you know,

176
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,660
even the people at the top of
journalism can't. I mean like, yeah,

177
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,860
like Megan Kelly says one
wrong thing and you know,

178
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:08,580
it doesn't matter that she's got a $20
million contract, she's just, she's fired.

179
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,100
Uh, and when you look at the thing that
she said, I mean, it was just a question.

180
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,821
Yeah. She, I mean,

181
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:19,640
she just didn't seem to understand how
charged the phrase black face was. Right.

182
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,800
She's just ignorant of that piece of
history or something. But like, you know,

183
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,900
so she just, she should, she
put her foot in her mouth.

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,700
She gave an apology that was just like,
you know, full blown hostage video.

185
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:33,360
Apologies. Just like, you know,
just like I am so fucking sorry.

186
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,171
You don't even know.
Like,

187
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,930
here take a sample of my blood
and you'll just see my test,

188
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:40,440
my cortisol and not good enough,
not good enough.

189
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,850
And they let her say the apology
till he is even more crazy.

190
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,890
They let her come back, say the apology
and then go good. Thanks for doing that.

191
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,390
Yeah. So, but so she,

192
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,140
no one's job in that space is secure
enough where they can take real risks,

193
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,810
but you know, you and I, you know,

194
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:02,410
you and I could do an interview
with Louis C K right? Like,

195
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,870
and just process his,

196
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:09,340
coming back into standups and do it
in a way where people didn't like it.

197
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,340
You just say, okay, fuck off. Right.
This is the conversation we had.

198
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:16,810
And I think modeling that more
and more. I mean, I think,

199
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,590
I think we have to take those risks and
people like us have to take those risks

200
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,190
and hope to break the spell by
having those conversations in public.
