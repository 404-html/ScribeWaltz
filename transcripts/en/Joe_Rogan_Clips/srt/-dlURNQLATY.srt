1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,430
And he had a lot of groupies
and he took and you know he,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,850
he forgot they were filming was Mike and
he had a lot of group laid the law down.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,820
Jump on him. That's
hilarious. I need to see that.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,680
I was telling you about uh,

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,820
American made the movie with Tom Cruise
and other bad ass Tom cruise movie.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,210
Oh yeah, we see he's on the airplanes.
You was just jumping around. Yeah, do it.

7
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,030
It's good. It's really good.
It's a good movie. They look,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,600
I know a lot of the Barry seal
story and they covered a lot of,

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,000
you can only cover so much of it and
a 90 minute movie. But yeah, look,

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,190
I mean they did not pull any punches.

11
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,910
They made look like Bill Clinton got 'em
off. Bill Clinton called the prosecutor.

12
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:43,760
They caught him with millions of dollars
of and cocaine and money phone call.

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,850
Nope. Nope. They have her on the phone
with Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton, who like,

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,270
he's telling her I'm going to walk.
Whether or not he said that,

15
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:54,960
I don't know cause he's dead. No one
knows. Right. And he's telling her it was,

16
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,460
trust me,
I'm going to walk right out of here.

17
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,560
And they're all laughing and she's like,
you're not going to walk anyway.

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,100
And they're like, Mrs Prosecutor,
Bill Clinton's on the phone,

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,750
and it's governor Clinton. Yes. Yeah.
And you see your group, you see,

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,620
just get pissed off.
The next thing you know,

21
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,390
they're unconfident and he's leaving.

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,790
So they would let you know
that Bill Clinton, if they,

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,910
if the only way you could put that in the
movie is there has to be truth, right?

24
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,130
Some truth to him,
they're like,

25
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:23,850
there's gotta be some sort of a documented
record of him making that call. Right.

26
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,850
He made that call. He had to have made
that call. You couldn't defamation,

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,650
of course, Clinton.
And he is the governor.

28
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:35,460
So there's probably a record
of him saying, let that guy go.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,170
And so the reason they think
is because in the film,

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,440
this is what they're saying is that he
was tied in with the CIA and somehow or

31
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:47,550
another through the CIA using him for
reconnaissance photos and stuff like that.

32
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:50,490
And the eventually got hooked up. These
drug dealers and started selling drugs.

33
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:54,360
The CIA was in on it and
they were allowing him to do
it and he was getting them

34
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,740
photographs and Intel from all
these different drug places.

35
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:02,160
And in return they were letting him do
whatever he did and taking a piece of it

36
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,460
problems, which you mentioned
Mena Arkansas. Yeah, yeah.
They mentioned all the,

37
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:05,761
all the,

38
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:08,880
I mean that's where Bill Clinton was
the governor of the only found out about

39
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:11,730
all this stuff because two kids
were killed. They were murdered.

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,560
And they told the parents that the kids
had gotten high and fell asleep on the

41
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,490
train tracks.

42
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,210
But the parents did an independent
autopsy and found stab wounds in the kits.

43
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,060
So like, oh Jesus, what
the fuck happened here?

44
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:29,040
And then slowly but surely the whole thing
unravels. They witnessed a drug drop.

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,490
Yeah. And uh, well they
couldn't have any witnesses.

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,570
They made mean like it
was lit case he killed,

47
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:40,650
go to youtube and just punch
in a CIA, Mena, Arkansas,

48
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:44,550
cocaine blow. And you get the
host. It's a sear. It's like,

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,360
it could be at two kids. We
don't know. We don't know.

50
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,640
Somebody who was in our assume the CIS.

51
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:54,540
The kids must have seen the drugs be
dropped and whoever was selling the drugs,

52
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,201
moving the drugs,

53
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,870
they just decided to kill these kids
cause they couldn't take a chance.

54
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,190
The kids keeping their mouth
shut so they killed them.

55
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,000
And apparently that was just
one thing though in the movie,

56
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,890
the way they haven't made up is like that.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,980
That was just one thing that's sort
of straw that broke the camel's back.

58
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:09,701
They don't even have that.

59
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,430
And I don't even remember if they
had that in the movie. The kids,

60
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,590
did they have that in the
movie? The murder? They didn't
have the murder, the kids.

61
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,710
No they didn't. But what they
did have is these people were,

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,690
I mean everybody was rich.

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,660
There were all coming in and
buying things and everyone's like,

64
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,210
where the fuck is all this
money coming from? Who is rich?

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,930
The people that we're working with,
Barry seal's like his brother in law,

66
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,020
like his wife's brother apparently.
I don't know if that was a real person,

67
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,920
but in the, in the movie, he's, he's
balling out of control and he's, uh,

68
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,550
he's got some fucking ridiculous souped
up car and he's got money coming out of

69
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:43,330
his pockets and he stuffed in his pocket
and he gets caught by a cop. You know,

70
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,280
and I don't know if that
happened in real life,

71
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,250
but in the movie they made it
seem like everybody was just,

72
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,770
there was so much money flowing around.
It didn't make any sense.

73
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,860
They were burying it in his
backyard. They, when they busted him,

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,460
it was like in the movie. Now again,
I don't know if this was real.
