1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,180
Are.

2
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
And I went to Greg's when the tap out
guys picked me up and he introduced me and

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,590
all that, right. But when
you're on the tap out,

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,670
show that a reality show that will
mask called Greg and gotten me.

5
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,660
That's how I got involved
with them, right? I cite

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,350
motherfuck us.
I left.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,540
Linda Garcia was fighting Roger Ward two
were my best friends, Raj would call it.

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:30,240
That was damn right.
Motherfucking Mexicans drawn down.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,670
I forgot about that fight. Who'd go to
fight pass, right? To bring that up.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,990
Um, are still wildest dude
other men. So do I, man.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,110
And so he calls me like, Cup, I
need you to come down for a week.

12
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,060
Come for one week.
Help me get ready for Roger.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,780
He took the fight on my three weeks notice
something outlandish just like me and

14
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,580
Leonard Do, right? So I go down
there, I literally never left.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,020
When I went down, first day I
walked into the Jacksons and Rashad,

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,480
Keith, St Pierre, Joe
Daddy's Stevenson, uh,

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,360
I mean the list goes on and on
and on. And I was like, wow,

18
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,950
this is what a real gym is like, this
is what, and they all accepted me.

19
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:13,530
It was like, I was like in the family,
right? I call, I owned a house in Denver.

20
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,470
I called my grandma. I said, I'm
never coming home. I'm staying here,

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,770
sell the house. Right. And
I literally never went home.

22
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:23,640
She would just slowly come down to visit
me and bring me truckloads of shit.

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,350
Right? Literally, I
lived in a closet, man.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,990
Fuck a third as big as this room. We
had a bunk bed, me and Leonard and a,

25
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,240
if one person who was standing up,
the other person had to be in the bed.

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,660
That's how small this room was. Wow.
And I lived there for two years above,

27
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:43,500
above Jackson's. And we train every day
with him. And like I said, I never left.

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,680
And uh, Greg asked me, he sat me
down after about, I don't know,

29
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:49,560
a couple of weeks of being there. He
said, man, I want you to be my 50 fiber.

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,510
And at that time he had a,

31
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,350
there's a list of 55 ers were nuts
that he had and I was like, wow,

32
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:59,940
fuck Greg Jackson,
who at the time was the man man,

33
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,930
right that the gym was
flicking a 90% winning great.

34
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,340
And he just, he's such a
knowledgeable, awesome dude man.

35
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:13,110
And to see where the gym was
to where the gym is now is,

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,750
it's like heartbreaking
to me to be honest. And I,

37
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,460
and you want to talk about loyalty,

38
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:20,190
which is the biggest thing
in this conversation that
we're having right now is

39
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,480
how they pick someone over me
through being loyal. I stuck by Greg.

40
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,800
Even when the gym started going down,
when Winkeljohn merged over,

41
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,270
all of the big pros left. It turned
into like a puppy mill. You know,

42
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,410
it wasn't for, for back when Greg
had it and it was its own school.

43
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,890
You couldn't turn up to a pro class. Like,
like some guy couldn't just come here,

44
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,520
knock on your door. Like you
said, you get Weirdos hero time.

45
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,980
Next thing you know he has shin pads
on the sparring. There's litter,

46
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,290
be at the new gym,
bumps come in off the street,

47
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,380
I swear to God and we'll fight these and
we'll come in and put stuff on a fight.

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,090
That's a true story.
You random bums off the street and uh,

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,710
that would never happen back in the
day. So Greg doesn't run it anymore? No,

50
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,661
he has.
He's like,

51
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:05,160
so out of the loop Winkeljohn runs
the entire thing and that's what,

52
00:03:05,161 --> 00:03:08,320
what is Greg doing? He kind of stepped
back for a couple of years, man,

53
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,850
like kinda started doing other things
and just kinda got burned out I guess,

54
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,210
which is why I created the BMF ranch.

55
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:19,480
I needed somewhere to go and something
to do. So I created my office,

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,170
which is winks argument with me right
now saying you built your own place,

57
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,610
you don't ever come
here, blah blah. I said,

58
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,450
why don't ever come here because you
get the people you let in here is

59
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,740
outlandish.
Like anybody,

60
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,360
you pay $150 you can get on the
[inaudible] and spar with Holly Holmes.

61
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,520
You know what I mean? That's,
that's what it's come to down there.

62
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,060
And back in the day it was like
private and just us and good pros.

63
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:43,300
Everyone there for the same mission,
trying to, trying to get better, you know?

64
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,800
But I've talked to some
other people that are,

65
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,200
I don't want to name sure they've
said that when they go down,

66
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:51,250
their new guys will come in and is
literally a fight is a fight. It's a,

67
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,570
there's no, there's no, there's
no a, B, c class anymore.

68
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:58,240
It's like literally these guys come in,
they want to make a name on it.

69
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:01,060
He was sometimes when you're
towards the end of a fight camp,

70
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,900
you don't need those new guy. You don't
need that crazy sparring. Right. You need,

71
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,410
you need the guys you trust and
not some random guy. I don't know.

72
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,910
So it's just, it's Asinine me, man.

73
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,730
What they turned that place into that.

74
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,740
That still happens in MMA because you're
never going to find that in boxing and

75
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:21,850
boxing. All sparring is
control, controlled, bringing
the sparring partners,

76
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,520
you know, who you're
working with. So I mean,

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,990
we talk loyalty again to me with Greg,

78
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:32,710
his name is on that building. It's
not. It's wink Jackson Week, right?

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,290
Jackson fucking wink your names first.

80
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:39,730
Even when it came time to
pick a decision and they said,

81
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:42,850
we want to go with Perry.
Why the fuck didn't you stand?

82
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,310
Because Greg still with
me. He's like, yeah,

83
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,890
I'll just come to the ranch and
we'll sort this out. And I'm like,

84
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,450
what the fuck are you talking about?

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,090
You tell me I can't come
into the Jackson wink gym,

86
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,880
but you're going to back door and come
to my fucking house and we're going to

87
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,640
train to fight me while
Perry's there at the gym.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,570
You see everything he does and then you're
gonna come and you're going to train

89
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,990
me. Not to mention you're holding
classes there and he's watching me.

90
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,580
You might not be training him to beat me,

91
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:10,240
but there's a lot of people there that
have trained me for fucking years.

92
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,240
So to me that was the point
I was saying like, man,

93
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,730
can we just not have them
there for this camp? I mean,

94
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,750
there's a lot of secrets that I, that
like inner secrets that I have, like Yo,

95
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm, I'm fucking scared to death to
fight. Like that's that the say he can,

96
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,640
they can tell him like, or they tell them,
you know, go get cowboy mad, you know,

97
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,370
that's, he doesn't fight well when he's
pissed off. So fucking pissed him off,

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,360
poke out and poke the bear, piss him off,
get him out of his element and give him,

99
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,910
you know, the shit like this. Right.
So, and there's a lot of other things,

100
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:41,620
small dumb things that I do and tendencies
they've seen over over the year or 10.

101
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:46,120
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um, to me
that's, it's very intimate.

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,740
The relationship between a coach and
a fighter is, is very, very intense.

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,340
So for someone to violate that
in that way, and you know,

104
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,440
I don't think there's anything wrong
with guys from a camp deciding to fight

105
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,180
each other and you've
got to work that out.

106
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:03,330
But for them to tell you that you can
[inaudible] I agree with you, right.

107
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,850
Figure it out. Right. Cause you go that
way. I W right. These are your times,

108
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:12,470
your hours back to each other,
right. Friends. But finding partners,

109
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,110
guy who just came in, like I said, I got
nothing against Perry. He's looking for,

110
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,100
he wants a home. Right? He's looking,
he felt like Jackson does. He's great.

111
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,700
I like that guy a lot. Stuff
that's not him. I mean, what
is he going to do? Right.

112
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,590
And, and I just said, hey, frank was
going to go and train with him wherever

113
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,470
I heard stories. He was looking
to go to Vegas anyways. I don't,

114
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,310
I don't have any idea, man. I
was just, I was just like, man,

115
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,700
can we just not do it for this fight? And
then Winkeljohn caught me on the phone.

116
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,880
Didn't you have the fucking balls or the
backbone to say it to my fucking face?

117
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,430
And I was right there with them. Call
them on the phone. Like, Oh, uh, yeah,

118
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,270
we're actually going to go with Perry.
You know,

119
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,210
he pays money and said again, it
comes back to the money. I'm like,

120
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,840
so Perry pays him a percentage and
you don't. I can see, hey Greg,

121
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,070
for my entire career I've ever been there
because I don't like Winkeljohn style

122
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,480
and I'm like his way.
He holds meds.

123
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,970
I don't like the way he trains
people different about what he does.

124
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,230
It's the same thing for rep, for you. For
me, for John Sam, they're all the exalted.

125
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:15,020
It's the cookie cutter. Everything's got
to the same and it never changes. It's,

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,430
I don't understand how you could be a
coach of the one of the greatest at one

127
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:23,330
time, the greatest Jim's on the planet,
you know, and then don't ever evolve.

128
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:27,620
Don't ever change and don't
run class. And it, to me, it's,

129
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,980
he just drove that place
into the ground, man. Turn,

130
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,530
literally turned it into a puppy mill.
It's only about making money.

131
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,330
And for you guys all,
I'm talking about a pug mill.

132
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,140
When someone has a dog and
they just fucking breed it
and sell puppies and breed

133
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,640
it and sell the puppies.
That's, that's what's happening.

134
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,660
That's the infrastructure of this gym.
Now let's talk about training there.

135
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:49,010
Let's talk about coaching,
right? Greg's supposed to be
the, the, the general, right.

136
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm just a soldier. How come I have
to be now a general ANA soldiers?

137
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,480
That's the me. That's just fucking
up in my, in my career. I can't,

138
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,450
I need somebody to tell me what to do.
Tell me what not to do.

139
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,250
And I had to start my own school at
the ranch, bringing my own coaches.

140
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:07,610
But then now I'm making all of the
executive decisions when we're training,

141
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:12,080
what we're trained in, what we're doing.
And I'm not, I'm no longer just a soldier.

142
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm having to fucking run
this whole thing. Um, that's
not mountain for fighters.

143
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,260
So problem for me too. I like, I liked it.

144
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,980
I'm a fucking super alpha male and I like
to communicate with my coaches and get

145
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:24,680
everything done in the guys that have a
fucking standing by me and I love him to

146
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:28,400
death, but I need someone to be like,
you know what? You crazy fucking bastard.

147
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,940
You go into hard, we're going to do
hyper office taper off as pumped. Right?

148
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,810
Or let's pick it up. Right? The,

149
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,550
the fucking fun fuck off part of your
life is taking over into your training.

150
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,370
Can we step it up a little bit?
Right. I need that. I need,

151
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:42,350
I need fucking direction.
I need today we're working on this,

152
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:44,590
not just me going in.
There's then ah,

153
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,260
let's fucking wrestling
today. Right? So, um,

154
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:55,170
you know what to do, but it's also nice
for someone else who knows what to do,

155
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:58,390
who's completely objective is standing
on the outside because there's bits,

156
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,030
I'm in this so long,
there's like,

157
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:05,010
I could literally Joe never spar from
now til the Perry fight and probably not

158
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,460
even do one Jiu Jitsu role and I would
be okay to fight like mentally. Right.

159
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,890
But that's probably not a very smart idea,
right?

160
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:15,810
Like it's not you at your
optimum. Exactly. Um,

161
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,650
so it's just, it's fucking Asinine
to me and the coaches down there.

162
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:23,010
So not only can somebody just ring
the doorbell and show up and train,

163
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,670
pay the money. You can pay the $25 a drop
in, or you pay the hundred 59 a month,

164
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,590
come to any class you want. But if you're
a coach, you can just coach the class.

165
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,990
It's that. It's that ass. And I do,

166
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,950
I see a new striking coach
or new wrestling coach or
new Jujitsu guy in there

167
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,070
twice a week probably,
and they're coaching the class.

168
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,370
Our rest main wrestling
coach of Jackson wink,

169
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:49,371
the greatest school in the fucking
world is a reception to a chiropractic

170
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:53,460
upstairs.
He's great as credentials.

171
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,860
Whereas he was a junior
assistant coach at a call.

172
00:09:56,861 --> 00:10:00,510
It don't know the college name, who
got fired for selling the kid steroids.

173
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,890
That's our wrestling coach.

174
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,980
I had one of the greatest schools in
the world is a good coach and it was

175
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,840
terrible. He's fucking
God awful, terrible.

176
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,720
He watches videos on Youtube and tries
to teach people things that don't even

177
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:12,870
fucking work.
It's Asinine,

178
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,410
which is another who I had to hire my
own coach and bring them in. You know,

179
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:20,880
it's like, it's like, Whoa, wait,
what? And now they don't even drill.

180
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,550
They just go live and they want to
know why people get hurt every day.

181
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:26,310
It's like you can't just go in and
say, okay, and we're wrestling go.

182
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,750
So do you think that people just get burnt
out on doing things the right way and

183
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,430
they just, they just figure, look,

184
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,250
I'm just going to do this the way that
makes the most money? Well, I think,

185
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,630
man, I wish I had, I
had the answer for that.

186
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,020
I do because I'm not in that position to,
I'm not running a gym and that's,

187
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:44,400
I've never done that because I don't want,

188
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:47,130
to me showing up to class every
single day would wear me the fuck out.

189
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,760
Where's everybody?
It's got to.

190
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,860
But you should have an infrastructure
set in place that takes, especially if

191
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,700
you're the greatest at one
time, right? If you're winning,

192
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:01,080
percentages are in the eighties and
nineties and now they're in the 20s like I

193
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,720
don't, I have no clue what our, what
our rating record if the gym is,

194
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:06,660
but it's nothing like it used to be.
Right.

195
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,090
And it's fucking,

196
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,920
it's Asinine to me the way you were
doing as it, you have the BMF ranch,

197
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:15,030
right to everything set up.

198
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,970
You bring in all your sparring partners
and you would be doing all your training

199
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,400
out there. And how would Greg
interact? He would, he would, he,

200
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,830
we do their show up down at
Jackson's and spar cause they sell,

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,330
they're still bodies down there.
Right.

202
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:25,770
There's still guys would
show up down as the bar.

203
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,570
We'd bring all the guys down or
Greg would come up, you know,

204
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:31,320
three or four times a week to the ranch
and we do as far as your ranch from 50

205
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:33,320
miles bell. Okay. A good hour,

206
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,100
solid hour drive into the vast
Nolan's of New Mexico. Mexico.

207
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,480
Do you like living out there? I do.
I love it. I was fucking love it.

208
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:46,320
So I sold my house. I moved
here, I fucking planted roots.

209
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,030
Now I could never ever sell my place.
I'm stuck in New Mexico.

210
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,690
I'm moving back to Colorado. I'm a
buyer. I never saw it because I have,

211
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,910
this sounds like a crazy cult leaders
of anybody out there listening wants to

212
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:02,580
operate a colt.
I have the perfect alchemy.

213
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,640
We're going anchor you.
I got 40 acres, 40 acres,

214
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,730
plenty of rooms, buildings,
animals in your vicinity. Um,

215
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,890
oh well yeah. This might
be where we start. There's,

216
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,130
there's about an hour drive you can run
into milk and we have, we got antelope,

217
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,270
um, everywhere, which is
crazy thing about analog.

218
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:24,400
Did you know they don't jump fences,
they won't jump fences, right?

219
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,370
You can just literally corner
him into a, into a, into a meal.

220
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:30,670
Occasionally jump a fence. They've been
known to jump a fence occasionally.

221
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:35,440
It was very, very rare. You know,
they evolved before the ice age.

222
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,890
They evolve to get away from
Cheetahs. However, you're so smart.

223
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,390
That's what I want to know.
I'm not smart.

224
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:44,140
I just remember the dude is
fucking insane. There was a, a,

225
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:47,080
a mass extinction of giant land mammals.

226
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,280
It's somewhere around 12,000 years ago
in North America and before then there

227
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,810
was cheetahs.
There was actual North American cheetahs.

228
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,770
There was a North American lion
that's bigger than the African lion.

229
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,560
How about that shit.
Giant ass fucking line.

230
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,070
And that's where these fucking
things did you want another chu?

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,530
I swallowed it last time.

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,020
Whenever I meet people for
autographs, he's like, Kevin,

233
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,660
if you got Rogan to fucking take a
chill, not just take it. I swallowed it.

234
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,020
I didn't know what I was doing.
Like a man. Yeah. All right.
Round two. Here we go. To

235
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,870
what kind of,
it's a wintergreen Copenhagen Chin,

236
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:32,560
right under your lip.
You can put under your Chin if you want.

237
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,420
You take just a little one too late.

238
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,450
I don't want to take a big upper liver.
