1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,560
Well for going to come after you.
How dirty is that money exactly.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,400
It must be in a safe and it wasn't just
the safe. Only in the storage unit. Oh,

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:09,420
that's gotta be something bad.

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:12,210
And you get that handsome dude that
was in the beginning of Ozarks.

5
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:15,720
That handsome Mexican dude.
It's just a straight up murder.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,610
He's going to come visit you all.
Oh Man. That guy was my favorite.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,640
I was so sad when they spoil spoiler.
So sad when they killed him.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,980
Like the dude from breaking bad. That
comes around twins. But did you see Ozark?

9
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:28,710
You ever see Ozark?

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,610
I watched like the first couple episodes
and I fucked it up for you. Yeah,

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,590
cause it was a pivotal moment
that I just gave voice to many.

12
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:38,350
There's so many shows though. There are
so many shows. But that's a damn good one.

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,170
Is it good?
That is a damn good show.

14
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,710
What's the guy that's the guy who
starts in that? Jason Bateman Bateman.

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,720
He's excellent. And the woman Laura
Linney Linney. She's amazing. Yeah,

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,250
the family's amazing kids. Amazing. It's
fucking show, man. It's a show. It's like,

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,910
nope, you get sucked in and that
Netflix lets you watch them all. Like,

18
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:57,990
are you ready?
Listen,

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,770
let me ask you a question I asked a
lot of people is and I said to set up a

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,640
Christmas party and I got with a bunch
of hunters and I got a couple like the

21
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,430
stink eye. Like what's this guy talking
to? Conservatives. I don't know if that,

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,370
maybe I'm just weird. Have you ever
seen the movie the greatest showman? Oh,

23
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,600
is that the, um, the musical? It is.

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,370
I've been forced to watch segments
of that with my wife and children.

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,960
It is fantastic. Very good
movie. Hugh Jackman's in angel.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,430
He's an angel and Australian Angel. He
is. He sent down here to save us. Save us.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,000
You ever seen him dance and sing?
He's made, he's magical. I'm a hunter.

28
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,820
I got a hunting podcast. But I'm
telling you, you're a manly man.

29
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:39,780
Look at that beard. Yeah, we got
this thing. But I love that movie.

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a great movie.
I listened to it on the Pandora,

31
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,190
the greatest showman channel
and I sing the tunes.

32
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:48,150
Listen did my favorite comedy on TV is
the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Okay.

33
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,000
So I can't be talking about man.
Look, things are not in manly things.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,900
Hugh Jackman Perform Announces World
Tour set to perform the greatest showman

35
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,610
songs. He's going to just sit and look
at him. Look at him. Wow. One man show.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,910
Gorgeous man. He's just,
I mean it's unbelievable.
Unbelievable. But yeah, I did.

37
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:09,690
I get, I get made fun of for this. My, of
course, my son likes it. My wife likes it,

38
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,230
but I enjoy, I get into like your
son, how old is he? He's too,

39
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,010
he doesn't know any better.

40
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,680
We just like the music
[inaudible] something's going
on. Yeah. He's just like,

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,960
there's something on the TV.
He's not like a crazy,

42
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:20,190
he's not writing that critique APP.

43
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,560
But if you put on Dora the explorer
and then you switched it over to that

44
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:27,210
bullshit, he believes this
fucking guy dancing. No, he'll
be Dora. Dora. Yeah. Listen,

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,460
I think that I watch like if you watch
things like game of Thrones where they

46
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,970
are burning children. Yeah.
And like it's entertaining,

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,140
but sometimes I need a break.

48
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,860
I like to watch a man dance around
and sing for a woman, whatever.

49
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,040
It don't matter. Those move those
shows can get dark where you're like,

50
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:47,400
what am I doing to myself? You
know, like narcos. Oh yeah.

51
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,670
And they would just go into a fucking
nightclub and gun people down just sitting

52
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,190
there and watching like women and
children smoked. And it's, it's,

53
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,320
what's the other, the show
with Anthony Hopkins on Hbo.
What's that? The robots. Oh,

54
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:03,220
Westworld. Yeah. That's the
same way they're shooting
kids on there though. Well,

55
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,830
the kids are robot. We
can just path. Yeah,

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,180
they shot one right in the
face every once in a while.

57
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:11,320
You need to sprinkle a little bit of
musical and your life, I believe. Yeah.

58
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,670
What is that do you think?

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,910
And here's the come coming from a person
that's been on a bunch of life changing

60
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:19,390
experiences. And I know you have, I want
to talk to you about some them. Yes.

61
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,180
Especially the one in Nepal where you
almost died and you saw children and

62
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:26,170
wolves, babies. We talked about that
on the last podcast, but it's probably,

63
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,970
it would be worth revisiting. Um,
what do you think this is? Like why,

64
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:35,740
why are we so obsessed with life
or death drama that's artificial.

65
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,260
Well you see it like in the,
in the,

66
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,140
in the show Westworld they talk
about like it being a game. Yeah.

67
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,570
It being this game of access. Like
what can't I do in my real life? Right?

68
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,270
So when you watch TV and you watch
murdering and you watch this,

69
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,250
this evil thing come to life,
you're just, you're, it's,

70
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,570
it really is something that
you can be transported,

71
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,640
can't do that in your regular
life. For sure. With Westworld,

72
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,300
what you're getting is basically a real
live version of that red dead redemption.

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,350
Yes. Right. So when you, when you play
that, we were talking about the other day,

74
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:12,010
how this guy got in trouble because they
have all these things in the game that

75
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,100
you can do to people.
And this guy like ty this hook her up,

76
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,500
threw her off a cliff and
shit and you can start can,

77
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,690
you can do whatever you want.
But they were,

78
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,970
they were filming this stuff and putting
it on youtube and then youtube would

79
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,630
get mad and youtube pulled him off.
But then people are like, well,

80
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:29,630
wait a minute though. Why? How
come? You can just do it like,

81
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,840
why'd you have that in the game?
But it did when my dad was my age,

82
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,600
30 40 years ago,
there would,

83
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,630
they would never have ever does nothing
done anything like game of Thrones or

84
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,700
Westworld ever. Ever. In fact,

85
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,920
there was a Westworld and it
wasn't anywhere near like it is.

86
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,830
You'll bring modern
day. Good moving. Yeah.

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,450
But like I think we've just stretched
out the limits to which we're willing to

88
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,510
explore, like really terrible and
evil things for entertainment.

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,960
We've definitely changed what we're
willing to accept and where the bar is in

90
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,690
terms of quality, the bars through
the roof, through the roof.

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,030
It's immersive to the point
where you can't even like,

92
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,880
I can't even explain what
you're experiencing when
you're watching these shows.

93
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,601
Yeah.
So look,

94
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:18,601
if you go and you see some great comedy
from the 1990s like you see watch a Dave

95
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,570
Chappelle or Chris rock specials from
the 90s that holds up 100% and Seinfeld

96
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,220
that. But what I'm saying is
like if that was out today,

97
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,310
it would be a 100% standup special.
I'd be like,

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,180
oh you see the new Chris Rock's bigger
and blacker, it's fucking amazing.

99
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,810
But if you tried to put some bullshit
ass 1990s TV show on on Netflix,

100
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,160
if you tried to like finagle
some CSI Miami type Shit,

101
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,870
you know what I mean? Some
nonsense. I don't know if CSI Miami,

102
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,690
is that even a show? Is that a real
show? There's a CSI Miami. There is.

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,710
There's several. There's many
CSI I guessed, but we'd like,

104
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,390
we don't order law and order.
There's so many of those,

105
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,660
but we've expanded our willingness
to like explore things that are,

106
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,940
I mean game of Thrones for example.

107
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,300
It's one of the best shows ever
created in my opinion for sure.

108
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,230
But it explores some unthinkable things.
Awful,

109
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,720
awful things. Well, it's the whole
show, but spoiler alert is, uh,

110
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,390
around a brother and sister were fucked
and had a whole family. Yeah. Yeah.

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,720
So we didn't explore these like these
things that in we would never even touch

112
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:34,660
upon in our media in the
fifties, sixties, even the 70s,

113
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,250
we would be touching upon those things in
a way that we do now. No, not only that,

114
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,550
but
here's the thing,

115
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,910
law and orders on a bad show. Like if
you watch it, you'll be in a, nope.

116
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,400
So what happened? Why, why do we go not
good enough? Like what, what was it?

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,830
Was it, did they go not good
enough or did, was it like,

118
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,080
like porn? Like if you watch porn, okay.

119
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,180
And you watch some porn from the 1980s
and then you flipped through like youporn

120
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,270
now that I would ever do that.

121
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,120
But if you did do that and looked at all
the different categories, you'd be like,

122
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,580
what the fuck happened?
Yeah. Like why are people,

123
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,550
why is gagging something people are
looking for? It's not, it's not an,

124
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,410
it's like a category. We've expanded
our ability to conceive of things. Yes.

125
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,700
In immediate space where we can create,
you can create dragons that breathe ice.

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,190
You can create. Yeah, there's,
there's things you can be
transported, like, listen,

127
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,680
this isn't real so I can,
I can do this, right?

128
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,650
I can have this scene of,

129
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,710
of rape or infidelity or are incest that
seems it's appropriate to me only in

130
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,500
this fantasy world,
man.

131
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,890
Sometimes I get down on that stuff like
a watch. Enough of it. You're just like,

132
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,410
I need a musical.
I need to be inspired.

133
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:53,450
That life is grand and that's
how I feel about it, man.

134
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:57,260
And sometimes it comes across and
like this dude washes musicals, but I,

135
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,200
I do for a little bit of a break.
Nothing wrong with it.

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,360
What I'm weirded out about is this natural
human inclination towards progression

137
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,230
in everything good or bad is that
things just keep ramping up well,

138
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:14,340
but we're progressing with our storylines
for like humanity in a weird way in

139
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:16,920
media. But we're also like
suppressing a lot of our,

140
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,910
we're trying to suppress through social
justice a lot of the same thing, right?

141
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,110
Well, some people are, but I think
it's a small, very vocal minority.

142
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,670
I think in reality there's,

143
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,350
the vast majority of people find out
about said suppression or upset by it and

144
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:31,591
they're like,

145
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:35,100
what in the fuck are you talking about
with this safe spaces and all this

146
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,500
nonsense. Most people that
hear that stuff are going, oh,

147
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:41,980
this is just nonsense by a few
like really loud device types.

148
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,820
Even though my pocket has,

149
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,760
it's something like as serious as hunting
is because you're killing stuff like

150
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,820
that's going out into the world and
taking plucking something that you didn't

151
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,410
put there,
taking it away.

152
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,700
But like I think that the core of what
I think you do well and what I think

153
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:00,810
others should try to do is ask why,
why are we willing to,

154
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,010
why is game of Thrones the most
watched show that's on right?

155
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,920
Why? Why, why? I can't answer
that question, but it's a
conversation because it's,

156
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,590
if it's so fictitious,
right?

157
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,410
It's so obviously fiction.

158
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,120
You're living in this fictional world.
You have fictional white walkers,

159
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,900
you have dragons,
you have people that can survive in fire,

160
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,620
but there's parallels to
real life and then these,

161
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,660
these ridiculous fantasies,

162
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:35,661
but then these parallels to real life
that that travel along the same path and

163
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:39,140
like you don't get to choose between
the dragons and the incest. Yeah.

164
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,830
Both there at the same time.
I think it,

165
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,830
it fulfills a lot of like base needs,
but it does.

166
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,470
So in this way, that's
obviously false. Yeah.

167
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,340
It's like why are
superheroes so huge to us?

168
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:57,450
If you stop and think about the number
of blockbusters that are superhero movies

169
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,830
that are comic book movies,

170
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,480
they're coming out like once every
couple of months now. Crazy. The,

171
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,340
that was a rare beast when I
was at chess when I was a kid.

172
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:08,520
If there's a hulk movie,
I have jumped for joy.

173
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,790
It was no god Damn Spiderman
movie when I was a kid.

174
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,880
There was a TV show and it's sucked.
Okay.

175
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,420
Was the God damn cartoon
TV show Spiderman?

176
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,740
Spiderman does whatever's
a spider spins a web,

177
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,300
any size catches these just
like flies. Look, ouch.

178
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,790
There comes a spider man.
It was terrible.

179
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,490
And I used to get up early to watch
it cause I was a huge comic book.

180
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,480
You've watched the Lou Ferrigno
Hawk, right? Fuck yeah, I watched it.

181
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,770
That was a little bit, I mean like you've
watched the Batman with Adam West. Yeah.

182
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,780
You watch him now and you're like,
what is happening?

183
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:46,590
So they came out with Superman.
He was like the first movies that,

184
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,870
what does this Spiderman, a TV show. Wow.

185
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,630
That's another TV show guy in the back
of was I kind of the background doing,

186
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,630
who's that guy? He don't look, you don't
do anything good. It's got a wooden stick.

187
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,100
He needs to know those
[inaudible] Spiderman can
shoot webs out of his hands and

188
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,110
that wouldn't sticks.
Probably not going to do much then.

189
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,260
Then Spiderman sorta changes
ability. Right? Because we,
it used to be able to do,

190
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,970
like now he could just basically fly.

191
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,780
I mean just hurls himself through the
air and sticks to buildings. You know,

192
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,750
he used to be a little harder
to swing around back. I like,

193
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,590
let me drop my backpack full of
textbooks, get to it. But he's, that was,

194
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,390
there was no Spiderman
movies when I was a kid,

195
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,440
and there was a superman movie and the
superman movie beget the Batman movie.

196
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,000
Batman movie came out, Michael
Keaton. It was a big, big success.

197
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:30,390
People were shocked at Michael
Keaton was Batman, but it worked.

198
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,810
Was that like Danny Devito
was the penguin? Yeah.
Everybody got a shot at Batman.
