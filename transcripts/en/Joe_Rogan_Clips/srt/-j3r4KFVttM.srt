1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,800
So this movie is based in,
uh,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,280
in no small part on your
own life experiences.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,960
It is a adopting and actual
you adopted like a full family,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,820
three him and children. Wow. Wild.
That's a, that's a bold maneuver,

5
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:22,650
sir. Yeah. What were the ages? A six,
three and a year and a half. And Wow.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,970
Yeah. What was the process?
Um, well it starts,

7
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:31,080
and this is how it starts in the movie as
well. My wife and I for years, I didn't,

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,850
I wasn't making any money and including
when after I made sex drive and, um, I,

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,510
uh, so I didn't really feel like
I could afford to have kids.

10
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:43,830
So whenever we talk about it, I just be
like, you know, not there yet. And, uh,

11
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:46,890
and then finally, um, when I
felt like I was doing better,

12
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,210
I was starting to get a career together,

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,570
I just started to feel like I was going
to be one of those old dads, you know,

14
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,430
like by the time the kid was a teenager,

15
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,210
I wasn't going to be able to play with
them during old, you know, I'm 49 now.

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,070
I was 41 at the time. And, uh,
so God, is that right? Oh Man.

17
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:06,260
It's depressing. Anyway, uh, so I, I, uh,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,370
I made this dumb joke to
my wife. I said, look,

19
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,260
why don't we just adopt a five year old?
It'll be like,

20
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,350
I got started five years ago and I'm like,
I'm right back in the game.

21
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,520
And she was like, you know, that's
actually a really interesting idea.

22
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:22,180
And I was like, no, I'm totally kidding.
Didn't mean anything by that. And,

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,610
and then she went to a website and she
showed me the website and then when I saw

24
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,660
the website, I was like, oh wow. You
see these kids, you see their faces,

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
you start to learn a
little bit more about it.

26
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:35,260
And we just started having conversations
and it, it went from there. Now,

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,430
now I got three kids in a movie.
And they're all siblings. Yes.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,390
So they're all came from one mom.
And what is,

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,410
how do they get separated from the family?
Um,

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,400
I don't have a lot of details about that.
You know, they don't really tell you,

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,690
you know, you, you know a little bit, but
not much. I mean, I know that there was,

32
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,340
that there were issues with drugs and I,

33
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,330
and I think there was some kind of a
fire at some point, but it's all pretty,

34
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,790
pretty sketchy as far as what you hear.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
So you've learned a lot
about the kids themselves,

36
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,220
but not that much about the situation.
And what,

37
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:11,130
what made you want to
turn this into a film?

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,050
Like I would imagine that's a
very personal experience. Yeah.

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,200
Um, it was actually my
writing partner, John Morris,

40
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,190
because I had been about three years into
it at that point and the beginning of

41
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,610
it was a nightmare. Like, like epic,

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,800
bad decision. Why did we
ever do this? Yeah, it was,

43
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,690
it was really a nightmare
for a short time.

44
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,910
And then when it came online
and we became a family,

45
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,180
it really became the best thing that
ever happened to me. And you know,

46
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,130
when John and I get together every day,

47
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:43,710
we just talk about our lives a little bit.
That's how we get started.

48
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,050
So John had been hearing all these
stories and one day he just said,

49
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,750
I don't know why we're not doing a movie
about this because nobody really knows

50
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,900
how this works when you go
into foster care to adopt kids.

51
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,860
So we started talking about it and then
there was the conversation of whether it

52
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,890
could be a comedy or not because
that's what we do. We make comedies.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,680
John again was like, most of the
stuff you've told me is really funny.

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,790
So not all of it of course, but that's,
and then we thought, wow, you know,

55
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:11,090
we could approach this as a comedy
and we might be able to get, you know,

56
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,780
a more general audience to get their,

57
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:18,460
their interest in it that way because
it'll feel less scary because that's the

58
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,730
problem is that most movies that are
made on this topic just frightened people

59
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,830
and they make people think
that these kids are all,

60
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,890
are all damaged and reachable of thing.
You know?

61
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,910
Do you worry that it would be locked
that movie 101 Dalmatians at a bunch of

62
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,090
people start getting foster kids
now and just screw him up? Yeah, we,

63
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,240
well we were talking about
top gun about how, you know,

64
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,820
remember when top gun came
out and everybody joined
the navy thinking they were

65
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:43,990
going to fly the plane. Right. Well,
when, um, the color of money came out,

66
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,270
pool halls boomed across the country.

67
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,270
I made a giant impact on pool halls and
I won Tom cruise movie and it was just

68
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,360
really, a lot of people just got scammed
out of their fucking pocket money.

69
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,760
Some of that going on.

70
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,570
I think the crazy thing about
this too was that like on the set,

71
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,720
you realize like when you, when we're
doing this, you go like, Oh yeah,

72
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:08,890
I always thought of people
who do that. Like, you know,
they exist, but you're like,

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,160
those are nameless, faceless angels.
They're not real people. If you're like,

74
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,610
do you have any of your friends at top?
I'd be like,

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,060
why don't I have friends like that?
Like those are other people you know.

76
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,550
And then you start like on
the set there was, you know,

77
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:24,700
people visiting or consulting and
there would be like, oh, you know,

78
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,500
they adopted are they run some foster
care thing and then you're like, oh,

79
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,990
this is actually something that people
really do well. Even like dudes,

80
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,040
the crew that somebody would come up,
you know,

81
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,830
who's in the electrical department
and be like, oh hey bro, I got,

82
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,550
I adopted two kids by the way, if
you like really, you know, or hey,

83
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:44,000
I got adopted when I was four years old.
Did you just would like,

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
once you see it now,
everywhere people are hitting me up.

85
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,470
Someone hit me up yesterday.
Like,

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,260
my sister is adopting four
siblings this week. Wow. Yeah,

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,200
it's nuts. I mean like, it's like
something, and I don't want to,

88
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,250
it's almost like when your friend gets
a car and then you start seeing it

89
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:03,330
everywhere.
Exactly like that though.

90
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,160
Um,

91
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,110
we talked about that video that went
around online of this little girl that

92
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,230
realize that she's opening up a box and
there's something in it that tells her

93
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:17,880
that she's been adopted by these two
people that are with her. And it's really,

94
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:21,030
yeah, it's impossible to not cry. Yeah.

95
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,870
I mean if you have any hard at all and
you watch that little girl freak out and

96
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,550
it's,
it breaks you up.

97
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,850
I think that's almost the test as far as
what you were talking about, about how,

98
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,510
cause believe me, I test if you're a
piece of shit or not. When you watch that.

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,350
Yeah, we should show that to a
lot. What's your reaction? Oh,

100
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:43,870
you're a piece of shit. You're a
sociopath. Yeah. But no, I mean there,

101
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,870
is that what you were just getting at
as far as, believe me, I'm not that. Hi.

102
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:52,010
That like I didn't feel special or like
any one of those sort of heart of gold

103
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:52,671
angels.
You know,

104
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:55,350
we have a line that's in the movie
where mark just says that's for the,

105
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,120
the kind of people that volunteer. It's
not even a holiday and we don't do that.

106
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,670
Yeah.

107
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,360
You should probably tell the audience
that I'm not staring in this movie right

108
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,160
now for people that aren't,
you know, those people are
like, so Tom starts in snow.

109
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,290
It's Mark Wahlberg movie for like
four and a half minutes. There you go.

110
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,670
And then everyone is mark Walberg
Stars in the rest of it. That's true.

111
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,790
That's a good way of breaking it down.
It was only probably like 90 minutes,

112
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,270
so that's pretty good. That's not bad.
What I have probably like seven scenes.

113
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:24,050
That's good scenes that now you've got
a solid presence. He didn't make it up.

114
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,760
You don't make the poster. The poster,
the poster. You made the standee though.

115
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,820
Did you know that there's a standee
in movie theaters and you're in that.

116
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,560
Oh really? All right. I'll take
that. Can Steal one. Heard that word?

117
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,730
Standee standees. Those are the
big cardboard. It was never cost.

118
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:42,740
Those things were because I didn't know
that either. Cardboard cutout thing.

119
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,060
That's what I always call it
cardboard cutout. Standee is the real,

120
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,780
the real terms that determine the
industry. That's an industry term.

121
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,200
That's a real.
