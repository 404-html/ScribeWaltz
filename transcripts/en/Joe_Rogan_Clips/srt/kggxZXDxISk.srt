1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,020
Cruises like 15 he got braces. Sure.
It was like, Yo, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:07,500
They came in, he's like, you don't
have my bat. Also changed his voice.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,450
Do you remember where I did he do that?
He went with veneers. They're brilliant.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,290
They're so good. Years are amazing.
That's what I'm saying Bro. Amazing.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,030
I had a friend,
she did it.

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,230
One of the girls that I did news radio
with almost hit her name and I'll get us

7
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,390
a three for one deal up in a forefront.
One Jamie, you want to your lungs.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,970
If you look at the the good ones,
you're like God damn you teeth.

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:31,460
Her fucking fantastic here. That
Bam Tom Cruise. What? Look what?

10
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,110
I don't know if that is veneers or
braces come cause he did wear braces.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,800
Look at real teeth to look at the left.

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,160
I think there is real teeth and I
think the one on the left is just,

13
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,980
it could be photoshopped.
I don't remember them being that bad.

14
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,060
I think it's Photoshop. Yeah, see
that's why he's wearing braces.

15
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:55,380
Teeth are real ta do.
I think those are his real teeth.

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,880
Go to him before braces seem to go to him.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,440
Go to him smiling in the color of money
cause he was really young in that movie.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,550
Taco Tom Cruise, color of money, smiling.

19
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:10,920
She's such a beast than me.
Tom Cruise is a monster.

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:15,090
I just watched the color of money on a
flight. It was fucking crazy right there.

21
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:18,180
The far left, far left. Holy Shit.
Yeah, those are his teeth, bro.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,800
He just gathers those frontline.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,440
Those front ones have been knocked out and
those, those are fake. Well, there's no,

24
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:26,340
no, this is a long time ago, man.
This is, this is the color of money.

25
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,920
This is like 1986 yeah.

26
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,890
I'm saying the rest of the teeth or
the color yellow in the middle ones are

27
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,980
white, but that's hard to tell. You
seem dark shadows all over the place.

28
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,740
You can't really gauge yellow right there.
Look at that. It's so hard to judge,

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,240
but see his teeth look like that.
I seen all this buddies, gentlemen,

30
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,740
you can't even see his right eye.

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,740
You're judging whether or
not that's his teeth color.

32
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:49,710
You literally can't see his right
eye because he's in so much shafts.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,150
Teeth don't look super suspect.
You know they look like teeth right there.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,050
You crazy. That's his teeth. His
teeth are normal. His teeth were,

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,690
you're judging by today's standards.
That's the problem.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,830
Make those teeth perfect like that dude.
If you had bad teeth back then,

37
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:08,400
if you had fake teeth, they look
fake as fuck. That's true. His teeth,

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,150
his teeth were off center like
you know the middle teeth.

39
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,890
They were all kind of pushed over to the,
right.

40
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:18,600
Now they're way better than [inaudible]
and crooked 56 still doing action movies.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,830
Still does his own stunts,

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,280
jumps from building to building
breaks his ankle and filming.

43
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,100
Have you seen that shit? No.
Apparently it's mission impossible.

44
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:29,760
Movie is a motherfucker and he's
killing it. They said it's killing it.

45
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:34,530
It's awesome. Mission possible
yet here and it's fantastic.

46
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,200
He's awesome. He's, he's just really
started fuck. But he's awesome.

47
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,580
He's also nice. His Shit. You
know what else, dude? He's,
he was, because watch this,

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,610
he jumps off this and breaks his ankle
and he really did all his own stunts.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,570
The watch when he lands. Watch how Jack
does apple get out. Boom. All fucked up.

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,140
You ain't ready for that be you
want to be a worldwide action here?

51
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,700
I can't do that. I'll look at
it. I showed hits. What I it is,

52
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,630
I don't quite make it.
Snapper Rooney, stocky

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,360
Dick to the metal. He still
finishing. He still finishes. Look,

54
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,090
he's still jumped over the top steel and
seen oiling character Lam that concrete

55
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,980
into his dick bone. And look how he
pulled off. He hobbled off when he got up.

56
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,080
That's why you have to have a stunt
man cause you're going to get,

57
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,220
you guys are hardcore man,
but he likes everything.

58
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:31,090
He does all the car driving
stunts. Exactly. The
helicopter does all that shit.

59
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,390
I didn't know that. I didn't know he
home blood and look up your tongue.

60
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,610
I don't have to look up shit.
Don't as a free country.

61
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,410
He might have a a dark wish for the
end to one of those movies. Oh my God.

62
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,470
He might have a dark, which might
be right. I have, I have friends.

63
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,410
People discredit it and
because the Scientology stuff,

64
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,740
absolutely 100% do and
Burlison the Scientology thing
is just how he gets by is

65
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,830
a lot of people that have their own
ideologies. They believe it or not,

66
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:59,230
it might be radical left ideology.

67
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:03,250
There's a lot of conservative former
like actors that are like super

68
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,520
conservative. They're on Twitter. Like
they're in it. They're in a cult, correct?

69
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,150
Correct. They're all rat. Everyone's
wrapped up in this own little thing.

70
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,690
His thing is just crazy. It's fucked by
a guy who was a science fiction author,

71
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:16,970
a war, a fucking captains coat on with
a bunch of medals he gave himself,

72
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,320
but they have some legit buildings.
You driven by the Hollywood actors.

73
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,520
They have legit actress, man.
Dude, Tom Cruise is fucking legit.

74
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,830
John Travolta has done
some silly nonsense,

75
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,150
but he's also done pulp fucking fashion.

76
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,330
He did carry when he was like really
good at Saturday night live face off.

77
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,400
He's a very fit and active as
a terrible movie face off. Oh,

78
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,330
that's a great one.

79
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,440
When they cut the face off and put
it on the other person has happened.

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,920
Post structure magically changes and
nick cage looks like John Travolta,

81
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:55,040
Tom [inaudible] technologies,
not terrorist debt.

82
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,670
There's no way Bro.
Okay.

83
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:01,360
What did it happen if Brian
Topp and put it on you?

84
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,950
I would think people were like,
there's a monster here.

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,990
First of all,
you head's way bigger.

86
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,600
So your skin a bit like some
60 year old lady from Bel Air.

87
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,730
So those 60 year old ladies where their
mouth looks like it's so big and key

88
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,380
your head,
cause they've been pulling,

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,340
they're pulling their skin back
to their mouth as like a joker.

90
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,730
They lose fat in their face.
As you get older, your memory,

91
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:27,340
you used to make fun of me for taking
an acting class and I stayed in 19 last

92
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:32,341
for eight years longer than I needed to
because I love of train wreck and these

93
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:37,921
two guys did a c Jeffrey
tambor was teaching and these
two guys did a scene from

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,190
faceoff and the curtain comes up and,

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,400
and one guy's hanging from a chain and
the other guy's torturing him and it's

96
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,120
like, and then he goes, yeah. And so,
and he's hitting him and it's crazy.

97
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,570
And at the end of the scenes like scene,
everybody's like,

98
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,720
and Jeffrey tambor just takes a
sip of his coffee and he goes,

99
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,480
what was that scene? And the
guy was face off, face off.

100
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,840
What is that? It's a movie.
It's an action movie.

101
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,320
John Travolta in an occasion
that seen as band forever.

102
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,610
That was it. Moving man. Yeah, whatever.

103
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,310
I heard this gaudy movie's terrible.
It's like doors moves all the time.

104
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,940
I've heard it already. Yeah.
It was like a zoo. Good tomato.

105
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,910
Why aren't I saw the, I saw the
trailer and I got into it. Okay, let's,

106
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,020
let's just Google. How bad
is the God he movie? It's,

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,790
I mean there was it say

108
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,980
two out of 10 that is insane. Okay,
that's great. Is that has to be correct?

109
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,310
He's great. He looks good. He
looks like a bomb. He looks good.

110
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,450
He looks like a good God.
He John's fault.

111
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,140
Is j Simpson on FX played a
shipper. That's right. Yeah,

112
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,440
that's right. He's a great, he's a great
actor and he's created everything man.

113
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,590
He just does a lot of
bad movies. Yeah, shorty.

114
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,680
He just does his and has
done a lot of bad movies.

115
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,530
I know Tom Cruise is
done from end of days.

116
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,920
Even like all those movies didn't even do.

117
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,410
I love them to know this guy is
fucking fantastic. Was best movie.

118
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,390
You know what else is good with that?
What is the,

119
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,950
is that the one the tomorrow again,
he dies. He keeps dying. That's it.

120
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,810
Does that end of days? That's no,
I'm thinking of a different one.

121
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,670
He did like two science fiction movies.
I'm thinking of director tomorrow. Yes.

122
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,330
That was what it was called, but it was
called edge of tomorrow. Originally,

123
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,750
and then like we've talked about this
before, they change. That's right.

124
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,640
Because the marketing,

125
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,020
because it came out and you kissed her
original marketing was edge of tomorrow,

126
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:50,040
whatever the fuck it came out.
And then people are like,

127
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,490
God that no one showed up to it.
But the people that went were like,

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
that's like the greatest movie ever.

129
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,660
So then it started to gain
traction then like, hold up,

130
00:07:56,661 --> 00:08:00,380
we need to relabel this thing. Then they
relabeled it and that movie's fucking,

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,390
that might be his best movie.
It's a great fucking mood,

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,440
a great fucking science fiction movie.

133
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,340
It is one of the most underrated
science fiction movies ever.

134
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,610
And if you're a [inaudible] fan and
you avoided it just because, oh,

135
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:17,780
it's a Tom cruise movie. Yeah. You fucked
up because it is amazing. It's amazing.

136
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,990
I did a reading with him one time
and, and uh, he, in the reading,

137
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,370
it was just literally me, him, Eric
Stoltz, Amy smart movie. It was moving,

138
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,610
it never got made called men and I,
I was reading,

139
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:31,790
I was reading all the parts opposite him
and the wall and they were talking to

140
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,000
Owen Wilson. So I was right next to him
and I, you know, spent, I don't know,

141
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,670
maybe three hours with him and
it was a small, nobody was out.

142
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,370
Nobody else was in the room,
like just Todd Phillips and a couple bags.

143
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,930
He in the reading, like in the
reading as you're just doing it,

144
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,030
acting full out and, and, and
amazing and, and just loves it.

145
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,670
And almost like his eyes were watery
at one point where everything's like,

146
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,950
all the chips are down in the scene.
And then I was just,

147
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,570
this fucking dude is up make,

148
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,480
I kept staring at him and I
believed everything he was
doing and just sitting at

149
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:03,360
a table and we get there. He's a
little late, just a little late,

150
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,470
profusely apologizes. He's got to,
haven't eaten. Just give me a second.

151
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm diamond and he's just talking.
He's so nice.

152
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,310
And he had five pieces of Sashimi
with a tiny little pepper on each one.

153
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,680
And some Penta water and he
was like, thank you so much.
It was great. Boom, boom,

154
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,670
boom. And then we went
out, read the thing,

155
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,340
and then he wanted to hear what
all of us thought of the script.

156
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,970
What are suggestions were
and when he listens to you,

157
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,460
his eyes sparkle, his mouth moves
in an oh like you can be like,

158
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,930
I think I was a little confused in the
beginning and he's like, Whoa, hold on.

159
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,110
What he, what he, you know, he's
zeroed in on you. And I was like,

160
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,020
this guy loves me man.
We're going to be best friends.

161
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,020
And then yeah,
we dated for it.

162
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,290
We can put you in the mission
and pulse was some shit. I talk,

163
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,090
I spend time with him. Dude,
you're not Scientology. Well,
he could get you to join.

164
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:59,010
I think he could get you to join. Yeah. I
wouldn't show up. And I'd be like, yeah,

165
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,020
of course he would get mad
that you weren't showing up.

166
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,250
But if you did show up and you charmed
people there and just rub backs,

167
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,220
I know a lot of [inaudible] that you loved
them. I was in the class for 10 years.

168
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,490
That is cited in the book by, uh, in, in,

169
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:15,130
I'm going clear at that whole class
that, that I was in that class. She,

170
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,390
I remember you had me come to one
of those little boots. Sure did.

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,450
Went to an event, a thing that was
going on, watch the guy saying, we, we,

172
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,790
we watched the guys saying,
well,

173
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:28,410
we were so high and we're in like a
neighboring dimension watching reality

174
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,900
through a dirty mirror in
the Scientology building.

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,840
How will to get it to show bare. There
was near there. It was in the theater.

176
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:38,310
We were barbecued. I mean,
Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba,
Bubba, Bubba, bubba barbecue,

177
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,440
freaking out watching this,

178
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,630
that they were singing
musicals and it was not good.
