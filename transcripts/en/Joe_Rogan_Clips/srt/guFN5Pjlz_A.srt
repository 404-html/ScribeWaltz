1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,970
I'm going to do a podcast which subtitles
in Spanish and I'm bringing them up

3
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:09,400
here on Friday. Why? Yeah,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,490
please do it for me in
Spanish with subtitles.

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,910
And then I'm going to bring him up here
on Friday and we're going to have a

6
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:17,260
three way about Cuba.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,530
Well it was like to rest on the
whole thing if you don't mind.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,550
Well you mind so I'll
do mine about subtitles.

9
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:29,540
Justin at Barnyard cool work
or more total. Yeah. So no,

10
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,480
we will not clash with you dude.

11
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:34,820
The three of us together would be the
greatest podcast cause I could interpret

12
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:39,340
it and you would be, would be,
uh, it would be a real MMA.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,660
You could really talk to him
about the hooks and to Russia.

14
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,040
That's a fantastic training.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,190
Even the Cuban where they shipped them
cause they shipped you off when you were

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,620
young kid. They did. A lot
of people don't know. Yeah,

17
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:55,270
they look at you on that ain't go uh, I
looked at him. You don't have a choice.

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,070
They look at you and they go do us a
little, try that on. That's it. Now,

19
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:02,380
and then they'd take her to a certain
age and that or the 80 to send you to

20
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,480
Nicaragua or Russia and you train.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,780
And that's why a lot of Cubans that you
docus because they go to rush and learn

22
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,740
judo.
Wow.

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,700
So he's going to tell you how they
shipped them off and they don't just tell

24
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,470
your mom would take him tomorrow.

25
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,640
It's always been interesting to me
because the Cubans and the Russians in

26
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:29,590
particular were always thought of as being
very technical. Really. The Russians,

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,330
Russians are super technical.

28
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,480
That was what a lot of people attributed
George Saint Pierre Success in

29
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:38,070
wrestling, you know, George's didn't
wrestle in college or in high school, uh,

30
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,650
but he trained with a bunch of Russian
nationals and Montreal and apparently

31
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:45,070
phenomenal wrestlers and they have
this incredible wrestling program.

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,000
Like when you see,
when you see Norma Madoff,

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,850
the way he mauls people inside the
octagon, like what in the fuck?

34
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,970
Like that is like a,
a perfect example of that.

35
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:59,050
Like style of super hard,
super technical wrestling.

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,750
They're so good at it. There's
so many. You see? You know,

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,910
see Loma Chanko used to be a wrestler
because a video of La Loma Chanko.

38
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:08,140
It looks like he's doing sambo.

39
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,350
It looks like he's got a like a g on
and it's him and some other cat and he's

40
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:17,380
like 11 years old or something like that.
So his father put him in everything.

41
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,340
His father made him. You know
Loma Chanko is, yes, yes, yes.

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,000
One of the best boxers ever.

43
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,500
Like literally one of the most technically
beautiful to watch boxers it's ever

44
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:30,220
lived. But this guy he used to
wrestle too. Like is this is a,

45
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,700
I don't think this is,
it is. It does him. Okay.

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,180
Is this him wrestling with somebody?
Yeah,

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,620
this is one now or he can still do
this shit. This is like pretty recent.

48
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,430
Like he showed some of his wrestling moves
but the other one was him when he was

49
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,730
a little boy. Like he's really
tactical man. He knows how to wrestle.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,970
This is legit. Like when you see
the way he's moving his body,

51
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,310
he's not faking that. He's done that
a bunch of times and yeah, this is,

52
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,800
this is one when he's a
little kid, man, it's crazy.

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,630
It says Greco Roman wrestling,
but they're wearing a Geeky,

54
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:04,360
so I'm not exactly sure what it is,

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,820
but he gets his kid and a gets
behind him and sends him for a ride.

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,100
So he was, he's always been an amazing
athlete, like an area. I think there's,

57
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,620
there's something to that.
There's something to,

58
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,200
his father had an idea to crazy ideas.

59
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,700
His father took him out of boxing and put
them in a dance for like several years.

60
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,420
Uh,
Ukrainian traditional dance style.

61
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,560
Apparently they were talking about it
on one of those HBO shows for like four

62
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,010
years, I think it was the HBO show, but
for four years, I think he just danced.

63
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,950
You imagine that his father's like,
you want to learn how to box,

64
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,060
you got to dance and now
nobody's got footwork.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,090
If you've seen him, Joey, you've seen
like his highlight reel. It's insane.

66
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,730
It's insane. It's insane. Jamie,

67
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:53,731
pull up allometry highlight reel because
my daughter goes to ballet and 80% of

68
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,150
the class is Russia.
So I was thinking about it yesterday.

69
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:02,140
I was watching the movements, the last
parade movement. I'm like, Jesus Christ.

70
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,210
If people did ballet, could you, and I was
thinking of the GSP, like, you know me,

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,790
I'm like, pre probably fucking
does ballet and give them that.

72
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,290
You would would be good.
It's great footwork.

73
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,680
This guy is the wizard or footwork.

74
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,760
It's crazy because he was
like right in front of you,

75
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,850
but he's one step ahead
of you at every turn.

76
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,670
Like he knows what you're going to
do, right? While you're doing it,

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,170
he's moving in a way that you can't move.
He's in front of you and then he's not.

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,670
It's crazy.

79
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:35,671
Like he's the one of the most technical
boxers I've ever seen and it just an

80
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:41,050
amazing stylistic achievement.
Like what he can do with his body.

81
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,550
His style is totally unique. I mean
every, but a lot of guys have done it.

82
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,770
A lot of guys that moved in and out,
a lot of guys have done it,

83
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,740
but he's doing it at such a high level,

84
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,700
such a high level that it makes people
confused. Guys quit in their corner.

85
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,200
They're like,
what in the fuck?

86
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,620
And I really think a lot of it probably
had to do with his father's cross

87
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,620
training and particularly with the dance,

88
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,840
I mean think about how effortlessly
he goes, like steps around guys.

89
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,980
I mean he's got some
incredible control of his feet,

90
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:15,790
but it makes sense that like you would
learn how to move your feet in a specific

91
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,120
way that the way you weren't learning
how to move your hands in a specific way.

92
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,850
Right? Like think about a guy
like Floyd Mayweather, right?

93
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,110
His hand combinations with his upper body.
There are so precise. It's like that,

94
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,450
that, that, that right? But with his legs,

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,860
is he as precise as he as precise
moving with his legs, his,

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,640
but his hands Rizzy 60% or 70%
or 80% lama chanko is probably

97
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,410
perfectly proportioned for his style,
with his ability to move,

98
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:44,770
but also also his ability
to box and hit you. Well,

99
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,660
he's got both things going on at the
same time with next level angles.

100
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,030
So that's what I was saying. Fuck. When
you're younger in Cuba, they picked you.

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,140
It's not like you wake up and
go, I want to be a wrestling. No,

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,760
they look at you and go, you look
like he could go, go, go wrestle.

103
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,920
And like what I was hearing back
from them in the early seventies,

104
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,060
it was like they just took you
away from your family. They uh,

105
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,730
that was part of your training. You
know, your, then they put you in a go.

106
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,640
We had no, you know where you
train them like their army. Do you,

107
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,050
have you talked to Y'all about this?
Like no,

108
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,620
we've discussed what this thing is.
I already have graphics on the podcast.

109
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,131
Well,

110
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,390
so I figured that I put them up and we'll
do a podcast in Spanish with fucking

111
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,590
subtitles, like an English film, like
a, like a Giulini movie, whatever.

112
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,640
One of those movies people think are
unique. Okay. I have it because his,

113
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,200
his English is too rough for me and I
know what he's trying to say and the

114
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,610
frustration in his face.

115
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,770
So now he did a tape the other day of
him in Cuba waiting for Bisbing in Cuba.

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,650
Cuba, no Romero's back. See if he's fine.

117
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,650
But what is the, see if you
can find he's, he's nuts.

118
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,740
He's nuts. He's nuts. He's
fighting Rockhold now,

119
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,800
which is a tremendous ride on the
10th all right. That's a crazy fight.

120
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,960
That's a crazy, very good
fight. Very good fight.

121
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,670
[inaudible].
