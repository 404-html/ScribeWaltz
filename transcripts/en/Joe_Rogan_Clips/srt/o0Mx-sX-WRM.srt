1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,380
How would they stop congressmen
from becoming lobbyists? Well,

2
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:07,820
one thing they do a,
and then I build loopholes into it,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,040
but one thing they can do is
they can basically say, um,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,450
once your congressman you can't be alive
is for five years and five years or

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,480
whatever the time is. But the more
fundamental factors, you know,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,060
if you change the way you fund campaigns,

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,950
if it was no longer the lobbyists who
are kind of channeling the money in or

8
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,350
that we're getting their
clients to channel the money in,

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,440
then it's not like there
wouldn't be lobbyists anymore.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,860
They just wouldn't be so well paid.
They wouldn't be as valuable.

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,020
And if they're not as valuable,

12
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,260
it's not as valuable for them to pay
the congressmen and incredible amount of

13
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:43,620
money to become con, uh, lobbyists. You
know, they would become almost like,

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,890
you know, lawyers policy wonks that
kind of go to Capitol Hill and say,

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,190
here's what will happen if you
adopt this legislation. You know,

16
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,930
that's an important part of the process.

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,390
But they wouldn't be the
mockers in the system.

18
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,790
They wouldn't be the people
who called the shots.

19
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,620
And so the value of their services would
fall and if the value of their services

20
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,700
fell, then, um, it wouldn't make so
much sense to go and become a lobbyist.

21
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,970
Maybe you'd come home and be a doctor
again or come home and like be a business

22
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:12,030
person again or do whatever you
want, uh, back in your district.

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,180
So I think if you change
the way you fund campaigns,

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,310
you would change 70% of the problem.
You would just fix it right then.

25
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,340
And these other things that good
additions, but not as critical.

26
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:25,890
But without changing the
way you fund campaigns,

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,530
I think all of these other
changes that are irrelevant,

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,290
they just can't get over the money.
You will always hear the phrase,

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,960
take money out of politics.
It's a constant phrase,

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,650
but that's not really possible now.
And underneath it gets really good.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,200
The point isn't,
the point isn't to get money out.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,160
The point is to get money that doesn't
represent a tiny fraction of the special

33
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:50,970
interests controlling how
congress people think. So, um,

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,740
I think today a congressman
from California Rogue Kahana
is going to introduce a

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,030
bill that he hopes will be eventually
part of whatever this big reform packages

36
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,750
that would create,
um,

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,570
a way of funding campaigns where everybody
gets a voucher or a set of vouchers.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:06,960
You know,

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,550
Seattle has done this for city elections
where everybody gets for $25 vouchers.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,290
They're only usable to fund campaigns.

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,080
So a candidate comes around and tries
to persuade you to give him or her the

42
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,170
voucher and then they take that voucher
and they use it to fund campaigns. Okay.

43
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,370
If Roca Han is bill passed and
everybody had vouchers to use to fund

44
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:28,660
congressional campaigns,
and you know,

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,330
the idea is basically you take the
rebate of the first $50 of your taxes,

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,600
which every American pays at least
$50 to the federal government.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,710
You take that first $50,

48
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,930
you'd give it back and you give it
in the form of a voucher and you say,

49
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:43,380
take this voucher and help
fund campaigns with it.

50
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,080
Congressman would still be raising money.

51
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,070
They'd still be spending a
large time raising money,

52
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,880
but they wouldn't be raising money from
the tiny fraction of the 1% they'd be

53
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,080
raising money from everybody.

54
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,860
And so the point is that you would be
using that money to spread the influence

55
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,570
in the way that democracy is supposed to
spread the influence to every American

56
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,330
as opposed to the influence in a tiny,

57
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:11,140
tiny fraction of the 1% so
that wouldn't get less money.

58
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,850
I think that could be
more money in the system,

59
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,210
but it wouldn't be corrupting money
because it would be money that is

60
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,440
democratically accountable.
