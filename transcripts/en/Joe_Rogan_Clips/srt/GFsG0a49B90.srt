1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,180
Okay,

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,230
you gotta be tall. And here's what
the craziest shit about the wall.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm sure you've seen where
it goes into the ocean. Yeah.

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,670
Was there like how are you going to
stop people from going around that?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
That is the silliest thing ever that is
like having this gigantic huge wall that

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,340
is like having like a gigantic,
huge impenetrable boundary.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,840
But on one side there's just
like a door. Yeah, that's a door.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,200
You go right around that. I mean
it'd be hard to bring all your shit.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,550
So what happens?

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,860
These guys right there on the Mexico
side and those guys over there on the

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:42,510
California side, like that is the weirdest
shit ever. ABC Ball with each other.

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,520
Do they? Yeah. Really? Wow. Okay.

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,980
So they added another piece to that
wall right there. So that wall,

14
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,360
that's an old wall. See that? The
construction of the wall that I saw now?

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,740
Yeah. Wow Man. He goes to a
swim, but as soon as you swim,

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,720
you know the part of the coast colors,
we'll come get you. That is so crazy.

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,700
Just what a strange and people would
go. You don't want a wall. Relax.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,190
I hadn't said any of that.
Not saying that.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,270
I'm saying just look at this just as a,
use your brain.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,870
Just look at this objectively and
see how bizarre it is that there's a,

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,180
a gigantic physical boundary that keep
certain people from going into a certain

22
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,210
area. I mean, I,

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,650
I think that that one day that has
to not be a thing anymore, right?

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,513
Wouldn't you say?

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,653
Yeah.

26
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,400
And that is a crazy thing to justify.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,650
Like you can't come to the good spots.
Like the good spots are limited. Well,

28
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:47,810
if they let people in and there'll
be no more, no more good spot,

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,050
it'll be just like the bad spots.
That's the, that's the fear.

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,600
And here's the thing, man, that
ain't none uncommon. That's not a,

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,160
it's not an imperfect, it's
not a fear that's not totally
illogical either. Right?

32
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:05,720
Like you would be worried if
you lived in a sweet place,

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,420
like a name,
a city.

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,430
Not Too many people perfect size
boulder, Colorado voters. Cool.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,530
Yeah. Ben Was Fun, right? Everybody. Nice.

36
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,910
What if a million more
people moved into boulder?

37
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,040
Now all of a sudden it's 1,000,100
thousand and you're like, what the fuck?

38
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,760
What the fuck is this? You can't
go anywhere now. Everybody's rude.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,600
He will start getting antsy that the
way they drive, they drive faster.

40
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,700
That's what happens to be more,
more gangs.

41
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,010
How do you fix that? That's
how, that's what we need to fix.

42
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:43,440
Not like whether or not there's
a wall. Okay. Do you fix?

43
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,540
How do you fix people from getting crazy
and no man shooting a little bolder.

44
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:53,340
Colorado probably have a subway system to
get other people off the streets. Yeah.

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,160
Yeah.
If they did,

46
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,620
if they did have like a couple million
people move, they're like, Bam,

47
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:03,670
start moving shit and sentence.
She would change radically.

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,080
That's what happens to places. You get
too many people. They just fucking change.

49
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,700
It's uh, it's still
strange fucked. See a wall.

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,590
It is Monday your house.
I'm not saying that I can,

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,110
but it gets so big.
It's so right when he left with a dude.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,600
What'd you just stick to comedy?
Yeah. All I'm saying is it's weird.

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,130
It's fucking weird.

54
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,480
It seems to be something that should
be perhaps reexamined. It's idea of

55
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,280
like,

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,850
it's almost like we have weird parents
that we have to listen to for our whole

57
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:44,020
life and that those parents
are the government I know.
Look at like when I was,

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,430
when I was a little boy, I was
living in Mexico and um, my mother,

59
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,750
she to tie me up to a stump runaway,

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,740
Holy Shit. That glade to follow my dad
to work every day. My Dad was like, uh,

61
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,800
I think he was like a steel worker
or something. He worked on a lathe.

62
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,410
So he worked with metro at the time.
Yeah.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,250
And I would follow him to work every
day because I was a board little kid I

64
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,480
guess.
And they could,

65
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,650
if I would run away every day and my
mind were tied me up to a little street,

66
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:19,210
stuck with a rope. Wow. I was
her pet, basically. Jesus Christ.

67
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,250
Holy Shit.

68
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,670
That's a weird memory. I know,
right? I lived it. I lived in, um,

69
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,120
I remember I lived in Mexico for a
little while, try with three or four.

70
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,420
Then my dad took off. Do
you remember? Mexico at all?

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
I remember a bathroom was outside

72
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,490
like an outhouse and we have to use
a flashlight to go outside and wow.

73
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,550
I remember mosquitoes everywhere and my
mom's family are living in like in one

74
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:54,240
big ranch with different houses
and it was fucking dusty.

75
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,170
I mean it was dusty. I was living
in them. Sinaloa Mexico. Right.

76
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,020
And they used to be a
truck that were water the,

77
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,330
the ground every day because it was
too dusty and there was no cement.

78
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,760
But then my dad took off to the
United States and we followed him.

79
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,990
We came here. We, we, we
were living in Tijuana,

80
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:20,840
Mexico for about two years.
Do you remember how you got
through? Yeah, we've got,

81
00:05:20,841 --> 00:05:21,674
we're all,

82
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,110
my dad made it through first started
another family then came and got us. No,

83
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,550
but that's what I thought. He
was gone for a long time, man.

84
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,170
We, we went, we were living with my aunt,

85
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:37,860
her name was [inaudible] and she lived
in Tijuana, Mexico, right next to that.

86
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,870
Where that, where that gate is Colonia
three. I say what's up? And, um,

87
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,520
we, we went across with a, uh, like
a coyote, you know, a smuggler.

88
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,860
My mom pay the money and we got in his
car, we crossed and we made it through.

89
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:53,910
I remember we made it through,

90
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,250
but there was like a checkpoint
back in the day in San California,

91
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,060
the California Sheriff Department,
we'll just, the county sheriffs,

92
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,670
they will randomly stop cars,
you know,

93
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:09,520
like too many people in one car and his
car too heavy. So they got us and he,

94
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,730
they put us in there like in a
holding cell. My mom went one way.

95
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,940
We went the other way.
Wow. And how old were you?

96
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,490
I was probably four,

97
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:23,450
maybe or 500 member throw
three of three little brothers.

98
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,530
I have my little brother was like
three and another one was one or two.

99
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,830
Why would they separate you from
your mom? Um, I don't know. That's,

100
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,150
I guess that's how they process
where bags are illegal people.

101
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,710
That seems kind of crazy. She went
to one when I don't know what, um,

102
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,080
I don't remember crying or being scared.

103
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:47,000
I just know that we were watching
cartoons, you know, American cartoons.

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,780
That's how you remember.
And then they caught us.

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,040
We went back again and they cut it again
in another car and we got separated

106
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:02,060
again. But this time we were held for
a longer time. And I remember my aunt,

107
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:05,840
when she saw us a Mexico, she said,
ha, they caught you guys again.

108
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,990
Just jokingly. Wow. But the
third time was like my add.

109
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,530
And my mom came over this crazy
idea because we have brothers. No,

110
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,470
we had cousins in Sunny California.
And my mom said,

111
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:26,210
you know, why don't we just borrow
their passports, you know, to cross.

112
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,110
And, and I, I don't remember this,
you know, I just found out recently,

113
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:34,640
that's what happened. My brother
told me, my little young brother, um,

114
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,860
we dressed him up like a little
girl, like a fall lawn, little girl.

115
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,810
Um, because we had like three
passports and two were boys.

116
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:49,811
One was girl and we took straws
to guests and my mom and my aunt,

117
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,240
they forced my little
brother to be a little girl.

118
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,590
How did it make him look like a girl?

119
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,980
They just hit my little girl for two
weeks just to play around, you know,

120
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,280
they give them a fake name and so and
so, and he was playing, you know, dance.

121
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,990
He know why Noah, you know,
dancing, getting ready,

122
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:09,470
playing with the Little Barbie dolls.
And so he was preparing,

123
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,090
preparing broker dinero bro. Wow. Getting
rid of it for that row of his life.

124
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,770
Wow. How old was he? He was
two, at least two or three.

125
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,604
Manual young.

126
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,293
Wow.

127
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,470
Though we crossed and we
made it all the way and um,

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,310
I remember that, um, some
of the car picked us up.

129
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,540
We jumped into another car right away
and then we jumped into another car and

130
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,300
then that car drove us to
come to southern California.

131
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,810
We were like in Compton somewhere.
And Carson,

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,160
we're in a house that had the, it
was like, it was funny when the car,

133
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,620
it was like a hub for illegal immigrants.
Like everybody,

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,250
they will go in different places. Okay.
Hawaii, you're going to go to St Louis,

135
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,950
this guy, you're going to go to San
Diego, the lady, her three kids,

136
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:05,430
they're going to go to Boyle heights
because that's where the father is.

137
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,630
So that we ended up Guerra,
Boyle heights and um,

138
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,260
didn't speak no English at all.
But um,

139
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,690
I picked up English right away,
you know,

140
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,410
cause you're little like
watching bionic woman and Shit.

141
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,460
$6 million man.
Incredible hog to say hazard.

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,420
So you basically picked it up
from TV? Yeah, we'll them dukes,

143
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,120
but like what kind of,
what kind of like lessons did you take?

144
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,350
Lessons were in English
or none. Zero. When I was,

145
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
when I was in elementary school,
it was different from now.

146
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:45,260
There was no like separating these kids
who don't speak Spanish and put him in

147
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:50,100
an English as a second language class.
I started, I started, I'm kindergarten,

148
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,150
so, so you just picked it up?
I picked it up. The teacher,

149
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,190
the teacher never spoke Spanish to us.
She never said I'm okay. Hawaiian Europe,

150
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,670
you know what apple is? That
it wasn't nothing like that.
It was, um, it was like,

151
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,010
I don't got time for you. You,
you're going to pick it up or not.

152
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,130
Do you think it was because you were,
you were so young,

153
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,640
your brain could pick up
another language really quickly.

154
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,590
Isn't that what they say?
Like young people,

155
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,480
their brains pick up languages quicker.
I think I picked it up really fast,

156
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,430
but to my pronunciation,
we're not there.

157
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,970
Like I didn't know how to stay Baiada
and ain't going to say [inaudible] that

158
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:24,990
kind of makes sense,
right?

159
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:29,490
That a part of your brain would really
develop and make it real easy to learn a

160
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:33,060
language when it's real young, you
know, like, okay, how do I say this?

161
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,210
What do I you like give more of a
desperation for figuring it out.

162
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,620
But I bet you a little kid that comes
from another country like you did. Well,

163
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:43,500
you're a perfect example. You
learn from TV. That's crazy.

164
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,350
So you learned from just talking to
people that are around you and television,

165
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,700
television. Nobody is saying this
is how you say this is a pronoun.

166
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:57,300
This is a noun. This is a verb. No telling
you any of that. Nobody told me that,

167
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,670
but later I had a cousin who
lived there at Santa Paula and um,

168
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,470
she taught me that stuff. Like,
this is what you're saying,

169
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:10,100
this word [inaudible] we're playing,
we'll play that school together. Yeah.

170
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,900
Or she'll give me assignments and we
were just, she pretends to be a teacher.

171
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:14,670
And then I'll read.
