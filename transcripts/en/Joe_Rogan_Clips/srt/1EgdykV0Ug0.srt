1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,070
When it comes to meat.
Um,

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,660
do you guys prefer a grass
fed beef or do you like, uh,

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:07,563
corn fed?

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,160
Because I had this discussion with Tony
and he was telling me that he actually

5
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:15,470
liked corn fed beef. He's
like, it's a fattier. There's,

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,360
there's two schools of thought and then
there's two schools of what is quality

7
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:21,400
beef,
right?

8
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,360
So one school will say,
yeah,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,690
quality beef is organic animal
pasture raised eating grass.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,130
The flavor is different.
It's not as tender,

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,110
but it is high quality beef.
Okay. Then the other of course is,

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,920
you know, a cow, USDA
prime cracked corn fed,

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,330
incredible marbling,
ridiculous fat content,

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,970
restricted motion.
Uh,

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,320
I'd say a lesser quality beef.
Okay. Then then the other,

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,140
but they all start eating wise.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,690
All pastored at first eating wise,
you know,

18
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,340
grandma pat pound for pound,

19
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,650
the corn fed steak will be more delicious.
Okay.

20
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,660
For some people. And then for
some people the other one will be,

21
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,400
and my,
my mind,

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,940
the grass fed organic pasture beef with
it's different flavor for me as a higher

23
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:34,030
quality animal. I, I prefer that taste
correct. I feel it's a Richard taste.

24
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:38,170
It's a denser, darker meat. Iron
taste. Yeah. I just like it better.

25
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,930
And I do like a corn fed steak.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,900
I do like and the general public,

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,960
the steak eating public that come to
restaurants and counter more corn fed beef

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,141
that and they,

29
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:58,141
their first judge of character to the
quality of that meat is tendering.

30
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,000
It's tenderness. It's marble.
It's not tender. It's not tender.

31
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,010
That's the reoccurring thing
that we fight with every day job.

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,060
While they're juicy and tender to
see to a 16 ounce fog walk tender.

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,770
I know. I mean, what are they looking for?

34
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,610
Can teeth work but we
get to take sends back.

35
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:23,250
It'll be because yeah, it's
tough. Yeah. Oh. Dot. Exactly.

36
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:23,930
It's not advice.

37
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,300
You usually go to this steak house and
it's two more tender because you're

38
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:31,570
bringing your serving of grassroots.
Sorry, I grass fed or grass fed steak. Uh,

39
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,130
that's not as marbled as it's
not organic. Well, it's an,

40
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,160
it's an oral that healthy, but you can
also have set up great valley. It's like,

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,040
it's like the natural wine versus
conventional wine fight. Right.

42
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,560
That we're having, you know? Yeah. But
it's also, we're calling it binary now.

43
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,010
It's like it's only corn
or it's only grass. No,

44
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,820
I think the solution is maybe a little
bit of a corn, a little bit of barley,

45
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:58,770
but mostly grass fed, you know, a brief
finish and like quality grains, why not?

46
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,090
And then there's a whole other point,
like, I'd like to raise giant feedlots.

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,520
I like to sell beef,
uh,

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,560
in my restaurant that comes from
very close to my restaurant.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,000
You know, when we opened Joe beef at
the beginning, when that first book,

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,980
the first book was written, uh,
beef was a problem back then.

51
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,860
You know, local beef was kind
of difficult. And you know,

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,390
we were buying beef from
larger wholesalers and we,

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,930
if we didn't know how to read
the barcodes on the boxes,

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,540
they would say it was Canadian beef.
But it might not beef,

55
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,400
it might be north northern USA beef.

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,590
But we didn't know because only a
professional could read the Barcode.

57
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,020
But they were saying it was Canadian.

58
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,960
But one day I had a professional come
into the restaurant and he said, no,

59
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,390
actually this beef is,
yeah, from a company with

60
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,180
investiture is in Canada, but this
is from Western Australia. And I say,

61
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:57,181
I don't want to serve anything in my
restaurant from Western Australia.

62
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,560
That's super far. Like I'd like, you know,

63
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,220
this is like remove beef from the
menu or seek alternatives. Uh,

64
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,430
but it's a business that's complex
because there's pastures and feed lots

65
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,090
slaughterhouse and packers. Right.
And, and it's not like a, you,

66
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,003
we have lambs,

67
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,390
got a baby lamb that come from the
parents lamb and then they farm,

68
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,880
they raised the lamb and they bring
it to the slaughter house themselves.

69
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:29,080
And then we get a lamb. Beef is like
you can get, it's like tracing bourbons,

70
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,370
you know, it's like trading and
brokerage and stuff and we're not,

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,370
it's the most sketchy
item on a restaurant menu.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,810
Like I know that I bought land from
you and I know I bought rabbit from,

73
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,650
you know,

74
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,910
Beatrice and I know I got go cheese from
this family and all of the products in

75
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,660
my restaurant.

76
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,660
I know exactly the farm and the farmer
beef is always dicey because beef always

77
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:59,620
goes to the packer. Beef always goes to
the distributor but fought, you know,

78
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:00,454
to,

79
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,320
and the general public only really
eats two cuts of beef in restaurants,

80
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:09,310
you know, three cuts, the tenderloin that
the, what do you call it, an English,

81
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,910
then I'll put a coat, you know,
the loans. The loans, right.

82
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:16,150
That's what people leave the
hamburgers beefs or not that, you know,

83
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,080
there's two big humps and there's two
big shoulders and there's a lot of brays.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,090
So, you know, it's a,
it's difficult. This is,

85
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,880
we see that a documentary on steak. Yeah.
We're in it. We were in, it's right. Yeah.

86
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,863
You were in it.

87
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,240
What did you think of that and then
their conclusions and what was the

88
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,770
conclusion?
Well,

89
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,770
just basically we're saying to Peter
Luger steak house in Brooklyn is a greater

90
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:44,650
stake in the world. Da Prime
Corn Fed for taste. Maybe.

91
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,060
It's good. It's good restaurant.
Good. Good story. Good
history. Great restaurant.

92
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,980
I ate there just a few months ago. It was
very good. Yeah. Very good. Yeah. But, um,

93
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,770
but again, it's a subjective thing, right?

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
The flavor in terms of like what you
actually look for and they as they were

95
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:05,540
talking about like your customers saying
they're accustomed to a certain type of

96
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:09,080
meat. Like they were saying that their
customers are accustomed to this.

97
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,680
They're not interested in grasp at
anything. But I understand that, you know,

98
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,200
they've been doing that for a long time
and you're hitting that beef that way

99
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,200
and I don't think they should change
ever. Not based on anything. Right. Well,

100
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,810
it's a great place. We get
consistency. I mean, you go there,

101
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,110
you get this fantastic steak.
It's, I mean it's so old world.

102
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,120
He too and you get in there
that, I mean, how long has,

103
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:28,810
Peter Luger has been around
for cod forever. Forever. Yeah.

104
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,180
It's 120 years or something.
Something insane like that.

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,190
And they get the moisturizers like that.
In my trial,

106
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,480
I was very old steak restaurant.

107
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:38,800
Moisture's is a famous restaurant
in Montreal and they, you know,

108
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,990
they do have their beef program and they
should not change because there's new

109
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:46,790
conversations happening. He
knows what he's doing. Lenny
lighter and he should do,

110
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,080
you know,
keep on doing that.
