1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,830
Her low freak bitches. Yeah. Steven
Crowder wanted to sue me too.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,000
Why do you want to tell you he wanted to
sue me and we were on the same network

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,800
for a while on Youtube and it was
called poly pop. And the guy that was,

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,700
uh, like my assigned, I forget
what the position is called,

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:22,050
the fucking facilitator or
whatever the fuck he had,

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:26,310
the same one as I did. And
he told me, you know, uh,

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,790
that video you made about Steven
Crowder and that, that shit,

8
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,490
cause he got in a fight with some
union guy on footage and he was like,

9
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,940
I was attacked by this union thug.
And I looked at him,

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,830
I looked at the footage and I'm like,
wait a minute,

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,840
this guy gets up from the ground.
He's facing away from you.

12
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,470
It looked like someone pushed him from
behind because you see the whole video.

13
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,470
Yeah, the beginning of it. The
guy threw a punch at him. Well,

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,410
the guy was on the fucking ground.
Uh, one point. Yeah. Like, but he's,

15
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:54,600
he,

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,900
you don't really see what happens with
them when you see the guy threw a punch

17
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,190
at him first. I'm very familiar with the
video. I don't know. I don't, I don't,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,540
I looked at it, I know the
guys in his face. Can we,

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,700
can we maybe see the guys in his face?

20
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:09,000
The guy comes close to him to get into
some sort of a grappling situation with a

21
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,790
guy like physically manhandled
them. I right hold, hold on.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,950
This is on Crowder's channel.
I want to see the,

23
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:16,850
there's like an unedited
version of this somewhere,

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,220
but you could see the full of
altercation when it does happen.

25
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:24,630
Let's take a leave it on Crowder's
channel. Go scroll ahead a little bit.

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,520
I want to get to a,
I'll tell you what.

27
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,940
That's the guy that's the guy that
gets the guy hits him. Oh wait.

28
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,890
It's the guys tell him to back the fuck
up. So he puts his hands and hold on.

29
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,730
And that, that's the guy that fights and
right there, the guy with the mustache,

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,380
which guy? The mustache dude. And
you see this guy. Okay. You see that?

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,460
Like we don't, there's like a
missing piece of footage there,

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,690
but in the footage I saw the,
you don't see that guy attack him first.

33
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,710
You see that guy get up from being
on the ground on his stomach.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,540
I see what you're saying.
So something,

35
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,620
and so when I was thinking is through
the guy that it's Steven Crowder pushed

36
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:00,600
this guy. I don't know cause you don't,
there's no, there's no footage on there.

37
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:00,910
But I,

38
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,680
I surmised based on what I looked at
in the footage that this guy was maybe

39
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:08,460
pushed and then got up and then started
wailing on Crowder. Mm. Interesting.

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,040
And I put that out there and
here's the interesting thing.

41
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,970
He said he was going to sue me
for what I said about it. Uh,

42
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,150
he then later went to court and a judge
looked at the footage and kind of came

43
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,410
to the same conclusion I did and said,

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,320
I don't think that this went down the
way you're saying based on the footage.

45
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,154
I see.

46
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,390
He lost that court case and then he had
to drop any sort of idea of a lawsuit

47
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:33,510
against me because the judge had already
ruled that the tape was bullshit.

48
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,360
Didn't really show what
he thought it said Shit.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,420
This is also instances where I challenged
him to debates back in the day.

50
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,140
Not recently, but he, he
would never acknowledge me.

51
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:46,590
I mean at one time he did send his like
little brother after me. His brother?

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,870
Yeah. Like I don't know if it was his
younger brother, his older brother,

53
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:51,960
I think it was his little brother was
like, you're a fucking faggot or whatever.

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,610
I'm like,
why won't your brother debate me?

55
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,260
Because we were at the
time on the same network.

56
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,590
You're saying he's sent them
after you physically? No, no,
just on Twitter. Oh, okay.

57
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,970
You got to get specified.
Sorry.

58
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,030
He didn't get to David's looking at each
other outside of Barr. He didn't come.

59
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,490
He didn't come and try to
fucking fuck me up or anything.

60
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,430
He's just talking shit on Twitter.
Say Talk Shit on Twitter.

61
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,220
You share that Steven's brother. It was
okay. Yeah, it was Steven's brother. But,

62
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,110
but Stephen himself has never taught.
I made several videos about him.

63
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,940
Maybe not several like three. Mm.
Uh, but he's never confronted me.

64
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,110
Poly pop tried to get us to do a
debate at the time. He wouldn't do it.

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,520
That seems weird. It's weird because like,
he's mister like, I'm going to go, like,

66
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,220
he just patrolled Janky Burger
the other day, you know, it was,

67
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,700
I thought that was funny. His, his
impression of Janky Yoga is fucking fun.

68
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,481
It is pretty spot on.

69
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,840
The one that he did where he played
Anna and Jank back and forth.

70
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,350
I didn't see that. Oh, fuck it. Pull
it up. He'll let us use it. Look,

71
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,820
I like Steven Crowder. I do. I really do.
I think he's a good guy. I just, you know,

72
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:52,660
he's like, he's a little bit heavy on
the right wing. He gets a little silly,

73
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,200
but he does some funny shit like this.
And when he crashed genx thing,

74
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,500
like with this, the saddest thing was
how Jank was responding to it. Like he,

75
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:03,710
he didn't have any sense
of humor about it. Uh,

76
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,130
well Jank obviously takes himself
very seriously for some reason.

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,110
I didn't mean any. Do the research.
That's not totally correct.

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,970
We'll have it listed a Goc yes,
I agree with you.

79
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:21,110
Cenk so king much.
That's absolutely right.

80
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,050
When you use the f word,
you know it's real time.

81
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,980
So we have a bunch of people anyway,

82
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,950
you could see it online and he at one
point he's pouring bacon grease down his

83
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:34,090
mouth. I just thought it was funny. It
was pretty fun. It's, it's, look dude,

84
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:38,390
I reached out to be able to make fun
of yourself. I recently sat down, uh,

85
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,790
we did this SPEC.

86
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,510
We went and watched a bunch of young
Turks videos so we could put out this

87
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,390
special drunken peasants
versus the young Turks.

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,120
A video we shot about five hours of us
watching young Turks videos and just

89
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,900
tearing them apart. And one of the things
I noticed is what Jank we'll do and,

90
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,160
and watch for this, if you've
ever watching this shit, uh,

91
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,170
he'll have his panel say something
that's like super crazy left wing.

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,040
Like someone will say it, like animals,
say it or one of the Steven o or whatever,

93
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,770
whoever he's got on, then
make a wits, whatever.

94
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,770
They'll say something that's real far
left wing and then it'll cut to Janke and

95
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:18,011
Jank.

96
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:23,011
We'll have more of like a a moderate left
wing opinion and then it'll go back to

97
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:27,760
them and they'll immediately capitulate to
Jank like, oh yeah, Jank you're, you're,

98
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,031
you're,

99
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,090
what you're saying is way more sensible
than what I said a second ago and I just

100
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,490
saw that pattern recurring
over and over and over again.

101
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,550
So I don't know if that's like
by design or if they're just,

102
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:39,880
they feel like the need to capitulate
to him because there they'd be scared of

103
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,830
him or something, you know, or,

104
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,460
or what it was definitely a lot
of emotions going on there too.

105
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,660
There's a lot of emotion in the way they
describe things and some people I think

106
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,000
at least initially connected to that,

107
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,520
but then they see where
it gets problematic.

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,580
If you're dealing with any like really
serious issue and you want to debate just

109
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:01,010
the facts like and have your
ducks in a row. The wool,

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,960
the wool over my eyes was the,
the Harris debate of course.

111
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,390
I think most people exactly.

112
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:09,320
That was like the first like major
chink in the chank Ugur armor.

113
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,350
I never know how to
pronounce his first name.

114
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,300
So when you said it that way I was like,
thank you.

115
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,830
You kind of think it's been changing Cenk
in the Jank you've chink in the Jank.

116
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,850
Yeah, there we go. I think he's a
good guy. I like talking to him too.

117
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,020
I just think people handle certain types
of confrontation and disagreements. Um,

118
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,440
and they don't handle them
the best way they could.

119
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,730
And then those things escalate and they
compound and then it becomes who you are

120
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,210
and then you defending who you are and
then you're always trying to argue with

121
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:41,180
people about who you are and what you've
done. And like that's when you're gone.

122
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,670
Yeah. It's when you're over the
top. It's like we've done that,

123
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,150
we've done that and we've done
this. We've done that. Like, Hey,

124
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,840
you're talking about shit that's happening
in the world. That's all you're doing.

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,810
That's all any of us are
doing on anybody's doing it.

126
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,470
Unless you're out there digging
wells in the Congo with Justin wren,

127
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,170
what you're doing is
you're talking about shit.

128
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,290
So if you've got a bunch of people
listening to you talk about shit,

129
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,850
it's just talking about shit.

130
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,840
The end of the day you don't get any
extra points because more people are

131
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:12,560
listening or more people are watching.
Your point isn't more valid.

132
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,110
Your point still has to stand up
in the marketplace of ideas. Yeah,

133
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,750
and yours is just as valid as his
is just as valid as mine. It just,

134
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,880
if the delivery system is
a bigger delivery system,

135
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,580
it doesn't mean that like
everybody has to stop.

136
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,330
I'd take you into account because
you've had more success in this market.

137
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,540
That's a crazy way of looking at shit.
Sure.

138
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,610
And when him and Alex Jones battle back
and forth between who gets the most

139
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:42,040
viewers and who has the model like, Holy
Shit, this is ridiculous. Like what,

140
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,800
when did you see when Alex went onto
the stage at south by southwest?

141
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:49,700
Is that what it was south by southwest? I
think so. Yeah, last year. It's hilarious.

142
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,450
Oh yeah, that was, that was one of the
greatest, uh, uh, trollings of all time.

143
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,360
But a Jen got so mad. I was furious
and a yellow and then that little,

144
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:00,920
they oppose Saudi Arabia.
A little weasel. Uh,

145
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,520
Jimmy Dore Spitting on,
that's so unfortunate.

146
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:06,410
And Alex Jones did,
you know,

147
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,980
it's unfortunate that Guy Jimmy
Dore does some good stuff. Yeah.

148
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,220
We've seen some of his stuff too.

149
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:13,010
If this is a really good to put
some really good videos up, but he,

150
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,110
he's done some really good work.
Yeah, I can't, people aren't perfect.

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,070
I don't really care for him. But um, but,

152
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,110
but you recognize that some of
the stuff's really good, right?

153
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,160
I've never seen the stuff that's good. And
maybe, maybe that, maybe it's out there.

154
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,320
I haven't seen it. I've seen him make
some good points. Very good points. Uh,

155
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,720
you know, I, he when he was
covering the whole Milo thing,

156
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,721
he played a very deceptive version of the
Milo clip and he credited us basically

157
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:42,950
as a podcast and well that's talked
about us is like we're doing this podcast

158
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:46,490
from a basement somewhere or something.
Meanwhile, isn't it funny that uh,

159
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,790
podcasts like yours, which gets hundreds
of thousands of downloads, I'm sure,

160
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,480
right? Like you, if, if
it was more than that,

161
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,080
he would have to say the
name of the podcast. Right.

162
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,210
Like if it was he was on
the Adam Carolla show,

163
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,360
he would say the Adam Carolla
show. Sure. Cause it's yours.

164
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,640
Even though he knows what it's like,

165
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,680
like I'm not going to give
these guys credit. And you know,

166
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,790
a lot of the media did
that to us. I was, I was a,

167
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,210
there was like transcripts of the
Milo episode where it was like,

168
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,800
and then unknown host said
this, it's like, fuck you,

169
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,270
I'm not in a bunker whites.
You guys can't just look it up.

170
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Aren't you supposed to
be like journalists?

171
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,250
Can't you figure out what
the fuck the podcast was?

172
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:27,450
And I saw ones that
attributed, um, stuff to me,

173
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,620
but then had stuff of yours
where they didn't even,

174
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,510
I didn't even know that
you guys had them on.

175
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:37,410
I thought that all the shit was coming
from my podcast because I got a text

176
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,680
message from my friend Chris
Mcguire informing me of all of it.

177
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,680
And so I went and I said, well,
this isn't even my podcast.

178
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,740
And then I realized like, oh,
he was on your podcast too.

179
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,950
And they combined the two different
things. I even saw people say like,

180
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:54,030
he was on Joe Rogan's drunken
peasants podcast. It's like,

181
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,040
wow, people are supposed to trust
you for fucking information.

182
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,180
You're supposed to be a
fucking credible source.

183
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:05,130
You can't even get this basic shit. Right.
So the media is a fucking joke. Well,

184
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,810
the media now is,
it's total fucking joke.

185
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:11,450
There's like a few places we
can still trust like wire. Um,

186
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm hoping you around the answer to that.
Cause you know what?

187
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:16,860
People come to me all the
time and they're like, Tj,

188
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:19,590
what news media outlet do you
trust? I'm like, none of them.

189
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,020
I don't trust a single
God damn fucking thing.

190
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,900
Any of these institutions have to
say whatever Megan Kelly has to say.

191
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:29,580
I'm lessening Megan. I'm in Megan. You're
right about everything. Make it a lot.

192
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,650
That's what I like. Like
ice princesses. Yeah.

193
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,920
I don't know why I like a main,
like Amina mean and smart. Really?

194
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,180
Not really. No. I'm like, no,

195
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,130
but I'm fascinated by people who must.

196
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:53,830
Yeah.
