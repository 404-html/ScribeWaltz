1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,740
Kids died a lot.
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:06,240
Then Dad died from injury and sickness
and a lot of people died from sickness,

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,390
you know,
no vaccines when you just said the mercy.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,240
And then also it's the
beginning of agriculture.

5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:15,680
So all these diseases are emerging that
we don't have immune systems for it

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,070
because they're being, they're being
jumped from like they're there,

7
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:20,970
they're jumping from pigs to people.

8
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:23,520
They're jumping from
chickens and birds to people.

9
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:26,910
That's where the source of most of
these pandemic diseases come from.

10
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:28,680
It comes from large scale agriculture.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,730
Those funky pigs all tucked
together in these little cages.

12
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,930
That doesn't come for free.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,630
Like there's some demons are being brewed
in that mix. Yeah. Like this, this,

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,140
what was this? What was the
source of, um, the Spanish flu,

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,290
which I think was the most
deadly epidemic in u s history.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, is that right? It was international
to, was international for sure.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,400
I think for sure it was the most
deadly epidemic in the u s yeah.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,980
But I think he came,
I don't think it came from Spain.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,420
I think I want to say it came
from somewhere around Virginia.

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,220
Does that bullshit. This is going
to take time probably in New Jersey.

21
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,490
I feel like it came from
some sort of farm situation.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,360
I don't know why I feel like,

23
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:21,390
I'm guessing that surprised it's not
more of that now because you see some of

24
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,040
these like pig farms and they have links.
There are lakes of waste.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,520
If you seen the drone footage, is that
what we're talking about? Oh my God.

26
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,580
Some guy fluid, you know, cause
they have these ag gag laws,

27
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:37,140
which apparently one of them just got
shot down a, somebody sent me an email

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:43,080
that some, maybe it was Idaho
or Iowa, one of those places.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,630
One was I states that uh,
the uh,

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,460
ag gag laws got shutdown.
The AG gag laws are safe.

31
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,630
You are working in a slaughterhouse
when you saw horrific conditions,

32
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,320
you got your cell phone out, you
filmed it, you could get prosecuted,

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,960
you would go to jail,
you could be sued because if walking,

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,880
all those documentaries that came out.
Well it's the,

35
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,310
I think those ag gag laws existed as soon
as they figured out that people could

36
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:12,330
film thing. You know, because a few people
released videos of her and it looked,

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,840
those ag gag laws kept,
you know,

38
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:20,130
kept people from talking about a
lot of creepy shit like this video.

39
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,480
If you see this video,

40
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:25,290
this guy decided since no one's
going to give him access to film,

41
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,140
the place openly,
she's gonna fly over it.

42
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:32,430
So he flew over with a drone Spanish
flu thing. Okay. For many years,

43
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:36,360
medical historians and epidemiologists
hypothesize that the outbreak could have

44
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:41,361
started in a British army
base in [inaudible] France
or at Fort Riley in Kansas

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,910
where the first American cases of the
new strain of flu were recorded in March

46
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,430
of 1918 more recently,

47
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:54,060
experts have experts have
proposed a third hypothesis.

48
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:59,061
The Spanish flu originated somewhere in
northern China in late 1917 and swiftly

49
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,060
move to eastern Europe within
140,000 Chinese laborers and,

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:04,750
uh,

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,730
the French and British
governments recruited to
perform manual labor to free up

52
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:13,540
the troops for war time duty. Wow.
Yeah. I think more people died of that.

53
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,480
Then they die then died
in world war one fifth.

54
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,560
So 50 million people were
killed because of this damn,

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,190
whoa.
Just think about courses.

56
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,970
A 50 million people looking at
reclaiming. Look at this. It says,

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,060
claiming more lives in a single year than
either the first world war or the four

58
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,440
year long black death,

59
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:40,030
bubonic plague outbreak that swept
Europe and Asia in the Middle Ages.

60
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,620
And this is one that, for whatever
reason, people talk about the plague.

61
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,990
They talk about the bubonic
plague. Look, everyone's heard of,

62
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,700
but no one talks about the Spanish
flu. Like that's a rare, it's not.

63
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,070
It doesn't get brought up that often.
If you see this number,

64
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,230
this number of people die, 50
million people in a year, in a year.

65
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,680
Man. People talk about how bad
that we're saying is right now,

66
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:03,550
but that's not what they're saying.

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,060
They're saying that killed more lives
in a single year than either the first

68
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:11,290
world war or the four year long
black death may have killed,

69
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,150
and that he may have kept one third
of the population was sick with it.

70
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:17,050
At least they didn't all die.
God Damn.
