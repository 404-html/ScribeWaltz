1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,200
I left before it ended. I
was at a friend's party and
went to a Superbowl party.

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:08,260
It was fun. The lowest viewed one in the
last 10 years. Are you serious? Yeah,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,510
but not by a lot,
but yeah,

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,510
it's cause they knew that that handsome
man was going to take your shirt off.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,330
Oh God. His name Adam Levine.
That's beautiful. Mass.

6
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:19,130
No nipples or everyone's time as Nicholas.
Now he has nice Brown nipples,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,890
but then we're like Janet Jackson,
like the big crazy.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,830
He loved shows, nipples.
Both. This is bullshit. Sexist
bullshit. And his Dick Route.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,850
This is, oh my God. He had dick
route showing God is bullshit.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,500
He just wanted everybody know he's got
beautiful tattoos and a fairly good body.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah. He does a lot of squats though.
Right? That's what's interesting.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,650
He's around like the greatest super
athletes in the known universe. Actually.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,500
Looks pretty good right there. Oh,
for today he was, it was pretty good.

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,190
Those random for today was,
I mean,

15
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:57,930
he's not always around the greatest super
athletes, right? No, no. Yeah, yeah. Um,

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,030
yeah. It looks pretty good. He
looks like he's in good shape.

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,660
Happy to take your shirt off with
his California stomach tattoo.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,830
But the point being
that guys around freaks,

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,090
he's around six foot, five, 290 pounds,

20
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:15,000
super athletes who could
jump over his fucking head.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,950
They literally could run through a
hundred of him like they were paper walls,

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,560
just raw.
That's what he's around.

23
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,560
He's around the fucking super bowl,

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,630
the greatest physical specimens
in the known universe.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,690
And he takes his shirt off
like, hey bitches, I'm here too.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,430
They had an event set up over the weekend.
Uh, so people can test their 40 speed,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,180
uh, up against other NFL times, whatever
they had. Like, oh, that's hilarious.

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,540
Hussein bolt did it and it's in his
shoes. They said street shoes, whatever.

29
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:49,230
But he didn't have cleats on. He
tied the fastest ever. NFL 40.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,090
He's probably dealing with a full stomach.

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,510
He probably just eight track a
couple of beers. Fuck it. I'll,

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,100
I'll show these bitches.
What's up? Yeah, it's just,

33
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:03,760
it was weird, like watched it on TV. Do
with a shirt off, you know, like, oh,

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,920
this is a different thing now. Now,
this is like a sexy concert for,

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,793
it was like a football.

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,190
That's what I think he's getting shit
for it because he didn't need to take a

37
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:12,300
shirt off. Right. You know,

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,600
he had his shirt on and then like after
it is second songs, like you know what,

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,930
let's get sexy and this Superbowl
bowl. No, no. But I mean,

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,860
why else would he take off this shirt?
I mean, at least make it a Hashtag.

41
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:27,000
Hashtag sexy in the Superbowl.
It's getting sexy up in this bitch.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,190
Well, he's a sexy man. Can't, don't be
hating. Beautiful Man. Yeah, I mean, but,

43
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,720
but that's the whole thing. You're,
you're audience is a bunch of guys.

44
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,650
You know my jacket on, I'm sorry with Jack
and on. Well, it was cold out at first,

45
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,650
but then he started to
warm up a sweat cow.

46
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,290
Never trust white men with Nicholas's.
That's my message now.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,560
He's got the little necklaces and the
bracelets for the Falcons to land on.

48
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,430
Wait a minute.
Those are spiritual necklaces.

49
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,600
If you have wooden beads for whatever
reason that makes you spiritual or gold.

50
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,180
I can't even tell you allowed to wear
wooden deck assists cause like people go,

51
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,110
oh, you're like really endorse
organic stuff. He really into macro,

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,920
but that's gold is gold.

53
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,160
That's like the other one was just weird
lighting. I can, I can't wear necklaces,

54
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,990
man. It, it bugs me. Did you ever
wear necklaces? Necklaces? Sure. Yeah.

55
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,010
It's never been a staple, but it's
a, it's a, it's a weird thing if,

56
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,390
first of all, if it's, if it's big
enough, it's like this target, right?

57
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,720
If you have like a bail gold necklace,
people want to steal it. All right.

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,890
There's a lot of necklace
snatchers out there, Brian.

59
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:35,020
I don't know if you know that. Yeah.
But then the other thing is like,

60
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,854
what are you doing?

61
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,500
What are you doing with that big
old shiny thing around your neck?

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,131
What are you doing?

63
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:42,970
What do you a chick remember in the
nineties chokers worry thing and I used to

64
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:46,090
wear a choker. How gross
is that? Like a dog choker?

65
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,740
It's just a really tight
necklace. Yeah. Hemp necklaces.

66
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,120
Oh yeah, those were the little bead. The
bead at the bottom. The beads critical.

67
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,440
Got To have the bead. Yeah, multi
colored bead thinking. Look, your cool.

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,671
Yeah,

69
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:05,671
like it's weird like with like some guys
will wear like little anklets with like

70
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:09,310
beads. Can they tie them off and they'll
walk around barefoot and you're like,

71
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:13,450
okay, hmm. What's kind of like that?
Look that that you're not shop.

72
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,160
Look where you have like the really tight,

73
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,130
like your pants to go up
so you can see your socks.

74
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,400
You know you show a little leg. You
know why they do that? Why sneakers?

75
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,570
Those gods show off the sneakers up
full snake. That's what shop told me.

76
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,780
Do you do that Jeremy? That's what my,
my pants have that actually for you.

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,560
That's how the pants. Ah, that's
funny. That's how the pants are made.

78
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,880
That's why you don't buy those pants,
man. That then you're not buying pants.

79
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,490
Where do you ladies store? Do
you buy? Do you buy it at coach?

80
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,850
Do you buy those pants and Ky.
Dot Count. Gosh, that's hilarious.

81
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,660
You don't do that too. You know
how dare you? How dare you.

82
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,990
I'm pair of a very comfortable
underarmor running shoes on.

83
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,300
How are those trouble cause
your shoes the other day? Um,

84
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,640
they're a little too tight for me. Okay.
They live, they bind my feet a tad bit.

85
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:04,390
When I got to the store, I
had to swap them out for a,
I had a pair of a converse.

86
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,180
All Stars would, you might
go to, you got Yeezys right.

87
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,880
Jamie gave me a pair of Yeezys about
a year ago and he just wore him.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,410
Talk to him. You just keeping
them on ice dead socked him.

89
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:17,110
Is that what's called that
stock dead stock. Dead stock.
