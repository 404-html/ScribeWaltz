1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,790
The Republican's and hate
for Trump in particular,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:07,791
ramps up and that they're really worried
that there'll be some sort of a violent

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,700
outbreak between the right and the left
and that this could actually really

4
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:16,500
happen. Man, it's not impossible.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
It's not impossible that at least battles
could break out because people are

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,300
fucking polarized, Matt. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,370
But I think what's interesting to
me is that more and more people,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,670
it seems like,
at least from my perspective on the right,

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,080
are now coming out against Trump.
It seems more common, more common,

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,040
especially with this government shutdown
people like what the fuck? You know,

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,800
there's so many videos of people going,
what are you talking about?

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:44,370
What this wall like? We need money.
Like people, it's government people.

13
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:47,550
A lot of them are living check to check.
Yeah. You're shutting down their pit.

14
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,500
This is the only way you
can negotiate this wall.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,210
Does the only way you can fund this
wall. This is crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,320
I mean it's, I don't know. I mean,
people always say the government sucks.

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:01,950
Fucking shut it down and then it shuts
down. Everybody gets mad. You know? It's,

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,880
it's makes an argument that the
government should be doing less things.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,320
This is the real argument.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,740
The argument is some of those
things that the government does.

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,270
Why does the government have to do
it? Why can't it be privatized? Why,

22
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,400
why can't it become a business?

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,390
It would probably run better if some
of those things we're not run by the

24
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,391
government like airport security or like
road maintenance or like a lot of other

25
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:31,710
things like don't have the government
do it, have private contractors do it.

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,770
Cause I'm really strong standards and,

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,840
and strong competition and uh,

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,420
John Stossel actually has
a video about it right now.

29
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,430
Um, it's on his Twitter
page. It's a long video.

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,200
But explaining how one of the things
people are realizing from this government

31
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,250
shutdown is that the government does a
lot of things that they don't have to do.

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,420
It would be probably better for
everybody if some of these things were

33
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,920
streamlined. Some of these things
were done by the private sector.

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,440
I don't think that's a bad idea.

35
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,410
I think there's a lot of things that
could be done better if there was

36
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:14,460
competition as soon as the government
controls certain businesses. I mean,

37
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:17,860
maybe they do it really well and maybe
they don't. You know, I think the,

38
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,750
I think there's certain things that
were, socialism works really well. Like,

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,600
here's one fire department.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,390
Fucking you gotta pay
for the Fire Department.

41
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:30,960
Everybody wants to fund the
fire department. Don't you
cut the fire budget, man,

42
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:34,890
what if my granny house
and we once fire man,

43
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:38,970
we gotta pay for the Fire Department. Pay
For that shit. Pay for the police. Yup.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,180
Pay. And everybody says
pay you shouldn't be rich.

45
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,360
People only get cops and poor people
don't get comps. That's crazy.

46
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:47,070
Everyone would say that's
crazy. Yeah. Right.

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,390
Well why is that not the case with
education to them? Well, right.

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,360
Don't you want people to learn things?
Like when,

49
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,370
when did education becomes such a
big business? Why is that a business?

50
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,300
It should be our goal as patriots,
right? To make less losers,

51
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,070
more happy, successful people. More
aware people, more educated people,

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,001
you know.

53
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:10,810
But instead it's like subsidized by
the government and that makes it even

54
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,410
weirder. And then you have student
loans you can't escape. Yeah.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,280
A lot of that is pretty bizarre. It's
bizarre is fuck, it should be free.

56
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,110
But there's also like
there's another like a lot,

57
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,550
some people don't want to do anything.

58
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,700
They does true want to be
alive and they just, they just,

59
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,290
they don't want to contribute and really
have any sort of life and they have no

60
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,011
desire for that.

61
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,880
And there's generation and generation
and generation of them dead is true.

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,940
But what if you ever,

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,660
do you ever look at universal
basic income? It's a weird idea.

64
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,910
I flatly rejected it when I first heard
it. We have it. No, we don't have it.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,650
They've tried it out
in a couple of places,

66
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,710
but I don't think it's really worked
out that well. But the idea behind it,

67
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,490
I'm having a guy who comes on soon,
his name is Andrew Yang,

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,010
is a proponent of universal basic income.

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,890
And the idea is you give people
x amount of dollars per month,

70
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,920
whether it's $1,000 per month and
everybody gets it no matter what.

71
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,980
And by doing that,

72
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,790
you take care of all of
the burden of survival.

73
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,770
Like we take care of everyone in the
civilization. Everyone gets food,

74
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,850
everyone gets shelter.

75
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,420
So that eliminates a lot of crime and
a lot of strife just right away, right?

76
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,570
Questions more laid back.
Where's all that money come from?

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,150
There's $1,000 a month.

78
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,070
308 million. Is that what it was? Plus,

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,340
you know, that was 2010 it's
probably more now let's slate.

80
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,010
Let's say three 20 that is a lot of money.

81
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,950
320 million thousand.

82
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,930
So that's 320 billion.
Gee, isn't that what it is?

83
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,730
I have no clue. And the 320 billion
a month when that would be the,

84
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,840
if you gave a thousand people $1 million,
isn't that what it would be?

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,730
A thousand million is a billion,
right? Just to it in the calculator,

86
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:02,350
Bro. Don't do it in your head. A thousand
a million. Yeah. So that's right.

87
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:06,810
So it must be so that that's so
much money. So three. So the,

88
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,510
the wall, like him talking about building
a wall, isn't he asking for 5 billion?

89
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,840
Five Dale. Okay. It's not that
much, I don't think. Well,

90
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,500
that's to build a wall once.
This is every month,

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,080
you would need all those billions.

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,990
That's all a lot of fucking Chadha.

93
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,050
And so that means everybody would
have their basic needs met. Yes.

94
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,300
Everybody get 1000 bucks
where that money comes from.

95
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,040
This is what I need to
talk to this guy about.

96
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,040
Obviously I'm not a mathematician
or any sort of an economist,

97
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,190
so I don't have any idea what they've,
how they feel like they can do that.
