1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
To, to understand if we can innovate
off of it. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Um,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,510
what did you think when they found that?
Um,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,100
Flores man on in Indonesia?
It's amazing. I like,

4
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,990
I'm not an anthropologist,
so you know,

5
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,840
that's not quite been 100% that zed 100%
agreed upon because I've only seen kind

6
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:21,600
of headlines. I, I'd have to defer
to you guys. I think there was one,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,750
there was some scientists
that was disputing but,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,030
but essentially they were talking about
a three foot tall hobbit, like man,

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,810
kind of cave dwelling. Yeah.
That little person, yeah.

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:35,550
Existed alongside human beings as recently
as like 14,000 years ago. Right, right.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,290
Which is like what I, I think it's
completely believable. I mean they're,

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,310
the Khoisan people in the Sahara
desert are tiny, you know, there,

13
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:46,620
there are big like four
feet. Ah, and until the,

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,910
you might have to double check this,

15
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:50,430
but I believe until the 70s
people used to go and hunt them.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,293
Maybe it was earlier,

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,220
we just sixties or fifties but you could
go and hunt this primitive sized human

18
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:58,410
being as like a PA, you
know, as like a hunt,

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,190
like an old Englishman with
it's big mustache and his
musket would go hunt these

20
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,070
people. Whoa. And now we have
an understanding that, you know,

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,720
there are people like you can't fucking
go and hunt them. But like what's to say?

22
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,990
There weren't tribes like that all over
the world that other people used to hunt

23
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,870
that drove to extinction.
Jesus Christ. Right.

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,150
What would say the name of it again? So
Jamie, you got it. You got Koi sanding.

25
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:25,650
Yeah. Let me see what these people
look like. They're, in my opinion,

26
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,220
they're beautiful. Like
you'll see what you think. But
they're, they're very small.

27
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,950
They're desert dwellers. You know, there's
not a lot of resources in the desert,

28
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:35,130
so you don't get huge. So they're
perfectly adapted to the desert life.

29
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,350
They really used to hunt them. Yeah. And
they look just like people. I mean you,

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,340
you'll have,
but they're still around.

31
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,790
Like these aren't an extinct race.
There's still there. Oh Wow. Yeah.

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,480
If you ever seen the gods must be crazy.
Yes. Yeah. It's like those people,

33
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,510
those were kind of taller, coy
sand, but those are Bushman.

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,560
So who are these people that used to
hunt these? Like I say, I kid you not.

35
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:05,220
It was like the old English explorer
would go and conquer Africa and,

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,390
and hunt these people. Like they were
an animal, you know? Fuck crazy. Right.

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,380
And this was until the 1970s that might
not be right. That sounds too recent,

38
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:16,950
doesn't it? Damn, that sounds horrific.
Yeah. You might need to check that.

39
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,590
But it was not as long ago as you'd think.
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:24,591
It was like very recently they were
still under under hunting can they're

41
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,350
people, Jesus Christ. Yeah. So that,

42
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,410
that's probably what happened to a lot
of the non homosapien human type people.

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,491
I would think so.

44
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:40,260
And even if it's not like for sport
it's for competition or resources or you

45
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,580
know what, any reason and that's,
that's human nature. Conquer. Yeah.

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,480
Fuck man, that is so dark. Right.

47
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,310
They would go and hunt small
people with a rifle. Yup. You know,

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,550
not there photos of people like
posing with the dead ones. Um, again,

49
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm not an anthropologist. I'm
not sure. Yeah, it's brutal.

50
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,463
Yeah.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,460
So what are the pockets of the world are
like mostly unexplored or could perhaps

52
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,140
contain some of these animals? South
America for sure. Central Africa for sure.

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,930
There's some very remote parts
of like Russian, Arctic, um,

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,140
Norwegian Arctic. Um, there's areas
in Asia that are still unexplored,

55
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:25,650
believe it or not, regardless
of their populace, there
really are deep, deep China.

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,330
There are some very unexplored areas.
Uh,

57
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,930
northern myin mar ecological hotspot,

58
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,240
nobody goes there very impenetrable.

59
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,010
I read something about sort of some part
of the world where they thought Tara

60
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,090
doctorals might still exist.
There's so many of those things.

61
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,120
I don't know that one specifically.
There's, especially doing what I do,

62
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,440
I hear them all the time. Right? Oh,

63
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:48,600
you got to go look for a big foots are
Taryn actos or whatever. Mamet's it's,

64
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,290
it could there be a large
reptile that perhaps flies? Sure.

65
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,060
It's possible. Is there a terra dactyl
as we know it, I highly, highly doubt it,

66
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,140
but a large reptile that can fly, it
would be a fucking trip they were around.

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,740
Right. So do you think it
would be something that we
don't know about? Like, yeah,

68
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,820
basically I think there's enough pieces
of this world that are unexplored that

69
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:14,020
there are still nega phonic
to be discovered. Not a
lot. Not a lot by any means.

70
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:17,350
And I might get ridiculed as I go back
to my scientific community for saying

71
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:17,531
this,

72
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:22,210
but my belief is there are these isolated
pockets where small populations of

73
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,590
Megafaun is still exist that we
don't know about. Whoa. Yeah. Well,

74
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:31,090
South America is, I mean, how much of
South America is actually populated?

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,480
I mean, you look at the size of the Amazon
jungle or something and it's, it's the,

76
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:39,580
sure there's, there's
communities and stuff, but not
that much. I mean, it's there.

77
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,990
Australia, you know, if you're not
on the coast, there's nothing, right?

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,860
There's all these huge chunks. Papa,
when you're Guinea, same thing.

79
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:49,100
Nobody goes up into the highlands there.
They just found a dog there. As you saw.

80
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,510
I mean,
there's crazy stuff.
