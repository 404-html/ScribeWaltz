1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,490
The joe rogan experience. I'm going to
go out on a limb. Yeah, she looks up.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,330
She looks good. I like it.
So, um, for 20, 20, I'll tell
you who's going to run. Okay.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,990
Bernie's going to run again.
He is. Yes. How can he do that?

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:16,260
1,000 different sites to who's
going to run? He'll be 78 years old.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,770
He's riding a fucking wave
though, man. Gh. I've been lifted.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm going to try to straighten my net.
Go.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,500
I tried to pull it back up into the snow
position. I got one of those things.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,480
It hangs from the door. I'm stretching
my neck. He's like Larry, Larry David,

9
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,910
right. It looks like Larry
David. Yeah. What about Oprah?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,460
Oprah is not running bullshit.
She's not wrong. She's going to run.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,250
I'm calling her right now. She'd not,
she's not wrong. She's running. Well,

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,830
that'd be fodder for us to laugh at
it for a long time. I don't know man.

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,960
She might win. No, she,
how about fucking NBC?

14
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:47,670
Whoever the Dork is that was running
the NBC Twitter that was saying our

15
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:51,300
president, like they about
Oprah. That, yeah, I'll know.

16
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,570
And Oprah gave that speech
that was at the Golden Globes.

17
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:58,860
She gave this big giant space and
everybody was like, she's got a vagina,

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,240
let her talk. And she, she's given
me listen, big powerful speech.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,060
Hollywood is so fucking insular.

20
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,030
They love sniffing their own farts
and stuck in their own dick. Wow.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,600
Clueless actress. Stacey Dash is
running for Congress in California.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,200
Wait a minute. Stacey dash is like a
Republican. She's like a harlot. Big Time.

23
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:21,060
She was on Fox News. Trump supporter.
Republican. Yeah, she was. Oh, clueless.

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,470
The movie they meant to Sarah. Yeah,
she's clueless. I read it wrong.

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,030
Maybe she is clueless to, but Stacey
dash is like super hardcore. Oh yeah.

26
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:34,170
Super Hardcore Republican Fox commentator
known for a controversial opinions.

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,670
So Oprah, Oprah. No, not
right now. I'm telling you.

28
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:44,880
I'm telling you the Edmund's going to
be the first man. The Rock not running.

29
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,030
Mark Zuckerberg wants to run, but he might
not run. Why don't you think he'll run?

30
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,420
Is He old enough? Zealand? He's 34
he's old enough. But I'd be like,

31
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,740
get in under the wire. How fucking
goofy is that guy, man? I mean, oh,

32
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:56,190
how goofy is he?
He's goofy show.

33
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,740
He showed the picture of him like
fucking feeding a lamb or some shit.

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,080
He did an okay to fetal lamb.
What's wrong with this person?

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,930
I'm anti lamb feeding. I'm taking a
strong stance on the Joe Rogan bottom one,

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,320
wants lambs to starve to death.
The secular talk podcast.

37
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,810
Um, yeah, Mark Zuckerberg,

38
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:16,110
he's been like doing this goofy Toro
where he goes to Iowa and pretends to eat

39
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:17,490
with regular people and he's like,

40
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:22,440
I spoke to a guy named Ted today
and he has a interesting story. Hmm.

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,560
I hate the pandering where they try to,
that's the thing,

42
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,560
like when they bring up the
personal stories and they're
like pretending to care

43
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,870
about some random dude and
Kentucky, it's like, fuck off.

44
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:33,150
Just tell me what your ideas are. You
don't have to do the fake empathy shit.

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,240
Right, right, right. Uh, so I
don't think he's going to run,

46
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,060
even though he wants to because
he'll get his ass handed to him.

47
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,730
Mark Cuban is another guy with a
giant ego who thinking about it,

48
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,600
but I don't think he'll end up doing it.
I don't think they want that scrutiny.

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,630
Like yeah, a lot of shit comes out. Yeah.

50
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:52,830
I mean think about who Trump was
preelection and Trump is now before the

51
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,300
election was kind of lovable.

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,480
He's like this lovable Egomaniac
Weirdo guy he had for the election.

53
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,500
Yeah.
Well you know,

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,450
let me take that back cause there's was
all that birth or shit that was pretty

55
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,070
wacky but pre birth or shit,
he was the guy who played the role of the,

56
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm the big boss. Corporate is
sky. Who was the guy with the,

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,020
I'm the duck date.
It was like a bigger than life character.

58
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:21,130
Large hair. Big fucking
name on the buildings. Gold,

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,030
gold lettering everywhere. Gold
bathroom, gold toilet paper.

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,200
Like he was just silly. Did he not know
that? Like there's such a thing as as,

61
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,080
what's the word I'm looking for?
Garish is that garrison.

62
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,870
I don't think he does know that well.
He's old man with old people.

63
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,960
That was like someone said it best and
it's one of my favorite quotes about

64
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:42,370
Trump that he is what a poor person
imagines. A rich person would be like.

65
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,860
That's a great point. Yeah, and he's a,

66
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,720
he's a dumb person's idea of a smart
person because he's very confident and he

67
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,630
most,
and like you say gold fucking everything.

68
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:56,800
It's almost like it's almost
like a wrappers or stuntin.

69
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,890
Oh yeah, I got my role as
bitch. Yeah, you got to Trump.

70
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,820
Is that Grill Paul Wall
style showing all your rings.

71
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,020
You're in front of your Lamborghini.

72
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:07,090
Bunch of girls shaking
their booty in front of you.

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,090
How did grills ever become a thing?
How did they not become a thing?

74
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,160
Why don't I have one?
That's a real question.

75
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,710
We were going to get what Paul wants.
People reached out to us.

76
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,830
We're going to hook us up. You could
actually maybe make grills popular.

77
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,380
I don't think so. I'm doing a
good job with fanny packs though.

78
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm telling you that. Oh,
sales are up. Sales are up.

79
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,270
I'm pretty sure fanny packs are back.
You know what?

80
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:29,110
I haven't given up on cell phone
holder. I saw the post. Yeah,

81
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,660
I saw those people gave up on that a
long time ago and they'll make fun of me.

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,700
But I'm like fuck you. It's coming
back in style and I'm rocking it.

83
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,740
Somebody had a very funny joke.
I forget who it was.

84
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:36,730
I wish we could give them credit,

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,360
but it was something along the lines
of that's the type of black guy that's

86
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:44,140
unthreading to white people type of black
guy that wears the cell phone holder

87
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,230
or the outside is buckle
clip cell phone holders.

88
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,710
Just don't have him weird around a cop
because they might think it's a gun.

89
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,630
That's right. Don't reach for it.
Don't reach for anything. Um, yeah.

90
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,340
The um, the grill thing, I dunno. Um,

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,380
I think a gold tooth
be kinda fly like one,

92
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,420
like maybe a Fang or Fang. Cause I
think that they think it shows status,

93
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:12,310
but in reality it shows in attempt to
hit higher status. You know what I mean?

94
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,060
Well, it's like that Jay z song, 99
problems, but a bitch ain't one. You know,

95
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,640
if you grew up with hose
holes and use Zap Atos,

96
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,520
you'd celebrate the minute
you haven't doe. Right.

97
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,240
So we critics you can kiss
my whole asshole. So when
you don't grow up with much,

98
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,220
then you're like,
yeah,

99
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,380
I'm going to fucking get a lot and then
I'm going to show off that I have a lot.

100
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:32,350
So you know, I got this shit.
It's a giant part of the culture.

101
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,380
I mean and even in the more
reserved people like Nas,

102
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,270
like who's like a more lyrical artist type
character. Father was a jazz musician.

103
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,320
He drives a Mercedes and his
pictures in front of the nice things.

104
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,850
It's just a part of the whole culture.
Like you got to got to have nice shit.

105
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,090
He can't be living in a log
cabin spitting out rap music.

106
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,420
Nobody wants to hear that.
Like anybody from like a book.

107
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,110
What's that show life below the, the
show where they're all in Alaska, Alaska.

108
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Nobody wants those people rapping.
But I feel like if somebody does that,

109
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,290
then that for that person, it really is
about the art of what they're doing. Yeah.

110
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,820
You know what I mean?
It's not going to happen.

111
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,110
No one's going to listen to a fisherman
rap like a dude who's like salmon

112
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,480
fishing commercial,

113
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,770
like one of those dudes from deadliest
catch. If one of those guys, hey, look,

114
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:26,510
when they're, you can't, can't
be a rapper. He smell like
fish. You got to be clean.

115
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,380
You have to have gold teeth or something.
You have to have a grill.

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,150
That's a is Paul Wall.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,080
Okay.
