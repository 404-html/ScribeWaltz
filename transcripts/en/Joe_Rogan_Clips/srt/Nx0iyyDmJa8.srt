1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,410
What populations as a whole, you
know, when you look at the world, um,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,000
what, where are the people
living the longest and why? Well,

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,460
it's debatable.
There are these blue zones.

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,540
I think many of your listeners
will have heard about those. Um,

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,510
but there are pockets
that have great genes, um,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,240
but they also have great diets
and lifestyles. And so the,

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,440
the best one that I'm familiar with
is the island of Okinawa in Japan.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,400
And, uh, and by the way, I used
to follow the [inaudible] diet.

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,710
A couple of my good friends
wrote a book about it,

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,820
so I was on Tofu when some fish felt
really great. Couldn't keep it up,

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,860
but those why couldn't you keep it up?

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,290
I had kids and our meals turned into
pizzas and pastor. Yeah, unfortunately.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,110
But, uh, I'm getting back there
now that my kids are teenagers,

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:51,090
but the Okinawans date,
they live into their hundreds,

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,550
uh, fairly frequently.
It's not one in a million.

16
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,240
It's more like one and I think 100,000
or something. So it's 10 times higher.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,110
They, they work most of their
lives. They're physically active.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,790
They fast a lot.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,390
And they have a lot of green
leafy vegetables and that
seems to be the secret.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,220
And there's, uh, there were,
there, there were selling some,

21
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,760
there was something about their mineral
rich diet they remembered they were

22
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,640
selling. It was like a big thing
for a while. Coral calcium.

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,470
And they were using that as an example
of why the Okinawans were living so long.

24
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,810
Do you remember that kind
of do remember add? Yeah,

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,710
but in scientific circles we weren't
really bothered with it. Yeah.

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,040
Like there's calcium is
calcium, right? Yeah.

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know how much better it better
calcium from coral or something. I mean,

28
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,440
it might be wrong about that,

29
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,780
but I just remember reading about the
Okinawans and the, the speculation.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,440
They seaweed as well. Right?
They are very healthy.

31
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,500
Probably the best thing that
they do is they don't overeat.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,120
Stop at 70%. Yeah, I'm a glutton.

33
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,740
That's my number one problem. I just
love to eat. Yeah. Yeah, me too.

34
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:02,520
And I keep going once I'm in it and I
just want to just keep shoving it in my

35
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,270
face.

36
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,270
But I've done a good job over the last
few years of tapering that off and the

37
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:09,540
intermittent fast and I think is probably
one of the best things I've ever done

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,580
in terms of, you know, just maintaining
energy levels, maintaining body weight,

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,340
that kind of stuff. Yeah.
Yeah. You look good.

40
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,070
So I think that that's one of the
best things that people can do.

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,630
What we've known for 70 or more years
actually is if you calorie restrict

42
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,350
animals actually even eat cells and words,
they live longer.

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,120
And this is the most robust way to,
to prevent cancer, heart disease,

44
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,960
Alzheimer's in a mouse.
Um,

45
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,150
and so the intimate and fasting is
just a way of mimicking this calorie

46
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,730
restricted diet. So what,
what is calorie restriction?

47
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,910
It's reducing what you would,
your doctor would recommend for your body,

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,570
but reducing it packed about 20 to 30%.
So it's quite extreme.

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,810
That's not pleasant. I tried that
for a week, gave up too hard,

50
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,310
but intimate and fasting like yourself,
it's doable. It's not always pleasant,

51
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,470
but uh, I think that's the best
way to do it. And with the mice,

52
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,890
it works just as well
as calorie restriction,

53
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,680
which is pretty much always
being a bit hungry. Now,

54
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,681
what other things are you looking at in
terms of mitigating stress or like what

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,290
other factors are there that you,
that you have to keep an eye on? Yeah,

56
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,630
stress is a bad one. Um, I try to, uh,

57
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
take life in my stride, not
get too worried about it.
Remember what's important.

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,980
So my heart rate rarely goes up.
Um,

59
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,420
even under really extreme circumstance.
