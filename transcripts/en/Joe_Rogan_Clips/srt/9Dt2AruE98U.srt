1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,590
Do you ever anticipate yourself
traveling for journalism again? Sure. Oh,

2
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:07,890
town travel. Yeah. But just
nothing like this. Yeah. No,

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't need to do dangerous
travel anytime soon. No, no.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,890
Yeah. Some people just want to jump right
back into the fire. Yeah, that's not,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,870
but that was not the point in the first
place. Right. What was the point like,

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,540
what did you hope to get out of
this trip to Somalia? Well, so one,

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,850
one thing that I noticed while
I was watching the trial and,

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,450
um,
in,

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,190
in Hamburg was this clash
between a modern liberal state,

10
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:39,060
which is what Germany is. Um, and
so it was American by the way. Um,

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
and in archaic crime and Germany in fact
is newer than the United States in the

12
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:50,370
sense that its constitution was written
in 1949 when nobody was thinking about

13
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,150
piracy.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,590
So the laws against piracy or extremely
lenient in German law in a way that

15
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:58,260
they're not in Spanish or American law.
Um,

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,230
we have laws that date back
to when it was a capital crime

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,660
and basically the Germans did not
to deal with these guys. And, uh,

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,680
I thought it was fascinating in the
first place that this ancient crime had

19
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,390
revived after a couple of centuries
of relative quiet, you know, and,

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,280
um,
so I,

21
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:20,220
that tension on its own was interesting
and that was worth the book because

22
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:23,890
nobody was quite approaching
it that way, you know? Uh,

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,260
so that tension is still interesting
and that tension is still alive.

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,860
So there are certainly threats to modern
liberal states going on around the

25
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:34,880
world. So what were the
trials in Berlin? Uh,

26
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,530
there was a trial in Hamburg and I was
going back and forth from Berlin. Uh,

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,550
it was 10 guys from Somalia who I tried
to hijack a cargo ship that belonged to

28
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,360
a,
um,

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,770
a German ship ship company
that was based in Hamburg.

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,460
Uh, I think they were
overpowered by the Dutch navy,

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,900
but the Dutch handed him over to the
Germans. In fact, the Dutch said, okay,

32
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,500
we'll do this as long as we don't have
to try them because everyone knew from

33
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:06,360
the outset that there was going to
be a problem, uh, trying Somalis,

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,390
um, in what way? Um,

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,990
in Europe in general,
but especially in Germany,

36
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:17,991
I think there's a actually a law against
shipping them back to Somalia because

37
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:22,980
it's considered not a safe
place, um, for them, for them,

38
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,680
even for them. And I think that's
nuts. Once they were convicted,

39
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,190
I think they should have been deported
after they serve their tongue.

40
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,590
It's so bizarre. But, but if they
were shipped back to Somalia,

41
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,230
how would they be treated? Like what
does the government like in Somalia? Man,

42
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,110
good questions. Sanely corrupt. I asked
some of my parents about that. Um,

43
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,500
it is corrupt. It's a, it's either
corrupt or nonexistent. So the,

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,210
the government of Somalia is,

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,100
are focused around Mogadishu and it
just doesn't have that much power in the

46
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,540
provinces.
And I was in one of the,

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,800
one of the provinces and because of the
provinces don't get a whole lot of money

48
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,240
from Mogadishu so that they run their own
businesses, wins in some cases, piracy.

49
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,900
Um,

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,550
I asked one of my guards what would happen
if a pirate went and got thrown into

51
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,100
jail and some of the country and then
came back and tried to, you know,

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,430
set up friendships again with his old
pirate buddies or whatever, you know,

53
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,760
would he be killed? Who would he be
in, in dangerous? No, no, no problem.

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,040
It was probably what you worry
about again. No problem. Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,880
I mean,

56
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
is there any sort of punishment for them
when they get back to Somalia news or

57
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,550
any penal system or a
potentially there is, yeah.

58
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,310
So that's not considered a crime.
There are, yes, it is. So there,

59
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:37,900
there are laws on the books,
especially in the regions, um,

60
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,300
and even prisons for pirates.
Um,

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,680
the problem is that clan relationships
are a lot more important than newly

62
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,980
written laws. Um, and so
even prior to go to jail,

63
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,690
this was true about one boss. In my case,
I'm might cut out again. So this guy,

64
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,410
this guy who was a pirate Boston,

65
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,750
my case wound up in jail while I was
still captive for one month in Mogadishu

66
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,690
and wound up walking. Wow. Yeah.

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,260
And he was captive for piracy I think
for having weapons that the government

68
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:12,310
didn't expect to see in one of his houses.
So a,

69
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,020
there's something off to the side,

70
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:19,021
but it's really sketchy system
of bartering and payoffs
and who you know and who

71
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,010
you're related to. And the, there
are other prisons for, you know,

72
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,280
low ranking pirates in Puntland
and also in Galkayo where I was,

73
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,870
um, it's a crap shoot how much time
those guys are going to spend in jail.

74
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,170
And what happened with
the people in Germany?

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,430
They got a total of seven years I think,

76
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,800
or an average in Germany,
in Germany.

77
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,810
And then what happened when they
were released? Nothing. Wow. Yeah.

78
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,010
Um, that's a whole separate story,
which I haven't even started.

79
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:56,470
It started to address,
but as it turned out,

80
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:57,970
a few of them went back to Somalia anyway.

81
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,960
It probably went right back into the
business a well or something else. Uh,

82
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,160
you know, elicit or
profitable or whatever. Yeah.

83
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,060
And there's a wide variety
of people that they target.

84
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,920
They target people and individual crafts,
the target large boats,

85
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,370
commercial vessels. Yup.
They did all of that. I mean,

86
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:22,240
in fact I met hostage is from all of
those, you know, from the whole range.

87
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,810
So the company hostage, did you meet
over the two years and eight months? Um,

88
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,440
a total of 30. So the, the
crew on the fishing ship,

89
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,970
the tune of vessel was 28 and then I
met to say shall Wah Wah fishermen.

90
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,610
The two guys from the Seychelles,
we're small time.

91
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,440
So they were just on a small craft.

92
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,270
Would it say shells in the Seychelles is
a chain of islands off Africa. It's a,

93
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,710
it's a country that belongs to
Africa. Um, but it has a French name.

94
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,840
Um, the, the guys on the tune of vessel,

95
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,040
um, we're from a, you know, relatively
big ship. The guys from the Seychelles,

96
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,680
we're from a small private craft.

97
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,710
And I was an example of
someone captured on land

98
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,690
and these people that were from
the small private co craft it.

99
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,580
Who were they trying to get money from?
Just anyone who knows them.

100
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,580
Is that how they do this? Yeah,
whoever. Anybody. They can, I mean,

101
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,170
of course they asked the government,
but the government doesn't always pay,

102
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,780
you know,
the given government.

103
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
Yeah. It's just, it,

104
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,670
it's just the whole system seems
so insane that they've got, I mean,

105
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,670
the key people for years and years,

106
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,020
but they have just a whole collection of
them or they're trying to extract money

107
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,060
from people that

108
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,240
no, them. Yeah. Uh, as it turns
out, they're not very good at it.

109
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,980
So pirates are in the kidnapping business,

110
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:45,160
but they don't always know
what they're doing. Um, the,

111
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,080
the bosses I think got used to,
um,

112
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,280
demanding a lot of money from shipping
companies and finding out that if you

113
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:55,290
hold a ship stubbornly for a long time,
I,

114
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,540
you got a lot of money from the
insurance company or whatever. Um,

115
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,490
I that, that calculation doesn't work
with human beings. So in other words,

116
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,160
everyone else on earth who,

117
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,210
who negotiates for a human being expects
of the person's price to go down as the

118
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:16,100
time, you know, wears on. And, um, it took
a while for pirates to understand that,

119
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,650
wow. What is it? I mean, when you're
d you're dealing with all this,

120
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,660
like what, what is it like on your
psyche when you're getting two years in,

121
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,080
two and a half years in and you,
you,

122
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,750
you have some sort of light
at the end of the tunnel.

123
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,000
What, what is it, what
does it feel like? Well,

124
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:40,240
I didn't know there was light at
the end of the tunnel. So, um,

125
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,050
two years in that's where, um, you know,

126
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,430
it was either forgive the guards
or, or, or self destruct. Um,

127
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,050
it was also,
by then I had also

128
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,440
deliberately given let go of having any
kind of hope so that that was a second

129
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,060
survival strategy. I, I had to,

130
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:03,630
I'm not hope that I was going to get out,
uh,

131
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,760
because hoping was had a downside,

132
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,760
that cycle of hope and despair,

133
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,510
it was extremely damaging
my mental wellbeing. So the,

134
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,700
after going through that
cycle a few times, I'm like,

135
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,790
I have to find a different way.
Hmm.

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,040
One of the things that I've gotten out
of travel is I think it it your view of

137
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:30,200
the world changes when you see the way
people are living in different places.

138
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,300
You, you, your spectrum expands.
You start recognizing like, oh,

139
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,220
I might be used to southern California
but this is not how they do things in

140
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:42,890
Ohio.
This is not how they do things in Italy.

141
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,920
This is not when you go as far
as being a captive in Somalia,

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,950
your,
your spectrum is massive.

143
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,270
I mean your view of the world
being entrenched in that
life and being with those

144
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:00,631
people,

145
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:05,631
whether chewing his narcotic and carrying
around coalition of coughs and yelling

146
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,530
at each other in a foreign language and
watching fist fights and realizing like

147
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,480
they don't have anything either.

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,880
What w how much has that changed you as
a human being and you or your view of

149
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,970
human life on earth?

150
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,970
Well, I think enormously. I mean, I,
you're right, it expanded my range and my,

151
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,820
my understanding of, of
what other people think, um,

152
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,180
they obviously come from a completely
different perspective and smelly and not

153
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:37,320
only are they, um, Muslim and African,

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,980
but they're also very isolated.
So Somalia as a,

155
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,730
as a rule has always been difficult
to penetrate for outsiders.

156
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:49,260
That was true when Richard Burton was
there in the 19th century too. Um, it's,

157
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,180
it's a closed culture and,
um,

158
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,510
they have their own way of thinking.

159
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,950
And also the office of the language
is not related to most other languages

160
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,850
you've heard,
unless you,

161
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,450
you're familiar with languages in Ethiopia
to learn any of it. Yeah, a little bit.

162
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,240
But, um, I, I resisted
learning it from the guards.

163
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,000
I think when I was there,
I thought about it like,

164
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,590
I'm in Berlin, you realize that
a lot of east Germans when,

165
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,840
um,
during the communist era,

166
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,290
we're taught Russian in school
and a lot of them hated it.

167
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,790
And I was not in a mood to learn
Somalia Somali once I was a captain.

168
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,500
So, um, it was similar to that. I, uh,

169
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,570
I learned a few words, but I
never had a good teacher. Um,

170
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,360
and of course when I was a journalist,
I was relying on translators.

171
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,910
I would imagine that as a writer,
that spectrum,

172
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,040
the expansion of the spectrum,

173
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:51,041
although there's no way you would ever
barter it off or bargain to have those

174
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:53,120
experiences to broaden your spectrum.

175
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,600
It has to have changed the way you put
pen to paper and view the world and your,

176
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,570
your ability to describe things.

177
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,170
Yeah.
I think you,

178
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,100
you realize that each
individual has certain, certain
boundaries, you know, and,

179
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,380
and certain certain self definitions.
Um,

180
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,400
and those self definitions can be
the,

181
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,840
the distance between one individual
and another can be enormous,

182
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,880
but in some sense also they're
superficial distinctions. So yeah,

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,310
they're inescapable.

184
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:35,170
Reality is so alien in comparison
to someone who lives in Bel Air.

185
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,310
Oh, absolutely. Just this, this,

186
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,490
just that contrast between this world
that you are so deeply entrenched in for

187
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:50,581
two and two years and eight months like
that has got to change the way you look

188
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,420
at human life.

189
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,803
Yeah.
Uh,

190
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,590
because the Gulf and
wealth is so enormous.

191
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,110
I mean they can't imagine that the amount
of money it takes to live in Bel air

192
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,320
and the other way around.
I mean,

193
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,040
I think it's very difficult for someone
in California to imagine how little you

194
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,900
can get by on,
um,

195
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,710
and how close to the earth most
people on the planet live. Yeah.

196
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,830
There's a statistic
that I read once that I,

197
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:18,630
I repeat all the time cause it still
baffles me that if you make more than

198
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:23,010
$34,000 a year, you're in the 1% of
the world of the world. Yeah. Possibly.

199
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,203
Yeah.

200
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,080
And that is probably magnified
many fold in Ethiopia.

201
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,360
Yeah. In Ethiopia and Somalia.
I mean it's, it's very, um,

202
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,090
you know, in some ways, although
they want money all the time,

203
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,460
especially if they're criminals,
um,

204
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,520
the money that we're used to sort of
greasing our path through life around here

205
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,420
is just not available. It's just
not, not part of the reality.

206
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,020
What do they do with money when
they get it? Well, it depends if,

207
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,780
if they're pirates,
they splash out on fancy car or,

208
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,650
or caught, you see fancy cars from sure.
Oh yeah, no, I was placed in fancy cars.

209
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:10,210
I mean, yeah, no. So the pirates
had great cell phones, um,

210
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,760
expensive SUV. Yes. Um, weapons
that they had bought, you know,

211
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,910
from abroad and maybe a weapons bizarre
in Mogadishu or something like that. Uh,

212
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:22,780
but that's not cheap either. Uh,
they, they bragged about how the, uh,

213
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,690
the bullets costs like a dollar each,
you know, and the one of them might,

214
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,480
might've been wearing a band of 500
bullets. Um, and the cut is expensive.

215
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:35,880
So lots of things costs an enormous
amount of money in Somalia. But if you're,

216
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,680
you know, if you're a very
ordinary Somali, Somali, you,

217
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,970
you're getting by on
less than a dollar a day.

218
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,500
So there's the ordinary Somalis who are
not criminals or not pirates at least.

219
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,960
And then you can ask the majority,
the majority.

220
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,800
And then you have these
pirates that are essentially

221
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,820
running through the
streets and Mercedes Benz,

222
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,250
they're like gangsters. They're
like gangsters. And that's,

223
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:05,940
that's actually how one Somali, who
had some connection to Germany, um,

224
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,280
describing them to me, you know, he,

225
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,310
he was wandering around and
got Kyle because it was his
hometown and in some way

226
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:15,840
or ancestral ancestral town. And he had
met some, this was before I got captured.

227
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,780
It was like they were, you know, they
had wrapped thumping from the SUV.

228
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,380
Did they really? American rap.
Who knows, who knows this?

229
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:25,380
There's lots of actually good
African ramp. Really? Oh yeah.
