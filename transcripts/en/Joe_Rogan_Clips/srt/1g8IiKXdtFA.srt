1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,110
Started as a test.
Jane Fonda workouts though.

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,800
Jane Fonda back in the day with the
doggy thing. What was that like?

3
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:08,780
1970s seven to me.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,200
Damn. Oh, that was crazy.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,050
That was so fucking big.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,670
It was the first time women were marketed
to for exercise. Think so. I think so.

7
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:27,671
I think before that women may be competed
in athletic events like gymnastics and

8
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,420
shit like that when they were young,

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,210
but then when they probably got
families or moved on to jobs,

10
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:36,040
they probably stopped. What is this
one? Just go aerobic championship.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,830
Oh my God.
Look at this as a choreographed dance.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,400
This is so strange. Wow, that's right.
Do you remember aerobics really quick?

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm going to take an aerobics class.
Yeah, you remember that? I'll be kind of,

14
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:53,330
that was people would just dance around
and you would do stuff. Feel the pump,

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,880
pop the pop and two and three and go.
They turn.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,040
Everybody gave for about five years, but
it, all these guys, look at these guys.

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,280
These guys are straight as fuck and they
don't even know they're doing gay stuff.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,130
You know? It's like, it's like when,

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,310
before everybody knew that Rob
Halford from Judas priest is gay.

20
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,460
He used to make everybody dress up like
him because everybody like the kids that

21
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,980
were straight kids,
so we're huge fans of Judas priest.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,100
They would wear the cap and the j wearing
gay aesthetic like gay biker looking

23
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:32,130
right. Tough guys. Everybody got into
it because they loved him because Judas,

24
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:37,131
it is so bad ass and he's such a fucking
awesome front man that like he had

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,400
straight guys dressing up like a gay bike.
That's fucking hilarious.

26
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:45,060
And then he comes out and they're all,
they're like, what? This so confused.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,960
But he did it in a
concert. Does 100,000. No,

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,050
I'm just saying what if he did and they
looked down and there were y'all wearing

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,150
is what I like in my men.
I had him on a show I did once.

30
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,340
It was a like this um,
thing for VH one called the list.

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,940
Oh yeah, I did that. You did it
too? Yeah. Here he is. Look at that.

32
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,950
I mean look at the outfit Bro. Seriously.
Wow. The leather paper boy hat on.

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,370
Yeah,

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,370
well it's more like a soldier's hat and
he's got leather vest on with no shirt

35
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:21,580
underneath. Leather gloves. It's
spikes all SNM shit. Tight, tight,

36
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,350
tight leather pants.
It's hilarious.

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,210
Freddie Mercury. Yeah man. Um,

38
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,050
what was my point? What we're, we're,

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,030
we're talking about something right before
we were talking about that. Oh, the,

40
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,760
the, the rubiks. The aerobics
guys. Like, come on man.

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,430
They had dudes were in singles. Look
at this. Look at this outfit. This,

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,950
that's like a singlet from
wrestling but with long pants. Yeah.

43
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,680
This is bananas that they got man dressed
like this. Good. What they're wearing.

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
You see their nipples like
their nipples are popped out.

45
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,400
They're all super gate out leg.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,640
There's three quarter length Reebok
high tops. Exactly. What the velcro.

47
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,930
You had to get the velcro. That's the
newest technology especially. Yeah.

48
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,530
So look, every girl is
dressed like, you know,

49
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,290
I guess they look more like why
they have tutors for an outfits.

50
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,420
The girls have some of
them expose the mid drift,

51
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,360
like the dirty girls that they are.

52
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,650
Then the other ones that
we're a a one piece. Oh,

53
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,480
Alan Thicke was hosting this mother
fucker. Oh Shit. Course he was, oh shit.

54
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,830
Look at him. Look at that hair.
It's wonderful. Look at his jacket.

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,940
Solve Miami vice doubt.
Yeah. He's got shoulder pads.

56
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,343
You got up,

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,960
got to get rid of shoulder pads back
then you could have shoulder pads. Yeah,

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,150
I remember having shelter pads
and my first jacket. It's nice.

59
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,003
It makes you look better.

60
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,300
It isn't like a stuffed bra for a girl. It
is. Yeah. It's the same thing. Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,810
But how weird that people,

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,130
so do you remember people
actually dressing like that
and in a class situation,

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,390
did they go to classes,
dress like that grade school?

64
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,890
We had uniforms and stuff,
so no,

65
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,490
I never took an aerobics class.

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,360
But see if you can find video
footage of an aerobics class,

67
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,830
if all the guys that dress like
that, those dudes got punked. Yeah.

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,910
Somebody talked to him into
dressing like a dancer. Yeah. Yeah.
