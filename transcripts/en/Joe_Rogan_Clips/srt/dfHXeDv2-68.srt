1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
So let's talk about these
fights, bro. First of all,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,550
let's start with Diego
motherfucking Sanchez.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,050
All these young guns sleeping on
Diego Sanchez fully redeemed himself.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,980
Do not sleep. Do not. Just do not,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,390
just don't cause he will
fuck. Ugh. People up still.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,930
How about Micky Gall bid and
do you see that? I saw this.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,000
There's a video of him bite him.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,820
Well there's a video of Diego going
look at this shit. Yeah, Diego.

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:31,821
I saw on his Instagram he showed his chest
where he takes a bit that it's crazy.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,440
I thought they said Micky
Gall had a hard cut,

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,130
like a really hard cut and maybe that's
one of the reasons he got so tired.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,940
I just don't think that so far he's just,
the skills aren't there yet.

13
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,400
Now he was out of his element a little
bit. Wow. I gave outclassed him.

14
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,210
Diego is a monster.

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,040
I mean you're dealing with a guy who
has 40 look at that bite mark. That is,

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,940
that is Cree bite the fuck Micky gall.
I'll buy bytes.

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,020
Guys had bitten guys before. Can't be
on my team. Yeah, you're off the team.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,850
It's not good. It's bad luck. Me or
Diego didn't say shit to the referee.

19
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,930
Just kept smashed.
Dude.

20
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:13,590
He is such a savage and he's a sandwiches
fighting since he was four years old

21
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:18,270
in the Usda.
He won ultimate fighter season one,

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,770
2005 14 fucking years ago.

23
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,250
That mental weight. Yup.
14 fucking years ago.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,330
You want to stop and think about what an
insane career that is and his last two

25
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:33,810
fights. Um, well I think you last
fight was Craig white does that,

26
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,811
who he fought last smashed that dude
smashed and then smashed Micky gall dude.

27
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:43,020
He, he's the, uh, he's the mascot for
Jackson's. Right? Like if there's a logo,

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,860
it's Diego Sanchez.
Yeah. And every prayer,

29
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:47,880
but he knows that is Brendan chops voice.
I sound like Alec Jones Right now.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,030
Not here. Not Loud enough.
Yeah, you're right.

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,820
You sound like Brendan Chubb with a cold
that I don't see. I don't feel sick.

32
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,340
You don't feel stuck. So it's
just a sore throat I think. Yeah.

33
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,190
But how's your throat just go? We
screaming at someone. No, dubs chilling.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,480
I did do podcasting for this Wolf House.

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,150
Sometimes my voice goes, I'm not sick.
Oh, that's so great. That's weird.

36
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:15,240
Cause I am sick a little
bit really around.

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,720
Well I had it over the weekend and
yesterday I felt like dog shit.

38
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,080
Do you work out? I worked
out, uh, not yesterday,

39
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,540
but Saturday I worked outside of it.
Probably wasn't a good idea.

40
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,920
They say when you work out,
when you're sick,

41
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,370
inmates at worst [inaudible] system's
down. I usually show up. Do it too.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,720
I lifted too. And you know,
it's not smart. No, but I,

43
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,010
I'm okay today I'm just like
a little, little worn out,
but my voice is all right.

44
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,300
You just need some rest. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean I'll be fine. I'm traveling.

45
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,410
Doesn't help.
No,

46
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,290
it's the worst man because always I
always take the first flight back cause I

47
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,760
want to see my family and yeah, I
got the that makes it worse. Yeah.

48
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:52,860
I was up at five.
Um,

49
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,690
so Micky gall in that fight,
he asked for that fight.

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,190
That was a fight.
He was begging Dana white to give him.

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,520
He thought it was a good fight for him.
He thought it was a good match up.

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,600
I don't know why people think that,
I guess cause like she's been knocked out.

53
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:12,070
Right. Ally Quinta, k
Odom. Um, uh, Matt Brown,

54
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,070
Kod Dem. But he's a big name
has been doing for a long time.

55
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,120
So these young guys go, oh, I grew up
watching him. Let me get him. Well they,

56
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:23,020
I think they also think he's been doing
it for so long and they're right. Yeah.

57
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,380
But he still so fucking tough man.
He has all the skills.

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,880
He still has all the skills and his
ground and pound his fucking ferocious.

59
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,210
And once he's on the
ground then he doesn't,

60
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,010
I mean if there's a hole in Diego's game,

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,040
you would have to say against like
elite Strykers he has a real problem.

62
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,950
Like guys like Matt Brown,
he's going to have problems.

63
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,580
He's just not as fluid as
those guys, you know? Yeah.

64
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,950
Diego's grappling to
amazing, amazing, amazing.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,990
And his ferocity cannot be questioned.
He's just mental games. Savage.

66
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,220
Just to think about the enthusiasm Diego
has after all these years in the game,

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,630
all these years in the game. Unbelievable.
Crazy. How many years? How many years?

68
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,470
What we know? Well, 14 years in the UFC,

69
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,620
but he fought before that he was,
he was a veteran.

70
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,600
He had several fights before
the yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

71
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,830
Oh yeah. Crazy. Crazy. How long
he's been doing it and again,

72
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,180
how long he's been doing it and how much
he loves it still and he says CBD is

73
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:27,180
really helping him. He's got his
own CBD. 2002 damn motherfuckers.

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,670
17 years in years.
He fought Michael Johnson.

75
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,790
2000 same Michael Johnson.
No Way. Like my mine.

76
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,810
Michael was six years.
What's that?

77
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,870
His name would probably be tagged
there for it was? Yeah. Would right.

78
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,470
That's not Michael. Wow. He fought
Shannon rich on this third fight.

79
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,260
Shannon rich has like a million
fights cook on Shannon Rich,

80
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,330
which in my get Gaiman, the joker old
school to then click on Shannon. Rich,

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,650
how many fights is here? I'm going to
say he's got, how many does it say?

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,420
Holy Shit.
Say the regular houses.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,330
53 it's Jesus Christ. It's the worst
record of everything. That's crazy.

84
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,430
That is crazy. Shout out to that guy
though. For keeping with it. You know,

85
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,960
that is Chris lost 79 times.
Jesus Christ, 42 kickboxing.

86
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,370
Oh my God. And 42 kickboxing
matches. Jesus Christ,

87
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,210
they kickbox and he's kind of
killing it. 35 and seven. Not Bad,

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
but that's an insane amount of experience.

89
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:29,641
But just stop and think about 17 years
in Diego's still slinging and so much

90
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:34,450
enthusiasm. That's a crazy part. It's not
just that he's fighting that he fights.

91
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,140
He was fucking angry cause
he had his own CBD company.

92
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:41,680
Now it gave me some of it any good.
I haven't tried it yet. He just gave,

93
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:45,850
he gave me some bottles of his stuff, but
he's human. He really believes in CBD.

94
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,930
A lot of fighters do. It's helping
them. Yeah. It's amazing. It's amazing.

95
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:54,340
Stops spectrum CBD. That's what I, yeah, I
mean, there's so many good companies now,

96
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,150
but uh.
