1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,470
Because the people that
get involved in it,

2
00:00:01,471 --> 00:00:04,200
part of the reason why they get involved
in it's virtue signaling. Totally.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,300
And I've been asked like,
you know,

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,640
as I've been prudent promoting
the book by a lot of people,

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,090
like what have you done in your life to
change? You know, and it's like, well,

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm flying a little bit less defying,
really makes me feel guilty.

7
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:17,820
But otherwise I basically haven't
changed anything because I do think that

8
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,790
politics and policy are the most
important impact you can have.

9
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,020
And I'm like spreading the word,

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,840
whether I eat like a couple
of fewer hamburgers a year,

11
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,340
it just doesn't really matter that much.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,700
But the idea that you would ask a newcomer
to the movement to demonstrate their

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,920
commitment by making themselves the most
optimally committed that they possibly

14
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,720
could be, that's just going
to alienate so many people.

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,190
And this is obviously an issue where we
need more people engage in a more direct,

16
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:51,000
profound way. So I think for me, it's like
anyone who wants to care about climate,

17
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:55,170
who wants to vote about climate, like
come on, like, yeah. Um, and I think that,

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,750
you know, Hollywood can be really
important here. Um, I mean,

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,890
since I've been out here,
I've been,

20
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,760
I have a couple of meetings about shows
and stuff and I do think that we've had

21
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:06,960
really corny storytelling
about climate change. Um,

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,850
and that there are actually opportunities
for like really incredible new kinds

23
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,200
of storytelling.
I mean,

24
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,890
in the book I write about this story that
happened a couple of years ago where,

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,553
mmm.

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,000
You know,
anthrax that was,

27
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,530
had killed a reindeer in Russia
in the early 20th century.

28
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:29,680
The reindeer was frozen and permafrost
for the entire 20th century,

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,340
permafrost melting,
the reindeer thawed,

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,580
the anthrax was released and killed
at least one boy and a number of other

31
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:39,340
reindeer in Russia. Wow. And that is true.

32
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:42,190
So in the ice in the Arctic ice are,
you know,

33
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,680
we know of rock is like a
record of geological history.

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,450
Ice is also record of geological history.

35
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:51,430
So they're like the bubonic
plague is trapped in ice.
The Spanish flu in from 18,

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,460
1918 that killed hundreds of
millions of people is trapped in ice.

37
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,060
There are diseases trapped in the Arctic
ice from before humans were around,

38
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,820
which means that humans immune
system have no experience with them.

39
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,560
There's so many horror movies you can
make them at this subject. Um, Holy Shit,

40
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,760
I didn't even think of that. I didn't
know that the Spanish flu is trapped in.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,030
Nice. Yeah. I mean,

42
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,510
and there have been instances where
like in lab conditions anyway,

43
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,160
they've revived bacteria that
are millions of years old.

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,180
Um,

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,180
one Russian doctor literally injected a
bacteria that he had revived from like

46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,940
35,000 years ago.
It had been frozen for 35,000 years.

47
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,930
He brought it back to life and injected
it into himself. Why would he do that?

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,720
Just to see what would,
that's a fucking marvel comic book.

49
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,100
That's how you become like the,
the red skull or some shit. Yeah.

50
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,540
Well that's what I mean about this.
This story is so big.

51
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,720
It's like the world that we live in
in the next couple of decades will be

52
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:50,980
completely transformed.

53
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,460
Like we will be reading about
diseases coming out of the Arctic ice.

54
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,810
We will be reading about tropical diseases
arriving in Copenhagen because now

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,290
are there because the temperature allows
them to live there and the way that

56
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,310
they never lived before.

57
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,370
We will be reading about climate conflict
will be reading about, you know, um,

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,890
I mean all this shit, it's, it's,
it's everywhere. It, you know,

59
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,200
air pollution increases the rates
of autism and Adhd. It changes, um,

60
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,280
the development of babies in utero.
It's like, it's all encompassing. Wow.

61
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,340
The disease in the ice things
really freaking me out.

62
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,880
I never even considered that.
Yeah.

63
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,080
But that is something to think about
along with the methane and carbon is going

64
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:32,980
to be emitted into the
atmosphere as it melts. Well,
let me tell you the story. So,

65
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,990
um, there we now, so there was,

66
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,550
there this species of antelope
called a saiga antelope. They, um,

67
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,690
they're mostly in Siberia.

68
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,250
They're kind of dwarf antelopes and
they've been around for millions of years.

69
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,600
And, uh, all of a sudden in 2016 or 2015,

70
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,790
they literally all died. It's called
a mega death. The entire species died.

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,690
They're extinct. They're
now extinct. Jesus. Um,

72
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,810
and that happened because a bacteria that
had been living inside their guts was

73
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,840
changed by temperature conditions.
It was an unusually hot,

74
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,920
unusually humid summer. And this bacteria
that had been living inside them,

75
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,750
presumably for millions of years
comfortably as a kind of peaceful,

76
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,990
cooperator became a killer
and killed the entire species.

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,270
Now we have inside us
countless bacteria and viruses.

78
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,370
Scientists believe
millions in every human.

79
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,430
So our guts are full of bacteria
that do our digestion for us.

80
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,740
They monitor our moods.
They're there. You know,

81
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:48,580
there are some scientists who think it's
really misleading to even think of the

82
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,630
human as a unitary animal rather than a
kind of composite creatures with system.

83
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,483
Yeah.

84
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,060
And most of those bacteria and viruses
are not going to be dramatically

85
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:01,150
transformed by a degree
or two degrees of warming.

86
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,890
But there's so many of them.
The chances that one could,

87
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,180
it's hard to dismiss that and whether
that would mean we'd all immediately go

88
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,350
extinct,
probably not.

89
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,000
But what if that means suddenly
schizophrenia increases by 15% because

90
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:20,230
schizophrenia is related to,
um, a bacterial infection
called toxoplasma guts,

91
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,940
bacteria Toxoplasma Gondii. Um, well
that's that cat parasite. Yeah, exactly.

92
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,060
Schizophrenia is related to
that. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

93
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,550
I'd like triples your chances of
getting schizophrenia. Wow. Yeah. Um,

94
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,530
and our bodies are so complex,
such intricate ecosystems.

95
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,620
Like you say that if one
little thing gets disturbed,

96
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,840
it could have really
catastrophic impacts on us.

97
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,700
And that's true of the planet as a whole.
I think that's,

98
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,380
that's one of the big lessons of my book
is that this is such a delicate system.

99
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,740
It's been stable for all of human
history and now it's not stable.

100
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,020
What that means for how we live,
we don't know yet,

101
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:55,300
but the changes will be significant,
will be profound.

102
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,100
But it's also true of the individual.
You know,

103
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,660
our bodies will be living differently in
a world that's two degrees warmer than

104
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,480
they are today. We can't really
predict what those impacts will be,

105
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:09,020
but they could be quite traumatic and
they could be things that we can't even

106
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,080
imagine stay because they're,
you know, by some counts,

107
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,080
millions of bacteria inside us that
we haven't even identified yet.

108
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,100
Jesus Christ, you're freaking
me out, David. God dammit.

109
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,670
It's a crazy world out there.
Not just crazy, but it seems like

110
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,400
when, when you're talking
about things like this,

111
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,710
when you're talking about climate change
affecting our actual gut parasites or

112
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,900
our gut biome, and that this literally
could change the way human beings behave.

113
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,030
I mean, these are all things that I've
never heard discussed and it just,

114
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,960
it's really terrifying,
really is, you know, I mean,

115
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,740
and part of the problem is people hear
like, oh, relax, everything's fine.

116
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,890
This is this constant thing that we do
where if it's not effecting us currently,

117
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,020
right now in the moment,
there's not a fire in front of us.

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,140
We don't worry about it.
It's a weird compartment,

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,940
compartmentalization thing that
human beings do. Yeah. And, um,

120
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,430
it's, you know, you'd think that evolution
would have trained us differently.

121
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,820
You think that evolution would have
trained us over time to have at least some

122
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,750
longterm capacity. And I guess we do
have some long term planning capacity,

123
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:19,700
but it's, um, we choose to think
we're in really short term ways.
