1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,390
So when you're dealing with some certain
accusations when it comes to human

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:07,050
beings like this, Chris Hardwick
things. And a perfect example of that,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,820
I mean he was just reinstated
yesterday by AMC and um, yeah,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,030
that's a weird one because she wrote the,

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,710
it was an ex girlfriend that
wrote something about him.
Yeah, I read that. Well,

6
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:22,380
she clearly didn't tell the truth about
some aspects of their relationship.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,400
She cheated on him and that's why he
got rid of her or broke up with her.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,380
And then she also said he was just
terrible boyfriend and he did all that.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,980
But then there's videos of her talking
about what an amazing boyfriend he was

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,360
while they were together,

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:40,110
about how he stayed with her
in the hospital and slept
by her bed. And it's like,

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,420
and she was also,
she had a bunch,

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,160
a host of mental illnesses that she
described in their video about like not

14
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:49,880
being able to drive down the street with
the windows open because she's worth it.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,020
Germs going to get in her car.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,300
And some of those she recovered from
and some of them she didn't like.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,190
It's an Oh,

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,180
there's another problem with people when
it comes to when they're talking about

19
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,960
things they might not even be
allying. Yeah, they just might be.

20
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,450
They just might have a
distorted perception of reality.

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,840
That is another problem with human
beings when it comes to any sort of

22
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,480
interaction between two people,
especially after a break up.

23
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,690
I think the way that a person can view
the time they spent with someone can very

24
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:17,250
much change based on,
you know,

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,710
their current situation or how
that breakup happened. 100% yeah,

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,270
but on both sides. The, the
real problem though is what,

27
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:29,130
what we were saying is that human beings,
it's very difficult.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,420
I can't read minds. You can't read
minds. You can't look into memories.

29
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:38,520
So we're relying on a person's description
and then we have to rely on what we

30
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,090
know about them, what,
how, how, what, what,

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,340
what we know about their ability
to describe things accurately,

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,100
what we know about their perceptions of
reality. They're delusions there. There,

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,330
there, there, there, there clarity.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,670
It's fucking super tricky.
I mean, my rule of thumb,

35
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,010
what I would say to people is,
unless you know the two people,

36
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,050
I don't think you can ever
really know what happened.

37
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,780
So in that case of say you leave and Jamie
tells you, I said something about you,

38
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,690
you're probably going to go with
Jamie, right? Cause you know him.

39
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,730
So I would say the same. He's a little
crazy. I'm like, I'm like, oh yeah.

40
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,530
I mean it's for sure.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,670
If I didn't know you and Jamie told
me you did something fucked up,

42
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,760
I would side with Jamie.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,180
But even that's weird cause like
if I'm not there, if I don't know,

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,980
if you say I didn't do anything,

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,090
I'm like well maybe one day you'll be
my best friend and maybe a of one day

46
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,580
Jamie turn out to be a fucking psycho.
I was like,

47
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,610
remember when we used to think
Jamie was okay, he's fucking crazy.

48
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,590
But that's the thing too.
I think sometimes with,

49
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:42,030
I do empathize with some of the women
who say if this happens to the men and

50
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,580
people say, well that's a nice guy.
I know that guy. That's my buddy.

51
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,450
I've known him forever. But you
didn't date him. So how do you know?

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,900
You don't know, right? Yeah.
You don't know. God Damn it.

53
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,980
It's fucking tricky. You know, if
you ever seen that episode of black,

54
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,230
do you ever watch Black
Mirror watched one episode?

55
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:01,120
So everyone tells me how amazing this
show is and I think it is amazing.

56
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:06,100
But I saw one episode that really freaked
me out. So no, it was the one about,

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,300
um, it was actually about a of the boy
who was a pedophile and then he was being

58
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:13,120
watched and blackmailed creeped me out.

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,870
But there's one called crocodile.
Okay.

60
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,900
And it is easily the most disturbing
episode of a television show I've ever

61
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:23,970
watched in my life.
And it,

62
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,610
it has to do with technology that
allows people to read memories. Okay.

63
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,790
And I'll leave it at that because
I had no spoiler alerts here,

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but until fucking dark stays
with you after this one does,

65
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,020
this one's dark. I mean this,
I mean I can't, I can't,

66
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,940
I will give too much away if I talk about
it, but the concept is that you can,

67
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,810
they have a machine and they set this
machine up and through this machine they

68
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,811
can literally read your
memories until that happens.

69
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,270
We really don't know.
And you know,

70
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,920
there's been things in my life where I
looked back on it and I had a perception

71
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,470
and then I went to the place
where I grew up and I was like,

72
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,920
I don't remember it looking like this. I
don't remember this being so close. Oh,

73
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,310
the streets right here. This
is where the house is. Oh.

74
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,250
And then you have to kind of like
remap your memories. Like, okay,

75
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,980
we got to clean these memories up and
try to figure out what's accurate and

76
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:21,250
what's not. But then this is,
I'm just talking about like this,

77
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,120
the neighborhood where I grew up in,
but what about your adding in emotions?

78
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,990
Then you add,
again,

79
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,910
painful emotions because of breakups
and perhaps suicidal thoughts and

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,290
yes, time. Sure. I mean,

81
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,740
it's been absolutely proven that eye
witness testimony is the least accurate

82
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,500
piece of evidence that any investigator
can ever use in terms of like trying to

83
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,320
figure out what happened at the scene of
a crime or anything involving any sort

84
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:50,950
of trauma.
