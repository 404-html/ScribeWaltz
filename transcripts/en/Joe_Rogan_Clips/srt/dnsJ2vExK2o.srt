1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,010
That's the ideological point that
right here, this is a new thing though,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,710
right? I mean, relatively
speaking, this, uh,

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,300
this hard nose stance from the left
of the equality of outcome and,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,340
and the only reason why there wouldn't
be 50% women or 50% black or 50% in it,

5
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,750
you just pick any marginalized group.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,260
The only reason why it wouldn't be even
across the board with all other races is

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:25,500
because of discrimination. This is a
fairly new stance. And then there were,

8
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:29,880
there were moments that were fairly
well publicized that I don't forget when

9
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:31,440
Larry Summers got fired from Harvard.

10
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:35,130
So let Larry Summers with the president
of Harvard and he's a famous economist,

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,660
uh, and he gave a speech
for which he was fired. Uh,

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,090
there might be a little more color
as to why he was fired. I mean,

13
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,830
it was more fire because he, he wants the
wheels started to come off. He didn't,

14
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,800
he had alienated enough people that he
didn't have friends to kind of prop him

15
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,634
up.
But,

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,090
but the thing that pulled the wheels off
was that he gave a speech and he said,

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,330
we know there are are differences in,

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,920
in the the bell curves that describe,
you know,

19
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,110
mathematical aptitude
between men and women.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,680
And this explains why there are many
more top flight male mathematicians and

21
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:14,610
engineers than women. And it's not
that they even, it's not that the,

22
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,890
uh, the means of the, uh, the, the,
the of the bell curves are different.

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,570
So the,
the means could be the same,

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,020
but there could be more variants so that
the tails are thicker in the case of,

25
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,640
of the male bet. Bell-Curve. So at the,
at the absolute ends, both the, that, the,

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,970
the low end and the high end, you have
many more people. So you know, if you're,

27
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:36,540
if you're going to ask, you know,
what's the, in the same size population,

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,800
how many people do you have
at the 99.9, nine, nine,

29
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,430
nine percentile of aptitude in math?

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,030
Say it could be that you have,
and there's,

31
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:52,020
there's a fair amount of data to show this
many more men at the tails than women.

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,370
Right? And, and that's true for
grandmasters in chess, right? It's just,

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,850
it's just this is not a, uh, and it may
be true for something like, you know,

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,450
playing pool, you know, I mean they're,
they're, they're just differences.

35
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,060
And that may not be
entirely environmental,

36
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:10,630
almost certainly are not entirely
environmental. Uh, that is one, right?

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,120
It's a big issue in the world of pool
men and women play separately and there's

38
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,850
no reason physically why they
should. Yeah, they're not,
it's not a strength game.

39
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,980
Right. But women are allowed to play in
men's tournaments, but they never win.

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,470
Right. Jean Bill Lucas
was a woman who was, uh,

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,830
she was like one of the only
women never compete and beat men.

42
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,930
She's like an extreme outlier.
And this was like,

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,880
I want to say it was in the late seventies
and eighties. And other than that,

44
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,310
there's been a few women that
have done well in tournaments,

45
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,520
but when they come to major league
professional pool tournament's,

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,000
they're almost always one by
men. Um, and when I say almost,

47
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,250
I mean like 99.9%.

48
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,330
So there was a commonwealth
games have been happening as we,

49
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:54,900
it was just over the last couple of
weeks and there was a male to female

50
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,580
transgender athlete in the weight lifting.
Consequently,

51
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:03,581
that's a whole nother ball participated
in the women's competition and the

52
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,670
Commonwealth Games at the time of her
joining hadn't yet put down a rule as to

53
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,310
testosterone levels in
the females competing.

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,410
And so this male to female transgender
person qualified in the female games and

55
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:20,120
was as you'd expect,
um,

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,300
winning in all of the Games and was the
front runner and destined to win the

57
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:29,710
competition as a male to female
transgender person. And the only reason,

58
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,460
and it would have led to a huge crisis
in the Commonwealth Games because there

59
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,070
was some resistance to this notion.
Um,

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,980
and of course the questions
that arise is this fair. Um,

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,980
men are born naturally with high
levels of testosterone. For example,

62
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,090
the only reason it didn't
lead to, to crunch time, and
that was a huge scandal of,

63
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:50,140
of, uh, of her winning is that she
injured herself in the competition.

64
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,830
And by sheer accident,
I saw that. Well, I can,

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,330
I can expand on that a little bit
because I've actually gone through this

66
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:59,530
extensively because there was a
woman who was a, used to be a man,

67
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,160
was competing in mixed
martial arts against women
and just beating the shit out

68
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:07,600
of them. And I was saying that this
is, this is a mistake and that you're,

69
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:11,980
you're looking at something whether
someone should be legally able to identify

70
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:14,580
as a woman portray themselves
a woman. Absolutely. Yeah.

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you have the freedom to become a
woman in quotes? In our society, yes,

72
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:23,500
but you can't deny biological nature and
there's physiological advantages to the

73
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,550
male frame. There's, it's specifically
when it comes to combat sports.

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,070
That's my wheelhouse.
I'm an expert.

75
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,180
I understand there's a giant difference
between the amount of power that a man

76
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,200
and a woman can generate.

77
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,940
And if you're telling me that a guy living
30 years of his life as a man, that's,

78
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:43,480
that's essentially like a woman
being on steroids for 30 years,

79
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,570
then getting off and then having regular
women being forced to compete with her

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,550
and try to pretend that this is
a level playing field. It is not.

81
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,640
There's a difference in the shape of
the hips, the size of the shoulder,

82
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,560
the density of the bones,
the size of the fists. Yeah.

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,920
That's a giant factor.

84
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,250
And your ability to generate
power is the size of your fists.

85
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,760
It's also an ethical problem.
And it's not just a competition here.

86
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,640
Girls getting beaten up by
someone who used to be a man. Yes.

87
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,060
But people came down on me harder than
anything that I've ever stood out for in

88
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:15,730
my life.

89
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,310
Never in my life that I think there's
going to be a situation where I said, hey,

90
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,860
I don't think a guy should be able to
get his penis removed and beat the shit

91
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,060
out of women. And then people are
like, you're out of line. But that's

92
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,480
the summary of the [inaudible].
What happened?

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,860
This is a conversation that
I had with a woman, uh,

94
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:33,580
online as well during this whole thing.
Uh,

95
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:38,470
she said she, this person who had turned
into a woman has always been a woman.

96
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,040
And I said, but she was a man
for 30 years. She goes, no,
she's always been a woman.

97
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:47,041
I go even when she had sex with a
woman and fathered a kid and she says,

98
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,090
yes, even then I go, well,

99
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:52,840
we're done because you're just
talking Nazi ideology can,

100
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,820
that's ideology covering Zap.
The fat,

101
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,030
so as they are is that she had a male
physique and the person who was arguing

102
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:03,740
with me wants to claim this moral high
ground of being the most progressive and

103
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:07,190
they're always looking to step on top
of anybody who's less progressive than

104
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:12,110
then and complain and and
proclaim superiority and this
is the ideological sport.

105
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,250
This is the idea support that that you
see with when people are playing ping

106
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,840
pong with our ideas and not listening.

107
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,430
You need to listen to experts in,
in that when you're,

108
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,820
especially when you're talking about
martial arts, there's a, the the,

109
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:30,380
the difference is so profound and the
results are so critical because you're

110
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:35,060
talking about a sport where the
objective goal, the goal is clear.

111
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
It's very clear. Beat the fuck out
of the other person in front of you.

112
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,810
So anything that would give you an
advantage in beating the fuck out of that

113
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,600
person should be really looked at very
carefully and not thrown through the the

114
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,410
lens of this progressive ideological
filter that we're going through right now.

115
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:51,980
Because that's, that's what it is. I mean,

116
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,250
that's how people are looking at it
and it's with weightlifting as well.

117
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,270
When transgendered athletes going
to weightlifting competitions,

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,330
the male to female transgender athletes
are overwhelmingly dominant. Yeah.

119
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,700
I mean, is this, is this
a coincidence or it's, no,

120
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:11,000
it's someone who had fucking testosterone
pumping through their system and n and

121
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,960
a y chromosome their whole life and now
all of a sudden we're supposed to say no,

122
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:18,950
she's a woman. She's a, she's
dainty, she's got size 14 feet,

123
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,130
she's got gorilla hands. Like,
what in the fuck are we doing?

124
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,670
So I think as you said earlier,
she is a woman,

125
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,660
but for the purposes of competition
against other women, you know,

126
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,280
legally she's a woman at that stage,
right?

127
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,140
If she goes through that
identity transition.

128
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,940
But I think we have to recognize it.

129
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,941
I think even many traditional feminists
are making this point much to the anger

130
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,060
of the Trans Community. They're saying,
hold on you what you're doing in this way.

131
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:44,660
He's actually,

132
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,660
we fought so hard and so long for these
female spaces where we have a space of

133
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:53,510
our own people that used to be men are
coming into those spaces is actually

134
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:57,480
quite literally beating the crap
out of us. Yes, yes. You know,

135
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,220
whether it's in boxing, uh, whether
it's in weightlifting, in martial arts,

136
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,520
they are, by definition, they're
dominating on this. Of course they offer,

137
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,930
what were the reasons you've said
experts that they're calling upon are all

138
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:11,540
malls,
all transitioned doctors,

139
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:16,541
surgeons or people that have transitioned
themselves when they speak to actual

140
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:20,180
board certified endocrinologist.
And some of the only do it off record,

141
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,530
but one of 'em, um, I forget her name,

142
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,890
she was in one of the big mixed
martial arts publications.

143
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,510
Ramona [inaudible] I believe is her
name. She's saying, no, not only does it,

144
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,640
it, it actually doing this
transition, like from male to female,

145
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,420
you're forcing your,
you're putting estrogen into the system.

146
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,160
So the bone density change that would
ordinarily take place if you remove

147
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,260
someone's testicles and stop that
does the production of testosterone,

148
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,900
estrogen preserves bone density,

149
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,020
so you're actually retaining
the male bone density.

150
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,550
There's so many problems
with this and that,

151
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,910
and then the one of the other things
they say, well, oh, the Olympics,

152
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:03,390
the Olympics allow it.
The Olympics are very ideologically based.

153
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,240
There's not a whole
lot of science to this,

154
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,170
this transition thing of allowing male
to female athletes to compete in the

155
00:09:10,171 --> 00:09:15,171
Olympics and there's a extreme amount
of corruption in the Olympics as it is

156
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,880
with the IOC being in bed with Wada,

157
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:21,210
the world anti-doping agency and the
way they handle this Russian scandal.

158
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,300
I mean this is Russian scandal that
was highlighted in that fantastic

159
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,900
documentary. ICARUS, yeah,
they're fucking crazy.

160
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,790
They're the Olympics or not to be trusted.

161
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:34,170
That is a gigantic multibillion dollar
business where the athletes get paid zero

162
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:38,550
money. It is inherently corrupt from
the top down. No doubt about it.

163
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,140
So to to call upon them is to see
who should be competing as a woman.

164
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,900
Fuck off. They, they, they're
not the experts. This is,

165
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:49,440
this is not something that's been examined
and this is coming from someone who,

166
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:53,640
one of my jobs is examining
and commentating on fights.

167
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,560
That is a big part of what I do.

168
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,560
I understand fights and I know what it
looks like when a man's beating the shit

169
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,370
out of a woman.

170
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,800
And that's what it looked like when
this person was fighting women. It was,

171
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,830
there was a massive physical advantage.
Massive and not a skill advantage.

172
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,220
What was the way you mentioned something
that the reaction that you got to that,

173
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,260
what was the trouble you go to the top?
People are so mad at me.

174
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,280
I mean it was just so many. Not only
that, they took my words out of context,

175
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:17,320
they quoted all these different,
uh,

176
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,770
gender transition doctors.

177
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:23,340
It's saying that there's no science behind
this and the science behind it being

178
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:27,720
totally fair and totally equal.
It's just not, and people know it.

179
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,680
Everyone knows they couldn't put cris
Cyborg against this guy and give him a run

180
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:35,100
for his money the wrong way class.
Or that's the other way.

181
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,270
That's the other thing,

182
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:38,700
and we're dealing with a similar
situation like that in Texas.

183
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:42,180
I don't even know about the girl who was,
she was born a girl.

184
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:46,050
She's transitioning to a boy in
high school taking testosterone,

185
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,900
but in Texas they only allow
her to compete as a girl.

186
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,980
So she's dominated the Texas
state wrestling championship
two years in a row and

187
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,760
it's horrific because she's on steroids.
She's on testosterone.

188
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,450
He now doesn't matter because
they're testing chromosomal. Yeah,

189
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,170
she's a woman. She was born a
woman, right? She was born a girl.

190
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,980
So because the fact that
she's transitioning to be a
boy, they don't give a shit.

191
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,560
You're a woman. You're not going to
wrestle against men. You're a girl.

192
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,120
You're not going to wrestle,
wrestle against boys.

193
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,240
So they have allowed her under
extreme protest and it's terrible.

194
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,960
She wants to compete or he, I should
say, wants to compete as a boy.

195
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,440
They won't let him. They say,
no, you were born a girl.

196
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:27,180
You have to compete as a girl. So when
he competes everybody booze, it's offer.

197
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,480
It's fucking awful. I mean it's,
it's, it's really devastating.

198
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,710
A question for you that way around
if it's female to male transition,

199
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,000
uh,

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,020
somebody that used to be a woman that
transitions to a man and wants to compete

201
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:43,650
with the men, they don't have an advantage
to tone. No, they don't allow to write.

202
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,140
They're at a disadvantage.
If they win in that context,

203
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:49,850
they've actually done really good.
Yes. Look, women can beat men. Yeah.

204
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,050
I mean it happens all the time at Jujitsu.
There's,

205
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,080
especially in Jujitsu in
particular because it's such
a technique based art. Uh,

206
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,820
but it is possible.
There's,

207
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,630
there's also a woman named Jermaine Duran
to me who's a worldclass mixed martial

208
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:04,920
artists whose multiple time world Moy
Thai champion of Fatah man and knocked

209
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:09,780
them out. It's crazy video. A real man
Kao them when the straight right it's,

210
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,910
it is possible for them to win if their
skill level is so far superior that it

211
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,110
overcomes the inherent
strength advantages.

212
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,060
But a woman to male transition would
be at a severe disadvantage against a

213
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:26,200
natural male. Would you be so in that
Texas case, they clearly have it wrong.

214
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,640
They should. They should allow him to,
to compete with this and would you be,

215
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,840
whereas I can,

216
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,870
I think all three of us
probably instinctively would
resist the notion that a

217
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:39,871
female than a male to female athlete
competes with other females because they'd

218
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:41,590
have it. One can resist that. Yes.

219
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:46,030
Would you be for a female to
male athlete competing with men?

220
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,150
Yes, because I don't think there's
no honor. There's no event.

221
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,390
But here's the problem and the,

222
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,080
and the consent is sort of running
in the other direction. The marriage,

223
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,940
she is continually putting herself
or he's putting himself in harm's way

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,410
knowingly. And I'm not opposed to a
woman fighting a man if she so chooses.

225
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,990
Like I'm not opposed to
bull riding if you want it.

226
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,260
I'm not lobbying to get
bull riding outlawed,

227
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,950
but if you want to be so fucking stupid
that you climb on top of a 2000 pound

228
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:15,730
angry animal, go for it. And you
should be able to do whatever you want.

229
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,840
I think you should be able to jump out
of fairly good air on airplanes. Know,

230
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,670
if you want to parachute, you should
be able to risk your life. Parachuting.

231
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,360
The difference lies in just massive
advantages and that there's a massive

232
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,580
advantage in transitioning from
male to female, female to male.

233
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,940
Here's the other problem. Female to
Male, you have to take testosterone.

234
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:36,490
You can't legally take
testosterone and compete.

235
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,420
It's been a giant issue in mixed martial
arts because for the longest time there

236
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:44,320
was a loophole and the
loophole was testosterone
therapy and they were allowing

237
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:49,300
testosterone replacement therapy for
male athletes that were either older or

238
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,650
it's, it was, uh,

239
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,420
it was a symptom of having
pituitary gland damage,

240
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,750
which comes from head trauma,
which comes, which means it really,

241
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,660
essentially your career
should be over your,

242
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,040
your body's not producing
hormones correctly.

243
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,910
And that's a very common issue
with people that have been in war.

244
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,150
People that have been blown up by IED
is people that have been hit a lot.

245
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,190
Even soccer players a lot of times show
a diminished levels of testosterone and

246
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,530
growth hormone because of
pituitary gland damage.

247
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,690
So you wouldn't even allow that.

248
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:24,640
So a female to male would be in a whole
nother problem in combat sports because

249
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:27,070
it's not legal for you to
take testosterone and compete.
