1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,740
We're so flawed in our approach.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,570
It's really interesting that it's like
the human body and the human mind is such

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:10,230
an incredibly complicated
biological entity, right?

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,450
Our ability to consciously be
aware of our, our, our life,

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,930
our position in the world,
our mortality,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,750
the insignificance of
us in the greater scale.

7
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,990
All those things are like
there right now all the time.

8
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:27,580
But they don't have any
users manual, right? Exactly.

9
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:31,500
Like we have this incredible machine
that can invent nuclear bombs and

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,930
satellites and there's
no union users mantle,

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,450
no user's manual for the mind or the body,

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,200
especially not in how to manage the
body with the mind. Yeah. Nothing,

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,150
nothing figured out. Bitch wide open.
If you're on your own few people of God,

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,810
you've got to like find these masters,
right?

15
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,280
So if you think about the 300 and
whatever million people we have in this

16
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:50,820
country,

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,820
how many of those people could guide you
towards a a proper integration of mind

18
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:01,371
and body and a positive way of interfacing
with reality that's beneficial to you

19
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:05,790
physically, mentally, spiritually,

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,450
[inaudible] is there a dozen?
Not many.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,450
Isn't it an interesting,
very interesting.

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,480
All these human beings and essentially
most of them trying to improve in some

23
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:20,670
way. Even people that fail on diets,
boy, they'd like to get skinny.

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,830
Even people that you know fail at school.

25
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,480
Why I wish I was smart enough to graduate.

26
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:28,950
I wish I had enough discipline peop
people want to do better so there's this

27
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,951
vast need for coaching that would
lead to improvement yet almost,

28
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,390
I mean nothing to speak of and certainly
not nothing large scale in any city

29
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,210
that has this approach where look,

30
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,290
we're going to teach you how to better
engage with the material world around you

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,790
and the the better engage with reality
itself that's going to leave you a more

32
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,110
spiritually,
physically,

33
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:58,280
emotionally fulfilled like that
seems like that'd be a big business.

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,510
One way to teach this stuff is by
example that if a person exemplifies,

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,060
you know,
good mind body functioning,

36
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:09,480
they can inspire that and another person
that seems like maybe the only way,

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,680
one strategy that I, if I can
do this, if I have a patient,

38
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,060
if I can introduce that patient to
someone who's had their condition is now

39
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:18,840
better.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,580
That is a very powerful way to up their
belief in the possibility of getting

41
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:28,290
better. Yeah, that makes sense. Which is
why people love user testimonials. Right.

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,150
But, but better if you actually meet
the person and show, see for yourself,

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
but use your testimonials are so
huge for that razor. You know,

44
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:39,210
I was skeptical at first,
but then I tried it and boy,

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,670
he was skeptical just like me.
Yeah. It's, uh, it, uh, to me,

46
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,850
when I look at the giant number of
people that are unhappy and displaced and

47
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:56,220
just seem like they're left out
of society, I was listening to,

48
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,780
oh, it was a Johann Hari
on Sam Harris' podcast.

49
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,810
And you were talking about the number of
people that are happy with what they do

50
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:11,390
for a living, happy with
what they do every day. And
it was somewhere around 13%.

51
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,630
Yeah. And then the number of people
that were just like, it's okay.

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,600
I just do it. Like I don't
hate it, but I don't love it.

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,580
That was like in the 60% and then the
rest of the people fucking hated what they

54
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:27,550
did.
So the vast majority,

55
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,490
some ungodly number,
you know,

56
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:35,080
like 87% of people hate what
they're doing. Oh, how sad.

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,130
Or if don't hate it, they don't want to
be doing it. And they do it all the time.

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,780
Yeah.
That's crazy.

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,000
That that has to have a profound
effect on all aspects of your life.

60
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,240
Right.
