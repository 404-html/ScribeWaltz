1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,340
Now Joe, I'm going to talk
to you about your language.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,800
Why the fuck do you swear so much?
I Dunno.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,500
Have you read anything about
the science of swearing? No.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,260
Do you know that there is a
science of swearing? Escience? Yes.

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,940
It's pretty interesting stuff.
Oh,

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,970
so the part of your brain that produces
swear words is not the part of the brain

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,830
that manages ordinary language.
Really interesting. Uh, you know,

8
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:27,150
we have two language centers
in our left frontal cortex. Uh,

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,770
people that have strokes that damage
them often lose language completely,

10
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:36,000
but they can still swear.
So swearing is coming from somewhere else.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,880
It may be coming from
the right hemisphere,

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,140
but it's also coming from deeper centers
in the brain that connect to the limbic

13
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:47,850
system and the Amygdala. And that connects
to the involuntary nervous system.

14
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,660
So here's a couple of interesting facts.
Okay.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,460
A swearing is associated with sweating,
increased sweating.

16
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,300
So you should be dripping with
sweat that much. I'm a comedian,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm sure. It's also
interesting swearing, uh,

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,180
increases pain tolerance. And there's
an interesting experiment. You know,

19
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,980
the standard way they do paint columns.

20
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:11,730
They have people stick their hand in a
bucket of ice and water and you see how

21
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,050
long they can keep it there.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,940
That people who say fuck shit can keep
it there much longer than people who are

23
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:22,170
not allowed to swear. What about
noises? What if they just go, ah,

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,910
ah no, it was swearing specifically.
So they've tried noises and swearing.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,690
So it may be, you know, when
you, uh, if you're hammering
a nail and hit your thumb,

26
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,870
you use one of those words.
That's a good strategy.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,900
That's interesting because I almost
always do that. If I heard something,

28
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,100
especially a finger like a
slammed a car door the other day,

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,030
he said that's what that is. But that's,
yeah. And it's interesting. It's coming.

30
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,780
There's a different part of the brain
that manages that and it has different

31
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,100
emotional content. Yeah. It
flavors language. Yes. I live them.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,660
I'm a big fan of the squares.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,930
I'll leave you some papers
about the science of swearing.
It's interesting. Yeah.

34
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,670
It's very interesting now what it will,

35
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,980
what would happen if there were no
longer taboo with the same eight their,

36
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,510
I think they lose their power
because that, yeah, right.

37
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,830
The same areas of the brain wouldn't,
I remember there was an episode of,

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,770
I don't remember what television show,
but it was a on CBS. Yeah. And uh,

39
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,500
they had a line at the end of the
show and essentially they were saying,

40
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:22,080
shit happens and it was a big deal.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,470
I'll bet it was a big deal that they
want it to be able to say shit happens.

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,980
And apparently they pulled this off and
they got it through and it was like a

43
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:32,370
10:00 PM show. So it was okay. And it was
11 o'clock by the time they said Shit.

44
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,580
And a, I remember thinking
like, wow, what a strange,

45
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,840
sort of like how many people were
involved in this sort of dance,

46
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,820
like how many lawyers and executives
and who, it's very strange,

47
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:48,690
very strange that this one word w
tr everybody knows the word, right.

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,400
It's not even that. It's kind of a,
you know, a kind of game. We all, yes.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,821
So,

50
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:58,821
but you're saying this game is facilitated
by one specific part of the brain and

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,270
so that because like I don't swear, words
are taboo words, right? Taboo words.

52
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:08,260
And I'll often associated with
things that we find offensive, uh,

53
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:12,350
or with bodily acts that freak
people out. So, but so there's both,

54
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,860
there's a psychological
social aspect to it,

55
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,810
but there's also a
neurological aspect to it.

56
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,550
Now when the words like some,
some words for some people,

57
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,750
like I remember when I was a kid, uh, I
lived in Florida for a little bit and uh,

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,810
I said,
hell once and uh,

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,390
in Florida in the 1970s,
hell was a swear. Like, uh,

60
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,870
yeah,
I don't know.

61
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:38,600
I mean I came from New Jersey and then
I was in San Francisco and then all

62
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,960
sudden I was in Florida and I
said, hell. And they're like,

63
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,610
don't swear like that in this class.
I was like,

64
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,760
swear the fuck are you
people talking about?

65
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,740
Like it doesn't make any sense to me.
And that I was like,

66
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,170
you guys have different swears. Yeah. Now,

67
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:54,160
if you had a word that
was not taboo to you,

68
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,780
would it be,
would that same area of your brain?

69
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,590
I know, no, this is, there has
not been a lot of research.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,610
It hasn't been taken seriously.
But that's all interesting questions.

71
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,020
It shouldn't have buddy.
Because some,

72
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:10,780
I mean if you're a really
super conservative person,

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,280
there's a lot of words that are off the
table. Yeah. But if you are a far more,

74
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,590
but you know she's loose with your
language, you could shit this and this,

75
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,330
God dammit. You know, that
would be nothing like Goddamn,

76
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,710
it would be just like Aww shucks.
Yeah, yeah. But to someone, God damn,

77
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,770
it would be like a really bad deal.
Really big deal.

78
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,370
So like what it would be different parts
of the brain would be activated by that

79
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,710
versus if you said it,
it would be not that big a deal,

80
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,460
but if someone was like super conservative
and they said, or even yeah, more. Wow.

81
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,430
Yeah. Interesting. What do you
think that that is a universal,

82
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,640
I mean it seems to be, seems to be
university seems to be universal.

83
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,570
Another finding that came across is
that people who learn a second language,

84
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,800
that swearing in the second language
does not have the same emotional impact

85
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,350
that your first language.
Does that make sense?

86
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,640
That's why they're so fun
when you learn Spanish swears,

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,540
it's like you get a free ride. Yeah.
Yeah. That's, that's interesting. Yeah.

88
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,280
That makes sense. Yeah. And you can
do them on television too, right?

89
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:16,180
You can say a lot of Spanish swears on
English speaking TV and everybody just

90
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,060
pleads ignorance. Do you,
so does every language, yes.

91
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,690
They all have sweaters. Every
language has words. Swear words. Wow.

92
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,410
That's universal. That is really
interesting. It'd be Asian languages,

93
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:33,130
European languages, all
of them, Huh. Wow. Huh.

94
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,690
So that, that would, at least to my brain,

95
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,190
seem to indicate that there's
like some use for that. Yes. Well,

96
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,910
probably many uses.
One is this thing of a modulating pain.

97
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,870
What does a social bonding, you
know, forming some community. Yeah.

98
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,780
That's how I kind of use it.
I think when I swear in front of people,

99
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:56,340
I'm testing them out. Yeah. Like you
freaking out. If I say, fuck you,

100
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,940
I can't talk to you. Right. Like,
you too much work. Right. You know?

101
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,510
You know what I mean?

102
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,510
I know exactly what you're talking to
someone in every other word like quo.

103
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,170
We're really wished you wouldn't
use that language. Well, okay. Yeah.

104
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,840
This is so much work to do
here. I can't, I know exactly.

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,490
Hold your hand dance through this
garden. Right? Yeah. It's, um,

106
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,470
it's to me also like,

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,910
I hang around with a lot of people that
swear a lot because I hang around with

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,120
professional comedians and fighters and
there's a lot of swashbuckling freewill

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,050
and type of individuals
involved in those pursuits.
