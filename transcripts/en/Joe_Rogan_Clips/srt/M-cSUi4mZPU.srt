1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,950
Hello Freak bitches because you're,
we're going way, way, way back. The,

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:09,990
the real issue.
This is like a year before,

3
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:12,720
more than a year before
everything went sideways. Oh yeah.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,880
What went sideways and why? So you're
this Super Progressive Vegan guy,

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,890
but what went sideways?
So I'm an ex of mine.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,570
I'm an ex of mine.
Uh,

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,470
I'm trying to think about like
how much I can say, um, started.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,700
Um, it was weird, like girls I was dating,

9
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:37,830
like she would kind of
like pop up and be like,

10
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,160
following them on like social media.
And I kind of was like, all right,

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,960
it's a little weird. Um, girls, you were
dating, but you were married at the time.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,410
So what was also not talked about in these
articles is that for the last however

13
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:53,340
many years before, um, Alison,
I got separated. We were
in an open relationship.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,920
We just didn't,
we talked about it on the show eventually,

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,800
but for a while we didn't talk about it.
Um,

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,040
and which to anyone in a
fucking open relationship,

17
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,960
like it's a nightmare when you're not
talking about it because you feel like a,

18
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,030
a lecherous cheating creep,
uh,

19
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,770
cause you're in an open relationship
and you don't talk about it.

20
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:15,330
So then when girls meet you and you tell
them like, yeah, right, yeah, totally.

21
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:20,280
When you go, I'm in a secret
open relationship, like
you're full of shit. Um,

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,730
and so, you know, I like kind
of did the road of thing,

23
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:28,440
but like felt like a fucking creep and
three meaning hookup with girls. Yeah.

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,720
And, uh, and then, uh, uh, you
know, I was finally just like,

25
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:37,560
we have to talk about it and
at this point, and I don't
want to shit on anybody,

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,330
uh, you know, at this point,
um, you know, my cohost and I,

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,450
we were like, we were pretty much
just like really good friends, right.

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,170
Who lived together and did
a show together. And, um,

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,560
so years later, years after, um,

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,690
me and this girl broke up years after
all this shit, I'm living in La.

31
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,500
Um, I have, uh, I've had
a girlfriend for a year.

32
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:06,360
It's like a very healthy, wonderful
relationship. Um, years after all this,

33
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,160
I guess what happened was
one of these girls, um,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,320
essentially started to try to find any
girl who has been pissed off by me before

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,390
and they found enough for an article that,
um,

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,250
I think like two articles came out.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,970
I left to do some radio because the show
was getting a ton of complaints. Um,

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,080
because our inner circle started to
find out that there were quote unquote

39
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:35,610
accusations, which the word accusation
makes it sound Weinstein. Um,

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,540
accusations of, so that's what
they were saying. But there was,

41
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,190
it was very unspecific.
What I've read,

42
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,910
they said predatory behavior and I was
like, oh, meaning he's trying to get laid.

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,050
That's what a man does.

44
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,070
Not Predatory in the sense of you're
victimizing someone to raping someone or

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,290
doing something horrible
to someone or even,

46
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,030
and this is when my own words kind
of bit me in the ass because you,

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,840
I spent an entire year a or
years being like, you know,

48
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:04,690
a Hashtag believe women. And then you
read that and you go to that Hashtag.

49
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,310
Don't believe when it like you
don't know what to do. And like I,

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,350
I was always like, if you call girl who
accuses you, uh, uh, you know crazy.

51
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,270
You're just projecting
and like you're trying to,

52
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,240
and then suddenly I'm reading this
article, I'm like, this is fucking crazy.

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,160
And I didn't, uh, all of my style on
one article you talking about the,

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,250
there's a decibel.
Yeah,

55
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:26,230
there was a decibel article and Hell
hath no fury like a woman scorned man. I,

56
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,064
uh,

57
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,040
it was really bad and I read it for the
first time and I don't want to go into

58
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:34,150
details because I don't want to shit on
people who like, feel like they were, um,

59
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:39,190
you know, hurt or whatever.
Um, but a good majority,

60
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,320
the article isn't even fucking true.
Um,

61
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,670
there was one part where Jazz Abella even
wrote it. Like if we can make it better

62
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,340
journalism because it's
one woman who wrote it.

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,890
Oh, Yay. Oh yeah, totally. So this, so
the author, there's one moment in it,

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,360
and I'll try and make this a about
journalism and not about the, the woman,

65
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:02,361
but one of the complaints about
me was I had a consensual night,

66
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,630
um, with a lady in Nashville, um,

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,540
who I guess because she like listened
to the show. Maybe they're like,

68
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,470
that's predatory because you're
like famous. And I was like, mom,

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,760
no one else thinks I'm fucking famous.
Uh,

70
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,100
well, wait a minute, wait
a minute. Wait a minute.

71
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,320
There were defining as predatory because
you're famous. That's part of it.

72
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,750
Every time Mick Jagger gets laid,
it's predatory.

73
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,860
That's part of it. That's what
I don't, that's the thing.

74
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,070
And it was the way I don't fucking
call me. If I'm Mick Jagger famous,

75
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,840
you can call me a fucking predator.
If I'm,

76
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,920
I can barely get a plus one to a Vegan
festival. Famous like, don't please

77
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,070
do not call me a predator. I mean, look,
it's, there's levels to fame, right?

78
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,350
And I know you're being self
deprecating and everything like that,

79
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:44,720
but you did have a nice
following and you did,

80
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,340
I saw some of your videos online where
you did big crowds. So it's not, no,

81
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,790
it's not like you didn't have
fans give that fence but,

82
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,820
but the idea that you liking some woman
who is a fan and her liking you like

83
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:04,130
that somehow under the Europe Predator
because she enjoys your work is crazy.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,610
What is that how they were defining
it? Because I don't know. And then,

85
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:11,240
but then it seems like they're being
very convenient, their definition

86
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,190
and, and, and that was part of
it. There was like, uh, uh, um,

87
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,350
there was another one where it was like,
yeah,

88
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,900
the predatory stuff's
specifically was that,

89
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:25,490
and then what was even more fucked
up about the article was it said,

90
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,900
um,
and I'm not going to quote exactly.

91
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,940
She also wrote into another
podcast and I heard this,

92
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,160
but essentially what the woman said,
we did not sleep together.

93
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:35,540
It alluded that we slept together.

94
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,570
It didn't say that I was in
an open relationship, but
we didn't sleep together.

95
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,370
Um, she told me she didn't want to, uh,
uh, sleep together and I was like, great,

96
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,430
no problem. She's like, I don't want to,
I don't want it to go further than that,

97
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,610
you know? Okay. So I was like,
cool, even if you change your mind,

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,700
we're not going to do it. Got
It. And then in the article,

99
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:57,070
in the article about me being a Predator,
it's like I felt so safe and,

100
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,880
and it was a great night and I was like,

101
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,990
this sounds like an article about
BP in a good dude. And then it said,

102
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:07,240
but then weeks later she
heard on the podcast that uh,

103
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,020
she was just a quote road fuck.

104
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,020
And then Jessebelle in parentheses is
one Arthur from Jess about and fantasy

105
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:15,860
said, Jessebelle could
not find the clip. Right.

106
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,190
Cause it doesn't fucking exist because
I'm not going to call someone a road fuck

107
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:22,520
next to my wife on my feminist podcast.
Not only that,

108
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,710
you're not going to say it if you
didn't even have sex with them.

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,080
We didn't have sex.
Right. So this is just,

110
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,910
they just decided to take
this characterization by
this one woman that's it and

111
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,670
flavor the article.
Yes and very unfair.

112
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,700
No and dude like is this punishment you
think for you because you somehow or

113
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,460
another. So that's why it becomes easy
and and just to be like incredibly clear.

114
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:47,060
Like if this woman was like hurt by that,
like that sucks man.

115
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,450
I've been burned by girls do anything.
If she didn't,

116
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,170
if she was hurt because you didn't
eventually become her girlfriend,

117
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,310
her boyfriend rather.
That's just on her. Sure.

118
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,910
Unless you're ms
character. No, no, no, no.

119
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:05,920
It's Catherine just trying to be, you're
trying to be nice to be nice. Yeah.

120
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,320
I assume she is probably,
you know,

121
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:11,030
I mean she's probably taken
out of context as well.

122
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,360
There's a real problem with writing
things about people and one of the real

123
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:17,030
problems with writing things about people
is they don't get a chance to respond

124
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:18,800
in real time to things you're saying.

125
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:21,020
So you establish a narrative
and then you keep going with it.

126
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,080
You write paragraph after paragraph
with no s no one responding to them.

127
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,140
A month later, I, I saw like the,
the, the woman who wrote the article,

128
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,560
like there was a request in my like,
other inbox and Facebook that like,

129
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:37,820
you don't even see and like for a comment.
So like, I mean, she did reach out. Um,

130
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,160
but at that point I was,
uh,

131
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,610
at that point I was literally googling
ways to kill myself. So I'm like, I did,

132
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,900
I could not get back to googling ways to
kill yourself for real. Yeah. For Real.

133
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,810
So, well just to like why put
against this on the article.

134
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,960
So here's what happened, and this
goes to your, your question before,

135
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,500
because I had called so many people sexist
because I had sort of made my almost

136
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,010
career by that.
Um,

137
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,840
it was a fucking fun man
when people heard about this,

138
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,650
like,

139
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,810
and you see the headlines and this is
another like problem with like clickbait

140
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,650
journalism. The headlines look
like I was fucking accused of rape.

141
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,830
There was a one article that
used the word sexual harassment.

142
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,650
Sexual misconduct was in all the
headlines that I have no fucking idea.

143
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,820
So seen that one about people
connected to Harvey Weinstein,

144
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,590
like about Ben Affleck, they call it
sexual misconduct. What does that mean?

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,270
Like in something that you don't think
they should do? What's really creepy?

146
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,890
Eagle and I almost lost a job.

147
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,250
I did just lose a gig because
when you Google and B,

148
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:44,510
it's like sexual misconduct stuff. And
like that's really scary. And again,

149
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,420
I don't want to be like, you know who
the real victim of Harvey Weinstein is?

150
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,290
Jamie Kilstein. Right. But like,
uh, let me just stop you right here.

151
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:53,890
If you say like one more time,
I fucking head's gonna explode too.

152
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,980
And I get comments like
that. It's brutal. It's a

153
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,640
brutal, is it as bad as I
just want you to slow it down.

154
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,050
I'm gonna use it every now and then. This
coffee over here, breaking the light.

155
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,650
The light meter. I'm gonna do it
too, man. A lot of people do it.

156
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,350
It's an easy one to do, switch
to water, but that word is a,

157
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,250
it's an, um, it's, uh, people use it
as, um, I know, I know. It's okay.

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,600
I do it too. We all do it, but it's
just, it's nice to know. Yeah, no, I,

159
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:25,620
it's also a very progressive thing.
Like there's a way like that people talk,

160
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:28,700
like when they're really progressive
that like you don't hear like leftwing

161
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,070
people talk. I keep getting
fucked over by the progressive's.

162
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,440
It's a way of a peering.
Um, what's the word?

163
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:42,000
Submissive or
passive?

164
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah. It's not a, it's not an aggressive
way of communicating. All right.

165
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,940
What if I said like,
but like I kept like punching the table,

166
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,870
like as I did it on a
fucking, like much, you know,

167
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,480
like go to like step to me
just smash a paps. Uh, can.

168
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,320
Um,
so,

169
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,410
so you got a bunch of people that were
upset at you because you had embodied

170
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,380
the quintessential allies.
So it was there.

171
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,800
Nobody had a reason to
like me or to defend me.

172
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,070
On one half of the Twitter sphere you
had progressive's who thought I was a

173
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:19,900
sexual creep.

174
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,220
And then on the other half you
have comedy fans who are like,

175
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:27,580
fuck this dude.
He's the one who called everyone a sexist.

176
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,340
You don't need to read the article.
If you see a headline, I mean, God,

177
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:32,860
I attacked so many people without
fucking reading the articles.

178
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,280
Of course there are people to this day
that will come up on citizen radio that I

179
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:37,660
don't know why I was mad at,

180
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:40,720
I would just figure out the story as
we were covering it and be like, Yup,

181
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,280
fuck that guy. I guess. Yeah,
of course. And so nobody,

182
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:48,040
there was no reason to root for me.
There wasn't a strong enough fan base.

183
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:52,090
It wasn't like if, you know, a, a
bigger comic gets accused of something.

184
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,090
Well he has thousands or millions of fans
and then this small community who are

185
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,350
accused him of something
I had sort of nobody,

186
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,860
and when I burnt all the bridges
and in comedy and you know,

187
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,290
I never just showed up at clubs
to do sets and stuff like that.

188
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:09,880
I just had this audience and sort of
thought I could never get fired, you know?

189
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,280
Um,
like when,

190
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,050
when Allie and I sort of became more
platonic before the open relationship.

191
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,380
I mean, there were days it
was, it was so, uh, you know,

192
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:23,620
I mean I would sleep on the couch but
there were days I would go on the road and

193
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:26,560
I would not cheat and I would go back
to the hotel and sure cough and like my

194
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,990
orgasm was better cause I'm like,
I saved citizen radio.

195
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:32,230
Like I was trying so hard not to,

196
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,480
not to do anything like that.
And so anyway, I lost. Yeah,

197
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:39,860
there was no one to root for me.
I just had the small audience.

198
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:40,720
It's a small audience.

199
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,920
Either thinks I'm a Predator or they're
too nervous to say anything. Well

200
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,190
you fit the Quintess you,
you,

201
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,220
there's a classic view of what a male
feminist is and that classic view is a

202
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,950
sneaky guy

203
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,000
that is like getting in tight with women
and saying all the things they really

204
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:58,834
want to hear.

205
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,730
And the classic story is that those women
are never attracted to that guy anyway.

206
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:06,550
And one up and go and fuck some jocks,
some Alpha Guy.

207
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,880
I mean that's literally what happens.
Yeah. You don't say like do you,

208
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,530
but it's just this thing that
people, there's, it's just,

209
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,770
well,
it's a cliche and I totally,

210
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:22,300
and I also think it was the homophobic
politician who sucks the deck right

211
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,730
there. Like the Super
Religious Guy who, uh,

212
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,480
turns out to actually be gay.
Like Ted,

213
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,570
what does that kind of thing
to the guy from Colorado?

214
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,470
Can we just say careers and start a bar?
You probably could take rice.

215
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,150
Uh, yeah. And so it
haggard Ted Haggard. Yes.

216
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,130
And to try to have a bit about
them and who didn't we have, right.

217
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,310
And so this is what happens.
Yeah. This is sort of the,

218
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:53,050
the problem with acting like you
don't have flaws. And I always did.

219
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:53,801
I thought on the show,

220
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:58,801
my favorite parts of my show were when
I talked about depression or alcoholism

221
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:03,790
and, and we were getting emails in
from people who, you know, it's edited,

222
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:08,220
really helped them. And I wanted to talk
so much more about that stuff because I,

223
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,800
I do think it's important to examine
your flaws, but on a political level,

224
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,140
I held myself up. It's
like an untouchable, well,

225
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:19,540
I think you were doing essentially the
same thing that you were talking about

226
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:24,070
doing on Twitter where you're addicted
to this positive response and you're

227
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:28,710
addicted to saying these things
about people attacking people there.

228
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,600
There's, this is a, it's a
real problem on the left.
