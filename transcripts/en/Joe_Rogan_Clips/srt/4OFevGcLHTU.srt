1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,730
The joe rogan experience from that show
and then straight into hard to kill the

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:09,960
show for the discovery channel from going
then deployed to Africa like this year.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,070
I don't even know.
I can't even,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,950
how does that all work
while you're still serving?

5
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:17,160
Like how do you get the freedom to do
all these different things when you read

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,030
after you reenlisted. So the army
will always get with the army once,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,160
um,
first of all,

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
but it's got to help them having you
be so high profile tentative of the

9
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:33,120
military. If you're listening right now,
go to your local recruiter. That's why.

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,260
But seriously, we are having
special forces specifically we are,

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,210
we are going to have the biggest
deficit of eligible up a pool,

12
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,920
a population to select from because
you have to have a certain level of

13
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,810
intelligence search,

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,660
certain level of physicality just to be
eligible for special forces to pick from

15
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:55,290
you. That pool is the smallest
that has ever been in history.

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,020
Why kids are playing video games.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,480
They're not eating Cheetos,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,870
they're less participation in sports.
I mean,

19
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,100
if you could just go to a high school,

20
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,520
it'll look at a high school are
now compared to 20 years ago.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,170
It's a different thing.
Really. Yeah. We, we,

22
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:16,171
we weren't like barely getting
kids past obesity 20 years ago.

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,850
Now in a high school,
if you walk into a classroom,

24
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,140
half the kids are obese.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,290
So you think this is just because they're
sedentary because of playing video

26
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,870
games and fucking around online all day.
It's not just,

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,540
it's not me thinking this is us.

28
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,220
Absolutely quantifiably saying we do
not have enough people to to pick from.

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,170
Right. And that would be one of the best
ways to really find out what the actual

30
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,300
average health of viable
males is. Right? Yeah,

31
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,020
for sure.

32
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,400
There's always going to be the best of
the best that want to test themselves.

33
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,270
I mean, this is just always how it's
been. So we teach hundreds of courses.

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,780
We only have that hundred,
we only get six or eight,

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,290
but that's a hundred people that
go to special forces selection.

36
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,880
That hundred that goes, they have
to have a GT score. They have to,

37
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:10,140
they have to have a scores high enough
on the military entrance exams just to be

38
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:10,620
eligible.

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,340
They have to have a PT score high enough
just to be eligible so we can't even

40
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:18,210
get that hundred and then of that hundred
only eight or the eight of them are

41
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:21,690
making it. So we're, we're, this
is, to answer your question,

42
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:25,620
how I'm able to do these things is I'm
in a position where I can say for the

43
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,050
love of God,
please get healthy.

44
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,010
Please walk to your recruiter's office
and please take a test to see if you're

45
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:36,420
eligible. Because we are just
needing people like we've
never needed them before.

46
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,240
Jesus Christ. It's scary. Wow. Well
that's one of the best indications.

47
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,400
I mean most people don't know,
like people like me,

48
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm 50 year old father
taxpayer out there do much.

49
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,580
I'm not paying attention to what fucking
high school kids looking at it. I know.

50
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:54,000
I've no idea. Yeah, I do go to like a
marine recruiter right now and be like,

51
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,230
hey bro,
how's your job right now?

52
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,560
And there's a fight him from taking
that pen and stabbing it into his eye

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,850
because he just can't get
somebody that isn't smoking weed.

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,910
Somebody that can pass a PT test,

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,480
somebody that can pass the tape test
and it's somebody that can past what's a

56
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,460
tape test. I'm like, they're not.

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,460
So we measure their neck and their waist
and they can't even pass that so that

58
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:21,870
too fat. The two fat has the
neck too little or too big. Um,

59
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,040
so if you have a big neck, right,
and a big waste, this is, um,

60
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,690
cause like I have a big neck. Right,
but it's from working. Yeah. Yeah.

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,940
But I have a tiny little waist, so that
gives me my BMI and my body fat. You know,

62
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,500
they measure, it's, it's a pretty,
it's, it's a gross measurement, height,

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,810
weight and measurement.
Right. And the other,

64
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,130
there's only like four things that we
need for some, for us to say. Yeah.

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,660
It's harder to get into military
than it is to get in college. That's,

66
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,950
that's absolutely true. Not Regular
military, but special forest.

67
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:54,190
So regular military. Yeah.
Really? Yes. It is not easy.

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,520
And then from that we only
pick combat arms and then, oh,

69
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,650
that combat arms,
we only picked the top hundreds.

70
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,810
It harder for someone to get it to the
military than it is to get into college.

71
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,970
I thought it was fairly easy
to get into the military.

72
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,510
I'm pretty sure anybody can go to college.

73
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,580
Anybody. Well, you can go to community
college. That's college, right? Yeah. Um,

74
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,910
I'm not saying it's as easy
to get into MIT. Right.

75
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,740
But anybody can go to, some calls can go
to any college that they want, not any,

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,740
any color they can get in,
they can go to, you know,

77
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,600
local community college and then two
years there they can go and get into the

78
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,340
next unit.
You know,

79
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,630
like the state you school and then from
there they can get a right. I mean,

80
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:38,810
anybody can do that, right? Well, you
can't go to the military, be smoke weed.

81
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,650
You can't go to the military if you have
bad eyes, you can't go to the military.

82
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,260
If you're diabetic, you can't
go to the military. If you
have asthma, you can't go.

83
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,520
You can do, you can go to college if you
have all those things right. You know,

84
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,730
you, you can't go into the
military if your Iq is x
number, depending on your job,

85
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,990
well,
you can still go to college.

86
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,940
You can't go in the military if you can't
run a mile or two miles in this speed

87
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:00,930
and do this number of pushups
and this many of sit ups.

88
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,870
I don't think any college
has that requirement.

89
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,920
So I'm just in those seven things alone.
We just cry.

90
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,310
We just exed out 80% of our population.
And do you have,

91
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,150
is there also a problem with people's
attitude towards the military, um,

92
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,350
with young people? Yeah, a
little bit, but that, that,

93
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,830
that is mostly a physical issue
that is way less of an issue.

94
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:26,180
The perception of military is way
less of an issue than us just having a

95
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:30,470
qualified population of viable
candidates for us to pick from. I mean,

96
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:34,200
it's really bad where we're,
we're freaking, we were,

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,560
we were borderline freaking
out about what we're gonna do.

98
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,660
So an average special forces the ODA,
um,

99
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,540
has I supposed to have
12 guys in it? Right. Um,

100
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,200
right now you're not going to find
a team that has more than 10 and,

101
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,750
okay.

102
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,140
We only have 70% of our teams with 10.

103
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,560
Yes.

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,393
Yeah.

105
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,620
Thank God we didn't go to war with North
Korea if they got at war ended and that

106
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,400
we're not dropping nuclear bombs
on anybody because we're in,

107
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,510
we're in a hurt locker for qualified
to have no idea about this. No,

108
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,070
it's scary. Wow. So
this is my part of that.

109
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:17,960
One of the best ways to measure what's
wrong with the way people are living

110
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,780
today. Yeah. I mean,

111
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,040
forget about whether or not they
want to go and serve the, the,

112
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,880
the viable quality candidates like this.

113
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,630
A number of them that are even
available is the lowest it's ever been.

114
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,770
Well, what about high school athletics? I
mean, have they decreased, finished? Yeah.

115
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,280
Really? Yup. The same rate. The
party, very, very similar. Um,

116
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,770
the participation and not
so you can go and play,

117
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,480
um,
for your,

118
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,700
the rec time volleyball.

119
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,020
But to get onto the the varsity football
team or the varsity volleyball team or

120
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:01,040
the varsity track team,
the number of people in percentage to the,

121
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,470
so if you have a thousand people,

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,520
you had a hundred of them that were
picked to participate in those athletics.

123
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,560
All right. Should we at 10%, that
number now is down to like five or 6%.

124
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:13,790
So the,

125
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,790
the overall percentage per capita of
number of people participating in these

126
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,030
sports has been consistently
decreasing for the past 20 years.

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,130
Wow. 20 years in 20 years is essentially
when the Internet became a huge thing.

128
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,121
Yeah.
I mean,

129
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:33,350
that's basically the same timeline you're
looking at like 94 99 you see obesity

130
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,810
going like this. Yeah. Wow.

131
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,890
You got bad food. We got to opt to, our
jobs are getting less and less physical.

132
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,020
The, the focus on what jobs people
should have. Everybody's been like,

133
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,640
I'll go to college and you're like,

134
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:53,990
become an academic so you can be this
intellectual that can go and do this job.

135
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:56,750
And then you graduated from college with
a student loan and you have no job to

136
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:00,500
go to. Um, where there's
this guy that needs welders,

137
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,520
but it's not cool to be a water, so
don't, don't do that. Or to be a mechanic,

138
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,930
like all these trade jobs that are just
begging and pleading for and they are

139
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,950
sometimes physical, but they need people.
But it's not core to do that because,

140
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,131
you know,

141
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:16,640
like I want to go to and we'll go to long
beach state or I want to go to UCLA or

142
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:21,380
you know, I don't want, I want to go
hang out with a bunch of hot chicks. Lsu,

143
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,180
you know, it's, the focus has
been wrong for a while and uh,

144
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,050
and that is evident in special forces
selection when we don't have anybody to

145
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,080
pick from. We can't select. Wow,

146
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,480
why don't we hear about this?

147
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,230
Is it something that we're
trying to keep posher it,

148
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,560
it has been a problem
because our community motto
is the quiet professionals.

149
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,190
Mm. That's our motto. How
do you fit into that? Yeah,

150
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:56,070
I don't, I mean, I get so
much crap all the time. Um,

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,240
but thank God like guys that really
understand what I'm trying to do. They,

152
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,100
they realize I don't shut up because
I'm trying to help the regiment.

153
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,300
I'm trying the best ways that I can,

154
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:09,390
the best ways that we can figure out with
people way smarter than me helping me.

155
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:09,800
You know,

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,170
I was on the phone yesterday with some
of the best and brightest in the special

157
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,870
operations recruiting battalion
about how were we going to fix this?

158
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:20,340
How are we going to market? How are
we going to develop interest? And, um,

159
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,050
so thankfully they're smarter
than me. Um, but we were almost

160
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,990
screwing ourselves over because that is

161
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,123
what,

162
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,000
how we live. And that's how we would do
our job. If you read about us on the news,

163
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:39,200
we failed. You know, if you write about
army special forces doing something,

164
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,430
we met, we have done messed up you.
Now, this is not the navy seals.

165
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,670
We're not writing books. You know,
we're not talking about our exploits.

166
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,360
We didn't kill bin Ladin.
Um,

167
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,190
this is us just doing our work and
nobody's supposed to know about it.

168
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,010
But because of that,
we now have a huge recruiting problem.

169
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,070
Okay.
