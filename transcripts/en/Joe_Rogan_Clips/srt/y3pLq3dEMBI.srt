00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,883
Hello

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,360
bitches.
You know,

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,580
one of the things when we were talking
about that I think is kind of important,

4
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,810
like when you're talking about um,

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,960
immigration and like bad
apples and stuff like that.

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,390
I look at immigration as same way.
I look at gun control.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,500
Like most people that have guns are law
abiding citizens and it's not going to

8
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,720
be a problem. The vast, vast majority,

9
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,220
and I think that's the same case with
immigration and the same case of people

10
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,130
coming to America, even the
illegally, they want to do better.

11
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:26,911
That's why they're coming here.

12
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:30,020
They're not coming here because they
want to start crying. Sure. They,

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,860
most of them are coming here
because they want opportunity.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,740
It's with guns.
I totally agree.

15
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,560
I want a shotgun so badly
when I needed a double barrel,

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,220
like I don't want to shotgun and I'm,
I've shot a lot of guns should,

17
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,560
especially with the daily show,
I've done shot guns for the daily show.

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,730
You guys going to be telling jokes?

19
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:51,510
Going to have to learn how to fucking
clear room out and defend yourself. Okay.

20
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,610
All right. Now, this is a
Thompson machine gun discipline.

21
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,350
Very important for the daily Cheryl,

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,290
not 50 caliber sniper busters.
50 calibers are ridiculous.

23
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,340
Dude, I will show you
a video after this. Uh,

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,470
actually maybe this hasn't really even
aired because it was part of a pilot that

25
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:15,230
I did that did. I did a pilot for comedy
central when I left the daily show.

26
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,960
It was an anti travel show
called displaced sucks.

27
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,780
I didn't go, dude, I'll send it
to you. Great idea. Just the con

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,040
dude. It's the fucking funny. You
know what they said? What you mean?

29
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:31,630
Everybody said it was too mean.
It's fucking hilarious. I go,

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,240
we stayed in Kansas City. I go, hey
everybody, my name is Al Madrigal.

31
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,580
I'm in Kansas City. I'm going to
tell you why this place sucks.

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,420
Just shit all over it and it just,
just do that online. Oh yeah.

33
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:45,330
I should just put them out 20 minutes.
A great idea for all things comedy.

34
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:49,140
Why don't you just like buy or make idea?
I totally just do you own the idea?

35
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,010
My idea? Oh my God, that's
a great idea. So that idea,

36
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,930
like as soon as you set it up,
you know,

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,930
someone says an idea and a light
bulb goes off, easy show, real id.

38
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:59,290
And I do it and see it.
Francisco

39
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,630
and I'd do it to San
Francisco is fucking filthy.

40
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,270
It is one of the dirtiest cities I've
ever been through in my entire life.

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,160
And also it's like filled with rich
douche bags now because of the, you know,

42
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,070
Internet boom.

43
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:12,610
And then all of this tech boom and
the poor people are getting moved out.

44
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:16,330
There's so much stuff to make fun
of. So anyway, I'm hate kind of a,

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
I went to this place oh and be
guns and I shot and machine guns,

46
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:23,710
handguns, like a shot, everything.

47
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:27,280
And then for the daily show I went
and I saw it was, I drove a tank,

48
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,980
I got to drive tanks. I was doing this
chieftain tanks that I was driving.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,810
I got to run over to Saturn's in a tank.
Really? Yeah. It's fucking awesome.

50
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,910
How do you drive a tank? Like,
what do you, what do you not, yeah,

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,100
it's levers and there's uh, so
um, yeah, you could watch it.

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,110
And there was this hot chick that they
had that was working there that was on it

53
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:53,170
with me and at the same place
I got to fire machine guns,

54
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:58,171
but I feel like when it comes to automatic
weapons and a 50 caliber sniper and

55
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,310
all that shit, I don't understand
why you need to own that.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,450
I liked shooting it. I'll go shoot
that stuff again. I really enjoyed it.

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,480
He couldn't see me shoot
that 50 caliber thing.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,150
Like there was a shockwave or yeah,
like your,

59
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:18,151
your head flies but you couldn't watch
my arms and the skin on my arms ripple

60
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,120
after I fucking hurt cause I,
I wore a sleeveless shirt to shoot it.

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,750
Boom. Wow. And uh, I enjoyed it.

62
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,680
I liked shooting that shit and I want
the shotgun to defend my house when

63
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,700
everything goes to hell. Yes.
I'm be apocalypse and a shotgun.

64
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,530
I want just somebody to here
get the fuck away from the door.

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,020
You know what I have by my bed right now?

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,800
Hammers Hammer.
I have a hammer,

67
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,070
like bill makes fun of me.
Like he thinks it's the craziest thing.

68
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,250
Like you keep it by your bed.
I keep a hammer under my bed,

69
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,610
like I'm going to fucking
get up and close in contact.

70
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:02,590
Like hammered somebody's death. Yeah.
And it seems like you thought it through,

71
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,210
like really,
really like on a surface level.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,750
I have a magnum flashlight and I can't
fly magnum flashlight. Yeah. Peter,

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,570
that always kills me when people
think they're going to clubs.

74
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:16,300
Somebody with flashlight. No, no, I
want to, I'm a flashlight in one hand.

75
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,120
So blind them and then fucking
running. Hammer. Hammer.

76
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,010
Why not a real weapon? I want
a real one. I got knives.

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,930
I have all close contacting me.
Never got a gun on my wife so I can oh,

78
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:33,190
one of them. Yep. Hmm. Well
I'll get one. I'm working on
her. She's good. She gets it.

79
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,650
Yeah. We've got to do as a false
flag in the house. Hire some friends.

80
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,680
[inaudible] oh yeah,
that's a good idea.

81
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,360
Not False flag. Really. The Dick Cheney
of households. Oh my God. So, um,

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,760
yeah I want the gun badly. But I feel
like with an AK 47 and maybe you know,

83
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,630
people can write like only bad
things have happened. People,

84
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,290
you know,
a district is responsible gun owners.

85
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,660
But you look at Dylan roof
and you look at, you know,

86
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:06,040
column when you look at all these people
getting shot up everywhere and seeing

87
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,730
the hook, like I don't want that
to happen. I don't want my kids.

88
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,670
I was walking away safe.
You put your guns in a safe.

89
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,790
Why do you need an AK 47 you don't need
an AK 47 I'm saying and have all the

90
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:22,780
handgun. But the thing is like who
should be able to decide who gets what.

91
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,120
That's where it gets weird. Yeah.
And what about silencers to, well,

92
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,310
here's the thing.
In,

93
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,460
in Europe silencers are thought of as
a polite thing because we're over in

94
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,080
America worried about shooting people.
They're worrying about noise.

95
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,010
So like if you have what they call
suppressor, they call suppressor.

96
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,220
Like if you're hunting,

97
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,680
you would hunt with a
suppressor on because you don't
want to blow your fucking

98
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:45,370
ears out.
Man,

99
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,840
I'll put the links out to these two
pieces that I did a daily show spots.

100
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:54,550
I'll do the one. If you go to my
thing, that Twitter, uh, I'll, uh,

101
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,631
I'll put it on.

102
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:59,270
I'll send them to you though when I
drove a tank and fired all those guns.

103
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,550
And then I did a silencer piece as well.

104
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,820
And the guy was saying he wanted to
protect kids ears with the silencers.

105
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,390
And that's what Donald Trump jr
saying kids. And I'm worried.

106
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,340
The reality is though,
and this is true,

107
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,930
I know a lot of friends that are hunters
that shot guns as kids and they're

108
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:22,370
fucked up now. They're ears
are a mess. Would it, should
they wear the, they should,

109
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,450
but they didn't when they were younger
because they didn't know any better. See,

110
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,570
20 years ago,

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,590
people didn't know that you were going
to do permanent damage to your ear.

112
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,890
They didn't, you didn't need ever heard
about it like these people just shotguns.

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,630
But I think also the,
uh,

114
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,980
unfortunate reality now is that you
could have somebody walking around

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,470
undetected shooting fucking shooting
people in a college and you could call it,

116
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,440
yeah,
I did.

117
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,570
I was on Kcrw and walking around the Santa
Monica campus and I really did think,

118
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,160
I'm like, okay, who's the
shooter? Right. Coast water.

119
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,450
And then it shouldn't be a thought
that, oh no, it shouldn't. Yeah.

120
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,160
I mean it's a mental health issue,

121
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,360
but because like the only person that's
capable of doing that as a person who's

122
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,450
sick. Yeah. You know,

123
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,410
and that's the other thing that doesn't
come up when you're talking about mass

124
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:12,870
shootings is whenever you hear
about it, the news, no one,

125
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:13,910
he makes the correlation,

126
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:18,911
the inescapable correlation between
psychoactive drugs and mass shootings

127
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,590
because there's a lot of
fucking mass shooters.

128
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,130
Like almost all of them that are either
on pharmaceutical drugs like SSR,

129
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:28,040
i's disassociative drugs,

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,220
or they're getting off of
'em antipsychotic drugs.

131
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,490
There's a look and be done is you're like,
there is no common ground.

132
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:35,960
He started having people make,

133
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:40,820
we live in this country where you
should be able to do whatever you want,

134
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,740
uh, and have whatever you want. But then
who gets to decide? Who gets questioned?

135
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:46,940
What guns?
Well,

136
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,740
Texas has sort of taking the idea
that just everybody has a gun,

137
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,290
a wheel armed society is a polite society.
My Ron white all of a sudden,

138
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,980
and then teachers should have guns in
the classroom and bulletproof helmets,

139
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,170
full vests. Jesus. Ak 47 is
right there, right there.

140
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:10,850
Put down the chalk. I don't know,
man. It sucks. Yeah, it's actually,

141
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,330
you have to think about it. There's
no easy solution. Yeah. Well it just,

142
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,970
every time one of those things happens,

143
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,210
everybody buckles down and wants to
take away guns and try to figure out

144
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:20,931
legislation.

145
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:24,470
And I just feel like the root of the
problem is not the tools that people are

146
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,990
using. It's the fact that someone's
willing to use those tools.

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,700
The fact that someone
is willing to do that,

148
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,200
the fact that those guns are more
accessible is a g is a genuine issue.

149
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,930
But I think we can all agree that no
one came for the guns. Uh, Obama. Every,

150
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,990
it's like Obama's coming for the guns.
What do you know why he knows the NRA,

151
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,810
the NRA is too strong.
The lobbies to strong,

152
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,800
they've spent a shit load of money and
continue to spend a shitload of money to

153
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,540
make sure they protect the
second amendment rights.

154
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,440
But so you're saying if they will,
if not for the NRA,

155
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,010
it 100%

156
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,600
per second.
All the guns,

157
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,180
they would have definitely done
something similar to what Australia did.

158
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,410
Australia essentially made gun
ownership very, very, very difficult.

159
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,850
They took away guns,

160
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,620
they enact a very strict laws and they
had like one mass shooting a long time

161
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,540
ago.
They're big mass shooting a long time ago.

162
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,820
That's the thing that they don't have
is like these big mass shootings,

163
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,040
you know when you see.

164
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,700
But Australia has the same amount of
people's California and it's the size of

165
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,700
the United States. Yeah.
They just just saw the thing.

166
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:26,070
There was a map comparisons
and fill your mind.

167
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:28,980
It's like it's the exact same size.
Yeah, it's crazy. And people are spread.

168
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,930
It's way spread out and it's the same
amount of people is Los Angeles and it's

169
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,550
in this giant ass fucking country.

170
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,260
So when you think about being able
to take people's guns in Australia,

171
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,030
it's different.
The culture is different.

172
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,370
The idea of independence
is different over there.

173
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:49,100
We have a different attitude over here.
Yeah. I just don't want to one. Yeah.

174
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,040
When you have little kids again,
she's your course changes, you know,

175
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,470
and she's like,
I don't ever,

176
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:59,520
why worry about them growing up in a
society where a teacher does have to think

177
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:02,100
about wearing a fucking helmet.
Of course, of course. I mean,

178
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,270
nobody wants to think that. I don't know
what the solution is, but the solution,

179
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,380
look getting the guns
away from the people.

180
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:15,240
There's more guns and there are human
beings in America and they're not,

181
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,350
they're not going to stop making
guns. No. It was good business. Yeah.

182
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,160
I the guns of the problem. I really
don't. I mean I support gun ownership.

183
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,620
I really do. I just started. I
don't think that's the issue.

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,780
I think the issue is lucky that we saw
in France in Nice that some crazy fucking

185
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:34,410
take a car and kill a hundred people
by plowing over Pete and just starts

186
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,710
stabbing people to get out of the car
and just fucking starts stabbing folks.

187
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,550
There's,

188
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,910
there's ways that people lose their
fucking minds and do horrible things to

189
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,460
people and the ways are not
things you have to take away.

190
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,910
You have to figure out a way. And I
don't go ale hammers. No. Right. Yeah.

191
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,410
I don't know what the solution is,

192
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:52,520
but I don't think anybody does the
idea of you see all those guns,

193
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,840
I think what you're getting at with
the mental health stuff is there,

194
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,530
I'm not opposed to there being a
screening process and seeing if you have a

195
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:01,740
history of violence. Of
course. Yeah. And uh,

196
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:05,790
if you are a show up on a terrorist watch
list and that's where I think the NRA

197
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:10,020
goes overboard. It's like if you're
on a fucking terrorist watch list,

198
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,880
who doesn't agree with that?
Well,

199
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:15,120
the only problem with that is who gets
to decide who's on the terrorist watch

200
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,950
list? Because there was people
that were, um, from, uh,

201
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,620
the Green party that were put on
terrorist watchlist after nine 11,

202
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,040
because they were anti war protesters
and they were put on no fly list.

203
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,070
There was a lot of weird shit that
happened where people were put on lists

204
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,640
because they pissed off the wrong people.
And you know,

205
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:36,150
in 2001 it was way easier to do something
like that, but it is to do it today.

206
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,040
Go to buy a gun and then they say,

207
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,430
I'm sorry he can't purchase this
weapon because you're on that list.

208
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,890
And then you can go to a gun
show that's part of the problem.

209
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,240
Go to a gun show and you could buy a gun
far easier and Kansas City and tighten

210
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:53,040
that down though. Kansas, Kansas,
you can go and Poop, correct me,

211
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,973
I'm wrong,
is

212
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,320
did a show called this place sucks.
What am I?

213
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,830
And so you go to Kansas and
then you can get a gun with,

214
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,980
no,
you don't do,

215
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,990
you get into just an Id Kansas Id and you
can get it in maybe like five minutes,

216
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,640
zero train. It's nothing,
just you get it right away.

217
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,380
You don't have to have a background
check. So true. Yes. Was that true?

218
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:20,260
Like when you did in 2014
when I did this piece? Yeah.

219
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:24,150
But you can look at Queen Queen,
check that gun laws Kansas. Come on.

220
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,830
No background check. No background
check. I'm pretty certain.

221
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,300
So why wouldn't you have to scan it in
Kansas and this kind of does with his

222
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:35,530
grandma. He walks into
this place and he goes, uh,

223
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,800
I can't even,
the guys says I can't buy the gun,

224
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,840
but she can make that he buys these
four guns or sub saying kills a bunch of

225
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,700
people.
So

226
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,970
Federal Law requires federally licensed
firearms dealers but not private sellers

227
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,800
to initiate a background check
on the purchase purchaser
prior to sale a firearm.

228
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,430
As a result,

229
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,850
concealed weapons license holders in
Kansas are exempt from the federal

230
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:03,390
background check requirement. Yeah, that's
crazy. No training. No background check.

231
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,051
Hold on.
A second.

232
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:08,430
Concealed weapons license holders like
you have to have a concealed weapons

233
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,380
license, which is difficult
to acquire. And let me,

234
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,300
it's not easy to get a concealed weapons
license unless they have a different

235
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:19,210
law. Their background checks and cans,
it's concealed way, but I think he could.

236
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,710
Concealed weapons is like the hardest
thing to get is a concealed carry.

237
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,900
Federal law provides states with
the options of serving a state.

238
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,350
Kansas has no law requiring
firearms dealers to initiate
background checks prior

239
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:34,710
to transferring a firearm.
As a result in Kansas,

240
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:38,730
firearms dealers must initiate the
background check required by federal law,

241
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:43,680
by contacting the FBI directly.
Kansas is not a point of contact state.

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,833
Huh.

243
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,630
So they have to contact the FBI.

244
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,590
Federal law does not require dealers to
conduct a background check of a firearm

245
00:13:51,591 --> 00:13:55,250
purchase or presents a state permit
to purchase or possess firearms.

246
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,080
It meets certain conditions.

247
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,370
So it seems like there's definitely
some wiggle room. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

248
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:02,540
And then you know,
that's her,

249
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,750
he was talking about these gun shows
where you can just go gobble up a bunch of

250
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:07,940
firearms. They can't,
they can bring them into,

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,370
that's what they just transport
them across state lines.

252
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:11,930
And it's one of those things,

253
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:16,931
like many human issues where there's
not a whole lot of like clear paths.

254
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,340
It's like there's so many guns.

255
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,080
You're never going to take
them all away from people.

256
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:24,500
And should you take them all away from
him? Like if a guy like you as a gun,

257
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,580
I don't feel like no danger or a threat
unless you get in one of your God damn

258
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,490
tirades he might have another best example

259
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,740
that's fucking stealing wood.

260
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,193
So

261
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,220
did you hear that bit like a,

262
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:45,510
not a bit of video of Carlos [inaudible]
was on Joey Diaz a show saying they

263
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:48,330
thought about bringing a gun around and
going to the comedy store and shooting

264
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:52,700
people and he was carrying a gun in
his car and like, no, no, I'm crazy.

265
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,250
Well, there maybe you shouldn't
never gone. Yeah, he's

266
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,970
[inaudible].
