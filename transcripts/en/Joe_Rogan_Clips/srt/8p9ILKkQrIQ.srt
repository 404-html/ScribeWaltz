1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,010
Her low freak bitches. Yeah.
And the idea that I know,

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:09,600
I know I lived in the city since I was
18 so I've been around gays for a quarter

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,180
century and I think of these guys I know
that had been together for 10 years and

4
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,430
I go, so let me get this straight. This,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,910
these two are gonna break up according
to you and evangelical person.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,940
And then they're just going to make out
with some chick with blonde hair and eat

7
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:25,830
her out and like fucker and
have a boner and pray to God.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,280
Come on. You know, that won't happen. I,

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I wonder how much of
homosexual behavior could be,

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,710
uh, induced by molestation
in early age though. Yeah,

11
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,820
that's the million dollar question. That
seems to be a real factor. It's not,

12
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:46,560
and this is not the nine
people that are born gay,

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
but I think there's a spectrum and I
think there's most certainly some gay acts

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:56,601
that are committed on young people and
horrifically those people tend to on a

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,790
pretty frequent basis do the same
thing to other young kids, young kids.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,650
Really Weird in in, in terms of like
the victims becoming the victimizer.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,330
Yeah.
I know where you're going with this.

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,520
We're walking into the elephant
in the room, but what kind of,

19
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:13,350
not even mean just just talking about,

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,530
I was listening to the George to Chi
interview today because they're trying to

21
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,530
pull up everybody now that
the Milo thing is out there,

22
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:24,480
they're pulling up everybody who in any
way it has condoned sex with underage

23
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:25,314
people.

24
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,450
And George to Kai was talking about his
own experiences in camp and it was on

25
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,570
stern show and he was just
talking about what he,

26
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,810
the way he was describing it as a positive
experience with a kid who was in his

27
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,110
late teens,

28
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:44,370
I think he said it was 19 and he
was like 13 somewhere in that age.

29
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,560
And you know, it's absolutely child
molestation. It's absolutely illegal.

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,510
But the way he was describing it,

31
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:55,640
he was pretty much describing it
as a positive experience. Right?

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,280
Which when it's your experience,

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,480
I mean it's illegal. The guy did
something that was against the law.

34
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:05,220
But boy,

35
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:10,110
that's a weird area because
it's his experience. And
he was talking about, yeah,

36
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,750
well here's the deal and
this is a mistake Milo made.

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,520
You have to acknowledge that what you're
talking about is fucked up and horrible

38
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,354
and wrong,

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,360
but you just so happen to have not had a
bad experience within those parameters.

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,680
Like say you were raped as
a woman and you came, right?

41
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,470
Uh, which by the way happens
for some strange reason.

42
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,800
So if you're one of those women in,

43
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:36,210
you're about to say that you have to
understand that we're going into a very

44
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,550
dangerous place right now.
And you can't say, look,

45
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:41,010
some rapes are absolutely fabulous
and women have come from them.

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,190
You have to say, this is
fucking horrible. Rape is evil.

47
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,540
But I buy some weird freak of nature
actually liked it. Or a murderer.

48
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,460
I'm sure there's times when you
murdered a guy and he ended up,

49
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,270
he was a mass murder and it was a
good murder. Right? And you go, okay,

50
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,770
I'm describing a murder.
I'm not condoning murderer.

51
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,980
But in this weird case it
worked and Milo's mistake
was he said it worked for me

52
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:06,310
and then he implied that it could work
for a ton of other gays to be fucked at

53
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,030
13. Well he did that, um,

54
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:12,490
a drunken peasants podcast and his take
on it from the drunken peasants was

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,590
different than his take on it from mine.

56
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,390
And on my podcast it seemed more like
he was trying to make light of something

57
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,170
that most likely definitely did happen
to him. The father Michael thing.

58
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,320
So there's two,
there's the father Michael thing and I,

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
I don't know if I believe that.
I think that's just a,

60
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,640
I've heard him say that joke
a few times where he's like,

61
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,630
I'd never would have given such good head
if it wasn't for Father Michael. Right.

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,760
So you think that might be something
like that he's constructed?

63
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,280
I don't believe it. I don't
know why. That's just my gut.

64
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,570
And then the other thing was condoning
sexual relationships with 13 year olds

65
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,370
and he said,
especially in the gay world,

66
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,480
now I know of straight guys
who were a straight guy.

67
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm thinking of in particular who was
molested at camp and it was by an older

68
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:57,640
gay camp counselor.
This guy thinks of that guy every day,

69
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:01,180
falls him on linkedin hoping he'll
die. He wants to murder him. Uh,

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,980
so the problem with what Milo said is you
end up normalizing is behavior and say

71
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,440
it's okay if in the gay world,
next thing you know,

72
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:12,430
some older gay who's at Camp Goes, well
this is probably a fag that I'm blowing.

73
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,660
Right. So this is, okay. Yeah.
So what I say to these gays,

74
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:20,290
these 13 year old gates to go, I would
be okay with fucking a 29 year old. I go,

75
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,460
well, I'm sorry, but we're not
normalizing that because the vast,

76
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:28,660
vast majority of times it doesn't
turn out well. So No. Yeah,

77
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,950
that's a very good way of putting it. You
know, and it's, it's really disturbed.

78
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,340
Well, the Milo thing is so
odd because first of all,

79
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:41,341
I think he's got this act and let's call
it an act cause part of it has got to

80
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:46,270
be an act. He's got a wide spectrum of
his personalities. So on Bill Maher,

81
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:50,560
he can be a raging Liberace queen with
pearls on dress like a woman. I mean,

82
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:54,060
just like a woman. Yeah. Camper
than any woman I know. Yeah.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,910
And then for the apology, he's the
conservative with the coke bottle glasses.

84
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,800
It's sort of like when a Jamaican who
goes back to Jamaica and they start

85
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,940
speaking in Patois, like their
grandmother and not necessarily lying.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,720
It's just a wide range of use.
Yeah. He plays it up and there it,

87
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,340
there's definitely a performance piece
to a lot of what he does. What's,

88
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:19,390
what's really interesting is he's
very good at riling people up.

89
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:23,260
He's obviously very good at getting
people upset, and in doing so,

90
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,120
he's created these sort of false
narratives about him, that he's a Nazi,

91
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,940
that he promotes genocide.
I mean,

92
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,610
there were so many people outside the
Berkeley thing that were screaming,

93
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:38,611
calling them a Nazi and saying he's a
fascist when they in fact were behaving in

94
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,810
very authoritarian,
fascist ways.

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,360
That's Antifa. By the way, you
said, I don't know what Antifa is.

96
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:50,170
That's those guys antifascist is that
what Antifa stands for? But you're right,

97
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,910
they're terrorists and they use terror.

98
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,070
They use violence to
achieve political gains,

99
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,800
which is terrorism and a these people,

100
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,320
it's not like Milo ever set or Trump
even ever said anything that is remotely

101
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,820
close to genocide,
but those guys just go.

102
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:09,290
Anyone that wants to enforce
immigration laws is a fucking Nazi.

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,990
So I need violence cause
I'm trying to stop Hitler.

104
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,360
I'm around the first stages of Hitler,

105
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,770
so I'm going back in time and strangling
him in his crib kind of. Right.

106
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,700
But the problem is the way
they're reacting to it is
the absolute wrong way to

107
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,090
react to someone who sang something
that you don't agree with. Oh yeah.

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
The the right way is to say something
that you feel opposes what they're saying.

109
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:34,730
It makes more sense to debate them.
That's the beauty of free speech.

110
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,080
Like it has no limits. If you want to
get out there and deny the Holocaust,

111
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,490
you want to get out there and
sexualized toddlers all go to your talk.

112
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:47,180
I want to hear it. And then in the Q
and a, I'll shoot you down. Well, not,

113
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:49,730
I don't think it even
should just be a Q and a.

114
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,660
I mean I think it should
be real clear other there,

115
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,080
there should be someone and they,

116
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,890
we shouldn't just rely on the audience
to come up with some sort of a response.

117
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,270
I think if you're going to have someone
as controversial as Milo and you are so

118
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,470
opposed to it that you're willing to
throw bricks through Starbucks windows and

119
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,760
light cop cars on fire,

120
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,140
there should be someone that can speak
for your side and then you should

121
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,340
organize some sort of a talk.

122
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,130
But this is setting it up
the wrong way because you go,

123
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,070
it's like someone said to
me once, hey man, you know,

124
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,050
like we were talking about
martial arts flows, black belt,

125
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:24,140
I'd fucking kick everybody's ass. No you
wouldn't. No, you wouldn't. First of all,

126
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:27,050
you wouldn't because you'd have discipline
and you'd realize the consequences of

127
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,500
that. But second of all, when you
just kick someone's ass, they don't,

128
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,720
they don't just take it like they come
back with a bat or a gun or their brother,

129
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,560
you started fighting.
They want to get it back.

130
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:41,561
And it goes back and forth and back and
forth and all conflict pretty much goes

131
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,320
that way.

132
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,980
You have conflict and then
someone responds to that
conflict and it escalates.

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,250
So if you have this thing where you
start throwing bricks through windows and

134
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:52,790
light and cop cars on fire and stopping
people from talking and hitting people

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,310
that have a make bitcoin great again,

136
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,550
hats and just see that girl got
maced in the face by a 60 year olds.

137
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,300
Eventually people show up with guns.
That's what happens.

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,100
And this is what happens when you keep
escalating the violence. You become them,

139
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,720
you become the other,

140
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,810
you become the enemy and you create this
polarizing atmosphere that's so intense

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,260
that no dialogue's kind of fix
it now because you're the enemy.

142
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,260
We are talking about the north versus
the south. You're, you're talking about,

143
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,870
you know, the, the Protestants
versus the Catholics. You, you,

144
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:28,871
you create this horrific environment
where almost it's almost impossible to

145
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:34,670
avoid violence. Well, so I'm done
avoiding it. I'm taking the low road,

146
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,850
I'm punching them in the face. So that's
what you're doing with this outfit? Yes.

147
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,270
That is really what I'm doing with stuff.
But I did a talk at Nyu.

148
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,640
They pepper sprayed me. Did
they read, when was this?

149
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,580
This was a couple of weeks ago.
What did, what was it talk about?

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,760
I didn't even have a plan.
I was, they know me as pro
Trump or something and they,

151
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:53,000
they, I'm a Nazi because
of that and they should,

152
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,230
they don't want to give a
platform to free speech.

153
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,850
That's the irony of all this is they
pretend that it's gotten so far.

154
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,310
It's beyond debate now in their world.

155
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,510
We are recruiting fascists for
some sort of imminent genocide.

156
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:11,220
So we're like signing up the brown shirts
with a form at our talks and you go

157
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,530
say that was possible. Uh, how does
that work? Like we sign you up,

158
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:19,860
then you're part of the club. Then
you come with us on the next genocide.

159
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,180
The fuck are you talking about?

160
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:24,060
You haven't even played it through in
your mind because for these people it's a

161
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:27,390
religion. That's why they don't want
to debate. It's like a born again.

162
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,140
He doesn't want to debate
about the existence of God.
He's already on that side.

163
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,310
So what was your plan when you went there?
What did, what did you want to talk?

164
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,450
I was going to say,
uh, this Nazi that, uh,

165
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,540
that you made Milo and I out to be who
wants genocide and who sees nonwhites is

166
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,440
inhuman, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
homophobic, sexist, whatever. Uh,

167
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,520
first of all, that guy should be
allowed to talk if he existed,

168
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,900
but he doesn't exist.

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,120
Your monster is a mythical beast
and you've gone to college,

170
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,990
you're 60 grand in debt already to fight
this mythical beast who doesn't fucking

171
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:08,220
exist. Well, in terms of
Milo, he definitely doesn't
exist. Milo is not a Nazi.

172
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,410
He's definitely,
he's not promoting genocide.

173
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:13,170
And those are two things that just
get trumpeted about left and right.

174
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Exactly who is,

175
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:19,610
but Milo has said some very inflammatory
things about and in a very generalizing

176
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:25,281
way about women and about the wage gap
and about all sorts of things that he,

177
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:30,360
he designs his words and his
phrases to be inflammatory.

178
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,840
So he gets the most response and
it's been incredibly profitable.

179
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,800
I mean up until Harper
Collins pulled his book deal,

180
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,200
he got a $250,000 book advance.
His book was number one on Amazon.

181
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,080
Just sheerly through controversy.
Yup.

182
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,510
I mean through presales and controversy.

183
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:50,511
So it's a strategy and a lot of ways
and it's also a response to this really

184
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,930
hard stance that the far left is taking
this anti anti free speech stance.

185
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,750
Right. But always with these cases
you go, what exactly did he say?

186
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:02,790
I always say this to people who
bitch about it. And Coulter, I go,

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,030
what sentence in what book
is factually incorrect?

188
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,460
What specifically are you saying?
And with this Milo thing,

189
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,730
he said that often sexual relationships
with 13 year olds can be beneficial for

190
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:18,690
gays. Uh, he has since
retracted that and apologized,

191
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,860
but that's not enough. And that's
about as, as egregious as it gets.

192
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,360
The other stuff that he says,

193
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,720
we all say in a joking way and then that
becomes pure evil and you advocate for

194
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:35,490
this, right? So the left is willfully
ignorant of humor when it comes to Milo.

195
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,840
And with Trump too,
you know,

196
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,010
within culture is doing is very similar
to what Milo is doing. You mean their,

197
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,640
their merchants of outrage and that's
what they're doing. I disagree.

198
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:47,760
I think they're speaking in a
hyperbolic tone. They're flamboyant.

199
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,530
But that's what the charter
was still there. Yes, there's,

200
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,140
there's definitely some truth,

201
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,830
especially with Milo that
some of the things that he
says. Um, but it's all truth.

202
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,130
What, what? Like again, I'm
saying it right now. What,

203
00:11:59,131 --> 00:12:03,160
what did he say this factually incorrect?
Well, there wasn't a joke, not,

204
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,660
not factually incorrect,

205
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,550
but extremely offensive to people
like the 13 year old boy comment.

206
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,670
Like the thing about sort of normalizing
relationships between grown men and 13

207
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,270
year old boys,
you know,

208
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:21,040
I think a big part of why he even says
that is because he's in many ways like a

209
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:26,041
natural contrarian and in many ways a guy
who wants to get a rise out of people.

210
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,460
And by saying that he didn't feel
like there's any consequences to being

211
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,360
outrageous in that regard.
Right.

212
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,520
But I think we could both agree whether
or not it's factual. In his case,

213
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,850
it's a fucked up thing to say,
right. As a fucked up thing to say.

214
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,800
It was negligent,
which is why I apologize,

215
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:45,820
but I think the grain of truth to
that and with his other statements,

216
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:49,150
there's a lot more than the grain, but
the grant of truth to what he was saying,

217
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:52,270
his gaze have less
chastity than straights.

218
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,900
And if a woman is known as a slut,
she's less likely to be picked up.

219
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,090
And I've been sued for calling a woman
a slut. Where are you really? Yup.

220
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,750
Who Sued you? It was a long
time ago. Back in vice days,

221
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:05,620
it was going to do's and don'ts and the,
the way the law is,

222
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,420
it's kind of antiquated,
but it's like, oh,

223
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,920
you called her a slut now she won't
have currency in the market of marriage

224
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,330
because she's known as a whore,

225
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,130
so we're going to punish you punitively
for this sin. Did you have to settle?

226
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,430
Yeah. God dammit. You
can't call someone a slut.

227
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,990
There's no word for a man.
No,

228
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,220
I cad. That's a compliment. That's
hilarious. Yeah. A cat is hilarious. Well,

229
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:32,890
the fact that there's no equivalent for
a man shows you that there's a different

230
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:33,221
standard.

231
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:38,221
And then with gays it is different to
like 13 year old and an older person,

232
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:41,860
right?
If it's a girl and a 40 year old teacher,

233
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:44,980
I want to take him to the parking
lot and beat him till he has a weird,

234
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:49,390
he walks weird. He was life.
If it's a woman in a boy, uh,

235
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:52,750
I don't want to murder her.
I'm grossed out 13,

236
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:57,490
especially 14 little better.
And then with gays,

237
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,270
uh, well I'm not gonna make the
same mistake Milo made right now.

238
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,890
Don't ever do it. But if a gaze,
no one has a sled in the future,

239
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,540
like say a 19 year old fucks,
200 people as a woman,

240
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,500
no one wants to go near as a gay.
You've been around the block. Yeah,

241
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,930
no, there's not the same consequences for
sure. And I, I had a bit of my act about,

242
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,880
I don't know if you
remember this commercial,

243
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:25,680
but there was a commercial adjust for men
commercial where there was a baby that

244
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:26,910
was driving a Porsche,

245
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,440
a baby with a beard and there was a
grown woman next to the baby and the baby

246
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:35,160
has like a Tuxedo on and it's like
you've always wanted the biggest bet,

247
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:38,060
his beard and the baby goes to the
nightclub and a bouncer looks at him and

248
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:41,460
winks. I'm like look at this, look at this
commercial. [inaudible] see the babies.

249
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,980
Yeah.
So the baby walks in just for men.

250
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,990
I mean I don't know what
the fuck just for men,

251
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,450
if you don't know it is some stuff that
guys put in their yard when they're

252
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:52,100
getting old. So this baby's got a
bottle, he out to the dance floor.

253
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:56,540
There's all these girls with these tiny
little skirts dancing around him and

254
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,170
he's like, he's like a pimp
and he's with this hot woman.

255
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,700
And this to me my bit was this is
proof, positive proof, positive.

256
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:07,100
There's no sexual equality when
it comes to child molesting.

257
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,790
Cause if you even wrote that
down with the is reversed.

258
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,180
If you even wrote it down, you're
fucking going to jail. Okay.

259
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,200
There's a little baby girl and she
goes out to a room full of guys who are

260
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:21,980
wearing Tarzan skirts and they're all
swinging dicks around her and she's got a

261
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:25,280
bottle and they're all fighting for her
attention and kissing her on the cheek.

262
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,080
You would go to fucking jail.

263
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,960
But that was a commercial that
aired on mainstream television.

264
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:34,070
No one cared about it. That commercial
air for years, it's probably still on now.

265
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,880
And that commercial is proof positive
that we have a completely different

266
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:42,881
attitude towards a grown woman
who's hot as fuck and a little baby.

267
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,330
Yeah, well even I was watching big with
the kids the other day. Tom Hanks is what?

268
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,390
Eight in that movie?

269
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,590
Nine and then that woman seduces
him and I guess he fucks her.

270
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:55,970
He gets a boner and I'm like,
you're raping a child. Exactly.

271
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,840
Why are we watching? And she's hot.
She's hot and he looks like a man.

272
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:04,050
So I just let it ride.
If that movie was reversed and it was a,

273
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:08,360
a young girl that all of a sudden was
in a sexual woman's body and the guy was

274
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:10,730
fucking her. She's like, I don't know.
Are we supposed to be doing this?

275
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,870
You would be horrified. You would be
absolutely horrified. These protests,

276
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,970
especially the things
like the Milo protest,

277
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:21,971
I mean maybe now that Milo
has been humiliated and it
at least temporarily side

278
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,360
tracked or put down for a
bit while he has to rebuild.

279
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,690
Maybe someone can come along and have
reasonable dialog and do some sort of a

280
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:35,240
campus be I don't like, why is he doing
these things on campuses? First of all,

281
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:40,050
I don't think he gets paid for most of
them. What my theory with Milo is a,

282
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,140
I think his eyesight's getting worse.

283
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,620
His glasses are getting thicker
and thicker and he sorta going,

284
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,800
this is my moment to make an impact.
So he's just like,

285
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,190
you think he's going blind? I think so,
yeah. Where do you just theorizing this?

286
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah, he's only like 28 yeah,
but you look at him, he's,

287
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,810
he just can't read English because
they're insane. Really. Yeah.

288
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,640
And they're getting thicker. Maybe it's
stress, stress, making his eyes worse.

289
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,970
Um, I don't know. I'm not a doctor.

290
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,690
I can't think it would be
good. But I think he's trying
to make a maximum impact,

291
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,930
uh, in a short amount of time cause you
think he doesn't have much time left.

292
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,790
That's such a way he seems healthy
weight. In fact, when we were in Orlando,

293
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,650
we made out at the site of the,
uh,

294
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:29,270
you guys made out Milo to offend Muslims.
Wow.

295
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,133
So I said,

296
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,000
I did a big speech about freedom and
funny taste in this America delicious like

297
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,083
strawberries.

298
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,010
Well at least he freshens breath up
before no gaze just tastes better.

299
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,160
I said,
fuck is lamb.

300
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:46,730
And then we made out at the site of the
Orlando shooting to know only Muslims,

301
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:48,890
but we had armed guards and
stuff. And I said, all right,

302
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:52,290
I want to make sure these guys are scoping
out the rooms and shit. And he goes,

303
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:56,400
I don't care if I die, I'll happily die
for this. I was like, well, I do care.

304
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:59,760
Actually. I've got three kids. What
does, is it Neil Ism or nihilism?

305
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,920
I always say it wrong. I
always say nihilism, nihilism,

306
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:07,430
that nihilistic sort of
instinct that he has.

307
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:12,360
He has a burn it all down instinct and I
think he has that with his life as well.

308
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,620
And I think a lot of that,
um,

309
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,950
I'm playing some serious bro
psychologist here, you know,

310
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,260
some I armchair psychology from
someone totally unqualified.

311
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,870
But you've got to attribute that to,

312
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,170
and at least in some ways
being molested as a child.

313
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,340
I would imagine that his experiences that
he's calling positive experiences when

314
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,174
he was young,

315
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,360
in many ways those could have potentially
damaged him and also being young and

316
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:43,350
being homosexual and being rejected,
all of those things wreck havoc.

317
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,130
And you develop this, fuck
you, I want to burn it down.

318
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,130
And this is one of the strategies that
he sort of adopted that strategy to be

319
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:56,550
this guy who is very difficult
for like he's, he's gay.

320
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,800
He's um, uh, an English gay
guy who's a right winger.

321
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,220
I mean it's, it's so baffling to
them. They don't know what to do.

322
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,790
They hate it because they see blacks.
And gays as their little pets,

323
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,270
and they like putting them on the front
lines and going liquid who were helping.

324
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,460
And then when one of them
defects to the other side,

325
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:16,370
they become particularly outraged,

326
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,900
but very few defect at the level
that he's defected. Right. I mean,

327
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,290
he turned around and started
attacking direct guy.

328
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,300
Okay.
