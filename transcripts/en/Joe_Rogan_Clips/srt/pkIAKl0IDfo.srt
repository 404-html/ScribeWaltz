1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,650
Her low freak bitches.
I hated dealing with actors.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,970
I'd never been around actors and that
thing that we were talking about before

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,240
where people just like say things that
they don't really mean because they think

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,680
that you're supposed to say those things.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,250
Cause there's like a pattern of
behavior that you chose to, yeah. Oh,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,040
I thought he was amazing in that film.
I thought it was excellent.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,410
I thought he had a lot to offer.
I mean,

8
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:26,280
there was a lot of that kind of nonsense
out here where I was used to real

9
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:30,210
people. I mean, I mean for
sure I was a flawed person.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,920
I mean for sure I was rough
and I, I said I just, I wasn't,

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,600
I didn't have good decorum. Like the
way I communicated. I was a rough guy.

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,570
You know, I'd come from fighting and
then went right into standing up.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,300
And this was only a few years later,
I'm doing this now.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,730
I had my last fight in 89 so
this is [inaudible] 94 I mean,

15
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:54,450
this is just a few years after
that I was still very sketchy,

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,840
you know, so I used to belong. I
felt like I didn't belong there.

17
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,160
I felt like I couldn't be myself.

18
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:02,020
Everybody was like reading the
Hollywood reporter and variety on sem,

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,360
like the fuck you guys reading this shit
for like, it's like this. It was just,

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,280
the whole thing to me was like this weird
play that people were putting on where

21
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,790
everybody was trying to pretend to be
something so that they can get auditions.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,000
And I remember going on some auditions
and dealing with some of those people,

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,660
casting agents that had all this power
over you and they exhibited it like they

24
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,190
exerted it when you were
in the room with them.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,550
They didn't communicate with you like
you're a person and I'm a person.

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,780
They communicated with you like you want
something from me and I don't know if

27
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to give it to you.
Hmm, let me see what you do.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,130
It was just the way they did. It was just
so shitty. It was just, it was gross.

29
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,700
It was just, there was those fun,
oh, it's gross. I mean, this is,

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,560
this is the thing that people have.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,160
The real problem that people have with
his Harvey Harvey Weinstein situation is

32
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:54,540
not just that the fact that he was a,
a piece of shit to all these women,

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,320
it's his position of power that
he had over them that he exerted.

34
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,940
He got himself into this position and
then use that position to on some, I mean,

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,780
according to Whitney Whitney Cummings
was talking to me about that. She's like,

36
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,370
what you're hearing is all the women that
said no to him. He, she's like, that guy.

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,190
Fuck, fuck the top out
of all, fuck the column.

38
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:18,180
And it was part of the deals that he
gave and they even went after one of the

39
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:18,511
girls.

40
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:23,511
He was fucking that girl from Donnie
Brasco and she did the movie with the

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,350
Gretchen Mol. Yeah, she did
rounders. Oh, I remember her blonde,

42
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,370
cute thing that if you watched Donnie
Brasco, she's with Donnie Brasco.

43
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:36,770
She ain't got a fucking line to that
movie. Not Aligned railing. She's not,

44
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:39,660
she's an extra in that movie,
basically Sonny black girlfriend.

45
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,270
But when you see her in fucking whatever,

46
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,690
she's got a bunch of lines now and it
was because she was fucking high. We,

47
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:48,960
they just went after a couple of weeks
ago. Gretchen Maag who wasn't met,

48
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,870
who went after just, you know,
Angelina Jolie and the truth.

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,320
Oh they're all saying that this is the
reason why I had dick suck cause listen,

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,710
they all got to suck a dick virtually.
Look,

51
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,320
I had heard that there was a lot of them
that were actually very successful that

52
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:07,080
fucked him. I mean this was this, this
guy's thing. It's, it's Kinda, it's,

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,130
I mean it's fucked up and it's dark.

54
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:13,570
But once that gets going and
once that's what he does,

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,170
how do you stop that train? Other
than what they did and they all knew,

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,010
they all knew and nobody opened the
fucking mouth. So you can suck my dick.

57
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,140
A couple of them opened their mouth.
A couple of them get,

58
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,080
they got swept under the carpet
and that's always going to happen.

59
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,510
But I'd rather fuck it.
You know the rest of these,

60
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:32,470
like Angelina and the rest of these
people, listen, I'm over brother.

61
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,440
I don't want to hear this shit no
more. It's, it's, it's amazing.

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,150
Like just the bullshit that these people
creating that world. You're right.

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,330
When you go to these casting
things and you see these things,

64
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:47,050
you see the fucking bullshit.
It boils out of a man. Well,

65
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:50,260
it's one of the reasons why
people in this town are so crazy.

66
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,300
It's because their insecurity
to begin with, right?

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,810
The only reason why
anybody becomes an actor,

68
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,600
like why people want to be famous,
not the only reason,

69
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:02,410
but one of the main reasons why people
want to be famous is because at some

70
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,920
point in their life, they didn't feel
valuable. At some point in their life,

71
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:10,180
they felt discarded. They felt
abused, they felt ignored.

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,070
And they had this it in
escapable need for attention.

73
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,620
This,
this whole that cannot be filled.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,820
And that was the driving force
that led them into acting.

75
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,020
Where would they could be on that stage
and everyone was looking at them all

76
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:29,200
eyes on them while the microphone was on.

77
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,560
And the words were coming out of their
mouth and they were in the play or in the

78
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,360
movie or doing standup even.

79
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,980
It's a lot of the same stuff
that propelled you and I
being ignored as a child,

80
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:39,251
you know,

81
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:44,140
like feeling like you were nothing and
then realizing that when you're on stage

82
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,740
man then your something like that person
up there with a spotlight on them,

83
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,400
that person's shining.
That's a something person that's not me.

84
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,900
I feel like a zero.

85
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,260
But that thing that leads you to become
an actor want to become famous is also

86
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,020
like it's,

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,050
it's so fucked up with acting
because you have to get chosen.

88
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,860
It's not like music or like stand
up where you can look at, stand up.

89
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,170
All you have to do as you do
open mic nights, you get funny,

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,030
you build up an act in and
people come to see you. You see,

91
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,670
you build up a career and
the next thing you know you,

92
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:22,120
you become a successful comedian.
That's what happened to you.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,780
That's what happened to me. But with
acting you have to get chosen. You don't,

94
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,300
you don't have to work.
Like if you do plays,

95
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:29,950
nobody has ever going
to fucking see you ever.

96
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,510
You're never going to
make it out of place.

97
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,740
Nobody's going to see famous play actors.
Nobody gives a shit about them.

98
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,370
You have to be in movies, you have to be
in television, so you have to get chosen.

99
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,930
So you have this whole chain of like Hume,
maybe I'll pick you,

100
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,700
but I'm not sure.
Are you the one?

101
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,110
And so you have to develop this sort
of personality that fits in with their,

102
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:54,520
what they're looking for. You have to
mold your sensibilities and your ideas.

103
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,300
Like there's a lot of people that are
in Hollywood that don't have opinions of

104
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,020
their own.

105
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,020
What they have is a series of opinions
that they've adopted and adapted because

106
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,400
they think it's going to
lead them to be successful.

107
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,270
[inaudible]
yeah.
