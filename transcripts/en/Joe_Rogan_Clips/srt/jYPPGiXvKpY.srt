1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,510
What was that shit that we drank
with Stan? Hope that was really good.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,950
Was it Stan Hope? No, Stan hope wrong.

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,630
Dan Home brought it and it
doesn't some band make it.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,230
That's the Florida Georgia line or some
shit. Cause do they make it? Is it theirs?

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,340
Yeah, it's like a pop band and they
make a good whiskey like a country band.

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:24,120
I think country pop and
whatever. Old Camp. Listen man,

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,940
if you call yourself country but
you get them fake rips and Eugene's,

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,750
you can go suck a bag of death.
Okay, that ain't country.

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,130
Not saying that they have that. I don't
even know. But you know what I'm saying?

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,370
Like those fake rips in the gene drive
might have a couple of little faith

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,880
groups in my team do. I checked those
fake grips drive me God damn banana.

12
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:46,740
I was like,
what are we,

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,810
we're pretending that we work hard
or what are we pretending that we,

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,180
we've had these jeans for a long time
and they're special to us or do we just

15
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:58,380
buy them off the shelf at
Macy's pre ripped like assholes.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,360
Where the fuck did that take place?

17
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,990
Like if our grandparents
who made it through the
depression could come over here

18
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,380
and see us buying ripped jeans would they
would realize like what is wrong with

19
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,670
this nerved up soften down fucking
shitty country. We live in America.

20
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,960
It's too easy,

21
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,310
too easy to get by wolves in the streets.

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,743
Young Eric

23
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,490
can't be running around with fucking
fake rips in your genes. I mean,

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,710
I'm Brendan Schaub. One of my best friends
does that. Oh, who's this? That's them.

25
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,830
That's them with the five. Nailed
it. I didn't even mean to nail it.

26
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,280
I didn't even mean that.
I just took a wild guess.

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,580
I don't know a goddamn thing about
these fellows. Go to that other one.

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,960
Go to that last picture, right.
We put the glasses on and look at,

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,630
look at those genes. Make that bigger.
Well he looks like he got a shark.

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,320
I got some paint. Oh, you
do have some gray. Got Some
fucked up shit on your jeans.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm gonna. I'm gonna keep it real though.
I'm not going to like, this is sad.

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,840
Let you go in on them and not
come claim my jeans here. Listen,

33
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,390
I should shut the fuck up.
I'm basically wearing yoga pants.

34
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,210
I got these barbell jeans on.
These aren't even jeans.

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,140
These are goddamn yoga pants, jeans, or
made a weird like this thing. I mean,

36
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,990
well these don't, these aren't
even Jesus. These are like,

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,790
they might as well be spend decks.

38
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,820
I might as well be wearing yoga
pants most most pants or that now.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,130
Even the ones that looked like jeans,

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
a lot of them are that they
feel better technology.

41
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,530
It's called advancement in
human civilization. Yeah.

42
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:31,710
You want to drive a car with leaf springs
like an asshole or do you want some

43
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:36,640
new magnetic Cadillac Escalade,
you know,

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,010
cruise through your pants or you want to
be sweaty all like the breeze from the

45
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,760
fake holes.
I'll take the sweat like a man.
