1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,900
I know what you're saying,

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:04,890
but the idea is that if you have a minimum
amount that you allow people to pay,

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:08,640
then at least the people that are
working for that company will have a real

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,540
income where they can pay their bills and
feed themselves. And that this company,

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,100
because they have all the power,

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:17,730
they have all the money in a poor worker
who's stepping into the market for the

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,560
first time or you know,

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:24,480
just hasn't been able to acquire job
skills that would allow them to make much

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,950
more money per hour that they would
be taken advantage of by this large

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,780
corporation.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,740
You know,
the corporation is,

12
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:34,010
don't have all the power because
they're not the only employer. I mean,

13
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,510
all employers compete with one
another for labor and um, and the,

14
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:40,630
and they bid up wages. I
mean, you can't, you know,

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,750
pay people less than the market value of
their labor because somebody else will

16
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:49,100
hire them, you know? So if
you could talk about, oh,

17
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:52,460
wouldn't it be great if
everybody can earn more money?

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,740
Has there ever been a proven example of
this where they've had no minimum wage?

19
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:58,690
And it's been oh,
financial boom.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,150
Oh absolutely. Well, first of all,

21
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:02,190
we didn't always have a minimum
wage in the United States.

22
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:07,020
I mean it happened really in the 1930s
but you can look at situations of

23
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,960
countries that have no minimum wage
and they have very low levels of

24
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:14,640
unemployment. And you can look at areas
where the government uses, well, I mean,

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,540
you know, they don't have a minimum wage
in, in, in Singapore. Um, and you know,

26
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,300
and there, there are countries that
since Singapore, one example though,

27
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,040
it's an extremely wealthy country,
right?

28
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,800
Well that's one of the reasons and
they have, well they don't, they,

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,450
it's very easy to do business,

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,570
but you can look at examples where the
United States has imposed a minimum wage

31
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,360
on other countries. I mean, the minimum
wage did a lot of damage in Puerto Rico,

32
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:40,050
but, you know, look at another American
territory. American Samoa, right?

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:44,430
American Samoa, we basically destroyed
American Samoa with our minimum wage.

34
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:47,730
I mean, there's, Samoans are, you
know, are, are furious about it.

35
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,780
This happened years ago actually. And
I, the reason I even found out about it,

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,370
I was watching 60 minutes and they were
doing a report about I think football

37
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:59,010
players in Samoa.
And um,

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,220
and during their report they mentioned
that there was like a depression going on

39
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:06,000
in Samoa and it was like there was 30%
unemployment and really high inflation.

40
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,590
And I was like,
what the hell is going on in Samoa?

41
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,570
So I wanted to research that on my own.

42
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:13,470
And I found out that we impose the
minimum wage on Samoa and we destroyed all

43
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,400
their jobs.
They're,

44
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,510
the two biggest employers were to
a chicken of the sea and starkist,

45
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,350
they were canning tuna and then they were
shipping the tuna back to the mainland.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,640
But the minute they raised the minimum
wage, they made the production, uh,

47
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,270
uncompetitive because now you had to
pay the higher wages plus the shipping

48
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,390
costs to get the tuna back to
the mainland. So they, they all,

49
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,540
the canneries shut down and then
it created massive unemployment.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,230
And then prices went way up on the
island because they no longer had boats

51
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,060
coming back and forth to pick up the tuna.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,000
So now all of a sudden the shipping
cost of imports went way up.

53
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,000
So they had massive inflation,
sky high unemployment,

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,410
all because of the minimum wage.

55
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,420
So you could look at examples of
how minimum wage destroys jobs.

56
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,950
Uh, you know, right there,
yet they continued to advocate
for these higher wages.

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,610
It sounds good. Oh, everybody should earn
a decent living. Well, you know, not,

58
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,700
if you don't have any skills, you
can't. And a lot of course, you know,

59
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,870
a lot of kids, you know, they're
16, 17, 18, 19, 20. I mean,

60
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,730
people live with their parents still.
Uh,

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,920
the most important thing is getting a job
so you can acquire the skills to get a

62
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,750
better job to, you know, to move up the
ladder in an organization to enhance your,

63
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,860
you know, your value. Do

64
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,070
Employers in general,
what's the argument against this,

65
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,920
against what you're saying
about minimum wage against,

66
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:34,330
to all of these ideas that you're,
you're just proposing. Do you,

67
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,570
do you get a lot of pushback? I
mean, I'm sure what you're saying,

68
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,050
this free market capitalism approach is,
you know,

69
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,190
there's a lot of people that oppose it.

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,270
Of course. I mean he knows a lot
of people that don't think it out.

71
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:47,470
They think with their mind or their,
or their,

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,570
they're harsh and they
don't even get there.

73
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,190
The re the origin of the
minimum wage was racism. I mean,

74
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:57,960
the first minimum wage is here. It was
designed to keep employers from hiring.

75
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,160
Uh, the Chinese are from hiring blacks
because they know that that's where the

76
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:03,570
minimum wage came from.
You know,

77
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:06,750
to try to prevent employers from hiring
certain people. So they said, well,

78
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:10,680
let's have a minimum wage and that will
reduce a hiring of people who have less

79
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:13,500
skills. And, and so, and the labor unions,

80
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:17,250
the biggest supporters of the
minimum wage are the labor unions.

81
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,840
And none of the labor unions workers earn
the minimum wage. So you might think,

82
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:24,950
why are they, did they still care about
the minimum wage? If they don't eat that,

83
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,610
they'll get paid a lot
higher than in wage.

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,200
And it's because you always have a
competition between skilled labor and

85
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,080
unskilled labor, right?
So let's say a business,

86
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:38,580
a business man has the option of hiring
a skilled person to do something and

87
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:43,581
let's say the skilled person is going
to charge $20 an hour or an unskilled

88
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,060
person,

89
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,680
and let's say I can hire three unskilled
people for $5 an hour and that equals

90
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:52,790
15 well, hey, I'd rather
hire the unskilled worker.

91
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,730
I can pay three $5 an hour to do
the same job of one skilled worker.

92
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,050
But now if the skilled worker can
could lobby for $7 minimum wage,

93
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,160
now if I have to hire three
unskilled people, it costs $21 Aha.

94
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,440
Now all of a sudden I
hire the guy with skills.

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,800
So the labor unions benefit by keeping
unskilled people unemployed because they

96
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:17,490
have more skills and therefore they
can, you know, they can get more work.

97
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,630
That sounds like a complicated mess
to me. It is a mess for the, for the,

98
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,150
for the people that get get
priced out of a job. Yeah. Now,

99
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,910
democratic socialism is the
thing right now. This is the,

100
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,160
you're hearing it all the time,
you're hearing it constantly in the news.

101
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,830
What do you attribute that?
Do you think it's a frustration with the,

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,550
this lifelong politicians?

103
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,600
Like what do you think it is that's
causing this up for eyes and upswing?

104
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,140
The woman, what is her name? That
one in New York? Yeah. You know,

105
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:49,460
she's actually half Puerto Rican.
Might mind my countrymen, but yeah,

106
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:53,370
I forget her name and country.
Puerto Rico, United States. So

107
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,490
you know, I found this out as
I'm traveling now, you know,

108
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:59,300
I still have an American passport,
but when I,

109
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,240
when I mentioned what country I'm
from and I look where you live,

110
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,580
I always have to select
Puerto Rico as a country.

111
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,550
Even though it's part of America,
it's,

112
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,220
it's still considered its own country
even though you still are American

113
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:13,910
citizens when you live there and
you travel on a, on a US passport,

114
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,890
it's listed as a separate country from,
uh, from the battle to the reader name.

115
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,080
From a tweet that shocks Andrea. Yeah.
And you know Cortez 28 years old.

116
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,320
Yeah. Well, she beat, she beat
a 10 term incumbent combination.

117
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,890
Of course he was a white guy.
That's a, that's a negative for him.

118
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,520
She's but a woman of
color. Yeah. You know,

119
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,090
Latino Nice look at woman to
actually so, but, but, but,

120
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,500
but the thing is people I think in
that community are just voting out of

121
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,370
frustration. In fact, I looked
at her commercial, you know,

122
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,020
and it's a very powerful
commercial, you know, Kinda
like, you know about, you know,

123
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,430
I'm women like me are not
supposed to run for office.

124
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:55,160
We're not supposed to have court when,
I mean that's all bunch of nonsense.

125
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:59,000
But it's a story that, that,
you know, I think resonated
with a lot of people. Like,

126
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:03,290
Hey, let's stick it to the man. Right. You
know, and uh, and that's what they did.

127
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,420
But I think that this,

128
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,630
this a wave is going to be
bigger than people think.

129
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,900
I think people are underestimating
their like, oh, this is unique because,

130
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,390
you know, she, um, she's in a, you know,

131
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:19,040
a heavily minority community and so
that message work better. But look,

132
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,160
Bernie Sanders read this here.
The change just pulled up.

133
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,040
She won in a district
where she didn't even run.

134
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,630
Progressive candidate also won a primary
and our neighboring district in the

135
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:34,220
Bronx as a write in for the reform party.
Oh well that's alright. But she won.

136
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,560
She won. Well, I, you know,

137
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,460
I don't think you could have two
house seats simultaneously. Easy,

138
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,730
but the eyesight.
But if you look at Bernie Sanders appeal,

139
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,140
it wasn't just, you know, you know,
poor people and minorities that were,

140
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,140
that were attracted to
the Sanders message.

141
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,930
And what was that message
that was attractive socially?
It was, you know, it was,

142
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:00,260
it was, you know, giving things ratios
when we got, we got to tax the rich,

143
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,560
we've got a tax corporations,

144
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,210
you should of wealth and it's all
about getting stuff for free. Right?

145
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:10,010
It's all about, uh, you know,
free healthcare, free education,

146
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,070
guaranteed jobs. I mean, they want,

147
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,870
they want the government to
guarantee everybody a job.

148
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,200
Well then was one of the
things that Bernie said that
he could guarantee people,

149
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,480
Joe, you can't be one in the country. How,
how's the governor getting Karen teach?

150
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,090
First of all, where's the
government saying, where's The gun?

151
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,490
We're going to get the money. They
did that in the Soviet Union. Yeah,

152
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:29,450
everybody has a job, but
nobody makes anything. And
so everybody is poor. I mean,

153
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:31,400
you can't, they want,
they want a guarantee,

154
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:36,401
a $15 an hour job plus benefits plus
vacation plus health care to do what?

155
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,290
And of course,
what's the governor?

156
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,180
The governor is going to assign jobs to
everybody. What are they all going to do?

157
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,540
I mean,
people forget that we don't want jobs.

158
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,020
We want the productivity
that result from the job.

159
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,650
So it's about productive
employment, not make work, right?

160
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,860
We don't want it to government digging
holes and filling them. We want real.

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,790
And how do, how does a private
sector know what jobs are needed?

162
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,050
It's demand. It's there. It's
individuals that want something.

163
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,270
They're guided by a profit motive.
You know,

164
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,280
the government does that have
governor doesn't make a profit.

165
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,930
There's nothing to guide them to
efficiently allocate resources.

166
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:16,020
And how's the government going to just
figure out what people should do and just

167
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,860
assign them?
Yeah.
