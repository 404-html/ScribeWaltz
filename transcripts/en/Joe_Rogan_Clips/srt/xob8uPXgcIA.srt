1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,020
Did you have something to do with looking
for the Tasmanian Tiger? Yeah. Yeah,

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,820
I did know.
What do you think?

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,160
I think of all the extinct animals that
have gone extinct at the hand of man,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,710
given the range,
I don't know if you know this,

5
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,740
but the Tasmanian Tiger at one point
range from Pop Warner Guinea all the way

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:21,600
down to Tasmania. So not just the
island of Tasmania but thousands,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,420
tens of thousands of miles. I think given
the range, the frequency of sightings,

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,730
the amount of untouched habitat in
Australia and Tasmania and Papa New Guinea

9
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,750
where they just found a new dog
species by the way. They did. Yeah,

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,550
the Highland dog and New Guinea,
uh, maybe a year ago now.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,190
Incredible looking animal like absolutely.

12
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:41,760
Could there be a very small remnant
population of thylacine Tasmanian Tiger

13
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:45,570
hiding out in a isolated pocket of
habitat? I totally think it's possible.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,550
And these sightings, are they coming
from credible sources? So I did,

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,720
I did one expedition.

16
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,970
I've done two expeditions looking
for titles scene and one of them,

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was literally talking to the man who
is the head park ranger for like the

18
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:03,900
entire north Queensland. So He's a
scientist by trade, a biologist by degree.

19
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,040
And he says, I saw four
of them. Whoa. You know,

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,300
so this isn't like some crackpot drunk
who's like, yeah there are, they're here,

21
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,660
you know, this is a guy who is like
myself, a scientist, a biologist,

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,870
and spends his life in the bush. He knows
every animal in that area. And he goes,

23
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:17,520
I saw four of them.
Wow.

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,000
So like how do you not like I
get goosebumps talking about it.

25
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:23,160
Cause how do you not like
take that as credible? No,

26
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,740
that's about as credible as it gets. Well
look at that cool looking door. There.

27
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:29,670
It is. What a freaky looking into the
world's rarest and most ancient dog's been

28
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,780
rediscovered in the wild.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,540
So this New Guinea Highland
dog was thought to be extinct.

30
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,900
Is that the that's right.
Yup. Wow. So this thylacine,

31
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:39,300
this area is where,
where they are.

32
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:43,530
Has there been a concerted effort to
find these things? Sort of. I mean it's,

33
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:47,340
it's one of those things where like I
would say the thylacine is like the icon

34
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,950
of animals coming back from
extinction for Australia. Right?

35
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,280
It's kind of like everybody knows about
it in Australia, they all care about it.

36
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:57,720
But where these efforts are is like
outside of Sydney or you know what I mean?

37
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:58,980
It's,
it's close to home.

38
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:03,390
So there hasn't been a lot of expeditions
really deep in to look for him and

39
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:07,770
that's what I did. So there's so much
belief that the animal is still out there,

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,390
that the uh, oh shoot, it's
the university in cans.

41
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,040
I'm blanking on the name of it right now.

42
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,270
The university itself put money
towards funding to find it.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,110
So when you have a credible institution
like a university going, here's money,

44
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,690
go and find this thing.
You've got to think,

45
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,610
and I'm not a big conspiracy theorist,
but you've got to think,

46
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,950
they have some Intel that says,
look,

47
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,320
we're not wasting our money to look
for something that's not there.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,910
We've heard something,
we've seen something,

49
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,980
we caught something on a trail camera,
let's prove it.

50
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,950
And so actually teamed up with did
caught something on a trail camera.

51
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,710
Hard to say. But what they
did do is fun this expedition.

52
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:45,000
So myself and the university who is
still ongoing with the research when it

53
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:48,840
looked in this area in north Queensland
where I went and how far deep did you go

54
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:53,560
in? Uh, 1200 miles. 1200 miles? Yep.

55
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,270
Took 14 hours driving and then
hiking from there. Whoa. Yeah.

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,070
14 hours on dirt roads
because this is the,

57
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,570
where they've incited the most numerous,
uh,

58
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,240
this is where that siding that
I was talking about came from,

59
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:06,910
from the biologist as well as
I think for other sightings.

60
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,540
The community up there is a place called
Portland roads. You could look it up.

61
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,840
I think it's 12 people and wow.

62
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,560
Live totally not like the Amazon off
the grid, but off the grid, you know,

63
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,130
it's all like solar energy and build it
yourself. There's no power lines, blah,

64
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,580
blah.

65
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,540
So it's just this small group of kind
of like people in the middle of nowhere.

66
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,720
And almost everybody in that
community has seen them. So that's,

67
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,940
that's where we based it out of.
And then went deep from that.

68
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,690
Almost everyone in the community and no
one's taking a photograph that they have

69
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,650
cameras, everybody's, you
know, everybody's got a
cell phone kind of thing.

70
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,920
But it's like, it's all, it's always
the same story where it's like, yeah,

71
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,270
it was there. It was late at night
by the time I reached in my pocket,

72
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,620
it had gone off except for the biologist
I was telling you about who said it ran

73
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:51,910
around with his dogs. Yeah. He's
out camping and he's like, oh,

74
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,790
there's this red eye shine and my
dog goes nuts and runs over there.

75
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,230
And then there's four thylacine jumping
around with my dog like for like 15

76
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,740
minutes. And he's like, I'm trying to get
a picture and it's like 300 yards away.

77
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:06,490
It's in the dark and without the
flashlight and the phone and like, yeah,

78
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,180
it's like, it's basically 100%
of those things alive. I mean,

79
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,860
as a scientist you can never put
that in number, but two pretty yes.

80
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,480
That's why I've done two expeditions
and I plan on doing more.

81
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,620
I feel it's out there.
