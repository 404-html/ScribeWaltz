1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,170
Yeah. Wait, so you, cause you were
telling me this and I was like,

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,630
he was about to tell me before you came
and I was like this sounds like this

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,280
could be pretty good. Don't tell me save
it for the podcast that cause he's done.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,580
This is the most press Sean's done for
a film that he's put out that did you go

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,360
under? They were like let's give
you some advice on media. Yeah.

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,780
Well first of all I'm terrible at
it. There's that, cause I don't do,

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,790
this is the thing,
when you direct a movie,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,380
especially in movies like the kind of
movies that I make comedies and you know

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,380
big broad comedies, people don't
really care who directed those movies.

10
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:33,840
And I'm good with that.
Like I'm totally good with that.

11
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,960
But what usually happens is the studio,

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,860
the director usually wants to be
kind of a part of the campaign.

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,300
So the studio will find,

14
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:44,850
they'll sort of throw bones at
u of like press that you can do.

15
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:47,940
And I always tell them, look, if I can
be helpful in any way, let me know.

16
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,080
I'll do whatever you need me to do,

17
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,530
but don't throw many bones
cause I don't care. Right.

18
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:56,531
I don't need it to Kinda just pump up
the ego of the director that certain

19
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,890
directors just really want to be the
next Quentin turn. Yeah, I can't,

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,070
I can't imagine there's some directors
they really have to do it for. I get it.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,790
They don't want you to
feel left out or whatever.

22
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,060
But by my first couple of movies I
thought, oh I have to do this stuff.

23
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,930
And then I realized,

24
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:13,470
I actually had this experience where I
was in this red carpet thing and they

25
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:16,410
brought me up to this reporter and
they said, this is Shawn Andrews.

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,050
He directed the movie and she had this
big look on her face and then she went

27
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:22,230
like, ugh, cheese. And I
was like, Nah, it's cool.

28
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:25,470
You don't have so disappointed.

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:29,580
So disappointed. And that's when it
sunk into me where I was just like,

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,460
oh they don't care. They don't give
it. So that's, that's fine with me.

31
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,180
I'm good there.

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,960
Well there's such fame whores and
those days are those red carpet things.

33
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:40,020
There are so weird. Yeah,
those things are so weird.

34
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,190
And some people that is the highlight
of their life walking that carpet.

35
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,960
I can't chew over here. Tom
got your pose down. Right.

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,980
It's a really weird thing.
Also the Paparazzi at the
airport, you have that where,

37
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,370
um,

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,240
I've seen them where I'm at baggage and
they're looking around and then they're

39
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:04,470
like, hey Tom. And they'll ask me
like more thing and they're like,

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,020
they're obviously not there for
me, but they're like, they're like,

41
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:10,440
we got time till fucking whatever.
Seth Rogan gets off the plane,

42
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,440
so let me ask you something. And then
they're like, oh, all right, nevermind.

43
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:16,210
Here's everybody. Like, just blow you off.

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,410
I happen only one time because this
obviously doesn't happen to me.

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,000
They was flying at lax and I was getting
off a red eye and I was so just tired.

46
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,550
I looked like shit and that,
and this guy,

47
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,850
these two guys come up and they just
were so nice. They were like, hey,

48
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:34,500
you're Sean Anders. Right? And I was like,
yeah, yes I am John Anderson. Nobody ever,

49
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,990
you know?
And so it takes me a second to realize,

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,870
and I thought it was so weird because
they were, it was right after,

51
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,540
it was shortly after daddy's home.
And that was like the biggest hit.

52
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,300
And they were asking me about
horrible bosses too. And I was like,

53
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,060
why are they asking me about, of all
things horror? And I thought, oh,

54
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,500
because Jennifer Aniston's in it.

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,370
So they want me to say something about
Jennifer Aniston and just see if they can

56
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,650
catch me saying something crazy and
looking for a soundbite slip or something.

57
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,570
There's all they tried to do.
Yeah. It was the worst. It's weird.

58
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,450
And my wife is like, what
was that? I'm like, I, I,

59
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,670
it took me like an hour to sort of like
trying to make you click bait. It's not,

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,501
yeah.
Well,

61
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:13,360
what's interesting too is it's like sort
of an impromptu interview that you have

62
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,820
to do, right? Like if somebody
said, hey, this guy's name is Mike.

63
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,240
He lives in studio city. He wants
you to go to his house and, uh,

64
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,930
he's gonna film you. Uh, he's going to
ask you wacky questions. He'd be like, no.

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,610
Yeah,

66
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,120
but if Mike shows up at the baggage claim
and puts that camera in your face, hey,

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,070
Sean, Jennifer Aniston, man, what's up
with the Botox? You're like, what? Yeah.

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,350
Fuck. You know what I mean?
That's how they get, like,

69
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,770
you wouldn't do an interview with
them under any other circumstances,

70
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,120
which is one of like,

71
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,970
one of the weird things that happened
during the Roseanne Barr things.

72
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:47,780
Roseanne Barr, when her show was canceled
and all the controversy was going on,

73
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:51,800
she was supposed to do the podcast and
it became a big news thing cause she put

74
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:55,760
it on her, uh, her Twitter that I'm
going to do it. And we talked about it.

75
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,940
And then they tried to show
up at the podcast studio.

76
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:03,770
So they had all these news people standing
outside the podcast studio with their

77
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,970
microphones were out at,

78
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,030
out in front of where Joe Rogan does
his podcast and they thought for some

79
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:14,510
reason, just because they're there, people
have to talk to them. Right. I'm here.

80
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,730
Talk to me like they're made out of
milk. They're barely human. They,

81
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:24,200
the way they talk is the
most boring version of an
interview you'd ever get ever.

82
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,950
It's a tiny, quick little soundbite,
but they feel like, because they're,

83
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:32,090
they're like, the camera's on. I've got
the microphone. Come on it. You do it.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,780
If they said, hey, you know, kw,

85
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,390
fuck yourself once you to come in and
sit down for an interview, you'd be like,

86
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,790
no, I don't want to. I don't want
to talk to them. I don't know.

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,180
I don't have anything to
say like, Oh, I'll do all my
talking on the podcast. Yeah,

88
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,680
well, but, and also if you're, I
mean, I'm in the business, but again,

89
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:52,390
I'm not somebody that does a
tremendous amount of pressure,

90
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,390
or at least not until
a couple of weeks ago.

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,930
And if you're not accustomed to that,
it's terrifying.

92
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,570
It's weird because somebody puts a
camera in your face because immediately

93
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:03,030
you're thinking like, well, if I just
go, you know what man? Fuck you. Like,

94
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,730
I don't have time for that. Then you're
going to, so you just think like,

95
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,320
I can't even walk away from this.

96
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:09,810
So you're just feeling like you're all
of a sudden somebody through a cage over

97
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:13,800
you and they're not even asking you,
can I do this? They're just doing it.

98
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:17,010
They're just, hey Sean. Yeah. Let me
ask you a question, Shawn. It's forced.

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,030
It's forced on you.
It puts you in a weird spot.

100
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,130
It's like all of a sudden you're in your,
you're on,

101
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:25,770
you're on your heels because
you're instinct is to be defensive.

102
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:28,440
If someone could see your, you know what
I mean? Your instinct is not going to be,

103
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,670
I'll give the most thoughtful
answer to this because it's, it's,

104
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,660
it's in the moment. Someone just dropped
it on you. So now you're like, okay,

105
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:40,590
and your, your emotions might be kind
of all over the place and you're not,

106
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,890
you're not stopping to like,
like having a conversation.

107
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,500
You're just sort of trying
to figure your way out of it.

108
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,570
And how many people have
ruined their careers or lives
on those things just said,

109
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,190
just fucked up and said one, they just
try to be funny or just that's the thing.

110
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,000
Cause they'll misquote,
dated and then they get ya.

111
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,630
And then they put it up and you're like,
fuck, why didn't I think through that?

112
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,800
I was coming home from the airport,
I was tired.

113
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:08,801
I was jetlagged Bordain got a shitload
of death threats because he said they

114
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:13,340
asked him if you had a serve dinner
to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump,

115
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:16,890
what would you serve? He said,
hemlock, he's trying to be funny. Yeah.

116
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,090
And then you all these Manga fucking
morons protestors were there.

117
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:25,790
They were all sending these
tweets like Potus, you know,

118
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,460
he's threatening POTUS and it
was so strange. Like where,

119
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:33,050
where's the NFL? You know,
where's the secret service?

120
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,460
They should lock this motherfucker up.
And like you guys are crazy. It's a joke.

121
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,520
And that's the thing right there
is that clickbait articles are,

122
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,360
they all make it,

123
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,660
it'll say like so and so said this and
they make it sound like somebody like

124
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:48,620
called a press conference to say something
ridiculous. And really it was like,

125
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,221
like you said,

126
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:54,200
it'll be some offhand remark and then
people out there that are judging they

127
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,470
that they never have anybody walk up
and put a camera in their face and they

128
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,940
just think, well, I would
never say anything like that.

129
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,670
It's like you don't know what you would
say. You're never in that situation.

130
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,230
It's bizarre. It's very bizarre. Bizarre.

131
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,570
So how many of these things did you
have to do to promote this film?

132
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:13,520
Because it will, because of this
film was based in large part of it.

133
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,400
On your actual life experiences
of adopting these kids.

134
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,660
How many of these things did
you have to wind up doing a lot?

135
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:22,100
Because I did,

136
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,820
we did our press junket in New York and
I've done junkets and usually I do like,

137
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,090
you know, six or seven or 15
or whatever I did in two days.

138
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,170
I did like 90 95 sort of the same
questions keep coming at you over and over

139
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,890
again and you start developing these
canned responses. That's the thing,

140
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,840
you have to,
and this is a mistake,

141
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,760
and this gets back to what
you were getting at before,

142
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:44,510
is that when I would do press
on my movies in the past,

143
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,510
I go to the junket and people would come
in and they didn't ask you more or less

144
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:50,480
the same questions. And I always felt
weird because I just felt like, no,

145
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,980
I just want to have a
conversation with you.

146
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,680
I don't want to be like
this disingenuous guy.

147
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:58,130
And then I would be sort of changing
up my answers and trying to kind of,

148
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,790
and it just essentially just made it
boring and I wasn't really making any kind

149
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,050
of a point whatsoever. So, uh, on
this one, they were like, look,

150
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,520
you've got a message with this movie.

151
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,140
You've got things you want
to get out with this movie.

152
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,930
You've got to learn how to do this.
So I went,

153
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,020
I went to like a day of media training.
And it was,

154
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,670
I did, I did. And it was,

155
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,870
the worst part was I had done
interviews and I've been fine before.

156
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,050
I got this guy sitting
across from me. Uh, who's,

157
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,270
who's interviewing me
doing this mock interview,

158
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,780
and then I've got the publicist and my
writing partner and they're just staring

159
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:35,870
at me and now all of a sudden I can't
do it. Right. All the pressures there.

160
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,710
Who's teaching you?
Who is teaching this media training?

161
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,860
Here's what they right away like, you
kind of suck at this. Absolutely were.

162
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,750
I mean, they were really nice about
it. They were like, okay, all right,

163
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,570
well there's some, there's some room for
improvement. Oh my God. Really? Oh yeah.

164
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:53,990
I know. It was the worst. It
was, seemed like a natural,

165
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,420
I mean there's what is there to teach.
You well know what it was. This,

166
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,040
this is the thing is I'm really
comfortable with this with,

167
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,100
with us just hanging out here talking.
Sure.

168
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,060
But this is what I do is I Yammer
when I'm, I'm a nervous talker.

169
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:09,510
So you asked me a question if I'm nervous,
I just kind of go and go and go.

170
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,310
And people are like, Geez, us, you know

171
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:18,720
that guy talk.
So the thing is,

172
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,920
I got this guy sitting across me,

173
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,440
really nice guy and he's
The guy who's coaching me,

174
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,580
but I know I'm going to get some trolls,
like fake interviews.

175
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,890
Well he'd how they coach
you first he gave me,

176
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,850
he gave me a lot of really good insights
and the funny thing is every rule that

177
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:36,210
he's saying as he sang it, I'm
going, Oh yeah, I do that. Oh yeah.

178
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,140
Like everything he's saying
that I shouldn't be doing.
I'm like, Oh yeah, that's,

179
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,680
I always do. What is he saying
you shouldn't be doing? I
mean that the main thing,

180
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,650
it's kind of like what we were getting
at before that when somebody is setting a

181
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:47,610
trap for you,

182
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,390
because so much of right
now media training is just
about don't go out and get

183
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,950
yourself into trouble by going in and,

184
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,240
and just talking about some ridiculous
area that, cause that's what people,

185
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,450
that's what everybody's trying to
do now. Like just as a, for example,

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,480
I did a Time magazine interview about
adoption about a year before we even made

187
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,270
the movie. Really? Yeah. The,

188
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,640
and it was just because I was in the
process of working on the movie anyway,

189
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,670
the whole thing was just about
adoption and my family and whatever.

190
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:19,530
And it was right when the Harvey
Weinstein stuff was blowing up. So ladies,

191
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,920
really nice interview. And then at
the end she says, uh, hey, you know,

192
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,660
since I'm talking to a Hollywood director,

193
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,350
I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you
know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff?

194
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,510
And I was like, Nah. And I mean it.

195
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,240
And I didn't even think about my
answer because I don't, you know,

196
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,790
I didn't know the guy was
never around any of it.

197
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,480
That's sort of like more
like fancy movies. And I was
like, yeah, I know I don't,

198
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,490
I don't know. I never met the guy,
whatever. I didn't think anything of it.

199
00:10:42,491 --> 00:10:45,180
And I got off the phone and then
I thought, oh, she didn't say,

200
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:48,600
what do you think about this stuff? She
said, did you know about that stuff?

201
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:54,300
And it was like, and then I knew, but
I kept it a secret. Yeah. Those people.

202
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:59,290
And I just thought right away,
I just, you know, so yeah.

203
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,340
It's, it's, it's sneaky. That's a
sneaky way of asking. It's a sneaky,

204
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,110
the way to get you to yeah,
yeah, yeah. Did you know,

205
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,270
well if you don't enter his captors
Weinstein secret for years, I,

206
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,280
I'm such a dumb shit. I would have,
like you said before, I think,

207
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,630
I think a year or two ago I might of made
a joke, you know, and been like, oh yeah,

208
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:23,310
I was there, you know, just
printing. Yeah. Anders was there.

209
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,930
And then if you like what you
know, so, uh, so you know,

210
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,650
a lot of it is just just to kind of teach
you how to just sort of stay on point

211
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,640
so that you don't get dragged down these
weird roads into these things that just,

212
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,130
that people are looking to
get you in on clickbait.

213
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,940
So did you bring up that instance when
you went through the training? Oh yeah.

214
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,150
Did you say what should I have said?
I think I did.

215
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,880
I think and really what they,
what they teach you.

216
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,170
It was funny cause believe it or not,

217
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,020
he said I'm going to show
you some clips of, you know,

218
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,970
sort of doing it right and doing it wrong.
Oh they have disaster clips.

219
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:59,230
They say they do. And one of them, the
file that you sent to jail, the show,

220
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,080
and you guys will probably
all know this one.

221
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
They showed me a clip
of Quentin Tarantino,

222
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,730
sort of like getting really
angry with this reporter.

223
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,320
Does that the violent thing?
Yeah.

224
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,310
I thought it was kind of and kick
some guys asked that lady was like,

225
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,850
your films are disgusting and
violent. And he was like, yeah,

226
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,100
they're fucking movies dummy.
Like he gets really upset about it.

227
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,310
And where was this? Actually I
don't know if it's the same one.

228
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:24,850
Cause the one that I saw was a
guy. Oh I saw him with a lady. Uh,

229
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,850
but that was via sat like a,
okay. So this is a different one.

230
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:31,510
Then there was one where
the guy's threatening to
kick the guy's ass. I don't,

231
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,190
the one that I saw didn't go that far.

232
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:36,520
But what I actually Kinda liked
what he did cause he was like, no,

233
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,590
I'm not playing that game with you.
I'm not doing,

234
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,770
he got all pissed off but I
was sort of like, Eh, you know,

235
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,480
I liked that he does that. I mean I liked
the one with the lady. The lady is like,

236
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:50,740
your movies are so violent. Awful. And
he was like a movie, a make belief thing.

237
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,580
It's not real violence. Like he really
Sassy as her. It's funny as shit.

238
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,900
And then I also, so she, where was
she? She was doing, you know, she was,

239
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,590
she was like good morning Pittsburgh,
like the entertainment reporter.

240
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,030
And then he was actually probably doing
like satellite stuff everywhere and he

241
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,430
was just like, you're dumb. So, uh,

242
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,810
but I also saw there's that guy,
he's a Gotcha guy too.

243
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:17,350
Did a Robert Downey jr it was
like promoting a movie too.

244
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:20,070
I don't know if they should go that
one. Right. And the guy's like, yeah,

245
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,510
now your drug addiction.
He was like, wait, what?

246
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,770
Like it was totally to try to get
him to, you know, in a moment,

247
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,270
Robert Downey jr is not having it. He's
like, Nah, I'm here to promote a movie.

248
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,400
Yeah. This has nothing to do with that.
Totally. Is that what he said? But let's,

249
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
let's get into your drug addiction. Yeah.
He was like, during your darkest times,

250
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,010
like what are you talking about man,
iron mans out.

251
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,340
I'm not doing my hair for that.
Well, it's just like the ends it too.

252
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,360
They're so selfish. Like that thing is
so doing shit like that is so selfish.

253
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,200
It's such a sneaky little thing to do.
They know. What did they teach you though?

254
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:56,650
Like in that moment of like
Quintin, they're just like,
don't, don't get emotional.

255
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,550
Well, it's like don't take the bait
and, and more than anything for me,

256
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:04,330
because I look, I'm from Wisconsin
and I still have that kind of,

257
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,800
everybody's nice, everybody has good
intentions, kind of five, you know. So,

258
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,190
and I had this experience on my very first
movie where I talked to this reporter

259
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,750
because it was a movie about a,
it was a road trip. You know,

260
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,850
it's just a silly road trip comedy,
you know,

261
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,990
and I talked to this reporter and he
says, and he, and he was just being,

262
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,080
he was being really cool.

263
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,540
We were just kinda hanging out after
this thing talking and he's like,

264
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,620
sa and gas prices were really high. And he
goes, so yeah. You know, he's, he's like,

265
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:33,340
you feel worried about making a road
trip movie when gas prices are so high?

266
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,610
And I, and I said like, ah,
I don't know. I, I, you know,

267
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,590
maybe if the movie tanks I can just blame
it on that no one could afford to go

268
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,440
to the theater because the prices
were so high and I don't think,

269
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,660
and then this article comes out that just,

270
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,990
the guy literally said I was
swarthy looking and it just,

271
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,560
he just painted me like an absolute
piece of shit and I was like,

272
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,460
that guy was so cool.

273
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,550
Like he was like when we were having
a nice time talking and then he just

274
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,330
destroyed me. I've been there.
Yeah, I'm sure you guys have. Yeah,

275
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,600
that's all new to me. I remember
one too that like who did it to me,

276
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,910
like when I was just doing phone,

277
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,980
like a phone interview for press before
I was selling any tickets and the guy

278
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:10,401
was like,

279
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:15,401
just like a really nice guy and totally
twisted things and made it seem like

280
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,820
just like he knows what I was saying and
he purposely twisted things around and

281
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:25,100
then it had real no, no impact. But I
remember reading that and being like,

282
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,200
Oh fuck this guy and,

283
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,940
and be careful when you talk to
these people because he totally,

284
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,210
he knows what I was trying to say and
I, and I read this article, I was like,

285
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:39,230
he misrepresented everything. Yeah. Well
that's the only way they can have fun.

286
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,800
Yeah. And that's the only, I mean if
you're just a normal guy and you give a,

287
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,490
you know, normal answers and
you're thoughtful and considerate,

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,410
that's not as good for them. Right. It's
boring to them. Twist it around. Well,

289
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,630
it's not just, it's not as profitable.
Right. It's more profitable.

290
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,330
Especially if it's an online
thing with an online thing.

291
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,530
You need a clickbait title.

292
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,870
You need a bunch of people clicking on
that thing because otherwise you're not

293
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,650
going to get any ad revenue for it.
Yes.

294
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,760
It's a very bizarre model where it's like
encouraging people to be deceptive and

295
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,900
to make these things inflammatory.
And I got to say, I mean, look, I did,

296
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,351
like I said,

297
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:17,351
I did nineties 95 interviews and suck
in the course of two days and virtually

298
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,920
everybody was really cool, really asking,
really thoughtful, interesting question.

299
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,920
So I don't want to make it sound like
I'm ripping on the whole press over this.

300
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:25,251
But yeah,

301
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,640
there are these people and that's the
thing is that if it was every single

302
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:29,570
person that came along,

303
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,330
it would almost be easier because
you could just kind of be like, okay,

304
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,950
here we go. I got it. Right. But
you, but you get like 30 really good,

305
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,873
you know,
uh,

306
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,960
reporters with integrity and good people
and then somebody jumps in and you're

307
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,220
like, oh yeah. And then, then,

308
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,800
then they catch you not looking because
you're not looking for that guy.

309
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,050
It also gets super jaded,
you know?

310
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:51,200
It's almost like cops that have arrested
too many people. Everyone's a crook.

311
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,230
Like they just think that everybody that
we're interviewing is a piece of shit.

312
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
And it's also like they're
interviewing these Hollywood people.

313
00:16:57,501 --> 00:17:00,440
They're thinking of you. You had a
big mansion and driving a Mercedes.

314
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:04,670
You got all this money. Fuck this guy.
It's like this instant take on it. Oh,

315
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:09,560
a Hollywood director. Right, right. How's
your casting couch? Yeah. Shit. Yeah,

316
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,170
that's true. It's true.
And it becomes the game.

317
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,060
I think too for them the game is like,

318
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,960
let's see if I can get one and we
shouldn't be real clear. This is not,

319
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:21,920
most people, most people are
nice, but it's just like one,

320
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:24,620
even if it's only one out of 10
you run into that one. You're like,

321
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,930
fuck these things.
I don't want to do these things anymore.

322
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,920
Totally terrifying because you think
about your family, your friends,

323
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:34,010
like anybody who's going to
cause now there, there is this,

324
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,930
and I know you guys talk about this a lot.

325
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,931
There is this culture out there where
people are completely reduced to like one

326
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:44,510
moment or one statement or whatever it is.
And that's all you are,

327
00:17:44,511 --> 00:17:48,800
is that whatever that thing that
happened in that one moment and you know,

328
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,600
you see it happening to people all
the time and you think about so,

329
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:55,350
so when you're there and you feel
like you're just a regular guy,

330
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:57,210
you don't feel like you know that.

331
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,900
It's really scary because you think
about your kids and you think of it,

332
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:04,470
you know, it's so, it's a, it's a
scary situation. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

333
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,040
it's a weird time for these
publications to them and it's done.

334
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,570
Nothing taken in consideration.

335
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:14,571
No one's really buying magazines
and newspapers like they used to.

336
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:16,410
It's hard to sell.

337
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,280
And so they're reduced to these online
publications and they have to compete

338
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:24,750
with a bunch of these click baity bullshit
things. And that's where the money is.

339
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,310
I mean, even in New York Times, man,

340
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:29,520
the New York Times is resulting
to a lot of click baity shit now.

341
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
And you're like,
wow.

342
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,020
Well do you guys have that feeling like
when you're online that you're on like a

343
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,020
clickbait diet where you see
things where you're like, oh man,

344
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:40,080
I totally want to eat that right now, but
like I'm not, I'm not going to do that.

345
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,410
Let me get an ingredient.
Yeah, open it up. Oh, it's so
sweet that you click on it,

346
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,370
you're like, navigate it. Now you
read that title and you're like,

347
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,580
I know this will have no substance to
like one moment or one statement or

348
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,371
whatever it is.

349
00:18:56,371 --> 00:18:59,910
And that's all you are is that whatever
that thing that happened in that one

350
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,800
moment.
And you know,

351
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:05,520
you see it happening to people all
the time and you think about so,

352
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,340
so when you're there and you feel
like you're just a regular guy,

353
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,200
you don't feel like you know that.

354
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,900
It's really scary because you think
about your kids and you think of it,

355
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:17,460
you know, it's so, it's a, it's a
scary situation. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

356
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,560
it's a weird time for these publications
to them and it's taken in consideration.

357
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:27,561

358
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,400
It's hard to sell.

359
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,270
And so they're reduced to these online
publications and they have to compete

360
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:37,740
with a bunch of these click baity bullshit
things, and that's where the money is.

361
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,300

00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:50,010
clickbait diet where you see

Yeah.
