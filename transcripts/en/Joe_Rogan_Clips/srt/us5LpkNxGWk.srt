1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,840
I Dunno if kids have changed or whatever.
Now they haven't changed.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,050
They just think that this is the
thing to do. Now, look, when I was in,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,980
when I was doing college is way back
in the day, I was in my twenties,

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,480
I did a college in Connecticut.
And right after I did the call,

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:20,570
I was talking to the kids. I would
do, I would do my set and then, uh,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,590
I would like open up for Q and a yeah.
Fuck's going on my throat.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,300
But it was,
um,

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,100
I was probably 23,
four,

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,110
25, maybe, maybe 25 at the oldest. So I'll
just, a couple of years older than them.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,540
And so it was fun for me to talk to
them about what life is like when you

11
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,060
actually have to pay your own bills
and you're out, you're out free.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,930
And some guy goes, uh,
you know, you got like,

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
I was doing the question thing and
some guy goes, uh, I go, you know,

14
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:58,830
I, I lift his hand to be able to tell a
joke. I go tell a joke and I go to Jews,

15
00:00:58,831 --> 00:01:03,790
walk into a bar, they buy it.
It's an old fucking street.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,400
Yeah. Street joke after the show, you
know the show goes great. I say thank you.

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,730
I really appreciate you guys coming out.
It was really a lot of fun. Thank you.

18
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:12,300
Good night.

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,320
So afterwards I was hanging around and
say hi to people and there was no picture

20
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,420
taken back then cause he had
to have an actual camera.

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,690
Then we had a fucking camera. It was
a long time, long time ago. This is a,

22
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:26,691
I'm 51 so this is a 90 91
92 somewhere around that.

23
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,750
Um, so this one guy
comes up to me, he goes,

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,710
the joke you said about Jewish people's
very offensive and I thought he was

25
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:38,850
joking. I go, are you serious? I
think it was, yes, very offensive.

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,170
And he's like nervous and shit and like
it has a hard time looking me in the eye

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,840
and I go, dude, I could think
about what the joke says.

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,710
It's about Jewish people being really
good at business. You walk into a bar,

29
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:53,070
they decided to buy it. It's such a,
it's nothing offensive about it at all.

30
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,870
You know? It's crazy. It's like it's
like people now and maybe forever.

31
00:01:57,871 --> 00:02:02,871
I've always heard shit
and they immediately think
this means if I'm thinking

32
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,140
something bad about this,

33
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,170
that means that someone is
saying something bad about it.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
They decided this is a taboo subject.

35
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,490
Even if you're not even say
anything negative about it.

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,430
Like say if you do a joke
about interracial relationships
or interracial race,

37
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:18,690
you just say it.
If you just do a joke about that,

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,370
there are people that are going to
put red flags up instantly and look to

39
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:27,270
misinterpret anything that you say
on purpose because they don't want,

40
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,770
they don't want that thought in their
head. They don't want the thought of,

41
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,220
you know,

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,650
like this guy's looking for antisemitism
in that joke to Jews walk into a bar,

43
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,080
they buy it. There's nothing
there. You could look all day long.

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,230
It's a joke about Jewish folks buying
stuff, right? It does. It does.

45
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:47,970
Nothing negative or a positive stereotype.
It's like a big Dick Black Guy,

46
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,580
Joe. It's not negative. There's
nothing negative about it.

47
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,560
Nobody gets upset that you
think they have a big deck.

48
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,450
Plus they have a little deck.
It's a lot of lead time. It's,

49
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,280
it's young people that also flexing,
right?

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,330
They're free from the control of their
parents and I find them you dealing with

51
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:09,331
that more in like rich or upper middle
class families because I think they're

52
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:15,130
more hands on with their kids and more
controlling and those kids get free.

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,390
They want to exert their own freedom
and when they get free of their parents,

54
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,470
they want to establish that
they're different and that
they have their own mind,

55
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,540
their own,
and then we're part of the new generation.

56
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,030
The new generation is not
going to tolerate racism,

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,650
CIS Hetero activity and they just decide
that they're going to fucking put their

58
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:36,880
foot down. But it's a pattern that repeats
itself over and over and over again.

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,300
It's just today they have social
media and this is the difference.

60
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,380
The difference is they feel like they're
empowered because they get online and

61
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:47,380
other morons that are the same
age as them. Confirm with.

62
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,500
You can just confirm any
belief that you want.

63
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,360
Like that's another lesson I've gotten
from this is just like confirmation bias

64
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,750
is like the wildest shit ever.
You can, you can be like,

65
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,400
there's one lady who wrote some Shit, I'm
anti gay, anti black and other people.

66
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes. I'm like, yes, this is clearly, this
is clearly what he was saying. I'm like,

67
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,420
what that you took that from my set.
Me,

68
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:13,750
I'm anti gay and I don't think
there's a solution here. Yeah,

69
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:17,320
I've looked at this heart for a long time
now. We need safe spaces for comedians.

70
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,870
Just no solution because you're dealing
with immature people in terms of like

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,690
the literally the development
of their frontal lobe.

72
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,640
They're not fully formed yet. How much do
you think of it is like I put it in my,

73
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,230
the op Ed that I wrote,
but it's like,

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,290
I was thinking about like how much of it
now as a function of the fact that like

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,620
we immediately get whatever we want
in our hands. You know what I mean?

76
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,630
Like those instant gratification.

77
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:46,900
So it was like instant kind of thought
process where there's no real thinking

78
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:50,150
that occurs. It's more just like, this
comes into my brain. I hear gay black,

79
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,660
it has to be, this is
wrong. It's coming out.

80
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,940
Yeah, for sure. I mean,

81
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:57,900
if you say gay black on stage
today in a really liberal,

82
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,580
very progressive environment,
you get this thing you,

83
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:05,581
but you have to say something like pro
super pro gay and super pro black and it,

84
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,090
it doesn't even have to be
a joke. Right? Like get,

85
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,480
you're better off just going
for that applause. Break, move

86
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,540
comedian. I mean, people want,

87
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,260
people want their comedians
to be their leaders.

88
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,600
That's what, that's what it feels
like when it is one a laugh. No,

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,850
people, when I say people, I mean like
this next group of, uh, of comedy,

90
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,940
like of the people that were at the shop,

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
because the comedians that are going to
be their leaders aren't even gonna be

92
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,070
funny. They're gonna fucking
die to starve to death. You get,

93
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,270
once you get out in the real world, fuck
man, if you're not funny, you're fucked.

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,220
Yeah. Nothing but like, it's like,

95
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,770
like if I went up there and I said
Asians other shit and fuck Whitey,

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,150
I would've been, I have been the out
on the fucking chairs. They were,

97
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,420
they're going to carry me out
like this is all mother fucking,

98
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:57,150
you know what I mean?

99
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,730
But like that's the thing I think like
people like I'm not a hero man. I'm not,

100
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,350
I'm just trying to be heard, you
know? Well, your comic. Yeah.

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,220
Not trying to be funny. Yes.
That's all it is. This is, uh,

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,420
I really believe that this is just a
symptom of growing up and you're just

103
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,730
giving these people the power to
express themselves where there's,

104
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,410
there's no mature, wiser person
that's around them. It's his, hold on,

105
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,530
let's look at the context
of what he's doing. Right.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,660
Let's examine what he's doing and then
you're going to apologize to him because

107
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:26,570
this is clearly a fucking joke.
You hired a guy to tell jokes.

108
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,160
He tells jokes and you say, not
that chuck, this specific thing.

109
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,470
It's strange because there were like,
everyone's like,

110
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,060
he did not respect what the event
was. I'm like, Hey. I'm like,

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,820
what? I mean, I'm not this, I'm not
your mascot here, right? I'm not,

112
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,430
this is not a pep rally dog.
I'm here to tell jokes,

113
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,210
but you weren't hired to do a
speech about this event. I'm here.

114
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:51,800
Did he rack my fucking act?
