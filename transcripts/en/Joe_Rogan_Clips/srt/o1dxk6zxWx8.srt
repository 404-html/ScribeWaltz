1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,260
Like when kids come over with chocolate
or candy. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, good.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,810
I don't eat that stuff. Like you kind
of have to buy girl scout cookies.

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:09,180
You want to support the girl scout.
It's such a scam.

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:11,190
All that money goes to the manufacturer.

5
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:15,420
Apparently the girl scouts make like
20% of the the cookie money. Yeah,

6
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,890
they're getting fucked here. All scouts
again, fuck core. Someone came in,

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:24,780
some ruthless man.
Probably the MOA as it was.

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:28,620
That's exactly what it is. Those
are the shit. Yeah. With milk,

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,280
with a cold glass of milk.
Duncombe Yup.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,760
Fuck yeah.
It almost tastes like a neat look at that.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,600
Then look at it as it's
chocolatey coconut. He goodness.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,220
Why do they have to be so bad for you?
When I was,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,830
when I was working on a TV show,

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,940
one of the producers had a daughter who
was in the girl scouts and I guess you

15
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:54,900
win contest if you sell over,
if you saw the most cookie boxes.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,420
So when the audience would stream out
after the show is a daily Shell and the

17
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,520
audience would stream out and uh,

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,080
the girl had a table set up to sell their
cookies and she was selling a hundred

19
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,920
boxes a day and for
every day she was there,

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,530
fucking won that contest dam.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,880
And they would have the audience, a warm
up guy like plug it during the shell,

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,820
like after the shit, like a comedian
selling his cds after the show,

23
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,560
he could buy some girl scout cookies
on the way out. And all these,

24
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,990
these fat people from the Midwest,
they're like Kooky.

25
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,760
Like Marie Callender's digest
have pie. Just Pie. Just Pie.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,310
Yup. Not even good pie. It's
good, but it's not great
considering it's all they do.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,790
I should have eaten there. I don't think
I've ever eaten there. Maybe I it one,

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,260
I don't think I had their Pi.
That seems a weird thing.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,080
Like come selling pies.
Yeah, Blake, good luck.

30
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,340
You're going to go broke.
But they're everywhere.

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,330
We know you have an element. We know you
have flour branch out a little bit. Like,

32
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,550
who the fuck gets famous as selling pies?

33
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,130
Like how genius is that company and
men's member, Edmonds intimates,

34
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,490
but then they, they, they broke out of,
they started doing cakes and cookies too,

35
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,840
but they all, they did just pies for a
long time. Dude. They used to have this,

36
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,420
this Ark, God damn it, this pastry. I'm
trying to think of what the hell it was,

37
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,620
but it had like,

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,370
like hard sugar on the outside of it.
Yeah.

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,010
And that it had some sort of creamy
sweet stuff on the inside of it. Yeah.

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,490
Holy Shit. Was it good? Yeah.
God Damn. We lived off that shit.

41
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,230
We had admins every night.
They had like,

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,850
they had one that had like a chocolate
filling in it and it was powdered outsize

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,700
mine. They went out of business and then
they say, oh, that was the cheese one.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,540
That was a good one too. I remember
the cheese filled crumb. Those,

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,750
they had some ridiculously delicious
shit. Hey, what are the other big ones?

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,620
You know, I decided to fight
in a tournament once because a,

47
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:08,590
I had a crazy sugar
high from Dunkin donuts.

48
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,900
I'd hurt myself.
I hurt something in my crotch.

49
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,340
I couldn't work out for like a week or
that pulled some sort of a muscle and

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,680
there was a big tournament
that was coming up and uh, my,

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,530
all the guys that are competed with, we're
going to this tournament. I was like,

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,830
I had just fought like a week before.
I was like, I don't think I can do it.

53
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,680
I'm like, this doesn't feel right. I'm
just going to take the whole week off.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,550
So I decided I'm just going to take
off, let this thing heal. And so, uh,

55
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,470
delivering my newspapers and
I go to Dunkin donuts and
I got this powdered lemon

56
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,820
filled donut.

57
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,830
I got one of those and I got a Boston
cream donut there, got one of those.

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,200
And I got a, I ate like three donuts
cause I'd be exhausted, tired,

59
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,170
drinking coffee, delivering
fucking newspapers for three hours.

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,690
And I was so jacked on sugar
and coffee that I said, fuck it.

61
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,524
I want to fight.

62
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,770
And so I drove into town like
right before everybody was leaving.

63
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,530
They're like, why are you here? I said,
if I'm going to fight anyway, man,

64
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,760
like Beavis and Butthead, I won. I won.

65
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,970
The tournament was a giant
tournament for me. It was big.

66
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,740
It was the American open. It was like
a big, it's a big deal. Wow. Yeah.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,060
It wasn't going to do it. I got jacked
up on sugar and made a rash decision.
