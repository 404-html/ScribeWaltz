1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,860
Her low freak bitches. It's like, cause
I, I promote a lot of things, you know,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,150
we might disagree on but you know,

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:09,420
I promote a lot of ideas in science
that I've seen the evidence for and I've

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:11,970
seen a lot of it and we disagree.
Um,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,300
you know some dietary things I would
guess like, cause you know, we can,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,760
we can put a hash them like what are,
I don't know.

7
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,140
What are your thoughts on Gmos?

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,100
I think genetically modified foods is
apparently almost everything that you buy

9
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:26,790
at the supermarket. Okay. What did
we agree on that then? Probably,

10
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,370
and it's like I think they
know you by every orange.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,190
If you look at a piece of corn,
oh it's organic.

12
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,430
That Shit is genetically modified.
It's been modified for a hundred years.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,510
You're going to make me cry.

14
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:41,511
Tears of good Kevin full time before I
was so happy I had him on because he's

15
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,460
never in California.
Brought a, he, we went up,

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,810
we don't end up for dinner that night.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,160
So he takes a lot of shit because Monsanto
has funded some of the studies that

18
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,560
they've done. But the studies
are real and the studies of,

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,080
I mean you can see the results. They're
not manipulated. Yeah. Kevin, it's,

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,171
well actually you know what,

21
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:01,440
they funded his communication programs
so the heat can come out and do things

22
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:05,370
like this and they never
funded any of his research.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,630
I misspoke and said, no, no it's fine.
It's uh, but you know what, here's a,

24
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:12,590
and this is what, where he
got a lot of shit was, um,

25
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,200
was that he said I have nothing
to do with Monsanto. Um,

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,510
and like I think if he just said,
you know what,

27
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,690
they fund my communication program but
they don't have anything to do with my

28
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:25,230
research. Nobody would have a, I think
people still would have been mad,

29
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,900
but I think people would
have been far less mad.

30
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,480
And I feel so bad that he went through
everything with that because there was no,

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,830
it's tricky. I mean I just took a tour
there and I got hate mail and it's,

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,680
I mean we were so careful cause I was out
there for other business and they were

33
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,560
like, oh you're going to be out in
Ma in Missouri, come have a tour.

34
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:48,210
Like they didn't pay and I had so
much fun like it was, there was,

35
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,120
they have a lot of really cool tech
there and if you were ever in the area

36
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:55,200
they'd gladly, I show you around so
they're there. They were nice to me.

37
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,100
I was funny.
One of the,

38
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,550
one of the rumors that I heard about
that was that they only have organic food

39
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,170
in the cafeteria. I'm like, I'm taking,

40
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,520
I'm taking my camera around and taking
pictures of everything. The word organic,

41
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,950
what's organic and

42
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,420
organic uses pesticides and that's
something I think people see it. Yeah,

43
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,410
absolutely. I mean I thought that
was the whole point of organic.

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,480
You don't use pesticides.
No.

45
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:24,610
I'm sure there are some organic
farmers that don't use any possible.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,050
What defines organic food?

47
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,280
Let's find out what is the accepted
definitions of organic food?

48
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,260
Do you want to hear it from me? And then
from, from Google to see if I'm accurate.

49
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:35,641
All right.

50
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:40,290
So organic food works by certain farming
stand or agricultural standards and

51
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,300
they can use certain pesticides.

52
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,920
In most cases these pesticides
are derived from natural sources.

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,210
I'm not always,

54
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,510
but most of the time and some of these
pesticides includes pesticides like

55
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,980
rotenone and the pirate thrums and also
have, if you're familiar with bt corn,

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,870
the bt toxin is also used
in organic farming for the,

57
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:03,940
because it's a naturally
occurring a toxin,

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,380
it can be used and sprayed
topically on organic produce.

59
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,190
So a lot of these,
uh,

60
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,050
the things that we think of as just
conventional farming practices definitely

61
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:18,400
use an organic farming. It doesn't make
it any better or worse. Um, it just,

62
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:21,130
in a lot of cases it's a little
more expensive parcel because of the

63
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,610
certification process and partially
because it uses older farming techniques

64
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,100
that need, you know, a little
more land, that type of stuff.

65
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,110
It also uses till farming practices that,
you know,

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,510
digs up the ground a bit more and can
release a little more CO2. So in general,

67
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,040
I tend to, Oh, here we go.

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,590
Here we go.
Simply stated,

69
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:41,430
organic produce or other ingredients
are grown without the use of pesticides.

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,760
Synthetic fertilizers, excuse
me, hold on. Sewage sludge,

71
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:48,570
genetically modified organisms
or ionizing radiation.

72
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:50,400
Animals that produce meat,
poultry,

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,000
eggs and dairy products do not take
antibiotics or growth hormones.

74
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,190
The U s hold on,
sorry.

75
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,200
The U S Da National Organic
program defines organic as follows.

76
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,300
Organic food is produced by farmers who
emphasize the use of renewable resources

77
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:09,840
and the conservation of soil and water
to enhance environmental quality for

78
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,880
future generations.
Organic meat,

79
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:14,820
poultry and eggs and dairy products
are made from animals that are given no

80
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,200
antibiotics or growth hormones.

81
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,700
Organic food is produced without
using most conventional pesticides.

82
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,340
Fertilizers made with
synthetic ingredients or sewage
sludge bioengineering or

83
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:31,080
ionizing radiation before a product
can be labeled organic and quotes a

84
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:35,190
government approved certifier and specs
the farm where the food is grown to make

85
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,930
sure the farmers following all the
rules necessary to meet Usda organic

86
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,010
standards.
It's

87
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,410
now the one thing on there that will
disagree with what their first paragraph,

88
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,150
as I say, without the use of
pesticides. In the second paragraph, uh,

89
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,610
it says organic food is
produced without using

90
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,310
most conventional pesticides.

91
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:56,750
You see that slight little slight of hand
because one of them is theirs and the

92
00:04:56,751 --> 00:05:00,360
other one is Usda.
Exact little slight of hand.

93
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,340
I mean, uh, if you, if, if I may ask,

94
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,260
would you, would you like
to Google? Hold on a second.

95
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:11,970
Let's Google what pesticides can
be used and still make it organic.

96
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:14,040
Exactly what I was going to request.

97
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:19,290
It's a organic pesticides approved
for use in the u s here we go.

98
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,060
Now what are the fears of pesticides?
Right.

99
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:27,150
People worried about toxins
getting into their food,

100
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,410
getting them their body and cancer.
I mean

101
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,050
I understand that fear partially
cause I went through it quite a bit.

102
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,490
Like when I got sick a few years ago,

103
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:40,080
like my first symptom wasn't celiac
disease. It wasn't my joints popping out.

104
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,860
I got the worst headache of my life one
day and it never went away like that.

105
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,300
That'll make you scared to
death of everything around
you. Like I went organic,

106
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:53,280
I went Vegan, I went, I'd cut everything
out of my diet cause I was a scared that,

107
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,460
you know, like you get, you feel like
you're getting stabbed in the eye,

108
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,850
constantly going to cut
everything out of your diet.

109
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,120
One day were said and
I was working and um,

110
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,390
at the time I wasn't working
in the pesticide lab yet.

111
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:09,740
I was working at a drug analysis lab.
What was going on?

112
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,350
Absorbs. Well, it was, I was um, the
thing that I was worried because I was,

113
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:19,110
at the time I was all those, there was
much more siloed than the rows here.

114
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,890
So day I was, there was much more of
me and there is here today I was, I'm,

115
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:26,240
I'm five, nine and I had at the
time weighed almost 250 pounds. I,

116
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,610
I needed to lose a little of
me, but it was like, all right,

117
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm eating shitty food. I should probably
try eating healthier. But I mean,

118
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,420
nevermind just more salads. I'm
like, I went organic, I went,

119
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,990
I just cut everything out of my diet.
So as a bunch of issues it wasn't,

120
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,170
but I mean, yeah, like I cut
a lot of things out, started
working out everything.

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,921
But you know what?

122
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:50,050
I still needed medication cause it
turned out there was just um, a, uh,

123
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,350
it was just,
I had,

124
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,410
and then we figured out the headache was
linked into the ehlers Danlos Syndrome

125
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:57,320
and there some to, to clarify
everything. Some people,

126
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:01,590
when they have one autoimmune, they can
tend to cluster. So there's, that's, I, I,

127
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,410
I was lucky color 1 million, but that was,
that was the thing with it. But I tried,

128
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:09,080
you know, I looked into this
and I fell for all of it. Like,

129
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:13,700
so all of the pesticides are killing
you. It's the toxin. So I mean,

130
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,070
I understand the fear of
the people who were like,

131
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:18,450
I need to cut toxins out of my diet.
Do,

132
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,210
is there any foundation in truth?
Nothing.

133
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,900
No. Well, no pesticide. Here's the thing.
There is a little bit of truth that sells.

134
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,180
The lie is what? I will give
this because I, you know,

135
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:35,870
I used to work with bulk quantities of
pesticides at my last lab and that was

136
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,370
kind of what sealed the deal for me.

137
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:41,390
That these when they're in your
food are not gonna hurt you. Uh,

138
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,810
because the amount of testing we had to
go through and the amount of regulation,

139
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:48,050
I think regulation in this case it's a
good thing because it will stop a bad

140
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,510
pesticide, uh, for making it to market.

141
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,170
And I want that regulation there
because I eat the food too.

142
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:58,340
I don't want anyone's child to
ever get hurt from something that,

143
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,280
that me or another, like I don't work
there anymore. But you know, that,

144
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,340
that I had any, uh, work
and getting on the market.

145
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:07,940
I don't want to ever want that to be
the case. Um, but once upon a time,

146
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:11,210
the pesticides we had in the
market were much less targeted, uh,

147
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,430
to hurting the weeds and
could hurt people too.

148
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:17,690
Like arson are cynical's a sulfuric acid.
Those were early pesticides,

149
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:21,950
Paris Green, totally toxic, especially
to, uh, to the farmers and to the,

150
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,910
even to the farm equipment.
The stuff we have now far less toxic.

151
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:30,340
And I mean people say far less
though it's toxic. It's in, I mean,

152
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,420
I'm going to qualify this
answer and I mean I'm not,

153
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,220
I'm not qualifying it to back off from it,

154
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:38,300
but everything is toxic in
some dosage. So, yeah, exactly.

155
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,830
But I mean,

156
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,560
so roundup is one that people are really
scared of and it's one that a lot of

157
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:46,530
people know about.
There is a great graph on,

158
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,430
on this showing how less
toxic it is than the,

159
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,380
than the pesticides that
replaced because we weren't,

160
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,600
we didn't go from using no
pesticide to using roundup. Um,

161
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,700
and I know someone's going to
correct me saying it's an herbicide,

162
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:01,520
but on herbicide is pesticides the blanket
term for all things that killed, uh,

163
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,480
stuff in farming. Um, so before, um, uh,

164
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,180
before roundup,
I believe the one we used was Cyanna seen,

165
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,200
I could be wrong on this,

166
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,280
but the one we used before
roundup was in terms of the LD 50,

167
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,890
the lethal dose for about
50% of the population.

168
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,110
It was 10 times higher than roundup.

169
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,110
And now we barely sell any of it.

170
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,270
So the issue just lethal dose toxicity,

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,390
toxicity that affects your
body cause cancer. Right.
It's, I and I understand that.

172
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,410
So a question that, that people
are, you know, keep coming back to,

173
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:37,500
and part of the reason that people are
suspicious of it is because of its use

174
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,530
with a GMO and the,

175
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:43,020
these things go through hundreds
of tests and years of testing.

176
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,890
And because of the suspicion with roundup,
it's gone through continual testing.

177
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:50,160
Like they've tested to see if it,
uh, if it accumulates in breast milk,

178
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:54,840
it does not. Um, they've tested, tested to
see if it causes cancer, doesn't seem to.

179
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,950
Um,
and they've tried,

180
00:09:55,951 --> 00:10:00,060
they've used it at higher doses than
it would with mice and rats. They've,

181
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,420
they've, they've tested in humans and
it's been on the market for 30 years.

182
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,200
But I mean, like it's been
in the population or it's
been used now for I believe,

183
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,140
25 years.
And there doesn't seem to be the only,

184
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,130
the only apparent increase in cancer
is because we're living longer now.

185
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:19,260
And when you have any
population that lives longer,

186
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:22,740
you have increased incidence of cancer.
Like we're not dying from polio anymore,

187
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,690
so we're dying from something like,

188
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,490
unfortunately we're not going
to live forever. So there's

189
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,620
toxicity issue when it comes to
roundup or when it comes to any sort of

190
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:41,030
pesticide, herbicides, herbicides
are what kills the plants, right?

191
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,960
Absolutely. Kills bugs or pests.
Pesticides are, it's the blanket term.

192
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:50,430
Insecticide kills bugs.
So pesticides the whole blanket term yet.

193
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,990
So what is, what's the most
controversial is that roundup,

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,490
roundup is controversial.

195
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,970
And I think the reason that it became
controversial is because people heard,

196
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,541
all right,

197
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,990
you have to genetically modify the plants
so that the roundup doesn't kill the

198
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,800
plant and it's this whole thing just to
make money from Monsanto and how dare

199
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,170
you make money. Um, and that's,

200
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:14,640
I think that was why people got mad was
because of the genetic modification.

201
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,510
Lincoln with roundup. Um, and it's, you
know, it's a new technology or you know,

202
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,291
it's,
it's one of a,

203
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:24,291
it's a newer technology and it kind of
made people a little aware of farming for

204
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,141
the first time.

205
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:28,680
And like I go to farming conferences
a lot of times to talk about how to

206
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:33,000
communicate agriculture. And I'll
sit down and ask farmers, you know,

207
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,250
what do you plant,
why are you planting it?

208
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:39,630
What do you think of Gmos you use roundup
and do you buy from people other than

209
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,200
do you buy from Monsanto? And do you
buy from people other than Monsanto?

210
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,070
And that handful of questions
will tell me. I mean, if I,

211
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,410
I wish I had more videos of this,
but like there's,

212
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,000
there's a video at some point on my site,

213
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:56,040
a with two farmers who buy from Monsanto
and buy from other companies. Uh,

214
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,110
and one of the reasons I asked that is
because there's a rumor on the Internet

215
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,350
that if you buy from Monsanto,
you can only buy from Monsanto.

216
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,680
Just not true. Uh, that, you know,

217
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,430
every genetically modified
crop is, uh, is, is, you know,

218
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,840
just is made to be roundup ready.
Again, not true, uh, that you know,

219
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:17,420
that people are, you
know, are being, um, that,

220
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,530
that people are dying of cancer
from just being around roundup.

221
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:25,150
And recently they found that one of the
reports, uh, that went through the IRC,

222
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:29,140
the cans, the place that declares things
cancerous, you know, on their, you know,

223
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:34,120
Group A, one, two, a two, a
two, a two B, um, cancer, uh,

224
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,080
classifications.

225
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,090
One of the reports was falsified
a that declared roundup cancerous.

226
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,620
Now we also have to fall back
by the person who is, I'm,

227
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,850
I have to hunt down this report.
Uh,

228
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:50,260
but the person who was trying to say
roundup is cancerous because of a little

229
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,300
bit of suspicion around
it because it's been,

230
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,450
people have kicked around that
it's causing cancer or you know,

231
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,990
that your spleen to turn
radioactive for you know, forever.

232
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:02,240
And it's just like a chem
trails type thing a little bit.

233
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,250
One of the things that people talk about
in terms of conspiracy theory and it

234
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,820
just, it gets put into the public sphere
so much that people start to believe it.

235
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:10,660
And here's the thing,

236
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:14,920
if I saw from evidence that
roundup had caused issues,

237
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,070
I would say right away, just get
rid of it, take it off the market.

238
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:22,540
And I keep on not seeing from evidence of
it, like one of the, there was a study,

239
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,430
there's this group moms across our moms
across America. Um, and it's, I take,

240
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,700
I always get my scientific information
from mom groups on the Internet. Um,

241
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,650
but this group,
uh,

242
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,400
decided to do a breastmilk study to see
a frowned up cumulated in breast milk.

243
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,700
And the way the study was done was they
just had women indiscriminately sending

244
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,700
containers of breast
milk, uh, to, to them.

245
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:50,701
And they declared like the amount of
roundup to be ridiculously high in the

246
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:55,180
breast milk. And I'm like, do they just
tell women to spray like pump bottles,

247
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:59,500
like of, uh, of roundup into
these containers and then
test it? But it turned out,

248
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,500
and this is just from knowing
how analytical techniques work,

249
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:07,501
like I used to design the techniques by
which we extracted a target pesticides

250
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:12,460
from a matrix and analyze them on our,
on our big overpriced, uh, machinery.

251
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,310
But the, uh, a woman
who was a breast milk,

252
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,930
a researcher out of a
University of Washington was
like, this doesn't seem right.

253
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:22,830
So she designed an experiment to,
uh,

254
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:26,920
to test if roundup was accumulating and
breast milk and she had it verified by

255
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:29,450
an outs by an independent lab, um, and it,

256
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,280
and they tested women specifically who
worked in agriculture and she had their

257
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:37,510
breast milk tested specifically on days
where they were spraying roundup and

258
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:41,380
there was nothing found that someone
who's not necessarily eating the food,

259
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,290
that someone who's working with the
food well working with roundup. Right.

260
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,960
And you would expect that if
it was being sprayed well,

261
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:51,590
the think about it this
way, when I'm eating it,

262
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,800
it's both, think about it this way.
If it's in the food supply, um,

263
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,150
wouldn't they be eating at as well?

264
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,470
I don't know. I don't know what
their diet is like if you're,

265
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:01,620
if you're getting it from people's
breast milk and those people say,

266
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:05,910
there's roundup in my breast milk and I've
been eating genetically modified crop.

267
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:06,831
Well,

268
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:10,490
the other question is if these are the
people that are following a moms across

269
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:13,430
America and their whole thing
is that roundup is the devil,

270
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,110
they're falsifying evidence.

271
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,700
I think that it was not a well controlled
experiment and it would be interesting

272
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,390
to see, um, to see how, um,

273
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,390
the experiment would come out. Um, if
the person who runs moms across America,

274
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,990
Zen Honeycutt would work,
would,

275
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,650
how it would look if zen were to look
in on every step of the process with a

276
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,170
Shelly Maguire, Dr Shell and
Mcguire to see that, uh, you know,

277
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,710
these people ate food that should
have been sprayed with roundup, uh,

278
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:45,680
and worked in the field
and then at the end, uh,

279
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,640
to see if their breast milk
came out with nothing yet,

280
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,223
don't you?

281
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:55,190
Don't you think that there'd be more
likely to be some sort of conspiratorial

282
00:15:56,341 --> 00:16:01,341
collusion with people that actually work
in farms that use roundup rather than

283
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:04,770
someone who's just checking the,
their breast milk? It's like,

284
00:16:04,771 --> 00:16:07,440
wouldn't you think that like if someone's
trying to prove that roundup isn't

285
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,890
showing up in breast milk and you've got
a bunch of people that they're living

286
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:12,750
relies on using roundup,

287
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,290
well, the farm workers themselves,
they'd want to be safe. Right. Mandy,

288
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,640
and I say that as someone who's worked
at a pesticide company and when I worked

289
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:22,100
there, I mean I was, I was
just an analytical chemist.

290
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:26,930
I'm not someone who had any investment
in keeping that company safe from being

291
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:30,110
yelled at. I want it to be safe
from the stuff I was working. Right.

292
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,890
Find it weird that you feel like there's
some sort of conspiracy with these moms

293
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,120
that are checking their breast milk,

294
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:39,110
but you don't think there might possibly
be some shenanigans involved in the

295
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:42,170
people that actually need
roundup to make a living?

296
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,510
It's no,
I understand what you're saying for sure.

297
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,690
But part of the reason why I think that
a Dr. McGuire would have conducted a

298
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,460
better study was number one in pa,

299
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,580
independently verified a number
two knows how to do collection, uh,

300
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,560
evidence or not ambulance,
a specimen collection accurately.

301
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,710
And number three monitored
and independently verified
from an outside lab.

302
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,750
So it's like we don't have, and when,
uh, when moms across America was asked,

303
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,640
uh, to show their data and how they
collected the samples, they didn't give,

304
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,300
they weren't willing
to, to share, uh, their,

305
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:21,320
all of their data on how
specimen collection, uh, was,

306
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,110
was handled was their
excuse for not sharing the,

307
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,900
I don't recall off the top of my
head, but they weren't like, it's,

308
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:31,400
it seems suspicious to me that they
weren't willing to disclose that. I mean,

309
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,200
when you're, when you do
an experiment, everything,

310
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:35,300
and I mean I used to
work under GLP standards,

311
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:39,050
which basically you throw out a glove,
you have to write it down. And that's,

312
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,580
that's part of the standards and how
you get, you know, a chemical into, uh,

313
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:48,230
into use in agriculture is you
really have to be careful and,

314
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,510
and forthcoming on how you do your work,

315
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,500
which is the amount of pesticides that
they found in breast milk uniform. It's,

316
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,360
I believe that you didn't find,

317
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,590
I think they were only testing for
roundup and they found there to be,

318
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,960
they didn't find there
to be even trace amounts,

319
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,040
which I was kind of surprised that I
would have expected something moms across

320
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,800
America stuff they found a lot.
It was a uniform.

321
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,920
Was everybody have like a similar amount?
No,

322
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,230
they found it in the amount of varied
and they were there were so high.

323
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:20,730
It was like, it was just, it was
suspicious and that's why I was like,

324
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,770
I don't like that was why I didn't buy it.

325
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,690
The other thing is they used a technique,

326
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,920
an analytical technique that was used
for water. And that's why I'm like,

327
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:32,970
this is not like not all techniques
you use for all work for all chemical

328
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,880
matrices. So that's another reason
why, you know, a different lab, uh,

329
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,550
was probably better equipped to handle
at one specifically that analyze this

330
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:45,690
breast milk. Um, so it's, I think
like at the other thing is, you know,

331
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,524
that the other lab,

332
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,490
the other lab kind of had a bias going
in because their whole thing is how

333
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:54,180
roundup is bad. So lab, it's like,
I just want to know if, you know,

334
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:57,030
moms are being harmed, if there's
breasts, if there's something in the,

335
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,670
in the breastmilk that seems
like a lab that, you know,

336
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,670
went in just wanting to know the other lab
went and saying, I hate roundup. So if,

337
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,960
you know, I would have, if, if
roundup had been found in, uh,

338
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,360
in the test that Dr
Mcguire's lab had done,

339
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,450
I would have happily accepted
those results because it, you know,

340
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:19,330
it almost wouldn't, it would have
surprised me, not in the least if,

341
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,750
if it had been found,
but I was kind of,

342
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,080
I was Kinda glad that there was nothing
there because it means that, you know,

343
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,430
babies aren't getting a concentrated
dose of this, uh, just because you know,

344
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:32,340
you don't want extraneous
chemicals going into the food.

345
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,270
So I only testing people that worked in
these farms is that, was that the idea?

346
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,660
I think they did.
I don't remember off the top of my head,

347
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,280
but I know one of the people,
one of the groups,

348
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,220
they did test for women on testing days,
but they go to this way.

349
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:46,070
They're not just spraying
it. They're also, you know,

350
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,640
possibly eating food that's been, uh,
that's had it on there. That's possibly,

351
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,320
it would be more interested in seeing
100% sure that these people were eating

352
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:57,270
food.
That makes sense with roundup.

353
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:00,840
And that doesn't make sense
to me that they didn't do
that. It's, I'm, you know, I,

354
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,050
I'd have to, I want to have a look at
the study again in myself just to be,

355
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,340
just to be sure of what
the other conditions were
curious about both tests have

356
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,970
I have a look.
Um,

357
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,010
we can have a quick peek a after it for
Dr Shell and Maguire breastmilk roundup

358
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,080
study. The whole thing
seems a little weird to me.

359
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:24,150
It's weird that one group tests high,
one, two group test. Not at all.

360
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,040
It's,
it is,

361
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,130
I'm going to say it is easy
to screw up a study using,

362
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,600
um, if you're not sure the parameters
you're supposed to use in an analytical,

363
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,351
uh,
in,

364
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:41,790
in a chemical analysis thing because you
can have interfering species that come

365
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,630
up with the same peaks at the same
time. Uh, so I'm, the other thing is,

366
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,350
like I said,
we,

367
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,200
the biggest thing is don't know the
collection parameters for the one that mom

368
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:53,890
across America did sign. They
won't tell us. Yeah. I mean it's,

369
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,670
the other thing is Dr. McGuire was
doing it through a university and she

370
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:58,450
could've been,

371
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,450
she could've been a lot of trouble if
she falsified a or data or done or done a

372
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:09,100
test that was purposefully misleading.
Right. So what are the pesticides?

373
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,660
Did you Google the pesticides that are,

374
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,220
yeah, both. There's a, from the put 'em
up, uh, there's a long list somewhere,

375
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:16,540
but the, uh, I had it

376
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,250
right here. It's on the USA
or usda.gov website. It just,

377
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,210
it's like a, the standards of what they
use to put stuff on and off of it. Okay.

378
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,070
And there are a organic standards
that allows some substances,

379
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,950
but where they're mostly trying to
get out synthetic substances. However,

380
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:39,220
there are also some synthetic
substances that are allowed to, yeah,

381
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,590
interesting.
And this is to label something organic,

382
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,060
right? And then there's a board
that votes on it from time to time.

383
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:48,540
If somebody wants to bring something
up and disagree that it shouldn't be on

384
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:48,970
that list.

385
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,810
Isn't that weird though? I mean,
most people think he say organic.

386
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,580
Most people think there's no pesticides.

387
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,440
Most people think you're
just growing plants.

388
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,450
Yeah. And that's, it's an, I mean
they, they saw that so well don't they?

389
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,350
For instance, for Mons
Pheromones, pheromones,

390
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,510
pheromones, pheromones. Pheromones
have long been used as effective,

391
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:16,510
nontoxic waste to confuse
insects. Hmm. Well,

392
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,580
that might otherwise in fest
organic crops, especially fruit.

393
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,750
So they put some certain
smells just freak bugs out.

394
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,930
Likewise,
vaccines for animals are important.

395
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:32,010
Disease Prevention tools against many
infectious diseases, blah, blah, blah.

396
00:22:32,011 --> 00:22:34,670
Especially since antibiotic
therapy is prohibited in livestock.

397
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm picturing an anti-vaxxer staying
away from organic produce because they

398
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,760
vaccinated it against bees.

399
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,110
Well, you could always grow
your own food, folks. You know,

400
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,790
and not put anything on it, but I
think large scale domestic agriculture,

401
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:52,020
if you're talking about these gigantic
fields, nothing could be less natural.

402
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,410
It's not normal to have
a thousand acres of corn.

403
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,930
It just doesn't exist in the wild.
And when you do that,

404
00:22:57,931 --> 00:22:59,130
you're going to run
into a lot of problems.

405
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,700
Since I always go back to the argument
of nothing we're doing is natural anyway.

406
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,410
We're sitting in a, in an air condition
studio in, in California that we,

407
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,790
we'd probably be, we'd be dead
with a lot of the things that we,

408
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,520
we don't have that's, that's,
you know, come out food.
There's no food around here.

409
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,730
Where are you growing food? It's, no, it
was, no one's grown food anywhere near us.

410
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:22,040
There's, there's nothing
that we enjoy that's, that's
natural. Any more ice creams?

411
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,260
Not Natural. And it's God Tam.
Delicious. I'm going to get a freezer.

412
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,160
How do you get a freezer?

413
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:36,840
Yeah.
