1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,500
The joe rogan experience
be new year. Tom. Papa.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,770
Yeah. Happy you get. Thank you
for the gift. You're welcome.

3
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:16,490
I've always wondered one of these.
It's amazing. Really. It is.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
I got two things that I
really don't want today.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,190
One was herpes. No. Yeezys

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,290
you'll love him Jamie. Thanks. I'll love.
He got me the party here and I said,

7
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,570
take these back. These
are yours. You keep him.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,030
And He came back and
brought me the right size.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,200
He insists first he brought me to
the Bronx. What's wrong with them?

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,050
They're fucking preposterous.
Let me see him.

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,330
If you're um, Brendan Schaub, they're
the perfect thing because they're in,

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,460
this looks like something
from the nineties yeah,

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,300
like some kind of shoe from the 90s now
what level of outrage would there be if

14
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,470
I started wearing these
to run the mountains?

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,700
What if they were really comfortable and
you liked them? I know what's going on.

16
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,380
So you think that if I put them on,

17
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,610
I would all of a sudden loved them and
I would get it. Those are street maybe.

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,390
Are Those for the street?
Does he have like a bird?

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,430
He'll have like a extra hook
in the back of the heel? Yeah.

20
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,840
Like why is it go like a normal heel?
Like here's a normal heels, right?

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,430
Those flat flush,
it's flat.

22
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,670
It's like goes out at an angle on
those two. That does too. Is the boost.

23
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,850
It's the style of shoe. It's the bottom.
It's what it's part of the Adidas.

24
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,290
Is it the style or is it the uh,
the shape?

25
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,160
Is it the style or is it the feel that
you really like the feel but won't? Both.

26
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:50,200
Honestly, both. But these
were really comfortable shoes.

27
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:54,520
The boosters are super comfortable. Is
this a Adidas made shoe? Is that, yep. Oh,

28
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:58,030
so Didas makes the, yeah. And
there's just no Adidas logo on there.

29
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:02,520
So it's hard to tell that he's starting
to like them starting to warm up while I

30
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,460
weird how they have this like
military style number. Yup.

31
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:10,030
Thing on the side.
Like some fucking Korean missile

32
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,410
quit. Is there, I couldn't tell you
what it stands for. I've seen it.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,140
Multiple things. It could just be
supply or couldn't you come up?

34
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,670
It could be an acronym for
something. I don't, yeah,

35
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:23,390
they look like they're from the nineties
enjoy them.

36
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,323
Thank you,
sir.

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:34,340
Okay.
