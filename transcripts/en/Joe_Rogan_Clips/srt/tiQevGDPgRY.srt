1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,470
I mean you,

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,700
I have friends that are pretty overweight
and one that died pretty recently who

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,701
was really big and he just had this
feeling when he would meet people.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,600
I mean you talked about it a little
bit. It was just obese, you know,

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,260
it was just this thing where you're
just, Oh, look at this enormous fat guy.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,530
And then to go from that
to, oh, there's a guy,

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,150
there's a normal guy that's just a
guy that's 168 pound guy. Normal.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,650
No difference between Hannah. I
tell Ya, I know we, we love to,

9
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:36,120
we love to beat up on fat people. We
love to turn it into a character defect.

10
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:40,530
But I gotta tell you virtually every fat
person that I know or that I've taken

11
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,730
care of, they are not disproportionally
eating more than their peers.

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,240
So in some cases, yes,
but not on balance it,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,000
the problem is that they simply
do everything incorrectly,

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,930
metabolically, you know, so their body
is functioning correctly and it's,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,330
you know, and it's exempt.
There's a genetic component.

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,280
I think there are dietary exacerbations.

17
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,410
I think certainly not
exercising makes things worse.

18
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:07,020
So there are lots of predisposing factors,
but at the end of the day,

19
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:11,880
what's happening is when you and I eat
like let's, let's take a meal that,

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,750
that like if you had pancakes,
bacon and scrambled eggs,

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,270
that would be like a really good mix of,
that'd be a third carbs, a third protein,

22
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:23,250
a third fat. So that's like a shit ton of
nutrient, right? If you were, I ate that.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
Yeah, it probably wouldn't be that
good for us. But like we, you know,

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,670
let's say we just finished a workout or
something like we're going to partition

25
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:34,140
such that that glycogen will first and
foremost go to replace the muscle and

26
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,620
liver stores of glycogen because we have
bigger muscles and our muscles are more

27
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,610
insulin sensitive.

28
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,150
We can actually disproportionately
put more glycogen into our muscles,

29
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,240
into the leg muscles, cause you'll have
done that, run up the hills. Right. And,

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,460
and then furthermore,
when we want to recruit energy again,

31
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,000
we'll have the ability to actually go
back and get fat. Especially, you know,

32
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,391
in other words,

33
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:59,391
break down fat at lower ATP demands than
necessarily always going to glycogen.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,020
So, in other words, we partition fuel
in a smarter way. And these patients,

35
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:07,920
I mean you can measure this clinically
using something called rer and of course

36
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:11,100
doing other blood tests,
like they just, they just,

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,480
they can't break down their own fat.

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,430
So their body is essentially broken in
that regard. And that can be fixed with,

39
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,390
with diet. It's a hard problem because
the way I explained it to people as,

40
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,810
and so clinically I'm not
interested in weight loss, right?

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,950
I mean that's just not, I'm much more
interested in longevity and yeah,

42
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,910
sometimes weight loss comes with that.
But I like if I ever get stuck doing,

43
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,150
you know, weight loss, like I'll, I'll,
I'm doing the wrong thing for my interest.

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,050
But, um, the way I say to people when
they want to lose weight is, look,

45
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:42,030
you don't want to lose weight.
You want to lose fat. Let's,

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,590
let's be very clear on our semantics.
It weight is irrelevant, right?

47
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,890
Unless you're a cyclist or some
athlete for whom the actual scale means

48
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,010
something. But for, for people like us,
it's you want to lose fat, not wait.

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,030
And then when you say you want to lose
fat, what does that mean in English? Well,

50
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,100
do you want fewer fat cells or do
you want each fat cell to be smaller?

51
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,320
Those are totally different questions.

52
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,690
If you want fewer fat
cells have liposuction,

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,250
but we know that that doesn't fix you
metabolically. So if you want fewer,

54
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,060
if you want to be less fat, you
have to have smaller fat cells. Now,

55
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,660
a fat cell conceptually has
two inputs and one output.

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,780
So now I say,
let's reframe the question.

57
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,590
You've got a room with a hundred people
in it. You want fewer people in the room.

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,730
What has to happen? More people have
to leave the room, then enter the room.

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,330
So similarly, if you have a fat
cell and you want it to be less fat,

60
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,830
you've got to get more fat out of it.

61
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,880
Then enters it and the fat that exits
the cell exits via a process called

62
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:41,170
lipolysis and the inputs to a fat cell
or something called De Novo Lipogenesis,

63
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:44,500
which is turning carbohydrates
into fat and reassess aerification,

64
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,670
which is turning fat like in a free fatty
acid into a triglyceride back into a

65
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:52,270
fat cell. Each of those three
doors is controlled by hormones.

66
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,530
And so the purpose of nutrition or fasting
or exercise or drugs or hormones or

67
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:03,640
all these things is to manipulate those
hormones in the direction of what I call

68
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:08,140
negative fat flux or what
would be referred to in the
literature as fat balance,

69
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,820
negative fat balance. And the hormones
that drive that are are many insulin,

70
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,220
hormone sensitive lipase,
testosterone, estrogen,

71
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,150
cortisol being the five most
important in my opinion. Uh,

72
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,380
maybe someone will disagree with that,

73
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:24,160
but I think those are the five that
rule the roost. And so, you know,

74
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,530
how do you manipulate those?
Well,

75
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:31,480
insulin seems to be the most important
of the five and there's no better way to

76
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,830
lower insulin than to not eat.

77
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,730
So the first thing that happened to that
dude who went 382 days without anything

78
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:43,660
but water and minerals, is he
basically had very low insulin levels.

79
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,610
In fact, once he got into raging Ketosis,
which he got into by about day seven,

80
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,740
his insulin came up only to prevent
him from going into Ketoacidosis,

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,310
which was what would happen if he had
no insulin response. In other words,

82
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:00,220
if he was a type one diabetic,
he would have died if ketoacidosis,

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,390
because he wouldn't have had the insulin
to regulate the uptick of ketones.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,690
But if you are, I did this
because we have a normal pancreas.

85
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,990
We would actually remake just enough
insulin to suppress ketogenesis and keep

86
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,090
that Beta hydroxybutyrate level in the,
you know,

87
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,990
kind of in the neighborhood of probably
seven or eight millimolar as opposed to

88
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,020
getting north of 12 to 15 which
is when you get into trouble.

89
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,120
So you know,
how do you manipulate insulin?

90
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,090
Nutrition is the first way.
If you can't fast,

91
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,130
the next best thing is
to reduce carbohydrates.

92
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,310
Carbohydrates obviously are
the most insulinogenic of food,

93
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,650
although protein can be quite
insular agentic as well.

94
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,930
It has a different response.
Um,

95
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,630
and then that's when you start to think
about these other things. You know,

96
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:47,710
I've seen patients where they just can't
lose weight and I watch what they're

97
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,800
doing and they're doing everything right,
but they just can't lose weight.

98
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,320
But then you notice their
cortisol levels through the roof.

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,680
It's hard to get rid of fat when
you have hot lots of cortisol.

100
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:01,681
Cortisol is a very anabolic hormone
to fat in a very catabolic hormone to

101
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,420
muscle, which is the exact opposite
of what we want to stoss. Drone,

102
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,830
of course is the exact opposite.

103
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,200
Testosterone is catabolic to
fat but anabolic to muscle. Um,

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,550
and then of course,
you know,

105
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,400
women have a harder time because
once women go through menopause,

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,250
they lose all the estrogen
and all the testosterone.

107
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,150
And so now they lose two hormones that
play a very important role in regulating

108
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:28,100
this. So for these people that are
having the issue with cortisol levels,

109
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,050
that's exacerbated by stress,
right?

110
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,150
So stress actually exacerbates
your weight gain. Absolutely.

111
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,460
That's interesting. In addition
to a whole bunch of other stuff,

112
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,600
literally eat the same diet and gain more
weight because of stress. Absolutely.

113
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,280
Wow. Again, hormones are what's
driving fuel partitioning.

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,290
You know, you're responsible for what
you put in your mouth, but in many ways,

115
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:59,210
at that point, like the hormones take
over and decide where it's going. Wow.
