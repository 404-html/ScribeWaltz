1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
I feel like my enemies the clock and I
was a lot of stuff I want to do in my

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:10,110
life and my enemy is the clock. Do you
feel like you live in the moment enough?

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,100
Absolutely. You do. I do. Because
that would be the worry, right?

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,740
Like if you're constantly
worrying about, damn, 20 years,

5
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm going to be 70 30 years, I'm going
to be Haiti. If you keep doing that,

6
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:25,150
like there, there are people that look
ahead too much and don't just, I've,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,950
I've talked to people that are 20 like,
fuck, I can't believe I'm 20 and like,

8
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:33,070
listen Motherfucker, you just
turned 20 dude, relax. You know,

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:37,740
just 20, you're a baby. Naw Man, I'm
going to be fucking 30 and 10 years.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,500
Like you shut the fuck up.
You're 20 now.

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,800
I use it as a motivator and I remember,
I remember when I was,

12
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,290
when I was starting out, I was 21
years old. This is a crazy story. Uh,

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,490
I just got dropped from our record label.

14
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:54,200
I was signed to a record label called
delicious vinyl. How did you do as a,

15
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,490
I had a rap record on tuition rapper.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,900
I was a rapper signed to delicious
with Tone Loc and Young Mc. Oh,

17
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:04,290
get the fuck out of here.
So my album doesn't get picked.

18
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,230
I don't get picked up for a second album.
And I moved to New York City.

19
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,230
I have two things on my resume.
Kiddie pool attendant,

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,600
cause I was a Kiddie pool
attendant and rapper.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,120
So I'm staying on my friend's couch,

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,530
living on his couch with his roommate and
he tells me on Monday I got to get out

23
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:20,190
of the apartment.

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,880
So instead of going to look for
a new apartment over the weekend,

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,700
I go to my friend's Bachelor
Party on the Jersey Shore.

26
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,630
I'm at the Bachelor Party, I'm getting
a drink at the bar and I see this girl.

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,420
I started chatting with her.
She asked me where I live.

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,160
I told her actually as of Monday, I have
nowhere to go. She takes out a Napkin.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,210
She writes her address on the Napkin.
I'm 21 years old and she says,

30
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,970
if it's an emergency on Monday and
you're stuck, you can come live with me.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,830
Monday comes, I get kicked out of my
friend's apartment. I have nowhere to go.

32
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm like,
this is an emergency.

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,710
I take out the Napkin and I live with
this girl and her roommate for six months.

34
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,260
It turns out that her father is
a big entrepreneur business man.

35
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:05,160
He owns a piece of the Yankees,
dislike monster mogul.

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,060
I write this song for the New
York Knicks called go New York,

37
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,920
go and it becomes a big success. You
remember that song? No, no, no. Okay.

38
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,620
That's okay. That's okay. I'm
not a sports fan. That's fine.

39
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,270
It becomes a big hit and I just realized
that there's an opportunity to write

40
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,610
theme songs for all these
professional sports teams,

41
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,900
but I don't have a penny to go
in the studio to do the demos,

42
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:32,880
to shop them to the team. So I need money.
So I go to this music guy and he says,

43
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:37,881
I'll give you $10,000 to go and do these
songs for 10% of everything you make

44
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,490
for the rest of your life. He wants to
buy me like a style the rest of your life.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,670
I'm 21 he's like, the rest of
your life. Everything you do,

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,530
I will invest in you own an airplane
business. He owns 10% yes. Forever. Yes.

47
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:52,740
You have to kill him then. Yes.
Yeah, you have to kill that guy,

48
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,060
but I need the 10 grand. So I say,
I'll take it. So before I take it,

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,880
I go to this girl's father for advice,
this business mogul.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,930
Then I'm living with her and I sit down,
I go to this guy's apartment again.

51
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,740
I'm 21 he's got in his apartment,
he's got a swimming pool,

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,300
artwork, like fancy fuck
women. He's macked out, man.

53
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,710
It's like I'd never seen
anything like this in Manhattan,

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,573
in Manhattan.

55
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,380
I'm just setting the stage
of the conversation and I
go in and I tell him the

56
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,710
story about the 10 the 10
grand and he says to me,

57
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,370
I would trade,
this is exactly what he said to me.

58
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,750
I will trade everything that I have for
you to get out of my daughter's life.

59
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,540
Exactly. Outweighed everything I
have for the one thing that you have.

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,830
And I'm like, man, I'm fucking broke.
What he taught me, I go, what's that?

61
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,450
And he said, youth, because he had
already gone through the journey,

62
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,280
even though he had everything,
he already had gone through the process.

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,540
He wasn't that 20 year old that you're
talking about that whatever he had gone

64
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,680
through it, he had it all. He
he will. He missed the process.

65
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,681
The journey of being you coming up at
20 and not know like you know here you

66
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:15,190
are. But it was the, those were
the years man. The first fight,

67
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,230
the first this like that.
That's what,

68
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,370
that's what makes you like so
and that stuck with me man.

69
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,330
At 21 years old. It stuck with
me and realize that like, man,

70
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:29,980
I got to enjoy the process and it's really
never rubbed off on me in front of me.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,480
Oh, well why didn't that guy, how old was
this guy at the time? The old rich dude,

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,170
he was, let's see, he must've been in
his sixties. Why? They just do shit,

73
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,800
do a bunch of shoot day lounging around
his fucking swimming pool. Did he did,

74
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:45,730
he had an amazing, he was 20. He had an
amazing life. He had an amazing life.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,930
So what did you wind up
doing? Uh, he said the SEC,

76
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,440
the second part of that
conversation, he said, do you, um,

77
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,650
will you make this work on your
own? I said, I think I can. He said,

78
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,830
I didn't ask if you can. He
said, I, I said, he said,

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,100
will you make it work?
I said, I will. He said,

80
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:08,200
and then go tell the guy to fuck off and
make it and it goes and go make it work.

81
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,910
And I did. So how'd you
get it funded that? Uh, I,

82
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,440
I somehow got,

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,500
I went to the Dallas Mavericks after the
Knicks and told them that I convinced

84
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:24,880
them to give me a $2,500 the next pay me,
this is the crazy part of my life,

85
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:29,200
but they gave me $2,500 to do the demo
and then they bought the song for like

86
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:33,400
$20,000 and that funded the rest of the
business that I ultimately sold to a

87
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:36,730
public company. Wow, that's crazy.

88
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,190
And you almost gave away
10% of your whole life.

89
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,950
That guy wanted 10% is a piece of shit.

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,710
What a mother fucker like.

91
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:49,390
That's a city like just business draws
prisoners and I had no one to go to.

92
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,040
I know he's taken advantage of a 21 year
old kid who's just got some dreams and

93
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,040
need some cash and 10 grand to him.
It's probably nothing.

94
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,430
I called my father and my father owned
the plumbing supply house in Mineola Long

95
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,790
Island and I during this time in my
thing and my father said, you know,

96
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,920
I love him to death, but he's like, you
know, do it. Do what you think is best.

97
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,730
Don't, he just didn't, you know,
I didn't know where to turn to.

98
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,460
I had no one to turn to. Yeah. Don't,
don't give up 10% of your life. Right.

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,850
That was just crazy that someone asks for
that. But you hear things like, I mean,

100
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:25,130
this is similar to what they
do in the music business,

101
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,590
like how the music
business treats artists.

102
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:32,270
They essentially sign you
to these contracts and then
take a piece of everything.

103
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:34,280
They take a piece of,
if you do a movie,

104
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:37,460
they take a piece of
your live performances,

105
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:41,000
your merchandise sales, everything.
They just say, look, we'll,

106
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,500
we'll help you out a little bit,
but you know, we want you, right?

107
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,350
Yeah. I mean, at least you
were in a contract though.

108
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,830
But there's some creepy contracts that
they used to do in the old days of

109
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:56,780
Hollywood that were similar to that.
Right? They just take a PCF forever. Yeah.

110
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,020
But you know, when I signed my music
deal, I didn't care. I was like,

111
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:03,620
you can take whatever you want,
man. Get me on MTV. Right?
Of course. Yeah. Because,

112
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,710
well, that's the whole idea. The word,

113
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:09,560
the reason why these exploitation
contracts work is because in the beginning

114
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:12,350
you're just so desperate and what
you have is what they don't have.

115
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,160
You have talent, right? You
have, as you're creative,

116
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:20,180
you're young and full of energy and
you've got something exciting that people

117
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:23,290
want to look at. And so what
they do is they go, oh, you,

118
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,430
what could we gotta fucking,
we got to wait through the door,

119
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,420
but we want 75% of the profits.
We want a little bit of this and,

120
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,880
and you don't get any money back until
we recoup our money that we spent on

121
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,500
executives and parking and car leases.

122
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:40,040
And they calculate all that shit.
How much the fucking building costs,

123
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:44,750
how much the electricity, all that stuff.
They that you've seen those I'm sure.

124
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,130
Oh yes. Contracts. They're fucking,
I've signed them. I've sat, you know,

125
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,400
in my own way. Yeah. But um, you know,

126
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,990
it's part of the process and no
leverage, no leverage. That's the thing.

127
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,190
They've got the leverage,
but now and now they don't have delivered,

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,450
but they still figured
out a way to pull it off.

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,750
It's really weird because who the fuck
is buying an albums now? No. Right?

130
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,843
No one.

131
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,420
Right yet these record companies are
still figuring out how coiling on do you

132
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:14,060
like a lamprey suck blood out.

133
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,530
There's still staying alive and they're
fat fingers driving their fat Mercedes

134
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,650
Benz.
They know how to do it.

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,680
They just figured out a way to grab
people that are just just getting poppin,

136
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:27,981
you know,

137
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:31,760
and just sign it and then figured out
a way to get in with these fucking

138
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,600
streaming companies. Have
you paid attention to that
shit? A little bit. Yeah.

139
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,120
That's the darkest.

140
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:42,290
It's even darker than the
music distribution because
the artists get like no

141
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,490
money point. Oh, oh,

142
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,020
Steven Tyler was talking about it with me.
It's just,

143
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,620
he was explaining it and there's a,
there's, it's the company's actually,

144
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,260
or the organization's actually called
M m. A what is it? Something, what did,

145
00:08:56,261 --> 00:09:00,530
what did it stand for? Musicians for, uh,

146
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,440
some,

147
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,440
some sort of an act where they're trying
to stop the streaming companies from

148
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:10,830
ripping off these artists'
music modernization act. Yeah.

149
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,430
It's dark. Yeah. But it's
along the same lines.

150
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:19,431
It's like people figuring out a way
to just take something from somebody.
