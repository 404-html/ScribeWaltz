1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,470
Search gear for that. Is it? Hey,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,480
what are your thoughts on net and tragedy?

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,720
Because I would talking to people online
today about net neutrality. Yeah. Uh,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,520
I posted something about it that it seems
to me to be one of those ideological

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:17,790
camp issues where if
you are leaning right,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,150
you think that net neutrality is a bad
thing, that the market should decide.

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,260
If you're leaning left,

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,100
you think that there's some regulation
that the government should step in and be

9
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,830
important because you want to
keep people from information.

10
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:33,120
You don't want to a big corporation to
be able to step in and say someone can or

11
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:37,470
can't have their program
on 18 t or Verizon or,

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,780
I think that from what I've read,
there are six major service providers.

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,140
Maybe,

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,140
maybe a couple more that that already
smelled a little bit like a monopoly.

15
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:52,920
But what I think is that if you and I,
first of all, nobody really knows yet,

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,280
but I think that the bigger issue becomes
if these companies provide you service

17
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,420
in your area,

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,880
they could decide to break it into say
to bandwidth say could decide you want

19
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:09,030
regular, you want regular
service or do you want premium?

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,240
If you want premium we're going to pay
a little more and that's one thing they

21
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:15,900
could bring it up. If that's the
case, we'll let the market decide.

22
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:20,820
Maybe that maybe that creates an opening
for another service provider to come in

23
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,970
and say, we don't do that
one price covers everything.

24
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,880
It's one of the guys on my Instagram
or my Twitter rather had a really good

25
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:27,360
point.

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,840
He said the real issue that people aren't
talking about is the monopolies that

27
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,140
these companies have in small areas.
Like if you're in a certain town,

28
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,160
like you can only get this kind of company
or Verizon or, that's what I'm saying.

29
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,210
When you have a company that owns
a certain town and then you know,

30
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,250
and in certain areas is the
only way you can get coverage.

31
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,950
Do you have to do with this one company,
then then it becomes a real issue.

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,030
And not only is it become an issue,

33
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:52,920
but the other issue is that now the
real question is if you are a service

34
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:57,150
provider and you provide, uh,
people in this area, that service,

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,340
if the other service has,

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,440
if you use platforms that the other
service provides and they compete directly

37
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,600
with this,
would this service block that,

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,600
would this service have
an incentive to uh,

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,620
slow block your access to it or whatever?
And that would be an issue. But my,

40
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:18,621
my feeling is that we'll find out very
quickly and as long as consumers have the

41
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,540
ability to go over to another provider,

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
as long as consumers
have the ability to go,

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,690
I don't like the way you do business, I
want, but they don't have gotten some,

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,230
a lot of areas becomes the
[inaudible] have a license,

45
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,570
they have a license in a certain,

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,320
a certain district consumer
backlash is how you fight that.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,930
If there's enough consumer
backlash and people go,

48
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:43,380
are you just keeping it net neutrality
in place and prevent it, you know? Yeah.

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,100
I mean it's just I'm going to have some
experts on to talk about it soon in the

50
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,530
future. Yeah. I'm going over
all the data and information,

51
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:53,950
but I just wanted to get
people's temperature and
it's so funny how people, uh,

52
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,900
get so aggressive and shitty with you
when you just talk about this issue

53
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,570
because a few people, I had a mute.
I was like, good luck dude. Yup.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,570
Your opinion means shit to me because
you just have to be insulting when

55
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,690
someone's just asking a question. Right.
You know this, this whole thing is,

56
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,050
is interesting because there's smart
people on both sides of it and they have

57
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,660
compelling arguments on both
sides of it and I don't,

58
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,080
I don't have an opinion
100% I lead more people.

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,340
A lot of people don't yet know how this
this is going to play out well because

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,810
you know where we may say though,

61
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:27,811
you lean towards what I lean towards
the idea that you have to have some

62
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,420
oversight, that you have to
have someone who's looking out,

63
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:35,590
who makes sure that these companies
can't fuck you over and can't prevent you

64
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,600
from having access to certain information.

65
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:41,370
Certain sites I lean towards that most,
but the answer that other,

66
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,800
the other question is though that does
the market decide that was going to say

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,600
the other oversight could be,

68
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,500
I always leaned toward the idea that
the marketplace would be your oversight.

69
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,980
Let people make their choice,
but they have to have a choice.

70
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:57,800
Unless you were talking about there
are very few service providers. My,

71
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,720
my question is,

72
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:02,440
is there incentive for other people to
come into the service providing space?

73
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,030
Can they make money?
Uh,

74
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,870
what are the barriers to entry and
as far as that's concerned, right.

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,980
And secondly, secondly, um,

76
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,340
is it in the service provider's interest
ultimately to make extra cash for such

77
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:19,240
bad press? I, you may see
nothing happened as a result,

78
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:23,380
but I liked the idea that the marketplace,
that consumers have a choice,

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,850
and when consumers have a choice,

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
they're going to go with what works
the best for Groupie. I do too.

81
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,960
But I do believe that it's
entirely possible that large
corporations could have

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,850
monopoly, real, real influence over the
way our culture has access to information.

83
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,830
I think I agree that should be stopped,

84
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:43,090
but I also think that these fucking
government organizations almost all suck.

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,400
They're all filled with unmotivated
people who suck at their job and the

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,070
bureaucracy and the fucking red
tape gets deeper and thicker.

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,840
I think almost every government
organization that does any task is flawed.

88
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,950
So the idea that we should have
government take care of these issues.

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,380
I have a problem with that too,
missy both sides of it.
