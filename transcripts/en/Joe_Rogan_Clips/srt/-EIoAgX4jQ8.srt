1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,620
North or something like 200 whatever. It's
like the closest saltwater crocs. Yeah,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,100
they keep a track like you know,
they're pretty visual and about how,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,370
where they are, what rivers they would
be because they get a warn. People like,

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:14,340
don't swim here. Some people don't
listen, they're stupid and they die.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,840
But like a crocs not going to just sort
of give you an exploratory bite like a

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:23,530
great white might and review. They're
going to snatch you and there, you know,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,130
and they're not going to get the
surfboard and the way from the underbite,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,560
you know they're gonna.
There was a horrible story that I read it.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,930
I think it was in national
geographic about this.

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:34,920
These two people that were kayaking in
the river in Africa and this guy was guy

11
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,600
went with him. Did you? This
might be a different story.
I don't know. What do you,

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,800
what story did you hear?
This one was like,

13
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,590
these two guys were going to do a first
descent down this thing and they were

14
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:46,260
contacting another guy who had
done that river, an American guy.

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,490
And the American guy was like, I
can't miss this, the I got to do this,

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,780
I gotta do that whole river.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,530
And then the three of them got into
this zone where they're just crocs

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,310
everywhere in the river was real slow
and wide. And as soon as they got there,

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,630
all the river, all the crocs came off the
river bank and they were like, oh shit,

20
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,464
there's like tons of them.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,980
And this guy's theory was to take his
helmet and throw it off to the side.

22
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,690
So it would be like
movement and distract them.

23
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:13,410
And they'd attack that and he paddled
up the shore and all three of them got

24
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:16,830
together and the American guy was on the
right side and the other two guys where

25
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,720
you've got, and they were so close,
they like the guy in the middle,

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,350
like we couldn't really paddle. He
would just kind of like, you know,

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,110
trying to move along with them.
And so they figured if the bigger we are,

28
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,140
the bigger we look and more intimidating,
like maybe we'll be okay.

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,850
1518 foot crop comes up, grabs
the guy, takes him out of his,

30
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,770
pulls him out of his car, disappears.
They never seen him again.

31
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,090
His backpack floats up and then his
stuff's floating down downstream.

32
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,530
The other two guys get out of the water.
And um,

33
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,330
I think I'm telling the story pretty
good because I read it like five times

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,523
online too.

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,920
And they got other water and then there's
a little village just down and there

36
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,780
was a little, um, a
bridge over. And they had,

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,640
there were some boats when the boats were
all dry docked and they went down and

38
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:59,220
in broken English there was one person
that could talk to him or whatever and

39
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:00,150
they said,
you know,

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,520
our boats are not in the water
because there's too many crops here.

41
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,060
Like we know not to go on the water
because they were like, we need a boat.

42
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,370
We got to find his body. We got
to try and save him, you know,

43
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,030
and then they went to this bridge
and wash this stuff like float by.

44
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,880
That's the same story. Yeah, it's,

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,550
and the guy wasn't supposed to be on
the trip and there was about the gut,

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,530
the Kayak flipping and then pulling
his body out under the Kayak.

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,160
Yeah. Brutal. They're monsters. It's a,

48
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,250
there's a show called Diana started.
They really are.

49
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,790
This is a show called uncharted
by, uh, you've seen that show.

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,580
My friend Jim Shockey is a Florida.
Yeah,

51
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,300
that's 15 foot fucking
alligator they found in Florida,

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,930
strolling across the golf course and
the next day they found a giant snake,

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,600
a giant rattlesnake strolling
across the golf course.

54
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,440
Look at the size of that thing I fed,
you know, I was friends with Steve Irwin,

55
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,880
so he said, go to look at the size
of that thing on a golf course.

56
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,240
Here's the thing, I, I,

57
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,460
I think there's a misconstrued
misconception about the crocs.

58
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,570
And they actually talked about this,

59
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:05,410
cause I used to be friends with Steve
Irwin before he passed away. He taught.

60
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,920
He actually had me hand feed a 13 foot
crock and scariest thing I've ever done

61
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:13,270
in my life. Terrified. Why would
you do that? And I dunno. He,

62
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,310
he told me, you know, you got to
feed a crock. Fuck that. Kelly,

63
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:21,010
you're ready Mike. You a feed
crock. You got to Viagra.

64
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,600
So for two nights so crazy for
two nights I had nightmares.

65
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,880
Look at it.
What is this guy doing it?

66
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,480
That one I told you I saw this a
few weeks ago. He's feeding them.

67
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,740
Why is he doing these things?
Look at their heads.

68
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,510
Oh Man. Good Lord. And
these are wild crocs.

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,020
Well they look pretty like they know
this guy going to feed them something.

70
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,610
They know something in that bad man.
Look at the heads on these things.

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,860
What?
See this is like the conception we,

72
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,340
the concept we have about these animals,
right?

73
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,530
We just think that they're
just killers and whatever.

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,190
Do you ever see the guy and limone of
Costa Rica who had a pet 15 foot crock?

75
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,170
Yeah, they did say that guy's
an asshole. This is crazy.

76
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:09,310
It's a crazy animal man. It's a
crocs freaked me out. But I like,

77
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,800
I kind of mess when I'm playing.
When I'm playing golf.

78
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,800
I played a lot of golf when I'm in
Florida. I always messed with the gators.

79
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:19,690
Like I'll grab him by the tail.
Why? Oh, why? Oh it's, it's kind of,

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,980
I dunno. It's just like, it's fun
until you get your arm bid off I guess.

81
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,640
But this guy is not even where he
doesn't even need to backstep you know,

82
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:29,560
he's like, well those are smaller. Yeah.

83
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,020
But that means still get rip
your arm off death roles.

84
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,810
But that's so small in
comparison to those other ones.

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,090
I was fishing in Australia
in this fresh water a river,

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,950
but it goes down to the ocean.

87
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:45,640
So salt water crocs come
up it to a certain point.

88
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:48,250
There's like this dam and they don't
go past that. So you know, down here,

89
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,040
up here is all the fresh water
down here is fresh and salt water.

90
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,040
And we saw a few 15 foot crocs this day
and we're in a boat that was six feet

91
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,240
wide and about 18 feet long,
15, 18 feet long. And, um,

92
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,800
you know, the guy taking us, he said, you
know, we don't have problem in this boat,

93
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,170
but you know, if you fell out of
the boat there's a book of problem.

94
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,270
But he was telling us a story.

95
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,820
One day I was fishing with these guys
and swing guy standing up in the boat

96
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,270
fishing.

97
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,440
He falls out of it and the guy was about
250 pounds or something like a big dude,

98
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,580
like maybe 300 pounds.

99
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:21,580
He was like a big overweight guy and
he fell at the boat and the guy said,

100
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,960
the guy was in the water for about two
minutes and he was just like any second,

101
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,260
this guy is dead. He's like,
there's nothing I can do.

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,620
And he said it was all they could do to
hit dead to get him from the front of

103
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:34,420
the boat.
He was trying to pull up,

104
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,300
come up the side and he couldn't and
he was panicking. So He's, you know,

105
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,590
when people go into panic mode,

106
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:40,180
like when people are drowning
and they're panicking,

107
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,560
they say you've got to punch him in the
face and try to knock them out and call

108
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,580
them down. And they couldn't
punch this guy. Like they would,

109
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,000
they were trying to get them to calm down
and they had to get him all the way to

110
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,010
the back of the boat because they
had to get him up the transom.

111
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,950
And they said from there they could get
leverage and lifted and it wouldn't flip

112
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:54,940
the boat or whatever.
Right.

113
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,070
But he said this guy was in the water
for a couple minutes and he's like,

114
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:02,090
at any time there's a croc that's big
enough to eat you with insight of us here

115
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,770
at all times. But this guy
said that, he said that, um,
the biggest, you know, I said,

116
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,170
what's the biggest one you ever seen?
Cause we've seen 15 foot crocs,

117
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:13,160
like every 20 minutes, every half
an hour. And we see a 15 foot. Yeah,

118
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:18,080
no giant freaking cop. Yeah. And
we're, we're fishing. Oh my God. Um,

119
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,710
we, we're efficient for Barrow
Monday. That's a crazy fish. Yeah.

120
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,260
And um, and uh, so we're
fishing for money and,

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,310
and I keep thinking like,

122
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,590
I dunno when you've got one in
the line is like a shark bite,

123
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,020
that thing or whatever. And
anyways, we started asking the guy,

124
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:35,420
what's the biggest one you
ever saw? And he said, Mike,

125
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:39,980
the biggest one I ever saw was about
28 feet. 20. Yeah. 29 feet maybe.

126
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,490
And he said he's only seen it once and
he saw it from about a kilometer away and

127
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,740
the estimated the size
and he said this guy,

128
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,370
these guys in a helicopter shot at
once and it doesn't stay in the river,

129
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,130
it stays out in the ocean.
And he said, it's so smart,

130
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:54,650
it knows it's in silty water
where nothing can see it.

131
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,630
There's nothing as big as it is. It owned
its territory, you know, eight feet. Yeah.

132
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:04,430
And he said that, he said that the back,
we're in the six foot boat and he said,

133
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:07,520
if this thing, he goes, I tell you
this, how big they are. He goes,

134
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:09,680
this one would be,
he said if it was under our boat,

135
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,340
it would be sticking out about
four to six feet on either side,

136
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,610
across his backside.
And we're in a six foot wide boat.

137
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:20,600
So he said it'd be like 15 foot across
the back. It's back. That's how fucked up.

138
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,490
So think of the girth. So something
that big 15 feet across the back.

139
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,500
That's what this guy told me. I don't
know. We didn't see it. Oh my God. Well,

140
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,340
I mean we're seeing, you know, 15 footers
that are like, it's girth close to that.

141
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,680
You know, like a great white, when
you see a 15 foot great white,

142
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,000
it's girth is 15 feet pretty
much. They're so fat. Yeah.

143
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,150
Once they get like 10 feet,

144
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,690
then they start getting fat and a
growth gets about the length them.

145
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,810
So if you see a 15 or 20 foot, 18 foot
great white, and you measure their growth,

146
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:52,160
it's pretty much their length. How big to
crocs get, I don't know. This guy said,

147
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,581
I don't know,

148
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:55,280
this guy's claiming it's like must have
made the biggest crock in the world.

149
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,880
But there was one they called
Gus or something in Africa.

150
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,100
I used to go late night,
just youtube this stuff.

151
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:02,540
When they were saying this
is one that had eaten,

152
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:06,130
like they think it's eaten
over 102 hundred people and
these villages, oh Geez.

153
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,100
And they think it's like 23 feet
long or something. Well this uh,

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,890
Jim Shockey show that I was talking to me
about uncharted. They just offered him,

155
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,610
who's look at that fucking thing?
The Savannah King.

156
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,970
Is that a perspective shot though? Look
how far back those, I know. You wonder.

157
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,060
You wonder. Yeah, but people do
that with pigs and then make them,

158
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:26,540
I do that with my 20. When I catch
a fish, I put it right by the Lens.

159
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,040
It says 28 feet, four inches. So that
makes sense. Like, Oh, what's that?

160
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,230
That's a replica of how big it was.
Fuck that thing. Fuck that thing.

161
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,280
And everything that was alive before
that made dinosaurs too. You know,

162
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,650
like go back to that picture Jamie.
That replica,

163
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,000
make that larger the replica and just
make that larger look at the size of that

164
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,860
fucking thing.
Oh

165
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,840
well what is the largest confirmed ones?

166
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,960
Cause if that one is 28 feet, four
inches, this thing, the thing about that,

167
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:59,520
when they said 28 feet,
four inches,

168
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:02,260
that's like back when people
were full of Shit. Yeah.

169
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,430
I mean this guy who told me this Aussie
guy might have been trying to freak me

170
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,010
out too. I mean cause it echo.
Look at that one right there.

171
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:12,270
That thing is 20 feet and it's not
20 feet across his back or 12 feet.

172
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,490
You know what I mean? Another
eight foot long. It's pretty.

173
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,170
That's why you see when you see like a
five foot crop or alligator and then you

174
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:19,980
see a 10 foot,

175
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,980
the girth relative to the length changes
at that point is it's like he's talking

176
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,200
about the ratio in the size. It's like
one point, right. What does it say?

177
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,120
Number one, what does it
say? Number one candidate.

178
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,840
This is a list of the top 10 so I
think their largest chronic program,

179
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,320
the Cambodia crocodile seven minutes.
Now is this just the,

180
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,520
the species they're talking about?
Yeah.

181
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,380
This is just the five largest
crocodiles ever recorded on Cambodia.

182
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,720
Show the picture of the Cambodian
one 23 feet. That doesn't have, no,

183
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,251
it doesn't this.

184
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:50,250
There's only one that had a picture that
would you not take a picture of a 23

185
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:55,170
foot long crocodile? Trust
me, bro. Schumann's big.

186
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,560
Yeah, I mean I would imagine that
there's probably bigger ones out there.

187
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,740
I know there was a super killer croc
that went extinct that far dwarfed those.

188
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,130
Those were 60 feet are giant.
Enormous.

189
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:11,730
I had extinct pull up that
extinct giant crocodile.

190
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,850
I had a friend who was a
commercial fisherman and
South Africa and he was like,

191
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,510
he told me, he's like, boot the biggest
shocks it way bigger than you think.

192
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,660
He's like, yeah, and I go, I want to
see a picture or something. He said,

193
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:22,494
I'll tell you this.

194
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,470
I was on a 60 foot boat with
10 guys fishing almost. Hey.

195
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:29,220
He said like everybody in
the boat saw the shark.

196
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,750
He said at camp next to their boat,

197
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,240
they were 20 miles off of Port
Elizabeth where there's this reef,

198
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,930
they fish and he's claiming the thing
was more than half the length of their 60

199
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:40,440
foot boat. Why? He's like it was
35 feet. That's what he tells me.

200
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,650
What is the biggest great white like 20
but he's saying there's Jacques Cousteau

201
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,800
supposedly filled one in Cape Verde did.
They didn't have anything.

202
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,780
They couldn't tell the size cause
they didn't have something next to it.

203
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:55,420
He said it was close to 10 meters,
which is 30 feet. But this guy,

204
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,840
this guy's telling me,
he goes, no, he goes,

205
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,390
I've seen the shark twice out there
is what he told me, but I don't know.

206
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,150
They're out there every day.
That's the thing. How many
people are out there? Yeah,

207
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,440
I don't know know.
It's like people are the biggest ones.

208
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,670
The biggest ones are smart. You know,
like I don't, I rarely said big shark.

209
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,600
Rarely I'll see like I've seen a couple
of great whites in South Africa jump.

210
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,890
Look at that thing, that that is the, a
replica of something that used to exist.

211
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,060
12 animals.
You're glad it's fucking skull.

212
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:27,810
This guy's basically standing inside
the skull. This crocodile. So freaky.

213
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:32,280
Fuck that man. Well that's that. That's
the premise of that stupid movie. The Meg,

214
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:37,110
meg, meg, Donna. I won't
even watch it. It's like,

215
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,970
oh come, I don't know. Do you
remember that movie? That deep blue?

216
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,460
Is that what it's called? And it was a
shark that they were, there were sharks.

217
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,110
They were training. They
were like GMO sharks are, so

218
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,020
he's genetically clone charts and they
were supposedly training them and then

219
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:55,570
they got too smart and they start
eating everyone. And then there's like,

220
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,080
you know,

221
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,070
the girls got a hot girl in the Bikini
and she has to take off her wetsuit

222
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:01,900
because it's rubber. I
don't know. There's the,

223
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,150
you see these movies
and you just like the,

224
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,170
the artistic license on these things
are so bizarre. There's no truth to it.

225
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,910
It's like was here we go. And he started
talking about it. He goes, you know what?

226
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,360
You know what dangerous waters,
not dangerous. Ice is dangerous

227
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,530
fight mall.

228
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,960
We're going to pull together
and we're going to find a way,

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,440
good move and see that. I mean I wouldn't,
I wouldn't see that coming at all.

230
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,570
I wouldn't go in the Waterford
seconds after that. So that movie,

231
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,320
I actually was with Samuel L.
Jackson like two weeks ago in Paris.

232
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,120
No one in golf together. How big I wanted
to ask him about that, but I didn't,

233
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,710
I didn't know the balls.
I mean,

234
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:53,550
how big do you think they
could be and people don't know.

235
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,640
I mean 30 feet sounds reasonable.
If they think they're 25 feet,

236
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,920
there could be one that's 30 feet maybe.
Yeah.

237
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,360
I mean I think it's reasonable to go,

238
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,190
but that's a lot more years and eating
and like no one saw it during that time.

239
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,260
I mean, it's kind of like Ufo
is I got to see one. Yeah,

240
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,320
I got to see an alien sharks and we
know they get big and we're not just how

241
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:19,650
many people are out there looking for
them. That's the thing. But they film one,

242
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,910
they called big blue last year I think
in Guadalupe Island, I think it was.

243
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,620
And it was 20 is one or two feet. Yeah,
the videos online and it's, you know,

244
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,850
I'm big day look right?
Yeah.

245
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,240
This thing's face and nose look
small because the body is so huge.

246
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,070
It must have been a pregnant
female or something,

247
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,610
but it's body looks like even
bigger around than the length.

248
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:43,590
And they said it was 20
see like his face almost looks like small.

249
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,210
Oh my God is so,
so world's largest shark.

250
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:54,240
Seven meters. So that's
2022 feet, 23 feet.

251
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,040
What the, this guy touches it to their
guy comes out of the cage and touches it.

252
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh look at this size of this
thing. That's another thing. This,

253
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,680
the shark feeding freaks me out.
There's this guy touched at wash.

254
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:08,740
He just comes out and he's like,
I gotta touch this creature.

255
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,120
Got To get out of there,
bitch. But she like,

256
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:16,470
it's face almost like small
compared to how it's so massive.

257
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,650
So scary. That is so big.
It looks like a whale.

258
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,880
It literally looks like a whale.
Oh my God.

259
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:26,670
And to think that there's something out
there that's 10 feet bigger than that,

260
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,730
well a killer whale can eat that
things liver without thinking about it.

261
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,670
And it it killer whales,
just a dolphin.

262
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,960
It's so weird to think that that thing
has dominance over that thing. It is,

263
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:40,710
but there's just so much smarter.
Yeah. There's so much more agile,

264
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:45,240
so much smarter. How often,
what this is a seven guilt,

265
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:47,700
what do they call that?
Greenland. Shark. Yeah.

266
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,350
They think isn't wasn't that one of
the speculations of what the Loch ness

267
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,700
monster was?
I think there was a,

268
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,080
some sort of a land lock green or not
landlord wouldn't have been in the lock.

269
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,500
Now they think it was the lock because
it was trapped because of the luxury used

270
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,390
to be connected to the guy
was a twig that was good.

271
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,970
The driftwood man. Or it could be like
a sturgeon or some shit like that.

272
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:09,800
Like there was one of, one of those, um,

273
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,260
was a lake Champlain or one
of those surgeons are here.

274
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,950
Sturgeons are crazy. Yeah. That's a,
that's another diet. So alligator, Gar,

275
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,850
you seeing those things come and
my friends went fishing for them.

276
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,470
They haven't made Texas. You can catch
them in Texas. Those things are bizarre.

277
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:31,930
I don't think you're noodling for
those things. No. That's another thing.

278
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,270
A hundreds of millions of years
old. Right? I mean that would be,

279
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,060
I'd love to go take my
friends and just go new Lynn.

280
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,030
Sometimes it sounds kind of creepy or
girlfriend be like, what? Noodly oh,

281
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:44,880
for catfish. Yeah, but, but you get
accidentally get turtle sometimes though.

282
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,970
Snapping turtles and bite your arm
off when it will fuck your Harry's.

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,160
I feel fucking hand job. We just break
your arm in half. Probably. Fuck you up.

284
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,970
I mean, I'm sure dudes are probably
lost fingers snapping turtle or those.

285
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,960
What's that?

286
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,440
Accidentally googled that and the
snapping turtle incidents popped up.

287
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,910
Guys losing their hands.

288
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,410
Don't show me this because
that's like two razors.

289
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,210
They're like two razors that go.
Yeah,

290
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,540
like garden sheers taking
your fucking arm off.
