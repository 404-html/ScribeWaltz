1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,260
These are people who see themselves as
gods who want to be a world historical

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:08,640
figures there. They're literally do that.
Who, who do you think is doing that well?

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:13,470
Like, like Jeff Bezos. You think he thinks
of himself as a god? Yeah. Really? Yeah.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,430
Really you don't, and now I read those
text messages he sent to that check.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,050
I don't think God would say that God
would say you should be lucky to get this

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,200
dick on this space exploration
stuff though. It's like,

7
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,760
you know all that people are obsessed
with the life extinction extinction. Um,

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,840
but, but don't you think that this is
a side effect of having $150 billion?

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,550
You so much good with that. So bayzos
is pouring $1 billion a year into his,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,360
into his space exploration
project, which is like, I mean,

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,970
I'm excited by space too.
I think it'd be cool to go up there,

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,540
but there's some pressing problems here,
which we could really benefit. You know,

13
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,240
that money could really benefit
and I agree. But Longterm,

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,660
I think the philosophy is that we're
going to have to get off this planet.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,540
If the human race is going to succeed,

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,340
but because of not just the threat of
global warming but of Astra steroid packs,

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,860
it's an asteroid thing I think.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,920
I mean for me Novas there's a lot of
factors mark on the particular question of

19
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,730
climate.
Um,

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,270
there's just no way that the earth is
going to get as inhospitable as Mars is.

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,040
So the idea of building a colony there
as a hedge against global warming,

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,200
it's just crazy. We could, it is
ridiculous on the positive note,

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,350
if we could fix that shit
hole, like imagine what we
could do here. Yeah. Paradise.

24
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,350
Yeah. Well the idea is
terraforming, right?

25
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:34,230
That they can go there with some kind
of massive machine that's gonna create

26
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,450
oxygen and the environment and yeah.

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,760
Well that's a good place to
practice because no one lives there.

28
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,870
So you could do all kinds of goofy shit
and go, well, good news and bad news.

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,270
The good news is we figured out a way,
terraform,

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,150
the bad news is we already fucked up Mars,
so we're going to try another spot.

31
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:51,090
We're going to go to, you
know, we're going to move on
to see rhinos. Yeah, yeah.

32
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,490
Well, you know, Venus used to be
actually quite earthlike. Yeah.

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,120
And they went through a really
rapid global warming that made it,

34
00:01:57,121 --> 00:02:00,510
now it's like a total hellhole and
that's like the sort of worst case.

35
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,440
Worst case for earth is
the venous scenario. Well,

36
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,580
ultimately the sun's going to burn out,
right.

37
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,950
But that's many millions
of years for sure.

38
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,300
But if we really do look into the future,
something, something has to be done.

39
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,530
You know what I mean? This is the,
on the grandest of grand scales, the,

40
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,640
the concept of a, some sort
of interstellar arcs. I
mean, I believe that I'm,

41
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,080
and I'm, I'm, I'm with it. I just think
the timescale of the threat that we're,

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,120
that we need to avert by
space exploration. That's
a timescale of Millennia.

43
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,810
Yes.

44
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,260
We have a lot of new technology develop
over the next thousand years that will

45
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,720
allow us to do it better and more
efficiently. But climate change,

46
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,650
the timescale is like the next 30 years.
Right? So we need to focus on it now.

47
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,840
To give ourselves the
opportunity to do the other show.

48
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,630
Why do you think it's sexier to
go to space? Is that what it is?

49
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:50,130
Like rockets and I mean, I think
for these dudes. Yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,530
It's a big metal dick.
You shooting off into the atmosphere.

51
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,210
That's what we're doing
and kind of fuck space.

52
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,890
I actually made that argument about Mars.
Yeah.

53
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,160
It's like they're shaped like dicks.
Yeah. Something to that. Yeah.

54
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,470
Well also this generation of
people really grew up in the,

55
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,550
in the age of like the space race.
I mean it's um,

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,700
and the aftermath of landing on
the moon and I think there is,

57
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,930
like Peter Teal talks about this,

58
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,410
there's this kind of unfulfilled
sense of future that we all,

59
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:20,800
like anybody who grew up in the post
war years in the 67 they were like,

60
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:21,910
you know,

61
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,150
whatever his famous line were promised
flying cars and all we got was 140

62
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,330
characters or whatever. I think that that
applies to the space exploration stuff.

63
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:32,140
It's like, well, the government is no
longer doing the really ambitious shit,

64
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,780
but we can do it privately.
On the other hand,

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,930
there is a government in the world
that is doing that shit. And China,

66
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,840
they just landed on the
far side of the moon.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,400
They're doing really aggressive space
exploration and I haven't been there in 20

68
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:45,611
years,

69
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:50,110
but the people I know who live there say
there was so much faith in the future

70
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,280
there. Um, they just
believe in a very inherent,

71
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,660
deep down way that like the future will
be better and Psi Phi e in an exciting

72
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:02,320
way. And that's so far from the way
that Americans think about the future.

73
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,890
Is that part of the benefit of
having a dictator run things?

74
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:10,960
I think it's just like they're on a huge
upswing and so like there's no debate

75
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,780
about how things get
done. Yeah, yeah, totally.

76
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,030
I mean that's what I was saying before.
It's like it,

77
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,730
it gives you some hope for climate.
If like Xi Jinping is just like, okay,

78
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,640
immediately, no more
coal, they'll all stop.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,360
But he's also throwing 2 million Muslims
in concentration camps. Yeah. Um,

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,080
this bayzos thing,
I mean,

81
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm not criticizing you because I
think it's a very common thought,

82
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,250
but why is it that we look at these
super rich billion billionaire characters

83
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,330
that are on the top of the heap?

84
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,080
Why do we think of them as like having
these tremendous egos and looking like

85
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:45,790
gods isn't it sort of just does just how
you're always going to look at someone

86
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:49,960
who lives in of $100 million
house and it's possible.

87
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,760
I think when you look at,

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,240
I mean not to get too like armchair
psychologizing about basis,

89
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,880
but when you look at the
physical transformation that
he's put himself through,

90
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,880
when you think about like the life
extinction, what has he done physically?

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,300
But he's just like,
I mean if,

92
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,350
if you look at photos of him when
he's like a young man, he's, you know,

93
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,850
just kind of like dweeby right? And now
he's like a, um, an action hero. This is,

94
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,780
he really, yeah. I mean maybe not
like you, but he's like, he's, yeah,

95
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,300
he's pretty as big as Jack. Am I
missing something? Let me show you.

96
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,320
Definitely looks different.
Go pull up,

97
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:24,730
pull ups and marriages of Jeff
Bezos jacked. I didn't know,

98
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,410
but he got a trainer. I mean,
no, I'm not blaming him,

99
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,510
but that's only one part of
it. I would say I'm bigger
than that is, you know, the,

100
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,610
I had just had thin skins. I'm the
worlds. Okay. Let me say zoom in.

101
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,740
I guess he's got some arms there
is. Oh Wow. That's a big difference.

102
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,540
Yeah. But he's also got a vest on.
I guess his arms do look pretty big.

103
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,120
Yeah. I mean in most ways
I'm not a business hater.

104
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,850
I think Amazon has been actually really
pretty great. I'm a fan. Yeah. I like,

105
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,610
well listen to the guy talk and I loved
his letter to the national enquirer.

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,200
There he is right there.
Yeah.

107
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:07,400
So he looks fit in front of the King
Kong rampage movie. Is that him? Yeah.

108
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,140
Yeah, he looks pretty good. Um, okay.

109
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,370
I guess physical transformation, but
that's, yeah. Probably life extinction,

110
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:18,800
like uploading your brain to the computer.
There's so many busy into that shit. I,

111
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,310
he is actually, I think not as
into it to some other people.
