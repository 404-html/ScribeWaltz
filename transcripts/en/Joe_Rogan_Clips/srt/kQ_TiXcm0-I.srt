1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,560
The joe rogan experience. I think he
does whatever the fuck he wants. Yeah,

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,523
that's what I think.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,830
That's the only thing that explains his
tweeting and all that crazy shit that he

4
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:13,360
says all the time. Perhaps. Yeah. I
mean that's just complete guessing.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,840
No, I know him. I knew him.
Did you? Yeah. Fuck care.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,160
Does it felt weird that he's a
president. Very. He called. Okay.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:29,910
Amy over there worked for his wife
for seven years and then I got her

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,890
and I was in Maui sitting on my
bed and I get a phone call it song.

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,190
She was Jesus Christ. This
Donald, she hands me the phone.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,950
Do you say the Donald or just don't know.

11
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,640
She said it's Donald [inaudible] were
three vodka. I'm just kidding. Melania.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,660
She worked for Melania in the
family for seven years. Okay. Um,

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,640
I got the phone call, I pick it
up, I'm sitting down and I said,

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,683
we'll say hey Donald,

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,190
because we had been down to Mar
Lago and offered money to do shows,

16
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:08,230
one offs forum and just stuff. I've been
up, been up to his little castle and um,

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,720
he calls me up and I said,
Donald,

18
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,640
you can't use dream on as
for causes not campaigns.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,390
And he did anyway.
He did anyway.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,380
And I had to assume I got Dino's whom
sent him a letter of cease and desist.

21
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:26,560
So I've been through that shit.
So I kinda know where lawyers live.

22
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,300
You don't have his whole world's run by
lawyers and Donald's got 90 lawyers that

23
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,900
are telling them what the fuck. Okay.
Maybe he's not listening. Right.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,610
But when everyone is saying,

25
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:41,050
if you just say John Mccain
is a fucking hero, if, if,

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,420
if we don't see John Mccain is a hero,

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,990
then how do you expect any young people
to one average joined the armed forces?

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,840
Because for everything they
do in bullets they take,

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,880
they're going to be laughed at
by presidents like Trump. Right.

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,280
What the fuck are you saying Donald?
Well he said something crazy like,

31
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,820
but you see what I'm saying? Soldiers
that don't get caught on things he said,

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,370
but, but they do, war is war.

33
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:06,910
Who wants the soldiers don't get
caught cause they want to. Exactly.

34
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,520
So I just tell you that you know he,

35
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,610
he's not saying anything because
he's being told what to do and see.

36
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:17,560
I think he just does whatever the fuck
he wants and if the lawyers tell him,

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,260
Steven says you can't play dream on,
and he's like fuck him.

38
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,220
I know it's what he did.

39
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,500
He played in any way so I had
sent them a cease and desist.

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,240
Then he sends a letter and said what when
I'm playing kid rock or fuck something

41
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:32,560
what? What did he found
a better song? He goes,

42
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,410
I found a better song. I actually
have, I'm going to frame it.

43
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:39,650
But that's his thing. You know he likes
people and you know what? That's a scene.

44
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,170
I see how that, how people get off
on his, what it isn't is I get this,

45
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,390
isn't he a precedent for this time though?

46
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,180
I mean this is the time we were talking
before the show about people trying to

47
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:53,050
drag people down and social media and
there's so much hostility and people are

48
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:57,280
looking to be angry and insult. This
is the time for that and a lot of ways,

49
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:59,980
unfortunately I wonder if
he's opening good peer,

50
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,000
he's opening Pandora's box for good
or is he opening Pandora's box choice?

51
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,350
I think it's our choice, but he's
our president. He's the president.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,300
But I think we can respond to this bad
feeling that we have about those kinds of

53
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,270
actions in a positive way.
I think that's where there's an opening.

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,660
I think the opening is for people to
recognize that it's not going to live

55
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:23,020
forever. You can't insult people into the
grave and feel good when you're dying.

56
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:25,750
It doesn't matter.
Like what makes you feel good right now.

57
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,800
If something makes you feel good to
constantly be knocking people down and

58
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,560
shitting on their grave,
you probably a terrible person.

59
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,440
Nobody wants to be a terrible person.
At least the majority of people don't.

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,280
So I think the majority of people are
going to recognize that this path is a bad

61
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,890
one. Then it might feel good in
the short term to say, fuck you,

62
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,330
we're going to make America great again.

63
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,050
We're gonna fucking
light the world on fire.

64
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:51,680
But I think after a while when the
tide goes in and the tide goes out,

65
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,760
people are gonna realize that this
is not the way to go. Yeah. I hope,

66
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,270
I hope we're going to learn. I think
the world is getting better overall.

67
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,450
I think there's terrible moments that
have always existed throughout human

68
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:05,260
history, but I think overall, if you look
at the period of time we live in now,

69
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,131
you know,

70
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,640
and Steven pinker wrote a great big
book about this and there's a lot of

71
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:12,760
evidence in his book.
Lot evidence points to that.

72
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,360
Every now and then I'll find somebody
on, I'll read something, see something,

73
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:20,890
and I call my managers, get me his
number called Steven up. I'm from Boston.

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,850
I met him and had lunch. He's great
at the what called Crab, you know,

75
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,950
you know Boston? Yes. One of the best
restaurants on planet. The barking crap.

76
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,250
Crab fucking men. And I had lunch
with him and my Mary Jo Becker.

77
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,230
What a fucking slamming guy.
Yeah, he's a really kind person.

78
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:39,430
Is fucking smart as can be friendly.
Yeah. This is the kind of people,

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,960
this is the key. This is the, I agree with
you when it's time for lifting up. Yeah.

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,390
Well, I think that's going to happen.
It's a really fun thing is right now.

81
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:56,430
Okay.
