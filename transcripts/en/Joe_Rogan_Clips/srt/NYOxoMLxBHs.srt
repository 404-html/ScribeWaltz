1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,760
Or three,
two

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,250
spillover. How are you felling what's
going on? See Ya. Good to see you too.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,190
Thank you very much for taking me up on
that flight. I'm gonna tell you what, no,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,170
legitimately you changed the way I
think about La. It's really small,

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,180
isn't it?
It's way smaller than you think.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,490
It's a different thing when you fly over
it. You Go, oh, just ain't that big. Yeah,

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,350
that's here.
This is what it is.

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:29,940
I remember when I was still getting my
license and I was doing a night flight,

9
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:34,750
right. Mom, which is insane.
Totally different ballgame.
Well imagine and uh, yeah,

10
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:35,800
cause when you're on the
ground you're like, wow,

11
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,290
it'd be really easy to see everybody
because you're looking up and all you've

12
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,950
seen as the backdrop of the dark sky.
Right? Right. But when you get up there,

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,740
if someone's below you, they disappear
into the city. So that's what, yeah, yeah,

14
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:50,080
yeah, yeah. So anyways, so we were flying
back and I trained down in Long Beach,

15
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:52,930
so we were going along the seven
10 and I just see like all these,

16
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:57,490
these lights and it was like right down
like going up and I go, what's that?

17
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:01,150
He goes and I've got a pilot
with Toby goes, oh that's the uh,

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,630
that's the fireworks from Disneyland.
And I was like,

19
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:08,530
fucking Disneyland is right there because
in my head it took like two hours to

20
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:13,180
get there. Hour and a half going
down the five. But it's just like,

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,770
cause you don't look at miles.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,260
All you do is look at time when you
were out here because there's so much

23
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:22,240
traffic. But it's literally like, oh
that's like 40 miles. It's not even,

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,610
it's like from Hollywood,
like I would take it,

25
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:29,230
it can't even be more than 1520 miles
away. Like Anaheim is so fucking close.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,770
But I just, it's just, or like Irvine
Comedy Club, that's all I think of.

27
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:35,230
It's just fucking way to fuck down there.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,580
And then you get up in a helicopter and
you're like there and like 11 minutes

29
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:44,290
going like, this is, this
is ridiculous. So, um, yeah,

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,410
yeah. That's awesome dude.
It was awesome. Yeah,

31
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,980
it was a Malibu when you landed on a
top of that little hill there with the

32
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:55,130
picnic table. Dude, that's funny. I sat
it down Nice. That was a little nervous.

33
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,370
So I'm like, all right, don't
fuck this up with Joe here.

34
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:00,520
Cause he's going to be like, Eh, forget.
Know. It's all right when he was flying,

35
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:03,820
when he went, when the big part, when
he went to land, he wasn't that good.

36
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:07,330
But I'm smooth. And then the
apocalypse now. Shit, we're
going through the canyons.

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,070
Dot. I thought that was awesome,
man. That was there. Um, I get it.

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,790
There was a fun. That's, it's a a,
it's a lot of fun in the, you know,

39
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,490
I fly mostly with an instructor because
they got the kid and everything,

40
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:20,590
but every once in a while
you got to go up by yourself,

41
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:24,220
just so you know you can
do it. But, um, I also, um,

42
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,010
I'm actually over to Overdo to do it,

43
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:30,010
but I always go out and I do like the
auto rotations and he'll just sorta chuck,

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,410
I'm flying along. He'll just chop
throttle and like it, it's just,

45
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:35,140
it's just rolling the Rpms. I mean,
rolling in the engine now, not the Rpm,

46
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,410
the engine down. And then you immediately
have to pick a spot, you know,

47
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:41,230
when sometimes you know,
the lower you are, you know,

48
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:42,520
it becomes literally what you,

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,970
the first place you look is where you're
putting it. It's really crazy. But, um,

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,580
where you would, where you would
put what you're talking about.

51
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:49,870
You mean crash landing,

52
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,030
that's an autorotation means it'd be
basically if you had some sort of problem.

53
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:56,140
Yeah, engine failure, whatever.

54
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:58,600
So like when you're flying
along in the engine's working,

55
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:02,710
it's drawing into the disc and that's
what creates lift. But when, uh,

56
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,940
when you go into an auto rotation,
um, it's, it's the air rushing.

57
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,750
You're using gravity, bringing the, uh,

58
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:15,010
the helicopter down, using that air,
like almost like a fan to keep it going.

59
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,690
So, and there's a critical point where
if you let the main rotor go too slow,

60
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,980
that's why the low rpm horn comes on,
which is just a nausea and sound. Uh,

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,480
if you let it go too low,

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,140
that when it gets to a point
where if it's spinning too slowly,

63
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,970
no matter how fast you drop, you can't
get it going again, fast enough to create.

64
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,290
And you're basically at that point,

65
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,490
you're in something that's in the longer
able to fly your, uh, your instructors,

66
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,324
Skylar,

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,230
Skylar pointed out something that I
didn't know that they have to Redo those

68
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:49,180
things. Like every x amount of miles, they
rebuild every hours. Yeah. Yeah. It's a,

69
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,940
well, they have like, there's all
this maintenance along the way.

70
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,840
They're incredibly maintained because
I'm sure you noticed if you read the

71
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,910
comments, all people talk about is
dying in aviation. It's like, ah,

72
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,220
that's how entertainers die. It's
like, no, it isn't. They overdose.

73
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,370
If you really looked at the
graph there on the ground,

74
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,180
completely safe overdose car accidents,

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,960
there's always over those ranking. Yeah.
And Shit like that. And it's just like,

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,390
that's mainly how you die.

77
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,590
Like the amount of people that are up
there every day and then nothing happens.

78
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:23,510
It's, it's, you know, but
there is the, you know, the,

79
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:26,820
the fly in the ointment is
that there's, there are, uh,

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,880
particularly at the private level, there
are knuckleheads out there like this.

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,770
People like I think every time I get in
I'm always thinking like, am I going to,

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,300
you know, I don't want to die today. So
I, I go over all a whole bunch of shit.

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
And you know, especially at my want
to fly solo, I have the whole flight,

84
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:48,040
I have all my options on,
you know,

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,040
where I could land, you
know, if I had a problem,

86
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,680
like that's what you're supposed to do.
I look at weather reports,

87
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,910
I do all of that shit.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,080
And what happens is guys get more and
more confident and their preflight is,

89
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:03,780
they kind of look, oh, it looks pretty
clear. And then they go out there and, uh,

90
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,880
you know this, you know this, there's,

91
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,410
there's people who go up
knowing that they can die.

92
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,290
And then there's other people out there
who just like magnum Pi and they want to

93
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,280
fly by waterfalls and shit. I mean,
those guys have more fun. But, uh,

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,760
it's, you know, there's definitely, um,
those are the people that, you know,

95
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,540
you supposed to fly,
there's like two envelopes.

96
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,740
She supposed to fly within the envelope
of what you're flying and then you know,

97
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:31,680
your skillset so you don't fly in to
shit. This is like, you know, like if the,

98
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,940
if it's too windy or whatever,
I'm just, I'm just, I'm not going,

99
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,720
even if I could handle it, it's like I'm
not going to have fun up there fucking,

100
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,340
you know, riding it
out and just, you know,

101
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,880
let the wind do what it wants to do and
don't fight it and, you know, make sure,

102
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,930
you know, you're not flying to fail.
You do is slow down, you know. Um,

103
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,320
but you know, it's, it's there,
there are elements of that,

104
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:54,430
but like if you look up there
versus what's going on down below,

105
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,010
when you fly, I always say this,
when you drive on the highway,

106
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,850
like you're flying in formation,
you're in the blue angels with,

107
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,560
with nobody talking to anybody. You
have no idea what anybody's going to do.

108
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,440
People are texting, they're on medication.
They fucking hung over their suicide.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,520
What the fuck they're doing. You know,
and then the end, the top of that,

110
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,160
you've got to look up for
the guy splitting lanes in
the motorcycles and shit.

111
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,140
Um, it's pretty amazing how few accidents
are actually, are they? It is, it is.

112
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:19,580
And what I fly,
the Robinson's,

113
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,610
they get a bad rap saying they're not
safe because they look at the amount of

114
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:25,330
crashes that they've had,
but it's be,

115
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,160
it's because it's a
helicopter you can afford.

116
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:32,390
So it's inherently a low hour
pilot. And if you look at it, it's,

117
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:37,370
most of the time it's not, it's
not the helicopter, it's the,

118
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:42,170
it's the person flying it. Um, which
is why you really have to be on it.

119
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:46,190
Like you, you, you can't. Um,
it's, it's just not something, uh,

120
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,620
uh, uh, I don't know how to explain
it. It's this weird thing where your,

121
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,660
your level of enjoyment is way higher
if you're, if you're riding in it,

122
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,720
you know what I mean? If you're
the person flying the whole time,

123
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:59,420
you have your life and other people's
lives at hand so that you're not really,

124
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,840
oh look at that. Oh look at that. Oh look
at that yet. Got Most so like, you know,

125
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,140
thinking things of like, you know, when
we were flying through that canyon,

126
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:10,160
you need that at that. I think in
that shit, I'm looking, you know,

127
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:14,910
no one where the wires are and where the
road is cause that's all fucking tree.

128
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:17,750
So it's going to be the road.
So there's those, you know,

129
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,130
when you're kind of going around a bend,
you know,

130
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,180
this certain like altitudes and
stuff just, it's, it's boring,

131
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:27,770
but it's just stuff that you're, you're
always thinking that, um, you know,

132
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,620
I imagine like when you fight, does
that, you know, I know with a lot of,

133
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,740
it's like instinct and stuff with this,
these things that you just don't do.

134
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,620
You know what I mean?
I don't know anything about fighting,

135
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,760
but it was heard in boxing. You don't
lead with an opera cut. That's just,

136
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,960
it's just fucking things.

137
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,630
You don't think you see a lot of
guys like when they go to take off,

138
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:44,030
they do this fucking thing.
Like the nose down attitude.

139
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,340
Like I was taught not to do that.

140
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:49,190
Cause I know they do that because it
looks cool. I don't know why they do it.

141
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,810
I mean you're supposed
to, like, I was taught,

142
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:55,760
you're supposed to keep it level so that
way if you have a problem, you know,

143
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,120
you, you're already in the right
attitude to just immediately enter,

144
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,700
enter an auto. Like, now, if I'm,

145
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,070
if I'm fucking nose down and
if I'm too far to the ground,

146
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:07,890
I'm just gonna fucking go right into
the ground. Um, I dunno, but I mean I'm,

147
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:10,730
I'm still like totally a novice.
I'm, I'm coming up on 200 hours,

148
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,040
so I don't know a lot, but
I'm super, super, super,

149
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,220
super fucking cautious and,
uh,

150
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,150
I make sure I don't go too long
without doing an auto rotations.

151
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,930
I used to hate them and now I
actually really liked them. Um,

152
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,280
it was sorta the way it was explained
to me, I didn't get it until one day.

153
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:31,670
I just thought about it and then I
got it and I was able to lock into it.

154
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:34,430
Cause it's, it's the same inputs
if you were going in for a landing,

155
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,410
but they broke it down to like four
steps. Like it was low Rpm, you know,

156
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:44,270
lower collective, gentle aft cyclic,
you know, uh, look at you trim strings.

157
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:48,200
You know, [inaudible] was
a trim, trim, airspeed,

158
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,340
Rpms and just fucking doing all of this.
And the reality is, it's just like,

159
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:56,490
it's the right pedal. Jesus Christ that
forgot that pedal. So it's all the same.

160
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,080
It's all the same input if you were
going in for a landing. So all I do,

161
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:05,400
anytime I hear the low rpm is I just
do that and then I'm locked into it and

162
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,850
then I'm just watching Martin
and I can just watch my rpms.

163
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:10,340
And at this point I've flown enough
where I kind of know where I'm interim,

164
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,050
which basically means you're not like
crabbing and you kind of go in straight

165
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,000
and then you can kind of like pick out
your spot and then it becomes fun as

166
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,020
what's cool is you can do like
one 80 autos. You can turn around.

167
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,770
And what I do like about it is when you
come down to the ground as you can bleed

168
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:27,540
off all of your airspeed, that forward
motion that's going to fucking kill you.

169
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,210
And as long as you don't fuck up and
flare and go back up and then drop like a,

170
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:32,460
you know,
you know,

171
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,800
it's kind of like a hockey stop
was the way it was described to me.

172
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,660
Just level it out and
running should go to drop.

173
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,950
You pull like that and these guys
land, I'm like daisies and stuff. It's,

174
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:44,010
it's really amazing. I'm not as good as
that, but like I, I will do it where,

175
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:46,350
you know, worst case scenario, you know,

176
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,980
I might well like I fuck like
get a little bit of a bump. Yeah.

177
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,760
But I'm going to be all right.
So, um, yeah I don't know.

178
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,290
Now there's probably a
bunch of people saying,

179
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,210
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about, which admittedly, you know,

180
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,590
I still think there's a lot of
shit I need to learn about standup.

181
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,900
So as long as you go into
things like that, um, you know,

182
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,770
well the fact that you're doing it in
the fact that you learn in a new thing

183
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,180
that's really difficult to learn.

184
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,310
Don't you think that
that's good for your brain?

185
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,990
Now I am a big believer
in constantly learning.

186
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:20,940
It's why I like you as a person
cause you're constantly like,

187
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,240
you're not the Joe I knew three years
ago in a good way. You're like, you,

188
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:27,840
you learn all of this. You know, when
I first met you, you weren't hunting.

189
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,250
Uh, you weren't a marsh. That
was thing you would, you a
two dimensional, you will,

190
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,170
which was amazing because
everyone was just a comedian.

191
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:38,970
He will this taekwondo champion,
a standup guy. And then,

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,830
and then since then,
you've added all,

193
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,590
like the guests that you have on in the
fact that you're able to like talk to

194
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:48,090
them and stuff is because you've
continued to, you know, um,

195
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,291
you know,
it's,

196
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,080
it's the same thing with like a comic
who writes his first hour and then just

197
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:55,590
sits on it for like eight years and
all of a sudden two presidents goes by.

198
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,170
It's like, why aren't they
laughing anymore? It's like,

199
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,960
cause you're just stuck
in time. So, um, I, I.
