1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,840
Go active drug.
So there's a lot still to be discovered.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,700
Now Canada has just recently
legalized marijuana as of today.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,510
Yes. Yeah. Um,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,140
did they have any plans or do you know
of considering the legality of other

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:20,770
substances? As a matter
of fact, they do. Um, uh,

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
there is there, I can't really
talk about it that actually I,

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,560
I shouldn't talk about it cause I
don't have that much information.

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,030
But there is a gentleman who
came to one of my retreats.

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,830
I meet the most interesting people at
these retreats. You wouldn't believe it.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,900
This guy is, uh, uh, of
aspiring young politician,

11
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:44,940
Canadian politician from Ottawa.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
He's talking to Justin about legalizing
psychedelics for therapeutic uses and

13
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,500
he's, you know, working with some,

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,740
some lawyers and so on and
putting together a proposal
to do this MTMA assisted

15
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,100
psychotherapy trials to begin final
phase in Vancouver. Well, letter you go.

16
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,370
But that's maps, right? That's
the catalyst behind that.

17
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,440
He wants to change policy.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,130
And the thing is the Canadians
are reasonable people.

19
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,220
That's the big difference from
America. It was, you know,

20
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,280
you can propose this kind
of thing and they'll,

21
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,740
they won't dismiss it out of hand,
lol, you know, what's your evidence?

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,810
Why should we do this? So Justin's a
very young guy. I mean, he's young, 40.

23
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,811
I imagine he's been beyond the
chrysanthemum a timer to I do.

24
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,960
Really? Sure. I think so.
Wow. What makes you say that?

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,710
Because he's spoken about it. Hi.
I'm sure he wouldn't speak about,

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,430
I guess just to guess he's the right age.

27
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,360
Um, he, well,

28
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:52,380
I can't say it's just pure speculation.
LE, let's put it this way. I,

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,560
I wouldn't be surprised for people who
don't know what we're talking about.

30
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,490
Beyond the Cassandra means there's
this thing that you see when you break

31
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,600
through,
when you do DMT,

32
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:05,220
that's very bizarre geometric pattern
that resembles a chrysanthemum. Right,

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,540
right. You know, the, the
Canadians, I mean, for instance,

34
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:14,541
to get approval for these Mtma trolls was
a lot more straight forward in Canada,

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,690
you know, and, uh, now, and,

36
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,380
and they've done some clinical
studies with Iowasca and they're,

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,040
they're on board with that.
Uh, they've done some,

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,930
some studies with the indigenous people
in Canada. They call it first nations,

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,470
but they have, they have done
that and it's been pretty, uh,

40
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,830
it's been straight forward
to get that work done.

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,280
That would be really the drug
hysteria that we have, you know?

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,190
So I think it's a good place to
produce, pursue this research. Well,

43
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:47,640
in many ways.
