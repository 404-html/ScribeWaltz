1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,360
But now I'm more the,
uh,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,120
thing I've become obsessed with lately
is there's a skepticism about Ufos.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,540
Yeah. That's why I want to talk to you
about this because you told me that you've

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,520
become obsessed with Ufo is recently. Oh
yeah. Completely. And it's like, yeah,

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,420
totally. Really? Yeah, totally
believe the UFO phenomenon is real.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,600
I don't know what it is, but it's totally,
it has to be real. Some things happened.

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,600
Why is that? Because there's just way
too much evidence that it is real.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,420
What evidence? Uh, well, uh,
radar evidence, uh, that the,

9
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:37,380
the f 16 locked on a Ufo, that
footage and also just, uh,

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,590
like I know that friend of ours,
I don't know if she wants to say it,

11
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:45,280
but her father was an air
traffic controller and he
told her, they said, yeah,

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,780
every air traffic controller
has seen something. Yeah.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,600
And I had another friend whose father
was in a commercial pilot and she said,

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:51,900
yeah,

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,740
my dad said every single pilot has seen
something and they've all been told not

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,870
to say anything about it. We got a couple
of friends that say they were a like,

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,870
yeah,
you know,

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,250
the abducted one is a little easier to
wrap your head around because when you're

19
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,090
sleeping, your brain is producing all
sorts of indogenous psychedelic chemicals.

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,450
Yeah. Almost all of these experiences
happen when you're sleeping.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,700
Almost all these experience,
when these people were abducted,

22
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,400
they're taken from their beds, which
is when they're dreaming. I mean,

23
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,260
it's just like there's some real clear,

24
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,250
easy steps to follow up on a fall Ockham's
razor and not, you're not get crazy,

25
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,061
but it knocks those out,

26
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,640
but it doesn't knock out like Barney and
Betty Hill and all the people that are

27
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:30,440
abducted will fully conscious and that
and that remember it without hypnotherapy.

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,570
I'm like, I'm not sure about
the abduction phenomenon,

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,560
but I don't know Barney and Betty Hill.
I know the story, but I don't know them.

30
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,920
Yeah,

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,260
so I would have to know them because
there's a lot of people that I've taught,

32
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,850
like I did a show for Scifi,
I called Joe Rogan questions.

33
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:49,851
Everything that cured me and show
cured me of a lot of my nonsense with,

34
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,800
with conspiracies when we used
to talk about it. Yes. Yeah.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,120
That stuff all the time. All
the time. Yeah. Yeah. But I,

36
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,810
I needed to actually study it. So for
six months, that's basically all I did.

37
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,280
I interviewed people and
I like big foot believers,

38
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,630
Ufo believers,

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,260
and the one thing that they have in
common is they all seem to be kind of lost

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,700
and dependent upon this thing being
real. Yeah. Instead of being objective.

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,290
There's only one lady that I interviewed
that saw big foot that really seemed to

42
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,160
be telling the truth,

43
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,940
but I think she saw bear bear's
walk on two feet all the time.

44
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,910
They do it all the time. It's video
footage. You can find it all the time.

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,480
And she was in the Pacific northwest,
which is incredibly dense woods.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,470
You see something, you'd glimpse
it. Look, I was hunting once in, in,

47
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:40,800
in Canada and Alberta, and I thought
I saw a wolf for like two seconds.

48
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:45,730
It was a squirrel. Okay, I understand
this. This is what does that note,

49
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,240
squirrel? Yeah. No, I just saw
far. Right. I saw it for and I was,

50
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,910
because it's really dense was cause I was
looking for fucking wolves cause I was

51
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:56,280
like,
cause I know we did see one wolf.

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,010
It crossed the road is either wolf or
coyote was hard to tell cause it was

53
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,660
at dusk. It was very dark out. But
um, when you're looking for something,

54
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,530
you think everything is that thing
you're looking for. Yeah. So for like a,

55
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,520
for a second, a huge thought that fucking
squirrel was a wolf. That's funny. Yeah.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,790
Well the expectation and perception
are very linked. Yes. Yes.

57
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,530
Well this is also that they've found that,
uh,

58
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,360
that 50% of everything you see is
a product of memory. Yes. That,

59
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:24,640
that when you observe something,
they've done FM,

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,970
FM ris and that most of the activity
in the brain is in the memory centers,

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,760
not in the, uh, visual speakers.

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,980
Only about 50% of the activities
and the visual centers of the brain.

63
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,380
That's crazy thing is
very, I, when I was a kid,

64
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,030
I went and saw Carl Sagan speak at u of
t at the University of Toronto and I was

65
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,864
like,
you know,

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,960
14 but he did an equation on the board
of the possibility of an alien life other

67
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:55,330
than us in the universe.
And it came to the smallest.

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,080
I mean he spent the whole time writing
on this chalkboard. It was fascinating.

69
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,720
They actually came up with a number
at the end and it was such a small,

70
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,740
he says there is,
there is something out there,

71
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,340
but they are so far away that they'll,

72
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,110
that unless they can go faster
than the speed of light,

73
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,080
which he said was impossible at the
time. Yeah. The Seventies. Yeah.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,750
Uh, there's no way we've seen
them. That's what he said.

75
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:30,730
So if some other beings have
conquered the speed of light thing,

76
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,950
then maybe we could see them.
Yeah.

77
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,430
But that's a thing with the exact problem
with his skepticism in general is like

78
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,920
that it, you know, like,
like the skeptics, skeptics
of the, of the 19th century,

79
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,560
the ones who said germs don't exist.
Right. Because we can't see them.

80
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,220
And people who've said germs did exist
were ridiculed and laughed out of the

81
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,360
trade. Right. And, um, I, I
agree with you completely.

82
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,940
Just because you can't see
it or it isn't happening.

83
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,110
It doesn't mean it can't happen.

84
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,150
And even since sagans day there had been
no exoplanets discovered then we now

85
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,780
know there are literally trillions and
trillions of sure planet earth like

86
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,460
planets.
Yeah.

87
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,670
Well they just speculated as to the
existence of them outside of our source

88
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:17,590
system before the, the real problem is
that if some, there's a leap and a leap,

89
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:22,591
a technological leap that opens the doors
to massive innovation that once this

90
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,630
happens,
once this happens in this,

91
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,810
and then all this stuff sort
of exponentially expands
in terms of technological

92
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,134
possibilities,

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,290
all you would need is a few hundred years
and you have an unrecognizable set of

94
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,120
technology. Yeah, sure. I mean
we were talking about certain,

95
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,140
I mean the whole anti matter idea that
they're still trying to figure out,

96
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,360
uh,
that's an insane sorts of energy.

97
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,390
You have never even experienced,
you know,

98
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,860
with them with a grain of sand. And
you can run a city and it was that big.

99
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,830
Yeah. And then there's also
the theory, there's reason one,

100
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:07,220
that space time itself doesn't exist.
So the,

101
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:11,830
the speed of light barrier
becomes moot because that is,

102
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,950
I guess it's the holographic
quantum hologram theory,

103
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,880
quantum holographic theory of
the universe, Talbot's book. Uh,

104
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,210
I can't remember holographic
universe, but it's, yeah, I think so.

105
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,630
But the idea that the universe is
basically just a geometry that,

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,990
that when you look at it from a certain
angle seems three dimensional and it

107
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:33,670
folds [inaudible] folds into itself.
So you could, and it's travel.

108
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,200
That's the wormhole thing. And it's not
even that, it's the idea that, that,

109
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,450
that space time is an
illusion is, uh, and that,

110
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,300
that it doesn't really exist. And
that's why, uh, you know, like, uh, uh,

111
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,010
entanglement is possible. You know,
the idea that, you know, spooky,

112
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:53,610
spooky action at a distance that
a quantum entanglement. Yeah.

113
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,950
But the reason that you know,
you know, uh, these, you know,

114
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:02,060
Adam's on opposite ends of the universe
can be affect each other instantaneously,

115
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,240
is cause they're not really at
an opposite ends of the universe.

116
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,320
They're really right next to each other.

117
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:09,380
It just seems like they're at opposite
ends of the universe because our ability

118
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:14,381
to perceive is basically based on what
we have to do to stay alive on this

119
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,430
planet. So our meager little
chimp brains, you have trying to,

120
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,270
trying to quantify all of these things
that are around us all the time.

121
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:27,900
So we put them into this sort of three
dimensional box of movement and distance

122
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,990
and that the entire,

123
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,500
the entire universe could be a
compact thing that projects itself,

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,960
like a hologram onto a screen.

125
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,690
I love these kinds of conversations
because I'm clearly too stupid to really

126
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,800
understand what I don't
understand anything I just
said and I don't understand

127
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:46,130
you too. So how stupid does that make
me? Well, we don't understand each other.

128
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,070
We're all the same.
Yeah, that's what I like.

129
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,610
I think it'd be interesting to do a
documentary or something about, uh,

130
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,791
about Ufo ology.

131
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,170
Cause if one thing is the assumption
that they're extra terrestrial is an

132
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:58,004
assumption,

133
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,270
but I think it intrigues me is
the power of ridicule to silence.

134
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,420
Even the most intelligent people in our
community from examining something like

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,200
the ridicule kept doctors
from accepting germs. Sure.

136
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,700
Because they didn't want to, they didn't
want to be ridiculed by their peers.

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,730
And even now you've got people that will,

138
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,800
like Michael Shermer will cling to the
most absurd explanations for phenomena

139
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:28,640
like the f 16 a radar
footage. Uh, what did he,

140
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,540
what was Michael Shermer, I can't even
remember, but it was, it was pretty,

141
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,560
it really went to great lengths
that entailed having to basically,

142
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,060
uh,

143
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,230
diminish any respect you had for any of
the people who reported on the events.

144
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,240
It had to go and had to go into character
assassination in order to eliminate it.

145
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,430
Yeah.
He was the best way to kill an idea.

146
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,670
He's a professional skeptic and I like
Michael a lot and he's been on the

147
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,160
podcast may times.
I actually had him debate Randall Carlson

148
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,390
and um,

149
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,420
Graham Hancock about these ancient
civilizations and it wasn't very good for

150
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,570
them. Like there's some clunky
moments cause skeptics are believers.

151
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,490
Well the problem is, Scott, the
problem is being a skeptic itself,

152
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,480
it's a stupid way to look at the world.
You're actually sure about something.

153
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,630
I mean, you shouldn't be objective,
right? It wouldn't, don't be skeptical.

154
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,970
Being skeptical is like, I don't know.
But I know for sure that that's not true.

155
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,370
But it serves a massive purpose for
people that really don't understand things

156
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,770
and he can explain it to you.
And with actual science,

157
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,130
as long as the actual science
is being used and it's not,

158
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:38,820
character assassination is not
mockery. It's not, it's not.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There's certain people
that are just debunkers,

160
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,660
they can call themselves skeptics, but
they're not looking at things like, oh,

161
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:49,620
maybe that is effective. Maybe that is
healthy. That is interesting. And No,

162
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,390
they don't look at it that way.
They're looking at,

163
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,070
they're trying to pick it apart.
And that's fine if you can pick it apart.

164
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,000
But if you cannot, you have to be
objective about the fact that, oh,

165
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,300
well this is a very interesting
phenomenon and this is what we know about

166
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,960
science is that, and this is what we know
about this thing. And right now we have,

167
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,900
we have a weird conundrum. Chariots
of the gods. And did he end up on kid?

168
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,880
Was He, was, he believed
that hundred percent.

169
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,780
He's all is still in all in. I asked
him, the first thing I asked him, I said,

170
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:23,080
what is desperately have to go
pee go. The first thing I, uh,

171
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,940
asked him was what is the most
compelling piece of evidence does that,

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,080
you know, and he pointed to this, um,

173
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,430
a Mayan stone plaque
that's in [inaudible].

174
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm gonna have you ever seen it? It's
a, it's in the book. Yeah. It's a, God,

175
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,360
uh, one of their, um,

176
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,470
one of their former kings that
is lying on his back and he's,

177
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:50,310
it looks like he's moving some, see
Jamie, see if we could find that thing.

178
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,830
It's just really cool,
uh,

179
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,870
carving that they found that looks
like there's a guy who is in a seat.

180
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,170
And it looks like there's fire
behind his back. And you could say,

181
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,070
you could say that he's manipulating
controls on a ship and he's, you know,

182
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,830
shooting a rocket into the heaven.
I would like to see what the s,

183
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,470
the mainstream version of that is. Because
it also, it could just be art, you know,

184
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,170
I'm imagining being, yeah,
it could be that they,

185
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,870
they knew about certain things being
propelled by fire. There it is. Yep.

186
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,130
That's it.
So if you see this,

187
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,440
I mean that's a big ass stretch
to say that guy's in a spaceship.

188
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,020
I don't know what the fuck that is. He's
sitting down Altera kind of. He could,

189
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,710
yeah, but it doesn't look
like he's looking through
an ips. Right. What's true,

190
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,510
but what does that mean? Is
it a telescope? Maybe he's
just kind of telescope,

191
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:44,790
but maybe they just an
astronomer. Yeah, it is possible.

192
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,320
I don't think they had telescopes.

193
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,560
I don't think it telescope
was even invented till, no.

194
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:52,260
Do they even have a glass
at that point? Oh No. Well,

195
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,760
I don't know if the Mayans did. Wow. But,

196
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,840
but that was his number one piece
of evidence was while Alan was like,

197
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:03,010
that's kind of silly when we were
kids in the seventies the, you know,

198
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,540
big foot,
you know,

199
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,710
and cherry to the gods and everything
was so new and look at this image,

200
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:09,970
look at the bottom of it.

201
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,640
Even the part where the flame supposed
to be coming out from below him.

202
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,080
Which Flint, where's the flame?
The flame is the shit. The very,

203
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:20,200
very bottom.
But I mean I'm not even sure I buy that.

204
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,320
If you were going to draw fire, you do a
really shitty job. If that's your fire,

205
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:29,170
that doesn't really look like fire
to me. Could be anything. Right?

206
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,880
If, if that's fire, like what is all the
stuff around them? What's all that stuff?

207
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,680
Is that, that looks kind of
mechanical though, right?

208
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,290
It looks like there's bolts does.
If they have a fire,

209
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,970
God maybe they drew the fire.
God,

210
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,440
it looks like a monkey kind of face
with titties. Monkey's got some titties.

211
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,770
Oh now I get it right. And then
the monkeys, is that his teeth?

212
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,890
It's the first tutors arms.
Actually it does. It could be armed.

213
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,750
But th that's the point is
it's so open to interpretation.

214
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,960
There's so much that you could
see if you're looking to see.

215
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,900
But what I do see is this guy who's,

216
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,340
he's reclining and chilling and it looks
like he's looking through something.

217
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,150
What's that thing hanging across him?
You see that thing across his arm.

218
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,430
But here's the thing, I don't think
anybody knows what the fuck that is.

219
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,910
But so for him to say that this was the
number one most compelling evidence,

220
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,630
I mean, where people getting
high at this point? Oh yeah.

221
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:28,180
So I mean that could be just some guy
got high and LSD. Yeah, they were,

222
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:32,740
they were taking different kinds of
plants that had like search like acid in

223
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:36,510
them. So what is this
obsessing? What is your,

224
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,210
your more recent obsessing about Ufo
is, what's the origin of this? Well,

225
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,640
part of it is just the fact that,
that the evidence,

226
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,600
just the evidence itself says you have
to take this seriously and yet no one

227
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,580
does a, or very, very few people
do. And even like I, again,

228
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:59,581
that f 16 footage that even Neil degrasse
Tyson who is a great skeptic said,

229
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,260
uh, on one of the late night
talk show, he said, well,

230
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:07,180
if you really want to look
at the possibility of some
a non human intelligence,

231
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,880
that f 16 stuff is pretty compelling.

232
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,740
What is the fcoe STD stuff?
That's the stuff that, uh,

233
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,220
to the stars academy put out. It
was the CIA Tom Delonge. He's crazy.

234
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,750
I had never met on the podcast.
Yeah, very nice guy. What do you see?

235
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,980
And he said she's a very nice guy and a
brilliant musician and he's a loon. Yeah,

236
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,860
I've never met a fucking full on believer.

237
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,570
He left blink one 82 to go do
this to the stars academy. Shit.

238
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,570
He's the biggest goddamn rock
band on the planet. Okay.

239
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Here's something interesting about
this and this was pointed out like by,

240
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,910
um,
okay.

241
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,820
Film video film by fighter jet shows
an unknown object near San Diego.

242
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,660
Video from 2004 was released by
the US Department of Defense. Um,

243
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,520
while the way it moves, there's something
about the way it moves is really weird.

244
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:59,120
Huh?

245
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,620
Jet Though one of the pilots told the you
immediate the object was not from this

246
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,960
world. Hmm. Yeah. And here's the thing,

247
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,320
it's like the skeptics in order to
dismiss that, they have to go, well,

248
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,210
if I have to make arguments like that,

249
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:14,300
jet fighters are not better
observers than anyone else.

250
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,190
Pull up Mick wards take on that mic ward,
the guy who he runs deep,

251
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,550
um, uh, what does it met?

252
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:25,220
A bunk metabolic can runs a debunking
site and he's another one of those guys

253
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:27,350
that is all in with the,

254
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,620
the conventional explanation goes way
out of his way to not look at anything

255
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:38,150
that could be yes, yes. Comes Razor says,

256
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,380
you know that if you have to go to great
lengths to dismiss something, right,

257
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,181
that's not falling.

258
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:48,710
OCKHAM's razor razor says if
the jet pilot says he saw this,

259
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:51,680
he saw it. I think he had an
interesting take on it though.

260
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:56,060
And one of the things is there's a time
during the video where the pilot shifted

261
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:58,370
from one x to two x,

262
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,530
which makes the image a move more
because you're, you have magnification.

263
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,320
Like have you ever use
magnifying glasses by knows?

264
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,490
Like if you use a 15 x by knows it's
very difficult to hold on the sec yet,

265
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,450
but six six you can kind of look at
things in the distance. Yeah. But that's,

266
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:19,100
if you don't have about about $3 million
worth of stabilization equipment on

267
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:23,750
your jet and walked onto this object,
right. Which is why that stays in Loc.

268
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,900
He had an explanation then that was kind
of interesting and when it breaks free

269
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,630
of the lock and how does
that got unbelievable.

270
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,210
But can you just take off or something
like that? It just, at one point,

271
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:36,320
just the opposite, just breaks free
the lock. And that's almost impossible.

272
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,430
I have a clad sound possible for
anything that manage bills to do what?

273
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:44,510
The quality of cameras today.
Why is this footage so shitty?

274
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,310
Uh, that this is infrared footage?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you need this?

275
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,600
When you're shooting at things in the sky,

276
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:54,050
you can't rely on [inaudible]
when you're looking at heat.

277
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,760
We can't heat signatures visually.
It's so far. It's so far.

278
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,570
It would be gaming the rabbit hole.

279
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,650
How to debunk conspiracy theories
using fact logic and was just so,

280
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,210
what is he saying? What is he saying? Uh,

281
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:08,900
the program [inaudible] a little
larger for my stupid dies.

282
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,920
Said a for all. He made sure you
were talking about the right video.

283
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:16,610
There's two that are confused here.
We're talking about the gimbal video,

284
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:19,880
which is not from the Nimitz incident.
Just discussed here.

285
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,890
So scroll down a little bit.
Uh,

286
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,390
the gimbal video is an okay. Yeah,
that's the one we're looking at.

287
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,560
It's an unknown date and location
from an up from unknown pilots. Nope.

288
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,540
The tick tock one. Some cells
pilots. Yeah, that's 2004. Okay.

289
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,030
That's David Fervor of the media
is discussed. These videos,

290
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,770
Tom Delonge to the stars. The link
contains the frames. What's he saying?

291
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,080
Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
Uh, the black shape on the object.

292
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,310
Some kind of infrared flare

293
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,150
glare. We know that the shape of
a very bright infrared source,

294
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
like the engine of a plane can be
much bigger than the object itself is

295
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:01,740
explained here. Okay, so this is like a
flare. That's a little, explain the mood.

296
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,410
It doesn't explain. Again I'll
comes razor is, okay, so this guy,

297
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,590
this guy is saying it
looks nothing like it.

298
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,800
Well even if it is a jet, a jet is not
capable of breaking free from the lock.

299
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:18,840
Right? So lock onto it.
And if you look at that,

300
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,780
you can see the jet and his own example.

301
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,890
Debunks is debunking need not be moving.
Yeah.

302
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,270
The video need not be moving.

303
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,720
The assumption that that this guy doing
probably a few hours research has come

304
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:38,100
up with something that is more credible
than a trained fighter pilot who was

305
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,620
there and visually seeing it.
What do you think have been tracking?

306
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,060
If you had to guess? I don't
know. Let's get crazy. Oh I
would. I think it is. It is.

307
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,620
It is an intelligent craft is a
craft being piloted intelligently.

308
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,290
Why aren't they talking to us?
We're fucking apes.

309
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:58,150
And why would you go and talk to us?
We're assholes when you look at it. Yeah,

310
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,430
I forgot. You're right.
Leaving fucking plastic straws
everywhere. Oh, we cured it.

311
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:06,480
No more plastic straws. When you're
a kid looking at a, an ant colony,

312
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:11,280
you didn't go listen to me aunts. Yes. You
just looked at them, you know, there was,

313
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,400
and they said, why? Why don't they
go to the White House? We said, well,

314
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:18,510
why would do when you look at an ant
colony go, I must speak to the queen.

315
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes. No, I've always said he
was looking at ants. Yeah.

316
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:26,610
That's what the most ridiculous
thing about like the old movies,

317
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,500
like the old movies, it would land on
the White House lawn, right? Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,520
That's it. Yeah. Burrata nickname,
whatever that thing was. Yeah.

319
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,800
Clock Lot to burrata. I'd like to
talk nick too. Yeah, that's the, uh,

320
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,200
a day or two still was like,

321
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,840
is that 1940 or 50 50 50 50 fucking great.

322
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,500
Great movie. I watched it really recently
because it's a terrible variables.

323
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,310
A little bit, right. The stories are
great. He was a Christ pair of, well,

324
00:19:56,311 --> 00:20:00,360
his name is John Carpenter.
Oh, I see. That's right.

325
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,450
It was a carpenter shoot
that object out of his hand.

326
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,830
The first second he pulls it out.

327
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:07,230
I remember he has a thing that's
going to cure cancer. They shoot him,

328
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:10,060
they shoot him, they shoot it
out of his hand to meeting him.

329
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,980
And then at the end of the movie he is a,
he is killed and resurrected.

330
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,000
That's right. Right. Yeah. They
shoot him. He's taken the robot.

331
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,550
The robot. That robot robot.
Yeah. Very tall. Yeah.

332
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,560
And like he looks like you would
want a robot to look in 1950.

333
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,150
Yes. Yeah. All metal and shits
moves. Yeah. Chrome. Yeah.

334
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,810
Those,

335
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,260
those were the days we thought that they
would communicate like it wasn't there

336
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:41,810
a whole rash of them that we're seeing
over Washington DC. Yeah, there was, yeah.

337
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:42,930
There was dozens,

338
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,830
dozens of Ufos tracked and admitted by
the government that they were tracking

339
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:50,020
them and watching them.
But they, uh, essentially,

340
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,540
and then at the end of their
explanation was, yeah. Nothing,

341
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,090
nothing particularly important.
You know,

342
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:58,060
we have a mutual friend who
claims won't say her name,

343
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:02,020
but she called and I wrote her off as
a lunatic when I first started. Yeah,

344
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:07,021
well she was claimed to be adopted and
then I was doing a show with her years

345
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,960
ago and she just telling us
the story. We're all like
a, Huh, that's pretty funny.

346
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:15,550
And she says it and they took a scoop
out of my back and I'm like a scoop.

347
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,630
They took a scoop out of your back
and she showed on her back shoulder.

348
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,920
There was a hexagon,
old diamond shaped scoop out of her back.

349
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:30,100
Uh, a divot that hexagon.
Yeah. That was clearly,

350
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,400
clearly and no scar tissue. Maybe she's
a crazy bitch. No scar tissue, man.

351
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,580
Yeah, give myself a little punch,
but I hole punch back there.

352
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,230
Worked at a bookstore at the time years
ago and I went into the alien section

353
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,330
was the world's biggest bookstore
in Toronto. It was the name of it.

354
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,810
And of course I went to the alien
section and just look all this crap up

355
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,810
immediately.
And there are other people with the scope.

356
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,340
Well there's a lot of other people with,
you know,

357
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,350
abduction stories and some of them have
like little pieces of something in their

358
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,710
body. I remember you talking to me about
this many, many years ago. I was like, oh,

359
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,470
well Dave's interested.
It was like implants.

360
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:09,040
You're talking about people that have
alien implants in their body. Yeah.

361
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,230
And that's the thing is,
to me it's just,

362
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,540
I guess the thing that I'm kind of
obsessed with now is just the cause we're

363
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,880
comedians. Yes. And the
power of ridicule, uh,

364
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,060
to silence, debate is
unbelievably potent. Sure.

365
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,990
And we're part of that. We're part
of the machinery that was used very,

366
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:33,850
very consciously by the
government to silence any inquiry.

367
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,010
You know, it was like, you
know, feeding it, you know,

368
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,670
feeding the story the right way
to late night talk show hosts,

369
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,760
made it so that nobody
would talk about it.

370
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,630
So do you think that the government
consciously fed those ideas to like Johnny

371
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,470
Carson and those folks? There's
documentation of a, of a pro, you know,

372
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,530
of that they, you know, to, uh,

373
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,160
to make the UFO phenomena ridiculous.

374
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,600
Do you think they did that to avoid
mass hysteria? Like if you are,

375
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,980
you're the government and you know,
there's nothing out there,

376
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,130
but you see these people freaking
out and go, okay, look, we've looked,

377
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:08,230
we've used all of our military might,

378
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:12,190
all of our scientific power and we
don't see shit. I'm not buying this,

379
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,330
but these people were freaking out.

380
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:16,330
This has the real potential to get
out of hand and go sideways on us.

381
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,990
Let's just start making fun of
this. Yeah. I don't know. Cause, uh,

382
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,350
I think it's more likely that there's
something there that they feel powerless

383
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:24,184
to control.

384
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,330
Do you think Kennedy was taken down into
the basement of whatever and shown the

385
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:33,331
alien sitting there and what I say
about aliens with in regards to Trump,

386
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,660
if there's anybody that would
fucking tell us it's hair,

387
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,950
he tweeted it tweeted immediately
tweet it. Tweet economic aliens.

388
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,140
You Fo's are real. But
CNN is fake. Yeah, yeah,

389
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,230
yeah.

390
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,230
It's still the failing New York Times
sales define you at Bose right back at

391
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,700
area 51.
If the government does have the evidence,

392
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,550
they're never going to show it to Trump.
That's the problem.

393
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:05,010
Like what the fuck's the point being
president if you can't find it. Yeah.

394
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,200
If I knew that to become president
meant you get all the access to Ufos,

395
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:13,010
I might go. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So
very good. I'm going to try for that.

396
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,680
The presidents who have tried haven't
gotten there. No, no one gets it.

397
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,790
Like Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter
said he was, he, he's, he
had a Ufo experience. Yeah.

398
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,190
He saw something, right? Yeah.
He said he saw something,

399
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,390
but see that was back in the 70s
where everybody was seeing shit.

400
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,890
They were all talking about things was
part of the zeitgeists people were legit,

401
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,780
like after close encounters
of the third kind,

402
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:36,410
especially people who legitimately
thinking that aliens were going to come.

403
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,100
Yeah.

404
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,950
He proposed such a possible
scenario and that movie was so good.

405
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,040
Yeah. Anything you expected it was going
to be. But like I was going to say,

406
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,040
here's like another example
is like the Rendlesham, like,

407
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,520
like that explanation of the
sixteens locked, you know, footage,

408
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,040
uh,
like Rendlesham forest where the,

409
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,070
they claimed that these American
soldiers in the woods, out in England,

410
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,610
uh,
mistook the light,

411
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:09,611
a light house light for a spacecraft
that they were within 20 feet of a craft

412
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:15,050
that they saw and took notes on
different lines of yeah. They walk,

413
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,670
not even like right up against it.

414
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,320
And he wrote down notes all like different
set of hieroglyphs on the ship itself

415
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,230
described it's, you know,
described the, the feel of it,

416
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,240
this electrostatic feel
of being around it.

417
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,930
And the official
explanation was they missed,

418
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:34,610
took a lighthouse several
miles away for this spacecraft.

419
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,950
So I'll comes razor against us.

420
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,870
That's hard to believe that these trained
observers and that's the other thing.

421
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,480
They always tried to dismiss the idea
that trained observers are better

422
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:48,650
observers. Um, but they
are better observers. Sure.

423
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,860
In the age of today where everyone has a
high definition camera in their pocket.

424
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,420
Have you taken, have you taken a
photograph of the moon on your,

425
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,650
on your phones comes out sick? It doesn't
look like the moon. What's true, right.

426
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:06,620
There's no details. It comes out of
the lung. The lenses are too wide, but,

427
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,430
but I'll comes. Razors has all right,
they saw something but they, you know,

428
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,080
cause what is the likelihood that trained
observers who have been on this base

429
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:19,730
for years on this night would mistake a
lighthouse that they've seen every night

430
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,520
for the entire time they've
been on this base for a Ufo?

431
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,740
I mean, what is the likelihood
that that explanation is correct?

432
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,930
I'm not aware of that store. Oh,
Rendlesham forest. Yeah. How'd he say it?

433
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:35,750
Bent Woods. Uh, Rendlesham and r. E n d.

434
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,850
L. E. S. H. A. M. Rendlesham
forest bandwidths.

435
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,940
It was two nights to get character
actor on Colombo. Where are you up for?

436
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,410
You have an of his own and
it's a nuclear installations.

437
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,970
Rendlesham forest and nuclear
installations are always
ripe with Ufo stories.

438
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,040
Yeah. What year was this? Ah,
this was in the 80s. Yeah.

439
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,250
Mm. Interesting. And it's,
you know, and it said,

440
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,010
obviously the obvious explanation
is we're not the expert. You're,

441
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:05,010
the only thing you can accept is that
these observers saw something. Right.

442
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:07,830
You described it accurately.
Is it something that had crashed,

443
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:11,400
if you want to say that? No,
it came down was, was, uh,

444
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,340
landed in the forest and,
and took off.

445
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,070
What do you think of the [inaudible]
case the night before that? Roswell.

446
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,300
I think it's probably true where
he'll, you're all in. Yeah.

447
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,990
Well David on about it.
But I mean, because the
interesting again, because the,

448
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,830
because the cover stories for our so
much less believable than an alien. Yeah.

449
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,180
I just, I would joke about it. Yeah.

450
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:36,030
They put it on the paper that they've
recovered a crashed Ufo and alien bodies

451
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,990
and the next day set up,
we made a mistake. It was
just a balloon. What about,

452
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,050
what about the aliens? Those Mexicans,
Mexicans, they were drinking,

453
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,930
apparently they thought the
balloon was opinion, Yada.

454
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,740
They got a little crazy in right now.
But, uh, we just invented some new stuff.

455
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,610
Yeah. Out of nowhere. And then 30
years later they go, oh, we were,

456
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,760
they were high altitude a dummies
that we were dropping. That's right.

457
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:04,320
To test how they would fall. And that
was, we have lasers and visibility cloaks.

458
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,110
Well the, they showed up again the next
day with a bunch of weather balloons,

459
00:28:09,111 --> 00:28:12,180
scraps and they're like, look,
this is what the guy holding it up.

460
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,990
Like what they don't tell you is that
they flew the wreckage out to Wright

461
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,350
Patterson air force in two separate planes
and the Truman met them there. Yeah,

462
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,350
yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah,

463
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,710
the more rational who separate planes
because they were worried that one would

464
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:27,570
crash the,
the weather,

465
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,560
the weather balloon thing is not as
rational as something weird happened.

466
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,570
I listen to, I want it to be alien
so bad. Oh, I questioned myself.

467
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,400
So that's my problem. I want to do that
stuff. But I again, I, I won't, like,

468
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,650
I'll be skeptical about stuff that just
seems crazy or people that, you know,

469
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:45,484
Billy,
you know,

470
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,620
sort of ascribe some sort of metaphysical
explanation for all of his, uh, my,

471
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,480
my thing is just,
well,

472
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,930
if the preponderance of the evidence
says something happened but doesn't tell

473
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:58,110
you what happened right, then you still
have to believe something happened.

474
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:02,010
Not knowing what happened isn't evidence
that it didn't happen and yet you're

475
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:06,150
still a flat earthers. Yeah.
Have you looked outside?

476
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,650
It's seems fly.
Yeah.
