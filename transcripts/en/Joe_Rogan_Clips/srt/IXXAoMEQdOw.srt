1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,900
Hello Freak bitches. A amazing
pace. Sodas. You look at guys,

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:09,580
you know Jon Jones has good cardio.
Very good cardio. Yeah. Might be EPL.

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,660
We'll figure it out.
I was on when you're talking about that,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,210
can't trust anything disappointing.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,980
Was that how disappointing that
broke my heart. John John's dude,

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,690
you broke my heart, dude. Jamie
sent it to me. I was at a universal,

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,710
my wife and my kids. I know Dallas,
Texas with you because what was I doing?

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,580
Uh, I forget. Oh, I think, oh,

9
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:34,390
I was working for showtime and I
have my phone and then I, I look at,

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,790
I have 70 Miss Techs and 23 minutes
called like, what the fuck out?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,340
It's someone that likes
own, died. Oh No. Who Died?

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,450
And I look and it's like John Jones,
like someone might as well go, hi.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,700
Jamie sent it to me. I
thought it was a show. Me Too.

14
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:49,220
I thought the people were messing with
me. I looked at my phone, I was like,

15
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:52,220
this is no one that you sent to me. I,
you're the first one I take someone.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,230
Is this real? You went? Yes. Well my
heart John Snow. Once you start talking,

17
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,830
once he started talking back and forth
with the golden snitch that gone snitch,

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,580
there's zero jokes there.
And listen,

19
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:08,480
when the golden snitch comes out with
something Dave brand that pisser through a

20
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:11,750
ton of tests. It's not
like a, it's not fake news.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,230
His was his shit. Apparently
a court, well hold on.

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,970
I don't think I can say this
right cause I had an expert.

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,510
I talked with an expert about this drug
and he fucking dropped some knowledge on,

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,480
okay, this is what I've
heard. This may not,

25
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,450
may or may not be true because this is
the reason why I don't tell you to say

26
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:31,940
this cause I'm, I'm
not, I'm not 100% aware.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,980
Maybe we can find some
information online available.

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,190
What I had heard is that this
drug is not detectable in blood,

29
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,790
that it's a drug that's detectable in
urine and they have to in a new test,

30
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,470
right. The test, is it a new task?

31
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,120
What from what I heard too is the
Usada is they have a new test.

32
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:52,220
I'll see the on announcing,
hey, we're doing this now.

33
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:56,100
Everyone welcome to the party.
And this drug was also, it's,

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,890
it's very common around power lifters
cause you can use in competition and by

35
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:04,660
the time you get tested after
it has, uh, hours, a half life.

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,620
So shelf life is super short,

37
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,360
but you take it and make you super
aggro and strong. So they, and they go,

38
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,890
it's so hard to obtain legally.
Most everyone gets a black market.

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,770
And when you get a black market,
you don't know where it's coming from.

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,671
And a lot of time,

41
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,530
and this happens with a lot of
power lifters in their athletes,

42
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:22,700
when they test hot for this,

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,910
it's because they got a bad batch
or something else mixed into it. Oh,

44
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,040
this is gone from my super knowledgeable
dude who knows about it. Oh,

45
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,770
it makes you anger all huh?
The confidence. Yeah. Oh,

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,230
and he goes in it, it lasts maybe
an hour, maybe two hours Max.

47
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,630
And that's how your
system, he goes, he goes,

48
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:46,160
so that makes sense by some
would fail directly after
cause it, no, no, no, no, no,

49
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,890
no. He, he, he failed after the weigh in.

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:49,930
Okay.

51
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,840
That's when he failed. This is after
the weigh in? I don't think so.

52
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,470
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll either way. Yeah.

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,000
Well maybe it's like lingering.

54
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,030
Well that's what he's saying better
what he's saying. He's saying well,

55
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:07,210
but also I heard that they would use
a new test to maybe someone gave him a

56
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:11,080
tainted sandwich. Maybe some tainted take
pills. Either way. You broke my heart.

57
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,370
I'm off. I'm off the train. I'm off the
God damn train and I'm sick of though.

58
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:18,910
We have no idea what happened. It was just
Dick Pills. I'm like, I'm out. I'm out.

59
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,530
How dare you? Well, is he offering up any
possible scenario for what happened? No.

60
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,770
He tweeted out like, this is when
I find out who my real friends are.

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Hashtag blessed boy, fuck that noise.
That sounds like you're feeling sorry.

62
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,120
She's just ain't helping me out of
this one. So much to be grateful for.

63
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,440
Well have seed money, but yeah, that's a
good amount. Yeah, he's got a nice family.

64
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,730
It's true. Good friends. Hopefully
whatever. Whatever the fuck is happening.

65
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,490
But here's the thing, man,
they have a second fire. Joe,

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,340
listen to it multiple times.
Sada,

67
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,850
since the golden snitch has been around
and he's a motherfucker. I liked the guy.

68
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:55,070
But if you're a fighter, he's
a motherfucker. Well, hey,

69
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:57,770
he's doing exactly what
he's supposed to do.

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,430
[inaudible] circle doing
the sport baseball first.

71
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,160
Now you're hitting all the fighters are
ruining it because they know what the

72
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:09,020
fucking parameters are. Now let's have
some fun. I agree. I agree. I don't look,

73
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,290
look, here's the thing about this fight.
Do you think Dana's ever like God,

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,290
what kind of testing was done for this
boy? Maybe where the Conor McGregor fight.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,860
Okay.

76
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,650
I those new lights. What do you, what do
you, I like what you're doing the place,

77
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:23,130
man. You know what man? I
like the curtains, right?
When I pulled the new studio,

78
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,830
I'm going to do the curtains.
Yeah, you should, man. Uh, yeah,

79
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:30,060
but Novitsky is a guy that you
don't want on your bad side. Oh No.

80
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,590
But do you ever think days like,
Damn Bro, relax me. Hired Joe.

81
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:38,100
But Jesus, they knew what they were
getting into. And you know what,

82
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,410
they just decided, this is only
one way to clean up the sport.

83
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,640
Bring in the guy who was the very best to
catching people for doing drugs. Ma'Am,

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
ma'am, ma'am, did they do? And
here's the thing, Jon Jones,

85
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,590
since you saw us coming in,
he's failed three out of four tests.

86
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,220
The only one he did a full line
was a co Osp. Coke is coke.

87
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,460
Coke is coke pro. Once,
Oh, so that's fine.

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,220
Okay.
