1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,960
Now, what did you think when he said
that we're going to pull out a Syria?

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,840
Well, first of all, yeah, yeah.
They just had that, uh, we've,

3
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:14,110
we've lost some servicemen up
in northern Syria today, um,

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,640
today as a result of a bombing up there.
Yeah. Isis has taken credit for it.

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:22,440
So there, there was a, uh, patrol
and we, and we've got roughly 2000,

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,890
uh, personnel in Syria.
And for the most part,

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,780
what are they doing there where they're
providing a guidance training? Um,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,260
they're assisting with targeting,
uh, uh, and because the,

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,390
the air power is incredibly important
over there right now. And so we are, uh,

10
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,820
our personnel are,
uh,

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,720
very much involved in selection
of identification of targets, uh,

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,610
for the air campaign. And, um,

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,190
so we have these 2000 troops here.
President says he's going to withdraw.

14
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,280
And then then some of the members of
administration started walking that dog

15
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:00,180
back, right. And saying, man, I know
it may not happen right away, but yeah,

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:00,720
they just,

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,710
there was just a routine patrol if
there this never really such thing as a

18
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:09,270
routine patrol, but there's a
patrol, um, and it got hit. Uh,

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,390
the military is not releasing a lot of
details because they haven't finished

20
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:15,170
notifying next to kin, but, um,

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,250
numbers so far indicate
possibly for service, um, uh,

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,330
lost. Um, and that's going to refocus,

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,320
I think Congress and hopefully the White
House on what the hell is going on.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,260
The problem I've got with it
is in terms of withdrawing,

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,820
look, we could stay there forever
and not accomplish the task, right?

26
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:43,380
If the task is to finally, uh,
defeat whatever that means,

27
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,410
uh, radical Islamic
jihadists, uh, Isis, uh,

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,620
that shit's never going to happen.
Not In our lifetimes.

29
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:56,940
We're not going to get rid of that
mentality, that, that ideology, uh,

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,540
the sort of what seems to be sometimes
a bottomless well of recruits that they

31
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:05,340
can draw on their ability to morph
into something else as al Qaeda did,

32
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,540
um, over, depending on how successful
we are in a campaign against them,

33
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,540
they're like, you know, again, it's,
it's, it's, you know, it's like, you know,

34
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,670
step on roaches over here
and they pop up over here.

35
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,420
So I think it's the, the, the,

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,940
the biggest problem I've got is,
is that if we leave, we're not,

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,360
we're not, um, you know,

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,790
it's not like we're engaged in firefights
everyday with isis over there. Right.

39
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:34,710
We've left that to our allies and our
allies in most part up there in the north

40
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,090
of Syria are the Kurds.

41
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,530
The Kurds have been our allies in one
way or another in that part of the world

42
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,560
for a long time now.
And it played a very important role.

43
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,150
And we have not been
particularly honorable over the,

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,000
over the years in terms of how sometimes
we deal with them. If we walk out,

45
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,100
if we leave, then uh, Irwin, you know,

46
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,963
the head of Turkey,

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,990
I guarantee you we'll be in there in
short order to kill as many of them as

48
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:06,991
possible because that's just what the
Turkish authorities are going to till they

49
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,160
honestly,
uh,

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,820
that they couldn't be happier with the
announcement that we're going to leave

51
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,170
because that opens the door for them
to then go in there and from their

52
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,620
perspective, stamp out the Kurdish
alliance that have been our allies.

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,940
We're the only thing our presence at small
presence, you know, not minimizing it,

54
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:28,510
but it, you know, 2000 troops has been
what's prevented them from doing that.

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,960
So that's,
that's the number one issue I've got.

56
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,961
The other is I have no idea why any
president or vice president or anybody in,

57
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,640
in the government ever,
not this,

58
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,400
this administration or any
administration ever thinks it's a,

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,660
it's a good idea to say
we've defeated the enemy. Uh,

60
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,340
when we're talking about radical Islam,

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,340
we've seen it over and over again
from previous administration,

62
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:54,250
from the Bush administration.
Every time they say, you
know, we were, we've done it,

63
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,270
mission accomplished, mission
accomplished, we beaten
al Qaeda, we beat nicest.

64
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,630
That's it. There's no upside to
saying that. Shut the fuck up.

65
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,250
Stop saying things like that. It's again,
it's a self inflicted wound at the,

66
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,330
because now what's happening.
Yeah.

67
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,060
The media is not focused on the
fact that we've lost servicemen.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,010
They're focused on, well, just, uh,

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,070
just the other day the president said
we defeated Isis and the vice president

70
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,170
today said the same thing.
Now look what's happened.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,360
There's no benefit to saying that. And,
and, and it's not going to happen anyway.

72
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,220
So, so the goal of being over
there is to assist our allies,

73
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:32,221
but also to make sure that these radical
factions don't become more powerful and

74
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,950
then eventually affect us and attack us.

75
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,610
And so we can keep an eye on what they're
planning, what they're doing. Is that,

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,670
is that an accurate

77
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,750
yeah, it is. It, it, it's, it's, it's
exactly it. I mean, if you look at, uh,

78
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,040
the reason we went into Afghanistan,
right, if we go back all those years,

79
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,320
Holy Shit.
Uh,

80
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,220
and that was because the Taliban allowed,

81
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,950
um,

82
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,950
al Qaeda to establish a beachhead in
there for training and for communications

83
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,960
and for finance and for plotting and
planning attacks outside of Afghanistan

84
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:13,310
against us and our allies.
That's why we went in there,

85
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:17,120
aside from just seeking revenge,
I see, was to route that out.

86
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,650
We then stayed,
you know,

87
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,450
thinking somehow we were going to turn
the tide of history and create some

88
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:26,720
pseudo federal democracy. So
that didn't, that didn't work.

89
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,090
But the reason now for
being in Syria is yes, we,

90
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,950
we have done a very solid
job of beating back isis,

91
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,240
removing their territory and
degrading their ability to operate.

92
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,140
But we haven't stamp them out. We haven't
defeated them yet. They're still there.

93
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,730
And so we've been providing
the support and the, again
in the form of, uh, weapons,

94
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:54,610
hardware, gear of resources,
training, and most importantly a comp,

95
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,740
uh, combat air operations, air. And, um,

96
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,430
that's been critically important.
If we leave,

97
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,720
I have no doubt that isis will
find some way to rejuvenate,

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,050
maybe not in its current form, but, and
maybe not in the same exact locations,

99
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,120
but they don't morph cause
that's what they do. They just,

100
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,470
they just find a way to adapt.

101
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,550
And we already know what's happened in
the past when we, when we left Iraq,

102
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:23,080
we saw what happened with the
rise of Isis. So, you know,

103
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,750
do I want to stay there forever?
Absolutely not.

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,740
But both sides can make a valid argument.
One for Stang,

105
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,390
one for leaving my, I think the
best argument for staying in the,

106
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,990
in the certainly short and midterm is to
ensure that Erdowan doesn't slaughter a

107
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:43,910
bunch of Kurds who have been working
with us. Uh, honorably. Um, you know,

108
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,130
I don't know how else to say that.
So we'll see what happens. I,

109
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,940
the best argument to stay is to protect
the people that helped us to protect our

110
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:53,980
allies. Yeah. Yeah.

111
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,440
So it's not in our best interest is in
the best interest of our commitment and

112
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,670
our agreement with them.

113
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,030
Well as is it in our national security
interest to, to stay in Syria for example.

114
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,500
Look, right, there was this,

115
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,380
there's so many levels to this thing
and I'm sure right now everybody's

116
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,960
listening going off. Fuck Sake. He's not
going to disappear down a rabbit hole,

117
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:16,940
but, but uh, yes, I am. Uh, eh. For
a while there, there was this, this,

118
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:17,721
this idea,

119
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:20,510
this was ridiculous pie in the sky
thought that we were going to get the

120
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:24,380
Russians out of Syria.
Never going to fucking happen.

121
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,870
Russian said the only port for their
Black Sea fleet is in Syria. You know,

122
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,860
w w they've been there for decades and
decades along with Iran. We're not,

123
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,990
it's not going to happen unless we want
to go to war with Russia to kick them

124
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,820
out of Syria.
That's not in our best interest.

125
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,360
So is it in our national security
interest to keep troops there,

126
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:44,300
to fight and try to minimize
Russian involvement in Syria?

127
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,320
I don't think so because we're not going
to shift them off that dime without

128
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,280
going directly at them. Right. It's
in their best interest to stay.

129
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,030
And every nation accidents own best
interest. Are we going to shift Iran?

130
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,700
Are we going to keep Iran from
forming but too late for that?

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,760
They've already got a beachhead there
that they're not going to give up.

132
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,630
And so he got to set those
issues aside and say, well,

133
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,160
what the hell are we doing there? Oh we,
oh we there simply because we have to,

134
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,690
you know, finish the fight
against Isis. Well, I, you know,

135
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:18,720
at some point you gotta say, you know, I
guess I wouldn't say that we've, we're,

136
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,020
we've defeated them, but I
think we would say, yeah,

137
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:25,100
we've degraded them sufficiently that we
can, we can now operate from elsewhere.

138
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:25,911
You know,

139
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:29,410
we can operate from forward basis in
other locations where we're currently,

140
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,770
you know, based. Great. But again, I
keep coming back to the same thing that,

141
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,140
you know, we've, we've
worked with the Kurds.

142
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,590
Is this in our national security
interest? Well, no, I guess it's not,

143
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,590
but there's something that tells
me it's the right thing to do.

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,100
And maybe sometimes that's
enough, you know, that we should,

145
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:50,630
we should not let [inaudible] have his
way and also longterm wouldn't it be in

146
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,950
our best interest to honor our
commitment and make sure that we,

147
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,250
our allies

148
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,460
so that in the future other allies would
be more willing to cooperate with us

149
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:04,110
because they understand
that once we're committed,

150
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,580
we're fully committed and we stay
and we stand for something. Yeah.

151
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,000
So what's the benefit of getting out?
Like the people that see,

152
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:14,010
I think we should get out. Like when,
when Trump said he wanted to pull out,

153
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,090
like what's his thinking?

154
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,220
I don't think it runs particularly deep.
I think it just, I think it's, you know,

155
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,340
uh, during the campaign
he talked about, you know,

156
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,040
stopping the endless wars popular
concept right now again, nobody wants to,

157
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,490
I mean, what the hell? I mean, I know.
And so it will be interesting to see,

158
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,830
you know, what today's sad, you know,
event does up on Capitol Hill, you know,

159
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,850
do they, do they rethink their, the,

160
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
the withdrawal or do they accelerate it?

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,900
So like when they had the buildup in Iraq
and it was highly criticized but then

162
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:48,010
it was very effective, like it did do
what they intended it to do. Right.

163
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,640
And it did knock back the enemy.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,810
If they decided to ramp it up worldwide,

165
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,250
would that be a solution to
any of this or is the opposite,

166
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,230
is it better to actually ramp up our
defenses domestically and just stay the

167
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:06,670
fuck away from all of these people?

168
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,840
Yeah.
Well eventually you can only,

169
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:13,860
I mean you can only do so much I
think on the domestic front. Um,

170
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,230
and then, uh, you know, if,

171
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,830
if they gained sufficient
ability and strength,

172
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,640
we've seen that from past attacks, I
think then, then they'll come after you,

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,320
they'll come after us. And that's just
the way I suppose that's going to work.

174
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:32,970
But I don't disagree with the notion
because it's, it is hard pressed. I look,

175
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,160
I wouldn't have stayed in Afghanistan.
Frankly,

176
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,520
I don't care whether they've increased
their literacy rate by 2% or built

177
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,710
another road or whatever. It
doesn't matter. They don't,

178
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:44,080
they don't know what the hell we're trying
to sell them. Right. So I don't, uh,

179
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,840
I'm not against the notion of getting out,
but this one's a tough one.

180
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,210
I guess that's what I'm saying is,
is that the Syria issue is,

181
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,410
I'm real conflicted on because of the
Kurds and what they've done on our behalf

182
00:10:55,411 --> 00:11:00,390
in the past and how they've suffered and
knowing, uh, going years and years back,

183
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,280
you know, having dealt with that
issue, uh, two and a half decades ago,

184
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,920
a long time ago with
the Turks and the Kurds,

185
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,070
knowing how vicious that could be a,

186
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,370
and I don't trust her to Juan as far
as I could throw them on a window. So,

187
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,520
you know, I think there's a
problem there that we need to,

188
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,180
we need to make sure we've talked through
thoroughly before we just say, sure,

189
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,650
let's get them out of there.
You know, what the hell? Yeah.

190
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,260
We shouldn't have them there
and we shouldn't be there.

191
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,070
But like everything else it gets,
it's complicated.

192
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,290
You would like to think that what they're
having conversations like this up on

193
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,910
Capitol Hill, you know, between the
parties, uh, Republicans in the dems,

194
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,050
but I don't think they are.
