1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,140
Yeah. So what other animals
are you looking for? A lot.

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,250
Like we were talking about primates.

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,860
I'm going to Borneo to look for
an animal called the millers,

4
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:11,430
grizzled nine gear to a type
of monkey. Um, I just got back,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,310
I was looking for an extinct Cayman
in the Amazon think Cayman. Yeah.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,550
What's the difference between that
and the Cayman's that you see?

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,780
A just a different species. You know,
just like there's many types of crocodile.

8
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:24,510
There's nine types of Cayman, you
know, you have salt, water, crocodiles.

9
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,740
Now Crocodiles, same
thing with Cayman. Um,

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,360
and I was looking for one with a
very weird morphological variants.

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,710
It looks very, very different
to any other, um, what's,
what's different about it?

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,340
It's got a very elongated snout.
Um, if you've ever seen a gharial,

13
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:41,370
if you know what that is, a type of
crocodile with this long crazy knows.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,000
It's like the alligator family that
came and family version of that,

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,720
this really long, skinny face, super
light, super yellow coloration,

16
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:49,531
just very different.

17
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:53,850
Last time one was seen was 52 years ago
and then they had one in a zoo that died

18
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:58,320
in the 80s. And nobody's found one since.
Um, so just really cool. And so yeah,

19
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:59,670
the list goes on. You know, I,

20
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:04,350
last year I did leopards and I did wolves
in Newfoundland and a bunch of really

21
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:07,380
interesting stuff. So it's fun, man.
You love it. You should come with,

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,180
talk to animal planner. Scared. I'm
such a pussy. Um, what about uh,

23
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,460
giants loss?
What are your feelings on those?

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,530
So I've had probably three
years of research into this,
into giant slots because,

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,580
uh, Matt Nannup poor agree,
I believe is how it's said.

26
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:26,820
It's the South American name
for giant slots. There's,

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,160
I don't want to give away too much
info before I get to do a chance,

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,600
a chance at looking for it. But after
all the research I've compiled, there is,

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,910
in my opinion,
one location on earth.

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,540
It's in high Peru where nobody goes.

31
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,750
It's a bowl of mountains impenetrable.

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,810
The only way in is a helicopter in the
center to me that that ball is going to

33
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,010
be like a primordial Eden.

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,630
All of the cultures surrounding it
have old stories of giant slots.

35
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,190
They all have different names for it,

36
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,980
but they all have these stories
of these giant slots. Right.

37
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:02,460
They were all hunted to
extinction, however they've
handed down these traditions.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,460
But nobody except for,
you know,

39
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,090
a tiny handful of like far out tribal
people have ever really got into this

40
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,510
impenetrable ball. And I think if
they're anywhere they're in there. Wow.

41
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,410
I saw a documentary once about this
scientist that was essentially risking his

42
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,550
reputation, trying to find a giant sloths
somewhere that maybe in the Amazon,

43
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,480
some somewhere, probably Peruvian Amazon.
That's where I'm thinking too. And uh, he,

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,530
he kept talking to people that had seen
it and he never could get ahold of it,

45
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:32,210
but he had been there for
years. Crazy though. Like why,

46
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,190
what if you're a little Amazonian village
or you don't read, you don't have TV.

47
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,130
There's no reason to make up
scientific, you know, science fiction.

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,820
Why say you've seen it cause you like
to fuck with white people. It could be

49
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,790
like get the stringy hair
dinosaurs.

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,170
Fucking five. Yeah. You
know, you're walking,

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,060
you're exhausted. Covered with mosquito
bites. He's like any day now. Yeah.

52
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,570
Just over the hill. He's just gonna
wait for you to fucking rot out.

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,150
That'd be a mean man. That's a meme
guy. Do you want to log all right buddy.

54
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,790
Pat You on the back. This is the last
spot for you. And I'll be taking,

55
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,730
I'll take your binoculars
and yeah. Um, I mean, yeah,

56
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,220
there's no reason for them to lie,
but that doesn't,

57
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,080
that's like the thing that people say
about everything. Why would she lie? Well,

58
00:03:22,081 --> 00:03:26,020
I don't know. People lie for a bunch
of weird reasons. People are crazy.

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,230
They shit up. True. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

60
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,550
to me it's like you have to
take an eyewitness report
of an extinct creature or

61
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,380
a zoo crypto creature with a grain of
salt, but you still have to take it.

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,070
Do you know what I mean? You still
have to bank it and consider it. Yeah.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,070
And so that's, that's kind of the
way I go. I, I always talk to people,

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,690
but then I come up with, I do the biology
right, I track, I put the cameras out,

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,100
I bait,
I sent,

66
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:55,330
I do all of that stuff to try and get
evidence of my own because just going with

67
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,520
eyewitness reports is,
like you say, it's nothing.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,960
Is there ever been any eyewitness
reports that are just too,

69
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,740
too ridiculous where you're like, oh,
for sure. Like what? Oh man, loads.

70
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:09,490
I mean like talking about
the thylacine for instance,

71
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,150
there was a guy that we met there who's
like, yeah, their styles seen everywhere.

72
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:16,300
They run around with the black cats and
were like, what? And he's like, yeah,

73
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,370
there's black panthers too.
They like hang out together.

74
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,510
There's an Australian exactly that. I
made the same face you did. So I'm like,

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,300
okay, tell me more. And he's
like, yeah, you know, they
like to hang out over there.

76
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:29,050
They're behind the trash heap. They
jump around with Black Panthers. Oh,

77
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:32,290
they're just fucking with
it. And I'm like, well that's
the thing. I'm like, you're,

78
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,960
you're just, you're either crazy or
you're completely fucking with me.

79
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:39,880
And I'm not sure which one it is because
your eyes are telling me crazy. Yeah.

80
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,210
Well, I mean, how many different
pockets in the world are there?

81
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,750
Like that basin that you said you got
to get helicoptered into? There's a few.

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,600
There's a few. Yeah, you'd be
surprised because you know, we're here,

83
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,760
we're in a city,
we're so used to our modern conveniences,

84
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:56,300
but there are totally untouched
pieces of the world still. Well,

85
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,120
do you know David Cho, the artist? I
don't. He um, he went to the Congo,

86
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,970
I think it was the Congo
to look for a dinosaur. No,

87
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,971
it was a really early vice piece back
when vice was first starting out.

88
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,940
And David is one of the more
eccentric people that I know.

89
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,390
He's a multimillionaire.
He made a shit load of money gambling.

90
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,070
And also he made a shit load of money
because he was it Facebook painted,

91
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,330
painted Facebook. What does that
mean? Like the wall? Yeah. The inside,

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,860
they hired him to paint,

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,420
like do these murals and they gave him
stock and that stock wound up being worth

94
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:35,830
hundreds of millions of dollars.
And so now he's just this freaky,

95
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,970
super talented artists who
is just doing weird shit.

96
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,320
And one of the things they did was like,
hey man,

97
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:44,350
you want to go look for a dinosaur? He's
like, fuck yeah, I'll go, absolutely.

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Why wouldn't you? You know?
But there's this video of him,

99
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,610
I want to say he was like 25 at the time
too. I think he was pretty young. Yeah.

100
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,840
Look at them there.
Oh yeah.

101
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,920
So he's in the jungle in search
of a fucking dinosaur because,

102
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,500
and it was one of those things where the,
the locals were saying, Hey, there's,

103
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,630
there's a dinosaur in the Congo. Right.
Which doesn't totally make sense,

104
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,710
but it, but, but who knows, right.

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,360
Why not investigate it kind of thing.
I mean,

106
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:16,361
how big of an area would there have to
be for there to be a species that we are

107
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:21,310
not aware of? Like how big of an area.
Oh, I mean, you know, that's, that's,

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,380
it's a generic question cause we discover
you'd have to look up the numbers,

109
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,050
but it's like 2000 new species
a year, right? The little stuff,

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,880
but mostly little stuff. There's
an animal discovered most recently,

111
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,140
there's an animal called the Salah.

112
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,220
It's an animal that I'm actually
working on later this year. And it is a,

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,150
an antelope,

114
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,690
like they call it the Asian Unicorn
because for generations people have been

115
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:45,140
talking about the Asian
Unicorn and Western worlds
like yeah, whatever, whatever,

116
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:45,770
whatever.

117
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,400
And then finally somebody went down
there into the Laotian mountains and,

118
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,640
and was like, here's a skull and here's
a skin. And they were like, Holy Shit,

119
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:56,240
this is a real thing. And this
is like in a pot, not populated,

120
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:59,420
but there's plenty of people living there.
You know what I mean? This isn't like,

121
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,640
this isn't like the middle of nowhere.

122
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:05,060
This is where there's villages and
tribes and people and they're like,

123
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,100
here's this animal, here's
the skin, here's a skull.

124
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,810
And since then I think one trail
camera has the photo has ever surfaced.

125
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:16,460
Like nobody's ever successfully documented
it because it's just this incredibly

126
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:20,600
elusive animal, like whether it has super
sensory organs, you know, hearing sight,

127
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:25,220
smell, whatever it is, or it's just
super low density and population. I've,

128
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,250
nobody really knows. But
this animal, this, this huge,

129
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:31,550
like antelope has been around forever.
People,

130
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,060
little tribal people have been talking
about it in like a mythological way.

131
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:37,970
The same way they would talk about
dinosaurs in the Congo and the Western

132
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,740
world's going, sure
buddy, whatever you say.

133
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,720
And then somebody finally goes down there.

134
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:45,440
Doesn't expedition just like David
did and goes, oh, turns out it's here.

135
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,103
Wow.

136
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,060
What is it about animals where we're so
fascinated by the ones that might not be

137
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:55,790
real or that might be hidden? Like
what is it about them? I mean we, we,

138
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,340
I mean people love to study. Giraffes
are things that are absolutely real,

139
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,580
but they also have an even more compelling
need to search for things that are

140
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,650
not quite sure that, I'm not quite sure
if they exist or not. I don't know,

141
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:16,000
man. I think it's like it's human
nature to want to know more, right?

142
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,090
Like we of course, like not everybody
you see a draft, you're like it's real.

143
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:22,790
I know it banked it. Right.
Some people go to the extreme,

144
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:25,910
they study every aspect of it,
but as a general populous,

145
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,730
I feel like once we
know something's there,

146
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,950
we want to know what the next thing
is. And I mean we, what do you think?

147
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,480
Like what, why, why is it that
we're so fast ass and it was,

148
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,490
I don't know the answer.

149
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,170
I think it's probably a side effect
of our compulsion for innovation.

150
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Like human beings are constantly trying
to find out new secrets are and find a,

151
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,180
find out new discoveries and
invent new things and find,

152
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,800
explore new worlds.
Yep.

153
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,350
I mean this is just something that's
been a part of human nature forever.

154
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:58,440
This desire to improve and to go
for the fund, the next best spot,

155
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,790
the new thing, you know? And then I
think that also works with animals.

156
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,510
I think we have this desire to find
animals that we didn't know a real or

157
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,630
weren't sure real well knowledge
is the foundation of that right?

158
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,490
To go to a new planet. We have to have
the knowledge of how to get there, right,

159
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,890
to go to a new habitat. We have to know
what's there. And I think maybe that's,

160
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,650
that's kind of that deep
rooted desire is like,

161
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,880
we need to know about
this thing in order to,

162
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,700
to understand if we can innovate off.
