1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,520
Dude. I think when people are
immune to have dicks in the future,

2
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:05,360
it just seems like everything's
going away so fast, man.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,980
They're trying to do that with this new,
a Gillette commercial.

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,490
I've seen that Gillette commercial
[inaudible] I heard about it that you can

5
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:12,480
shave your buddy or something.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,680
That's really mad because it's like an
anti masculine Gillette commercial and

7
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:19,470
makes like every man look like
a massage and his piece of shit.

8
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,810
It's such a disturbing commercial.
It's like over and over again.

9
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:26,010
Men doing douchey shit like, hey
bro, aren't you selling razors?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,710
Do and you changing the world with
your shitty fucking advertiser based

11
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,920
philosophy. What are you
doing? Like what are you doing?

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,000
Who fucking green lit this? How's
Atlanta? But like, Yo Yo yo guys,

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,910
people get hair.
They want to fucking shave it.

14
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:44,880
You're not getting it fixed.

15
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:49,881
Imagine if you are of sexist rapist
piece of shit and you see that Gillette

16
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,770
commercial like, damn, I got to switch my
game. I've been too much of a dick. Like,

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,040
does anybody think that
Gillette commercials or
somehow or another in any way,

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,190
shape or form going to affect
culture is bad. You're selling.

19
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,730
Razors is bad.
It's just a razor.

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,460
I'd rather break my fucking face
here than by Gillette. Again,

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,560
he wants to be lectured to
wear a tie or heard of that.

22
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,320
So sick of that.
You don't have your shit together.

23
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:17,400
Nobody has their shit together.

24
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:21,800
And you telling people how to get their
shit together in a fucking razor blade

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,280
at yeah. Yeah. Don't be racist. We know.
Yeah. Don't be a sexist. Yeah, we know.

26
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,490
We know. Most people aren't.
Yeah. This is like, you got it.

27
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,520
Like most people are the videos, like
most people. All right. It's not,

28
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:35,970
most people are crazy.
That's a disproportionate
amount of people that are,

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,700
that's what I hate about it. A lot
of the, this, a lot of these ideas,

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,880
the ideology today, it's
like, like they say,

31
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:46,030
everybody where I'm from is racist or
everybody's like, uh, you know, um,

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,670
some Christian Bible thumping.
And that's true.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,310
So many of the people I know are not
that at all that it's unbelievable.

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,760
But so many of the people in
some and these other places,

35
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:01,050
they don't even know anybody from there.
So it's like they have no idea,

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,440
but they immediately stereotyped
because of your accent too.

37
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,120
You have a southern accent. People assume
you're not bright. Yeah, it's so stupid.

38
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,810
But it's also, it's indicative of
what the place used to be like.

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,740
Like what the world used to be like was
like a lot of the rural edge areas were

40
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,180
less educated. Now that
there's the internet, the world
is a different place, man.

41
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,830
You can meet cool people in Wichita,
Kansas. You meet cool people everywhere.

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,370
Everywhere you go, you're going to
run into pockets of cool people. Cool.

43
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:33,690
People are everywhere, man.
So good people. Good people
are everywhere and they're,

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,440
they have different values and a lot
of them are more community oriented,

45
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,100
more friendly.
