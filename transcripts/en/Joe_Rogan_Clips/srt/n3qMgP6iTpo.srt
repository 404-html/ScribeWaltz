1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,950
The joe rogan experience. Oh, how
about this one? A guy got fucking, uh,

2
00:00:05,951 --> 00:00:09,850
sentenced or he got convicted
and will be sent in soon.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,280
I think he gets sentenced in April for,
uh,

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,400
getting his dog to make a Hitler salute.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,620
Make you a video. Yes, it's on my, uh,
on my Twitter page. I retweeted it.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,180
The guy is in Scotland and
he's a proud shit poster.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,990
He's one of those guys, Jamie loves ship
posters. It's one of his favorite things,

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,890
you know. Um, but he's one
of those guys that just,

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,280
he posts stupid shit to
get a reaction from people.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,440
And so just to piss his girlfriend off,

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,450
he decided he tried to get his dog to
do the Hitler salute, the Nazi salute.

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,910
And uh, you know, he gets his dog to
do it on this video and he says gas.

13
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:51,280
The Jews apparently,
you know,

14
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:55,900
like he's trying to like get his
dog to, to do this. Like when he,

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,260
I guess he thought it was funny,
right? And then he puts it on youtube.

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:04,540
Not only does it get him in trouble,
which I get people being mad like, hey,

17
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:07,540
that's insensitive. Okay, whatever.
It's what he's trying to be insensitive.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,910
They fucking arrested him. They tried him
and they convicted him. Which country?

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,820
Scotland.
The UK.

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,560
I mean this guy's convicted and
now he'll be sentenced. Wow.

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,610
It's fucking crazy. If you've
seen the video [inaudible] Jamie,

22
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:28,390
pull up that video because it's
crazy to watch. It's not that big.

23
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:32,680
A deal has been pushed off up until
April time. Yet next month. Yeah,

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,380
that's what I said.
What is the pull up the video.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,810
Yeah. He's um, that's one
thing about United States, man.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,460
You forget about free speech.

27
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:44,680
Like I was talking to somebody from a
different country recently. He goes,

28
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:49,450
you have no idea how big that is. And
we kind of take it for granted. Giant.

29
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,320
Giant. Yeah. It's giant
and it's, it's everything.

30
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,323
Okay.

31
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,840
It has been identified
by Youtube community is
inappropriate and offensive to

32
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:03,310
some audiences. I understand. Please
proceed. Give you some volume.

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,063
Uh,

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,930
uh, and so I thought I would call them
and he the least cute thing that I could

35
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,510
think of.
You can't even understand a word he says,

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,480
why don't they just speak English? Oh
God. That's the juice gas. The Jews,

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,930
the Jews were more gassy juice.
The juice,

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,850
guess juice. [inaudible]
juice. More gas. The juice.

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,180
The juice. So He's, it's tick.

40
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,830
It took them forever to teach this dog.
This is this the idea.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,960
That's where we're watching
this over and over again.

42
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,220
Oh God.
See?

43
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,310
Oh Wow. Boy. It's
adorable. It is very cute.

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,430
He taught the dog to do that.
It's crazy.

45
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,650
That's, it sucks that he's getting, well,

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,580
it's a classic shit post video.
Yeah. It's like these guys,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,590
this is the whole pepe, the frog thing.
You can take it down. This is the whole,

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,790
it's all the same shit.

49
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a bunch of people that are
having fun sang shit that's totally

50
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:17,380
inappropriate. This is what it is.
That's what that is. It's the same thing.

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,590
And the people that think that,
like anybody who would do that is a Nazi.

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,260
You're not correct.
That's not true.

53
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,760
I guarantee you that guys not
a Nazi I think. I don't know.

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,970
I'm assuming he's not a Nazi.
I'm assuming he's a shit poster.

55
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,370
He's a guy who's trying to
be funny. Hundred percent.
That's just ignorance. Yeah,

56
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:40,150
and that funniness is funny to them. See,
here's the thing. You might not like it.

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,180
You might think it's, it's horribly
and offensive, but here's the thing.

58
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:48,181
No Jews got ma got gassed
during the making of that
video and the worst thing it

59
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,760
did is get racist to laugh.

60
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,060
The best thing it did is get people
to talk about what's appropriate.

61
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,200
There's nothing wrong with that. I mean
it's not good. I mean I don't like it.

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,440
I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't tell people,
hey, this is the most awesome video ever.

63
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,930
Come watch it.
But to put that guy,

64
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,760
not only to put them on trial but the
fucking convict, him and Scotland,

65
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,730
how dare you, you people are
supposed to be ahead of the curve.

66
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,350
Skyland supposed to be a pretty fucking
bad ass place. That's ridiculous.

67
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,080
Isn't Scotland though? Like the, like the,

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,260
like a place that you have to think at
Scotland where you can't even talk about

69
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:27,610
sex on stage. You can cuss, you
can like show you pull a tit out.

70
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:30,700
But like if you're done, it's to talk
about sex. I think it's Scotland.

71
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,710
There's a noble Billy Connolly's
from Scotland and Billy Connolly's,

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,620
a pretty famous worldwide comedian. I
think a suite. It pretty outrageous guy.

73
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,820
I might be thinking of Sweden. Yeah
Cause Cause Connolly's pretty, he's,

74
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,910
he's like in the line of like popular
American standup comics of his era.

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,910
He was a very respected guy and
he's from Scotland. Must be sweet.

76
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,450
I think I'm thinking of
Sweden. Maybe. I don't know.

77
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,180
I don't know Jack Shit about those
other countries that I only visit

78
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,920
occasionally. Right.
But, but when you go to,

79
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,160
when you go to these countries to do
comedy, do you ever have to be like, Hey,

80
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:04,630
don't talk about,
no,

81
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,200
I wouldn't go if I went to a place they
told me I couldn't talk about something.

82
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,570
I'd be like, well why would I go there?
All right, well, I'll just go somewhere,

83
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,620
work and talk about anything.

84
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,420
I don't want to go somewhere where only
talk about certain things. It's like I,

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
I've done a few,
uh,

86
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,250
air quote clean shows in
my day where I got a Gig,

87
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,020
especially when I was first
starting out. They're like, Hey,

88
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,550
can you do a half an hour clean? And I
go, okay. Yeah. And I would just edit.

89
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,860
I'll just edit the shit out of
something. Use words that, you know,

90
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,230
there's like Innuendo that you could get
away with and I could sort of squeaked

91
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,830
by with a bullshit half hour
set, you know? But I would
never do that today. Right.

92
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,630
I got on one too. Yeah. I don't
want to, it's just like I,

93
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,940
what I want to be able to do is find
out what's the best way to express the

94
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,260
thoughts that are in
my mind that are funny.

95
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,260
That the best way is never
by censoring yourself.

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,410
The best way is by figuring out what's
the best way to express yourself.

97
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,330
Okay.
