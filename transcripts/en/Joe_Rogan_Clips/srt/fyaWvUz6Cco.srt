1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,450
Well, what, what, what do you
do with them specifically? Well,

2
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:07,290
I've been with him since 2004 and
recently became his coach right before the

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,390
first Denesha Johnson fight.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:13,380
And I'm going to head coach for Nma and
you're in disguise in case some other

5
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,280
athletes try to swipe it and it's
Halloween. Happy Halloween. Everybody.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,140
Happy Halloween folks. So, uh, first of
all, man, congratulations on your victory.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,750
Um, what does it feel like?
Oh Man, it's uh, uh, it uh,

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,210
it feels good. It feels good. Try to keep
this silly a fist away from your face.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,760
Yeah. Uh, it feels good because it's um,

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,170
[inaudible] I think as a competitor you,
you, you live for these moments. You live,

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,860
you live for these fulfillments, you
know? Yeah. I think somebody like,

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,220
and then I told people since the
beginning, it wasn't so much, you know,

13
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:46,370
the UFC belt,
but it was because it was it.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,730
I made it about Demetrius and it was
about Demetrius, you know, cause I was

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,090
mean. He is widely considered to be
the best pound for pound fighter ever.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,200
And you're the first guy, not only
to beat him, but the first guy who,

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,600
not just to beat them,
but mean beat him in like 11 years,

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,730
but the first guy to win an Olympic
gold medal in wrestling and a UFC

19
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,810
championship. I mean those are
two gigantic accomplishments.

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,370
Yeah, no, for sure. It's
almost like a god, it's, it's,

21
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:16,910
I'd beat the greatest to me the greatest
of all time. And then on top of that,

22
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:20,630
I be, you know, I can, I can
make the run for, you know,

23
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:23,690
who's the greatest combat athlete
of all time. Yeah. Like it's a,

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm a two sport world champion.
Just like,

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,800
yeah, Dale. I mean, you're absolutely
in the running now. I mean, if,

26
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,140
if he's not the greatest of all time,
I think he is.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,200
But the argument is that he didn't face
people as good as John Jones faced and

28
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:42,400
then fade or is the other fade or an
Anderson silver or the other people that

29
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,600
are in consideration for the
grace of all time. I mean, it's,

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,580
it's just a subjective argument.
I mean, who knows who's right,

31
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,140
but obviously you beat without a doubt,
one of the best ever.

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,340
Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and like, I
would, I would tell people there's,

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,160
there's a bit of a of admiration that I
had for Demetrius Johnson. Like I was,

34
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:05,750
uh, it was, it was like, you know,
you're fighting the dude that's, that's,

35
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,590
that almost seems untouchable that
you see a guy that makes you question

36
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:13,220
yourself like, Whoa, this is, this
is this, this guy. Is that right?

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,540
Good. Well, what's crazy is you
beat him after he had stopped you.

38
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,880
Just how long was it?
Two years.

39
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,100
Uh, but close. We're about two and a half
years ago now. Yeah. About, I was like,

40
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,003
I think two years.

41
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,550
Four months.
That's,

42
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,160
that's an amazing turnaround
between getting stomped in
the first round and then

43
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:35,750
coming back and beating him and beating
him in the championship rounds is really

44
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:36,650
where you pulled it off.

45
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,410
No. Uh, and that, absolutely,

46
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:43,100
I had studied Demetrius Johnson like
as soon as a lost on the first time.

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,120
What I pretty much did is I got, I got
rid of a lot of people, including my,

48
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,290
my MMA had coach. I just,
my whole philosophy was,

49
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:56,090
if I can't be the best and there's
something wrong, you know, emotionally,

50
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,940
physically, everything. I was just
invested. And when I, I'm just like, man,

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,520
I need to, I, I'm looking for
a better leader, you know? And,

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,560
and that's kind of what I
did. I ended up, you know,

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,270
letting go a lot of my cornerman, you
know, started traveling the world.

54
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,980
W went out to Singapore, went out
to a, to Thailand, went out to, uh,

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,810
to the Netherlands, spend months
and months at a time out in Brazil.

56
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:24,370
Like I, uh, I was on a quest. It was
like the, I kind of remind myself,

57
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,650
literally like ash catch him from Pokemon.
Like I was just on a venture

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,550
vision quest vision quest.
It was Matthew Modine move.

59
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,390
I, even, Swain, Swain
has to watch that movie.

60
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,410
And that's, and, and, and, and, and it'd
be, like I said, it became in a session,

61
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,340
I knew that if anybody could do it,
it'd be, it'd be Henderson who to,

62
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:48,330
like I really did it. And even after
the first time, Joe, when he beat me,

63
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,910
I still, when they asked me, it's like
Henry, you know, like I would, I was like,

64
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,051
guys,
I don't know,

65
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,900
but I still know that I could beat him
even being knocked out like two minutes

66
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:01,500
and 36 seconds.
Like I still knew in my heart and UFC one,

67
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:04,310
I sat there press crop that says,
I know I'm still the one that's,

68
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,700
what was it about him that made
you think that you could beat him?

69
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,210
What was it about you specifically
in relation to him and his skill set?

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,790
It was a, um, I, if you're
asking me what the difference,

71
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,210
what was it that made you think even
after he stopped you in the first round?

72
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,010
Oh God. Uh, I think it was
more so just believe in it.

73
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,620
My, and my abilities. I think
me just believe in more.
Okay. Henry, you need time.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,980
Like I was only doing MMA for three
years when I fought him the first time.

75
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,560
Yeah. A lot of people
don't know that. Yeah.

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,270
The Sears you see you fighting
for the title, not once,

77
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,480
but twice that you probably had
been doing MMA for a long ass time.

78
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,270
But when you find them for the first time,
it's a very,

79
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,240
that's a very short amount of
time to be fighting and MMA.

80
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,530
It's especially again to caliber athletic.
Demetrius,

81
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,800
what year did you win the Olympics
and, oh wait, yeah, that is,

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,680
I mean when you're doing that you're 100%
dedicated to wrestling. You have to be,

83
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:07,510
right. So were you doing any striking
training at all back then? Um, I did.

84
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,960
I did. What happened was once I
won the Olympics, almost kind of,

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,290
I fell out of love with the sport.
I fell,

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,640
I fell out of love with Russ
and I remember being at the
Olympics and being like,

87
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:22,030
man, I just, I don't know if I have it in
me no more just cause you're burned out.

88
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,860
I was, yeah, my whole childhood was
gone because of the sport. You know,

89
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:30,370
like crazy basketball further.
What are you doing? I mean, anyway,

90
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,260
I've been waiting for you to say that.

91
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,670
We'll do it in stages.

92
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,670
So you, you fell out of love
with it. I fell out of love with,

93
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,650
is it just because your whole life had
been dedicated to wrestling and you'd

94
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,350
finally achieve the greatest,
so great goals. Yeah.

95
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,740
Olympic gold medalists is the top of the
mountain. No, but check this out Joe.

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
And it was like

97
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,110
in the year of 2007, um, bad I
went through the worst year ever.

98
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,650
Like I was ready to become a world
champion and I went out to the world

99
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:08,150
champions in 2007 and I didn't even
score a point like in the first round,

100
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:12,860
like I got put out by, by Iran. And uh,
for some reason that whole year, man,

101
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,170
I was just going through freaking
struggles like left and right.

102
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,780
You're talking about just that versus I
couldn't want to turn him in to save my

103
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,950
life. What was it? Um, I
don't know. I don't know.

104
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,010
I truly, truly don't
know. I think I was, uh,

105
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,490
I think I probably begin kind
of fallen out of love with it.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,350
And I remember there was to me,

107
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,600
there was only two tournaments that
everyone had to win and that was,

108
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,290
that was the Olympic trials and
eventually the Olympic Games and,

109
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,830
and somehow like,
cause I'm correlating this with the,

110
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,460
with the fight with Demetrius
Johnson and uh, I remember,

111
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,730
you know, just, just
almost being in tears.

112
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:50,810
Like I just don't know if this is for
me and the, but I just stuck with it.

113
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,060
I stuck with it.
I ended up putting in the Olympic trials.

114
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,170
I ended up going to the,
you know,

115
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:58,190
the Olympic Games and ended up pretty
much fallen behind in every single match,

116
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,620
uh, that I was wrestling in. So the,

117
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,840
these are kind of the adversities
that I was going through,

118
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,580
like leading up to become
an Olympic champion.

119
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,420
You know, it's interesting
when you were fighting, um,

120
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,640
Demetrius for the second time, Daniel
Cormier said something very interesting.

121
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,230
He said, most guys, he goes, I
would never give a chance. You,

122
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,510
you get stopped by Dj.

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,150
And then a couple of years later
you're fighting him again. Like he's,

124
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:24,810
he's going to have your number where
he's going to be better in the rematch.

125
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,850
And he goes, but Henry, so who chose
a different kind of athlete? He,

126
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,960
and he talked about you competing and
then coming back a year later and being,

127
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,210
he goes, he was many times
better. He goes, the,

128
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,580
the amount of improvement that he got
in just one year was just unbelievable.

129
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,250
Yeah. I think, you know, I guess she
couldn't hold that teacher. Netics no,

130
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,990
I think you could talk a lot about desire
to just having the only get you so far

131
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,150
what it taught, he had, the Olympics
has, has g great genetics for sure.

132
00:07:55,151 --> 00:08:00,030
But it's almost, it almost becomes a, uh,
a mentality on, because of a philosophy.

133
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:05,031
It's like you almost start doing things
almost like two to not feel the H to,

134
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:08,730
not to not feel the pain of losing.
Hmm.

135
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,380
Like that's a motivator to
not feel the pain of losing.

136
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,360
And I remember when Demetrius Johnson
hit me, hit me and hit me in the leg.

137
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,020
And I had literally,

138
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,580
I don't think he put your how severe it
was like I literally spraying like a,

139
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,100
a severe low ankle, spend those first
30 seconds and the second fight.

140
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,610
So I fought Demetrius Johnson like that.
But it was,

141
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:29,350
it was to me the motivator was like,
man,

142
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:32,980
I don't want to feel that pain
of losing no more. I hate it man.

143
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:37,210
I hate feeling second place.
I hate feeling Kinda Kinda
somebody looking over me.

144
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,470
Someone's a almost like
a manhood challenge and I
hate that. Was it a low leg

145
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,140
kick that uh, that been
made your, your ankle go

146
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,880
go? Like what was it? It was a,

147
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:50,580
there's a nerve that you have
behind that like the bonus up PR,

148
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,560
I think it's the premium peripheral
peripheral nerve p. E. R.

149
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,430
Yeah. And I got hit there.
So I put my foot to sleep.

150
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,820
Just like when Michael Chandler happened
to him and bell tours. Same thing.

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,050
Exactly. You stepping on it. It's just
not working. And the pro and the reason I,

152
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,610
the reason why everybody kind of got
scared. I mean, cause I was, I was hurt,

153
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,470
but I remember before the fight,
I remember,

154
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,760
I remember I saw my cornerman like
kind of wait for, I fought the meters.

155
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,630
I remember I saw him all. Uh, I
saw him on nervous and never see,

156
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,300
I remember grabbing my cornerman is
team putting them right in front of me.

157
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,390
I remember telling us, hey
guys, I've been here before.

158
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,530
Like I was ranked 31st in the
world. I'd be, I know, I, I,

159
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,540
I became a world champion in wrestling.
Like guys,

160
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:36,520
like I want you guys to
have a little faith in deed,

161
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,140
but I'm going to ask you guys one
thing and I'm going to ask you guys,

162
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,290
I'm going to ask you guys to be composed.
I said, the key to winning this fight,

163
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,450
this for me to be composed. And then
pretty much there's six hours later, they,

164
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,300
uh, right before, you know, walk
on this are playing my song.

165
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:56,250
I looked back at my corner and I
said, uh, and I said, guys, I said,

166
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,980
the key to this fight,
remember I said it'd be composure.

167
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,390
So when Demetrius Johnson kicked me,
like I, I believed in my own philosophy,

168
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,910
I went back to, all right, my
composure because I was hurt Joe.

169
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,050
Like he could've stopped me that that
first round I was forced to switch south

170
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,370
South Paul, which I never fight in south
Paul, you know, so now I'm kind of,

171
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,740
I worked with me and Demetrius
Johnson or playing poker,

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,470
my whole philosophy and the key to this
victory was a composure part. And uh,

173
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:27,390
when he hit me, I, uh, I really did.
I was like, oh my God, not again,

174
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,140
not again. I'm not going to last two
minutes and 36 seconds. Not Again,

175
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,100
but it again, the motivator was
not to feel the pain to lose again.

176
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,260
Like it wasn't the desire to win.
I was like,

177
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,340
I just don't want to feel that pain
anymore as a competitor, as somebody that,

178
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,760
that, that that's on a mission
to that sacrifices life.

179
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,070
Explaining to someone who's
never experienced that before.

180
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:48,160
What is that pain like?

181
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,550
You train for how many weeks and then
you find mighty mouse with the title.

182
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:56,430
You get stopped in the first round.
What is our pain? Oh Man. It's,

183
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,850
I think every fighter has a spirit.
Like what is the spirit?

184
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,650
The spirit is your spirit is your
dream. This bird is that, you know,

185
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,440
you've watched somebody become a
world champion. You want to be, hey,

186
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:12,070
I want to be just like that guy. Your
confidence, your self esteem, that's the,

187
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,920
that's your spirit.
And you will also,

188
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:17,250
we also have a spirit of a war
that's like the man has side of it.

189
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,000
And what happens when I got stopped
with Demetrius Johnson's to,

190
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,140
I almost felt like,
and I've never gone through this,

191
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:25,170
not even in wrestling in my life,
like I was like,

192
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:29,280
my spirit was shot and I had to kind
of pick up my pieces to kind of start

193
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,480
healing myself, like mentally.
And I feel like it. And if it,

194
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:35,430
and if you look at a job
with somebody like Roy Jones,

195
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:40,050
jr he got knocked out one time
and it became a domino effect,

196
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,140
you know, because he never, he
never picked up those pieces.

197
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:44,730
He never started healing that spirit.
