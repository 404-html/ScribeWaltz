00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,850
Hello Freak bitches post thing on my bra.

brother. Yeah, Apollo. I was just 13.

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,180
Nick Depalo and Brian Cowen. Oh my
God. Where did you pull up Epstein?

6
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,710
Well, they hired Epstein, but Nick Depalo

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,290
I didn't meet him until he was on the set.
He was a real nice guy though.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120
Did he pass away? Oh, thanks.
Yeah. Yeah. I check it.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,170
A feeling she's good. You know, it's
really fucking sick, bro. Yeah, buddy.

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,840

to from that baseball show you

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,430
the Spanish guy that was on there with
you. A nice guy. Spanish guy. Yeah.

13
00:00:55,431 --> 00:01:00,000
You were on a baseball show. Yeah. Well,
I'm thinking [inaudible] Willem bar.

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,540
the Spanish guy that came to visit
you at the store a few times.

16
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,070
He's sick and guy. Yeah, I
just donated to his golf.

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,410
There's a dude from star trek.
Remember that? That dude,

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,060
it's in star trek all the time.
Uh, fucking, what is his name?

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,373
God dammit.

20
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,380
But he was the older picture and I
was the young asshole ballplayer.

21
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,450
What was that? Betty wife? Yeah, she
was not Betty. Was it Betty White? No,

22
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:37,250
the other lady from uh,
what's the cast? Some,

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,550
God damn it. I don't remember a
name. See if you can find the cast.

24
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,480
Yeah, but you don't want images.
No. That you want actual text.

25
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,780
Don't go to images. Sometimes
it pops up. Well, see?

26
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,310
Yeah. Ben Marie. Yeah.

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,170
Mike Star. Keep going.
Scrolling left. Yeah.

28
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,700
Ben Greenwood.
He thought guys in star.

29
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:10,680
He's in a bunch of movies now and
Dan Florick. He was in law and order,

30
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,830
but go the other way. That dude, it
only went worth, she was hilarious.

31
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,620
She been in a bunch of shit.
Chris Browning, he was on,

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,600
he's been a bunch of stuff recently.
Waze bike.

33
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,290
Fucking weird man. What
year was that? What years?

34
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,470
It said it was 94 four,
four.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,250
That's when I had to move to California.
I was miserable.

36
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,330
I was shooting this the first couple
of days, look at me like I was like 26.

37
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:42,990
There are so weird. Um,
you know what man, when,

38
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,160
when it first started out
it was fun. And then, um,

39
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:50,220
what happened was with twit TV shows,

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,640
a lot of times you have like these really
funny writers and these guys who wrote

41
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:57,170
it originally were really good.
But the uh,

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,280
they had written from
married with children,

43
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:04,410
the Simpsons and the network had decided
for some reason that they weren't

44
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,350
strong enough to run the show and
that they, they were only writers.

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,200
They weren't like a real show runner.
So they brought in,

46
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,500
this guy was a show runner,

47
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,570
he was terrible and I didn't get along
with him at all and they were actually

48
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,480
close to firing me or him.

49
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,110
Like there was like a real like impasse
between the two of us cause the guys

50
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:27,580
riding was dog shit. I was crazy back
then. Dude, I didn't give a fuck.

51
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,900
I had zero filter.

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,940
I never thought it was going to
be an actor in the first place.

53
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,080
I couldn't believe him on the set.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
And so they would try to get me to
do stuff and I'll be like, what?

55
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,480
And they would like give me the script.
Like,

56
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,940
well we made revisions to the
script and I would read that goes,

57
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,030
this is fucking terrible. And they would
get pissed at me and people be pissed.

58
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,970
I'm like, tell me how this is funny.
Explained to me how this is funny.

59
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,920
And then you know, like executives
are going, you know, you're either,

60
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,090
we're talking to my agent, this guy,
you know, he's, he's very arrogant and,

61
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,720
and you know, he's, he's causing
problems on the set and I'm like,

62
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,690
I'm not causing problems in the set.
I go, they took the writer stuff,

63
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:02,440
they rewrote it and they turned into dog
shit. You show me, show me how it's not.

64
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,640
And I,
and I,

65
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,610
I was like very close to like killing my
sitcom career completely just by having

66
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:14,590
no filter. Well then they realized
it, they read it and then they came,

67
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,770
has watched some of the run throughs. And
the network fired him, but it was close.

68
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:21,280
He wanted me out,
but I was one of the stars of the show.

69
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,110
It was me and that Ben Greenwood
Guy, but, and then, I mean it was a,

70
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:30,520
it was an ensemble show, but I
played the star player. There was,

71
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,010
there was about a baseball team, a
fucked up baseball team. And I was the,

72
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,050
the guy who was always causing trouble
and wrecking his car and going crazy.

73
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,500
And so they were having a real
problem with me. But it was,

74
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,920
it w it was because these guys
that had originally wrote it,

75
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,440
these guys were genius.
They were really,

76
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,880
really funny and they took their words
and just butchered it and turned into

77
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:55,870
something hackneyed fucked up
sitcoms. What they usually do. Well,

78
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:59,380
Jim Brewer was in the pilot with
me. Jim Brewer. That was me.

79
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,750
I looked like a baby. So weird. Um,

80
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,720
so Jim brewer was in the pilot with me.
He played the mascot for the team. Fuck.

81
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:13,420
He was funny man.
And Jim and I were buddies from New York.

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,430
There's Jim as Jim Brewer.
No,

83
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,340
Jim Breuer played the pioneer who,
uh,

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,870
he had like the, the bay, I feel
like, like he got in a fight,

85
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,150
Jeff Curran and Kevin Martin back
that up right there where you see the,

86
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:34,930
the Lens on the screen. Yeah. Where
you see the words like right there,

87
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:37,810
Kevin Curran rather than chef
Martin. Sorry, I fucked her.

88
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,870
Name's up Kevin Kern and Jeff
Martin with the guys who wrote it.

89
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,000
And um, they were really, really
nice guys and really funny guys,

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,040
but they were writers,
you know,

91
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,280
and this was something that they'd created
and then the network just butchered

92
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,230
it and then it wound up getting canceled.

93
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,640
And then I was ready to move back
to New York, but I fucked up.

94
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:58,280
And I had already got a
lease on an apartment.

95
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,220
I got an apartment on
Moore Park in studio city,

96
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,310
or it was actually north Hollywood.
And, uh, I was like, fuck,

97
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:07,970
I already got this apartment. Like,
what do I do? And so I'm like, God,

98
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,370
I gotta stay here because I've
got a lease. And I was like, shit,

99
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,410
I want to move back to New York.
I hated it out here.

100
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,600
[inaudible]
okay.
