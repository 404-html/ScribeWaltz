1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,110
Hello Freak bitches. You
pulled me in buddy. Uh,

2
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:06,100
I was uh,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,840
I was in Los Angeles and I got a call
from my manager and it was essentially

4
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:14,070
saying, all right, there's this
thing that we got an offer for.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm sure you're not going to want to do
this, but next friend Jeff says, scam.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,620
What a pitch. Mine as well. And now
here we are many, many years later. Um,

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,450
that was UFC 12 in 1997.
Uh,

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,170
and uh, Bob Myerwitz was the
president and owner of needs.

9
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:35,410
Just give him the finger. How dare
you? Is that what that was? No,

10
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:39,010
it was picking my Bob Myerwitz was the,
uh,

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,640
the owner and a Campbell Mclaren.
What was your official title?

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,290
Producer, you know cocreators what
they call me now? Aye. Aye. Aye.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,270
E p. Dot. Shows and was the head
of programming for the company.

14
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:58,271
So you were there for you
fc 1.01 young guy was,

15
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,170
oh my boy. I was like a little
hill. See my up there on the screen.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,590
I was a scrappy little youngster when I
was working for you guys. What happened?

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,040
Yeah.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,430
I became an old man,
you know,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,450
can gain years and uh, you
know, you still can look oh gay.

20
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,010
Cause you look like a fighter to me.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,590
You look more like a fight
or now than when you started.

22
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,220
Well I didn't lift weights done.
That's why I started doing Jujitsu.

23
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:26,150
Like right before I did that show. But
back then I was just doing kickboxing. No,

24
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:27,340
no weightlifting ever.

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,990
But once I started June doing
Jujitsu and getting manhandled,

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,040
I said to put some meat on, this is
ridiculous. I'm tired of getting raped.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,530
Well the Gracies, here's the pledge
they made to me and he'd go, you know,

28
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,170
gamble gums, study Brazilian, Jujitsu,
Gracie Jiu Jitsu with the family.

29
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:46,870
We promise not to break your ribs the
first couple times. That was the precise,

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,990
that's it. That's the, that's what I
get for. Nobody writes on free. Yeah.

31
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:53,330
You don't get good at Jujitsu
by not getting your ass kicked.

32
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:54,470
Everybody gets their ass kicked.

33
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:57,380
It's impossible to not get your ass
kicked and get good at Hugh Jitsu.

34
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,590
You have to do it. You have to experience
it. Do you think you're good at Jujitsu?

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,920
I got a couple of black belts. As far
as like regular people. Yeah, I'm good.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,340
As far as like really good Jujitsu people,
I'm not that good.

37
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,080
[inaudible].
