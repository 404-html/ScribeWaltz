1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,940
Yes, Joe, it's great to see
you man. I appreciate it. Well,

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:06,690
we were in a film together so we've
been like right next to each other on

3
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:10,500
cellular Lloyd. What someone we
in. Um, that was the culture.

4
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:14,040
Hi Brett Harvey and it's a, you, me,

5
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:17,970
Richard Branson and snoop Dogg.
Oh, good company. Yes. Right.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,800
Yeah. So you were just saying
right before we did the podcast,

7
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:27,270
you were in bed for 15 years.
I was in, I got sick in 1988.

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,570
I wasn't able to make it out of
that bed until 2003, but Joe,

9
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:34,230
I was absolutely certain I would
never make it out of that bed.

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,110
What did you have?
It's called these days.

11
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:41,300
This month it's called m e cfs.
Uh,

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,030
up until now it was just known
as chronic fatigue syndrome cfs.

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,960
But it's real serious if
you get a bad case of it.

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,830
So I was too weak to talk for
five years too weak to talk.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,140
You didn't talk at all?
Not a bit.

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:59,530
I didn't have the strength to
puff out even a syllable. Um,

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,470
and um, I was too weak to have another
person in the room with me for five years.

18
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,270
You can have a person in the room.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,300
My stress levels were off the charts and
the slightest thing would just a crack.

20
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:17,100
My wife tried to keep me company so we
have this big king sized bed and she

21
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:22,101
would lay in bed reading a newspaper
and the sound of the page turning went

22
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,370
through me like a cannon ball and she,

23
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:31,371
it just tore me to pieces and she had
to build a separate room in the front of

24
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:36,921
the house and live there because
I couldn't tolerate anything.

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,890
Did you think it was over?
Yeah. I thought first of all,

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,750
something you don't know,

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,880
you have a sense of humanity and you
don't know it and something like this that

28
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:50,010
wipes out your entire future.
Every dream,

29
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:55,011
the overhead for yourself robs you of
your sense of humanity and you don't know

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,680
there is a sense of humanity
until it disappears.

31
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,660
So it took me three years.

32
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:05,661
I had a rebuild a personality from just
about scratch because of the one area I

33
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:11,310
could handle at least most
of the time was the internet,

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,481
you know,

35
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,481
the Internet hit the music industry in
1983 and I had been lusting after it for

36
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:22,260
years because only academics had
access to this real high tech thing.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
And um,
I had,

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,680
it took me three years to realize that
every day I was trying to go up to my

39
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:33,681
front room office and work and that
sitting was draining me of my energy.

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,230
And since I only had a
tiny amount of energy,

41
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,380
if I lay there horizontal in the bed,

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,470
my voice would eventually come back.

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,450
So I had an assistant take two computers
because in those days to computers was

44
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,530
about half the size of the
processing power was half
the size of your cell phone.

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,270
And I had him hook up two
computers and a Chinese box.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,270
Don't let anybody tell you the,
and Chinese don't event things they do.

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,220
And this was a box that allowed me to
control both computers from one monitor

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,120
and one keyboard.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,650
So we have the keyboard up on foam
bolsters so that I could see it when I was

50
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:16,651
laying perfectly horizontal in bed so I
could still see the keys and I rebuilt a

51
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:22,441
personality online cause I couldn't get
any further than to the bathroom and

52
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,380
back. That was it. What do you mean
by you rebuilt a personality? Well,

53
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,240
everything I hadn't expected.

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,170
I mean I was going to write my
first book and I was going to,

55
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,970
I'm a nerd from science.

56
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,180
I got into science at the age of 10
I got into theoretical physics and

57
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:38,110
microbiology.

58
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:42,310
I felt built my first Boolean Algebra
machine when I was 12 I code is down to

59
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,800
computer,
the one science fair awards.

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,800
When I was 12 I was taken to see the head
of the graduate physics department at

61
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:53,650
the University of Buffalo and
disappeared into his office for an hour.

62
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,290
My mother wondered what in the world had
happened to me cause it was supposed to

63
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,670
be a five minute courtesy call.

64
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,830
We were discussing big bang versus steady
state theory of the universe for an

65
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,110
hour. And, uh, when I was 16,

66
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,950
I worked at the world's largest cancer
research lab and I came up with up with

67
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,140
the theory of the beginning,
middle and end of the universe,

68
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,330
the Big Bang theory or the balloon Tory,

69
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:17,620
it'll model that predicted 38
years in advanced arc energy.

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,420
And then I ended up in the rock and
roll business with this background.

71
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,230
So when I imagine I was
going to write my first book,

72
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:31,140
I was going to leave the rock and
roll business behind because my field

73
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:33,960
expedition and rock and roll,
I'd learned,

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,660
I thought as much as I was
ever going to learn from it.

75
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,100
And I'd worked with Michael Jackson,
Prince Bob Marley, Bette Midler,

76
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,370
ACDC or Smith Quist Piss Queen,
Billy Joel, Billy idol, Paul Simon,

77
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,660
Peter Gabriel, David Byrne, people like
that. What, what caused this disease?

78
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,390
Like nobody knows.
Nobody has a clue. Yeah.

79
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,950
What the, so in the different
names, chronic fatigue syndrome,

80
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,050
Sammy is Myalgic encephalomyelitis
and a more dignified name

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,010
dude. Can they understand it and to the
point where they could chest for it.

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,850
Did they give you a blood test
or they just can't test for it?

83
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,270
They don't know what causes it.
There's no Ivrit.

84
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,540
A friend approached me
at one point and said,

85
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,520
the Duchess of Kent has what you have.

86
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,070
Can you write her a letter
about how to manage it?

87
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,660
So instead of a letter I wrote 14
or 16 pages or something like that.

88
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,230
So when people have this,
I send them this pamphlet.

89
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:30,110
It explains how I got out of it,
but we'll work for me.

90
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:33,560
Is not necessarily going to
work for you or anybody else.

91
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:37,910
Was it a gradual slipping away of
your energy or was it a gradual?

92
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:40,430
It happened on March 10th of 1988

93
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,000
so March 9th year fine. March 10th. Okay.

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,840
March 9th. I'm fine. March
10th I'm fine. I fly down to a,

95
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,220
I think it was Richmond
or something like that,

96
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:53,100
to go out five to be taken by jeep,
uh,

97
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,830
five hours into the countryside to
meet with Linda Womack that Sam Cooke's

98
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:01,970
daughter and her husband,
Cecil Womack,

99
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,640
who is broke the rolling stones first hit,

100
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,940
he and his brother and they have this
big aircraft hanger sized farm building.

101
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,530
Uh, it's going to be their home, but
right now they've just had it built.

102
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,280
It's empty. It doesn't have
heating yet and it's March 10th.

103
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,200
It's still the end of winter.

104
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,370
And so we go and pass the sheep and into
this building and there's no furniture

105
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:25,791
in there.

106
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,390
And I sit there and interview them for
five hours and find out that there's

107
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,230
something called a black coal mining
culture and that Gospel came out of those

108
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,610
black coal mines. I had no idea that
blacks ever got involved in coal mines,

109
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,330
much less that. That's how
gospel culture began. And I,

110
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,020
they drove me five hours
back to the airport again.

111
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,240
I sat there on the plane with my little
TRS, 100, the very first laptop computer,

112
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,920
this little Gizmo that ran
off of Aa batteries and um,

113
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,080
and then I forgot my,
my laptop on the plane.

114
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,920
I don't do things like that.
Someone who was a little off the next day.

115
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:04,940
I thought I had a cold.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,530
My technique for handling a cold
work your fucking ass off, um,

117
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,150
walk a minimum of two and a
half miles and do your work.

118
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,100
So I worked in power to my
way through it by Tuesday. Um,

119
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,550
I was so weak that my staff had picked
me up under the armpits and drag me off

120
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:29,570
to the elevator and throw me in the back
of a car service car and shipped me out

121
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:32,810
to park slope to my
brownstone in Brooklyn Guide.

122
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,830
Don't know how I even got up the stairs
and it was all downhill basically from

123
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:41,720
there for 15 years. 15
freaking years. Right. But so,

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,970
but I still had, I had gotten
halfway through writing my
first book. My plan was,

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,390
okay, I'll do what I've done
with all my rock and roll bands.

126
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,890
When my book is ready to come out.
I'll go do every morning television show,

127
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,580
every radio show,
every newspaper in the country.

128
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:02,960
I'll stay at high houses where the
sheets are sunny and yellow and um,

129
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,550
where they make the bed for you.

130
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,940
You don't have to make it yourself and
they'll feed you food and stuff like that.

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,830
And I'll promote my book. That was my
vision of my next step in life. My Future.

132
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,580
Well, if you can't leave your
bedroom, that's all gone.

133
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,060
That's all gone.
And you have to,

134
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,790
and I had to walk into my
office one day and say,

135
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,990
I have no idea of what's happening
to me. I could be dying. Um,

136
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,860
I have to be out of here in two weeks.
And I gave the whole thing to my staff,

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,850
the biggest PR firm in the music
industry. He just gave it to them. Yeah.

138
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,750
And the next day I got a call from a west
coast competitor offering me a lot of

139
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:43,190
money and I had to say, no, I'm sorry.
I gave it to my staff yesterday. So,

140
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,910
and, and, and I, as I say,

141
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,900
had to reinvent myself with what little
I had. The books were still a value.

142
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:55,901
My science was still a value and
I had to create a new me online.

143
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,120
Now when you say create a new you online
and you say create a new personality,

144
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,550
what do you, what exactly do
you mean by that? Like, well,

145
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:08,980
I have your old personality.
All personality couldn't walk anymore,

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,270
couldn't talk anymore. That was
your body. That was my body.

147
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:17,271
But you have no idea of just how much of
your personality is your body and your

148
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:22,110
vocal cords and stuff like that that
you take for granted are instruments of

149
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:26,610
some internal you I had to invent
an existence, let's put it that way.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,260
Um, online. And how'd you do that? Like
when, when you say, well, I got on,

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,430
I got on line. Um, first I, God,

152
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:38,670
I can't even remember what came
first, but at some point, um,

153
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,000
because I was fact checking my first book,

154
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,250
but how to do this all laying there in
bed. Um, I got hold of Napoleon, Sean,

155
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:51,780
y'all, who is the, the anthropologist
who chronicled the fierce people,

156
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:56,500
the Auto Mama in South America,
people who are really, I mean you,

157
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,210
the more people you kill, the more
wives you get. It's as simple as that.

158
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,110
And y'all know,
I'm old culture and um,

159
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,240
I wanted him to read my book,
my first book,

160
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:09,480
the Lucifer principle of scientific
expedition into the forces of history.

161
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,110
And he said, look, people are out
to destroy my career right now.

162
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,270
I can't get involved with
anything controversial,

163
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,610
but I'm a key member of the human behavior
and evolution society and you should

164
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:21,444
be a member.

165
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,770
While he introduced me to a social group
in which I could interact as long as I

166
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,880
can continue to type.
So this is a message board or um,

167
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,260
it was all done via email.
So just a,

168
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,550
a group of people that you
could interact with, with the,

169
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,050
and I've been working on my writing since
I was 16 years old. Science is my base.

170
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,760
But the book I got at the age of
12 by Albert Einstein, you know,

171
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,860
sometimes a book grabs you by the lapels
and it feels like the authors writing

172
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,300
this directly into your face.
And Einstein said to be a genius.

173
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,210
It's not enough to come over,
come up with a theory,

174
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:58,050
only seven men in the world
who can understand to be a
genius who would have to

175
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:01,620
be able to come up with that theory and
then express it so clearly that anyone

176
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:04,800
with a high school education and a
reasonable degree of intelligence can

177
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:08,640
understand it. So Albert Einstein,
my heroes said, schmuck, listen up.

178
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,520
You want to be on an
original scientific thinker?

179
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,400
You have to be the best
writer you can possibly be.

180
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,050
So I've been working on my writing
since I was 16 years old. I was late.

181
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,040
It took me four years to get around
to doing it after Einstein gave me the

182
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:28,041
orders and I'm one when I was put on the
human behavior and evolutionary society

183
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:32,520
group,
well I can write my fucking ass off.

184
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,970
So people were impressed
and they gathered a round.

185
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:38,851
Me.

186
00:11:38,851 --> 00:11:43,851
Fortunately now admittedly it's all
on a computer screen and it's all via

187
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:48,000
keyboard and there are no living
humans in the room and he applies.

188
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,530
But it saved my life
to be able to do that.

189
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:55,960
And then I found it to international
scientific groups of my own and I wrote

190
00:11:55,961 --> 00:12:00,550
three books because those were things I
could do with that keyboard as long as I

191
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,360
have the strength to do the keyboarding
and I didn't always have the strength to

192
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:07,660
even lift my hands and do that.
But I did most of the time.

193
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,120
Now during this time
were you getting treated?

194
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:14,050
Were doctors giving you the doctors
don't know a damn thing about this?

195
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,891
Eventually,

196
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:19,891
my first wife who I lost because of this
loss of 34 year marriage because of the

197
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:20,980
illness,

198
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,980
she persuaded a cfs doctor or a doctor
who specializes in chronic fatigue

199
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:30,610
syndrome to come out to my house when
he was going to a party in Brooklyn and

200
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,444
see me.

201
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,650
And the most useful thing that he did was
hand me a piece of paper with an email

202
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:39,910
address on it. And he said,
this is another one of my
patients. She's in Texas.

203
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,530
I want you to get in touch with her.

204
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,530
And the two of us went out like
Hansel and Gretel, holding hands,

205
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,950
going into the forest,
looking for treatment modalities.

206
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:52,951
We're looking for treatments that might
possibly save us from our illness.

207
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,950
So when I tell people this
stuff I take and they say, okay,

208
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:01,750
how can I get this room? And I send them
to my doctor, my old cfs doctor, he says,

209
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,560
oh, I don't give those treatments.
Well, he gave them to me,

210
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:09,190
but he gave them to me because those
were the things that felt like they might

211
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,540
work and he allowed me to try them.
And I ended up with a,

212
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,500
every morning I give myself a shot
with three different things in it,

213
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,410
half a cc of magnesium,
one cc of Oxytocin,

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,480
and a about two CC's of Santa Cobalamin,
which is liquid vitamin B's.

215
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,950
Well, so be 12 magnesium
and oxytocin. Oxytocin,

216
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,900
the bonding hormone,
oxytocin,

217
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:36,250
the stuff that creates trust
in neuroeconomics experiments.

218
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,360
Oxytocin with, if you're a mother and
you've just given birth to a baby,

219
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,930
when you put that baby to your left
nipple for the very first time,

220
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,440
you feel in some cases like you've just
taken LSD because this chemical goes

221
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,871
coursing through your body and it's a
trip and it makes you trust everybody in

222
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:57,640
the room.
And everybody who walks into the room,

223
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,700
it's oxytocin and oxytocin.

224
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:04,840
I been on oxytocin now
for 20 years and Oxytocin,

225
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:07,810
it turns out also does something else.
Um,

226
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,950
there's this little experiment
called parabiosis, an old rat.

227
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,370
His brain is aging as hard as aging.
His kidneys are aging.

228
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,450
You Hook up the circulatory system to
the circulatory system of a young rat.

229
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,220
And guess what starts happening to the
old rat. His brain starts reversing,

230
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,010
getting, getting younger. His
heart starts getting younger.

231
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,870
His kidneys start to get younger. So
I'm about to be 75 years old in a month.

232
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,780
And um, I do between 400 and
700 pushups in the morning.

233
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:40,990
First thing, that's crazy.
Yeah, that's really crazy.

234
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,200
But when they tried to figure out what
is reversing the aging and the muscles of

235
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,860
the rat, the heart of the
rat, the brain of the rat,

236
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,380
the one ingredient they were able to
isolate and then use on other rats to get

237
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,920
them to get younger instead
of older was oxytocin.

238
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,320
So in all probability,

239
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:07,820
the reason I can do between 400 and 700
pushups in the morning at the age of 74

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,980
and when I was 19,

241
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,160
the most I could do was 92 and I
was working really hard at it. Um,

242
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,960
is the oxytocin. So I'd never heard of
anybody taking that as a supplement.

243
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,730
Well,
it showed up.

244
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:23,960
There was a doctor named something like
Seastrunk in Texas who was using it on

245
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,100
cfs patients. And my friend,
the Texas patient of my doctor,

246
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,390
um, found Seastrunk and got his
protocol out of him. In other words,

247
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:35,120
exactly what he'd used
to treat the problem.

248
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,750
And we gave it to my doctor and he sat
on it for six months until he could

249
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,170
regurgitate it as his own bright idea.
And then,

250
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:47,120
and then he prescribed it for me.
And it's done wonders that,

251
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,750
and a bunch of other stuff
have done absolute wonders.

252
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,570
What are the other things that have
worked? I think Gabapentin without that.

253
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:56,570
I mean I was on my way to Moscow
once I finally got out of bed,

254
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,780
I was going to address an international
conference of quantum physicists about

255
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,440
why everything they know about
quantum physics is wrong. And um,

256
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,300
I was fine.
All,

257
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:09,380
I mean this was my first traveling since
I'd gotten out of bed and it was taking

258
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,800
a huge chance cause it was a huge chance
on throwing me back into bed again.

259
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,400
And I flew all the way to
Germany and was doing just fine.

260
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,860
I was exhilarated that
I was doing so well.

261
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,510
And then halfway between
Germany and Moscow, the cfs
symptoms began to come back.

262
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,800
And that was scary.

263
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,480
And then I reviewed what I was doing and
I realized I'd missed all my afternoon

264
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:34,370
pills and I,
and as soon as I was able,

265
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,960
well my, we had to find a, a bed
in the infirmary, which is scary.

266
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,920
And the Moscow airport because there are
people walking around with machine guns

267
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,510
and military uniforms and they want to
take my passport away in order to allow

268
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:49,250
me to lay on a bed in the infirmary.

269
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,520
And so I could be
disappeared at any second.

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,440
But when we finally got to our
hotel and opened up my drug role,

271
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,360
um, I took the Gabapentin and within
15 minutes the symptoms were gone.

272
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,680
Wow. So did, have you ever tried
to isolate individual ones?

273
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,640
It removes some of them from the
protocol to see if once removed one

274
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,570
amytriptolene it's an
antidepressant. That's what it
was originally designed for.

275
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,770
And I figured I don't need this anymore.
I'm perfectly healthy.

276
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,810
It was a big mistake.

277
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,450
I started having these blinding
stomach aches and they went out for a,

278
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,940
I mean for months and months and months
until I finally got fed up and started

279
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:32,480
researching on Google. What do you do
about summer cakes? Well, guess what?

280
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:36,440
One of the primary things you do to
stop stomach cases. Amitriptyline,

281
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:40,700
the very thing I had gone off of,
so I had to go back on it.

282
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,890
So it's a whole network,
a mesh of supplements,

283
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,080
drugs,
and lifestyle.

284
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,150
I don't the way normal people sleep.

285
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,560
I sleep from four o'clock in the morning
until eight o'clock in the morning.

286
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,550
I get up,

287
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,500
I listened to magazines on the kindle
while I'm taking my bath and shaving and

288
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:03,930
all that stuff.
I meet with my assistant,

289
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,790
I give her her marching
orders for the day.

290
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,670
I go back to sleep at 11
and I sleep until three,

291
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,180
and then I get up for my second work day.
Um,

292
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,790
and that's when I do all my writing
and all that kind of stuff. So you do,

293
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,190
you sleep in four hour chunks.

294
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,400
You four hour chunks because
that is better for you.

295
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,790
My body was refusing to
do the eight hour thing.

296
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,860
So one of the first symptoms
of, of cfs is insomnia. Okay.

297
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:32,310
Now, Joe, if your body is refusing
to sleep for eight hours straight,

298
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,480
listen to your body,
give it what the hell it wants.

299
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,950
And so these are the hours
my body demanded. Um,

300
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:41,881
and they,

301
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:46,560
I had been working often until eight
o'clock in the morning from roughly 11

302
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:50,040
o'clock at night or something like that
and losing track of time and it was very

303
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:54,480
disorienting. And once I started
this two periods of sleep, a day,

304
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,140
my day stabilized. Um,
and there's other stuff.

305
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,270
I mean listening to
Pandora you would think,

306
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,610
what does that have to do
with your illness? Well,

307
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:06,390
I work at a cafe that's a vital part of
things because I'm surrounded by people

308
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,940
and I've slowly build community in this
cafe, other workaholic writers like me,

309
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,810
a neuroscientist,
a novel novelist,

310
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,890
and all kinds of people who just sit
there and slave away all day. And,

311
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,940
but I'm listening to Pandora that gives
me a sense of life for some reason.

312
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:27,930
It's as it's as positive
as an elixir would be.

313
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,580
Um, and it gives me a sense of control
over my environment and I don't hear the

314
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:36,090
conversations going on around me,
so I can really focus on my work.

315
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,510
I've written four books
this way so far in cafes,

316
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,040
all of this stuff walking five
miles a day. I'm in two bursts.

317
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,940
I mean there I am going through a meadow
in the middle of a park at night. Uh,

318
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,200
how many New Yorkers do you know who
go out and walk through a park in the

319
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,050
middle of the night? Rob's, yeah,
right. That's what you'd think.

320
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,980
But I have the time of my life looking
up at the stars that live middle of the

321
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,410
meadow and being where
I'm not supposed to be.

322
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,180
And you're not supposed to go through
the park at night? Well they let you. Um,

323
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,380
I have been thrown up six times by
the police because I've overseen,

324
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,460
I've overstepped the boundaries.

325
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,820
I've been out there after one o'clock
and they do close the place at one and

326
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:18,570
throw us all out.
But no win in New York Lore,

327
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
unless you're walking a really big dog,

328
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,330
you do not go out and
to parks at night and,

329
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:29,331
but do you put this whole lifestyle
together and it's not just any individual

330
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:35,400
ingredient that's making me better.
I'm happier than I was when I was 19.

331
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm stronger than I walk a lot
more slowly than when I was 19.

332
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,980
But in terms of push
ups and other exercises,

333
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,810
I'm stronger than I was when I was 19
years old. That is a crazy journey.

334
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:49,260
Howard.
