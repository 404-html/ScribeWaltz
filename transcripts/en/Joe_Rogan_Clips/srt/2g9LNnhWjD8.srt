1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,810
Do you know about the Latin x thing?
I didn't know that was the thing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,280
You didn't know about that. What do you
mean? I was reading this article and yeah,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,270
it's, you know, you know, and
Latina are male and female.

4
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:13,410
Gender specific.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,120
So the word Latin also get,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,620
gets it done as far as,
yeah, I dunno. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,820
So it's supposed to be like,

8
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:28,821
that's how you Latin x that you're
supposed to say Latinex because it's just

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:35,310
new. It's, it's not. It's a couple
of years in the making and fuck off.

10
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,330
We'll see in Spanish,

11
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:39,150
the masculinized version of these
words just considered gender neutral,

12
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,490
but that obviously doesn't work
for some of us like myself.

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,680
And so I think it's appropriate to assign
a masculinity as gender neutral when

14
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,750
it isn't.
So I'm Latinex well,

15
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:53,040
it's interesting because my kids are Latin
and this is another one of the things

16
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,480
that we touch on to next. Yeah, there it
is. And we touch it. Oh, sorry. Go. No,

17
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:01,490
go ahead please. Well, we touch on this
a little, not this pronunciation or,

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,430
you know,

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,480
but we touch on that a little bit in
the movie of there is that feeling,

20
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:10,620
you know, when, when we went into adopt
our kids, we were just open. We were like,

21
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,990
look, we're, we're, we're
pretty general agewise we,

22
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,870
we didn't go in expecting
three kids, just, you know,

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,660
we thought one and it sort of turned
into that. But, uh, but you know,

24
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,440
you're open to it and you just, and, and
they ask you, well, what about ethnicity?

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,150
You know, and just go, yeah, whatever,
you know, wherever the need is,

26
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,170
you know, whoever needs parents,
you know, let us know. And,

27
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,190
but then when, when it happens
in your kids, and in my case,

28
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:42,070
my kids turned out to be Latin,
then you have the, you know,

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,890
you start to kind of think about like, oh,
well, you know, uh, is that, is that okay?

30
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,380
Is that kind of, you know, is that
gonna look like the white savior thing?

31
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:53,220
Is that gonna look weird? Is that I am
I, am I saying things right and whatever.

32
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,790
And what ends up happening is this
really wonderful thing where your family

33
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:01,530
becomes this melting pot where, you know,
at first, because of the, there's the,

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,230
the Times that we live in right now,
it is,

35
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:08,070
it's a little scary jumping into that
because you're thinking about what you

36
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,420
know, but you're, you know,

37
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,510
but you ultimately are just going
to think about who the kids are,

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,400
what their need is and how
obviously wonderful they are and,

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,430
but you,

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,600
but all of those things come up and that's
the kind of thing that wouldn't even

41
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,880
be, you know, why would that the,

42
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,640
the Latinex thing have anything to do
with my house. Well now it does. Yeah.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,760
So I've got, I've got all that,
you know, all the time and, and uh,

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,880
I actually find it really
interesting. The next thing, no, no,

45
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,070
not that specifically,
but just that,

46
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,760
that my family is now this little
melting pot. Yeah, that part's cool.

47
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,240
And it's cool. I reject Latinex
completely. Well, it is, it is cool.

48
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,580
But it's also very strange that that is a,

49
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,600
and it would be a real point of concern,
like you would worry about, you know,

50
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,430
how do I handle this,

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,300
this culture without cultural
appropriation. How do I,

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,110
how do I bring my kid,

53
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,780
embrace the Latino or Latinex culture?
Like what do I, how do I handle that?

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,040
Yeah. Yeah. And how do I do it without
getting call the racist? Right.

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,830
And it gets back to what I was talking
about before where you're trying to just

56
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,060
put your kids' needs first and
just deal with them as children,

57
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:20,980
as individuals, as human beings, you know?
And, but at the same time, you're also,

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,640
you're, you're with other parents and
there's in the adoption community,

59
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,820
in really an, in every direction, there's,

60
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,430
there's mixed race families and
the adoption community and, uh,

61
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:34,270
and you're kind of learning from
them. And it just, I dunno, it just,

62
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,480
it opens up a lot of conversations
with your own kids and,

63
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,050
and just the movies you watch,
the, the foods you eat sometimes.

64
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,530
And I think it's great. No, it's great.
I think it's really, you know, the, uh,

65
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,770
the language thing for me it stands out
more because my whole life I've said

66
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,671
Latino,

67
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,671
like my mother's Latina and it's just
funny to me to speak Spanish speaks

68
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,581
fluently,

69
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:58,420
which is hilarious because Tom has some
great stories about people not thinking

70
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,910
he speaks Spanish because when you
look at them and you're like, oh,

71
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,420
this fucking American guy. Yeah. It
looks like a regular American guy,

72
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,870
but he speaks perfect flu.

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,550
Like I've been around him before when
he asks people questions like, Whoa,

74
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,430
I forgot you could do that. Yeah.
Yeah. It's like someone who you know,

75
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,520
that could do back flips, right. And they
just do a back flip. You're like, oh,

76
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,740
I forgot you could do that. Yeah, it's
true. And that throw it throws people off.

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,650
Yeah, because you look so
American and that, you mean
you look like a guy. I mean,

78
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:28,630
if you have a guy loves football stuff,
fucking American,

79
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:32,830
irregular American, but he speaks
perfect. Enrolls the RS when you go.

80
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,790
Even when I travel abroad, like to
Spanish speaking countries, even there,

81
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,990
even though Spanish speaking countries
are also melting pots, you know,

82
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,590
they still look at you like, Oh shit,
like, you know this mother fucker,

83
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,700
it's really throws people want the most.

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,570
The craziest one wasn't even
with me and my sister who,

85
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,910
one of my sisters who also speak Spanish,
uh,

86
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,911
went to the Naval Academy's Linguistics
Center to in the navy and she was in the

87
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,560
navy for Awhile and uh,

88
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,480
she learned mandarin and it was really
intense, you know, was really intense.

89
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,380
And we went to a restaurant
together and the,

90
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,910
the guy who was one of those breasts,

91
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,100
like a Benihana tight where they
chop stuff up and the guy was a,

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,341
someone asks like,

93
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,960
where he's from and he said somewhere in
China and she starts speaking Mandarin

94
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,660
and he dropped the thing and he was like,
like he saw a ghost and,

95
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:32,320
and she's spitting back to him
and pretty fluent Mandarin.

96
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,760
Wow. And he stops. And he was like, I've
never seen this before. And he's like,

97
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,420
I've never seen a white person do this.
And we were like, yeah, it's pretty,

98
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,190
pretty wild, Huh. And then
he turned to us, he goes,

99
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,860
I don't think you understand how
hard it is to speak this language.

100
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,630
And I was like, I have a pretty good
idea, I can't do it. So you know,

101
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,000
and then just watching it,
he was just like,

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,650
he couldn't even start cooking
your sister to learn. Um,

103
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,670
well she was in, when you
sign, when you get in to the,

104
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,350
like that Naval Institute program,
they have you going,

105
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,600
I think it was something like eight
hours a day, five or six days a week.

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,940
So it's really,
it's super into,

107
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:14,990
it's almost like learning
mandarin and it overwhelms people.

108
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:18,920
People drop out almost like in
a physical stress way. You know,

109
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,380
some people just can't
handle it like bootcamp.

110
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,940
And I forget how long she was in and
you know, she didn't reach the level of,

111
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:30,800
I'm super, you know, fluent
like we're speaking English.

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,460
But she was able to communicate
in Mandarin. Can she read it?

113
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,200
She was reading and writing.

114
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:39,980
That's the thing is she was telling me
one time about how many characters and

115
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,281
you know,

116
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:44,730
it was just unbelievable and like there's
sounds for expressions like I'm going

117
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,760
to screw up cause I don't remember it.
But she was like,

118
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,250
you can do something like,
oh,

119
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,410
and that means like means
an actual phrase, you know,

120
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,960
like there's so many and that,
uh,

121
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,610
that there's characters that
mean entire expressions as well.

122
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:02,200
That I was like,

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,010
it's just our brains are so married to
our alphabet and way of speaking that

124
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,690
gets a real jump to, to learn
that, you know, it's just,

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
it really is fascinating when you travel
and you listen to people speaking their

126
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,350
native tongue and you realize
how strangely different
languages are across the

127
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,360
entire planet. Yeah. I
mean, just unbelievable.

128
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,880
Like I was in Thailand this summer
and you listen to people talk,

129
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:30,860
tie and everything. Ah, everything
stretches. It's got like a stretch to it,

130
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,450
you know? It's like a weird, Huh? There's
W it's just very odd language. I'm like,

131
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,000
compare that to like German or Dutch.
Yeah.

132
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,210
Like the Germans got those hard
sounding really hard. Yeah.

133
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,910
It's like this weird difference. Yeah,
and the Latin one, the Latin root word,

134
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,760
like languages do have a flowy singy side.

135
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,280
They're kind of a nice to listen to.
It's a beautiful language.

136
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,430
It's really nice to listen to. I mean, I
like listening. I don't speak Portuguese.

137
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:03,870
I like listening to it. Yeah. Brazilian
Portuguese is amazing. Sounds so cool.

138
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,360
And I listen to them. We listen
to French music sometimes at home.

139
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,850
Just in the kitchen. Yeah.
Yeah. Like cooking or something.

140
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't know what the hell are saying.
I like it when I write.

141
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,000
I listen to Spanish music when I write
because I have no idea what they're

142
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,260
saying.
I can do that too,

143
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,170
where you're listening to music at a
foreign language so that it doesn't,

144
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:22,620
it doesn't, it doesn't distract. Yeah,
yeah. Yeah. It's like, it sounds good.

145
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:23,820
It gives me a little something,
something,

146
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:26,490
but I can still think about the exact
things that I'm thinking about. Well,

147
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:29,610
I recently had this interesting
experience. I sent you one of them,

148
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:33,120
but you know the trailers
for the movie get a, Oh yeah.

149
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,540
The movie itself and the trailers get
dubbed into all kinds of different

150
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,440
languages. So you have this dialogue
that, that I wrote, you know,

151
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:44,520
or me John Road or whatever, and you get
to hear it in these different languages.

152
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:48,720
And I sent you the Spain. Spanish. Yeah.
Yeah. It's different. And I don't really,

153
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,460
I'm not gonna pretend that
I understand that much.

154
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,170
What the difference between between it is,

155
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,130
but that's predominantly what you speak,
right? No, no, it, no, not mother.

156
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:00,870
What I speak predominantly is just like
specifically South American and more

157
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:05,580
specifically or Peruvian dot. Oh,
okay. All right, great. So, but I mean,

158
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:09,570
I did study, I studied in Madrid
for six months and once your,

159
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,460
your ears are trained to it,

160
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,150
you can listen to someone say a
sentence and know that it's, oh,

161
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,990
that's from Spain. Like that's you.
Then there's the Cuban version of it,

162
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,650
which is crazy
version of the way they,

163
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,790
all the island dialects sound
dramatically different. You know,

164
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,290
like if you listen to somebody from Cuba,
Puerto Rico,

165
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,060
is it a comparison like English speakers
from America versus English speakers

166
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:40,080
from Ireland? [inaudible] it is.
Yeah. Um, and I would say, you know,

167
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,840
I always think of a Spain as like our
Britain, you know, in a way like the,

168
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:49,800
the language properly English is from
England. That's where the language,

169
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:54,510
that is how you speak it, Spanish
and uh, gas yet Castilian you know,

170
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,500
that comes from Spain, they're
speaking, Oh gee, Spanish.

171
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,910
And then it all kind of came over here
and it's influenced in every country has

172
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,470
different ways of saying things
different. Obviously different slang, um,

173
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,760
all different curses, all different
expressions. Completely different.

174
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,080
Even words like as simple as like
to pick up, you know, go ahead,

175
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,090
pick something up.
You know,

176
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:21,730
you say that in a Mexico or Argentina,

177
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:26,010
it literally means to fuck. So really?
Yeah. So if you're like, you know,

178
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,800
cuticle hideous tower,
like you're trying to,

179
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,080
you're saying I want to
fuck this water. Yeah, but

180
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,710
just not what they, I'm going
to fuck this bottle. Yeah. Yeah.

181
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,140
My mom told me that she was in a,
in Argentina,

182
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,370
like when her youth and traveled there
and it was with a bellhop and she was

183
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,430
like, go hit made up my letter,
which is like pickup that suitcase.

184
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,050
But he was like, okay, cause
she was basically in slang
saying fuck my suitcase,

185
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,620
you know? So it's just
by like, there's like,

186
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,870
there's also like severity of words,
like hold aid is the word.

187
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,510
Like there's so many ways to say fuck,
of course in every language.

188
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,760
But holidayed in Spain is like, is saying
fuck. It's like going like, oh fuck.

189
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,770
But like when you say it in Peru, no,
my wholeness, it's a, it's a softer,

190
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,360
it's not taken as severely. So it's
not, it's not red the same way.

191
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,070
You're not saying, you're saying,
uh, like you're complaining,

192
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,050
but you're like, I don't,
it's like, it's taken as like,
oh, don't mess with me. Wow.

193
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,050
You know? So like even when I
would say when I would go Spain,

194
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:34,930
like they were like, damn, you curse a
lot. I was like, really? And then they,

195
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,180
you know, we, we went over that one and
then like six months later they were like,

196
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,520
you actually do curse a lot all
the time. And I was like, yeah,

197
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,540
that's probably right.
