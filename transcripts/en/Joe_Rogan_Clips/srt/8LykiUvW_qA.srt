1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,410
Without, we say are the best, I'm
gonna fail to sell them the best.

2
00:00:02,411 --> 00:00:05,140
And so I get defeated, you know, and um,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,820
right now I'm in a candidate for,
you know, fight of the year and also,

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,960
you know, uh, fight,
uh, fights of the year.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,390
I didn't have the cane,
I came back with Louisa,

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,000
a tease that was an epic one
and it came back with theory,

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,970
another app we fight and then
we're going to hit the two again.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,240
That's the thing about you that makes
it interesting is that you're not just a

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,000
guy who knocks guys out,
but you're a guy who can take it,

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,880
your guy who can take it and you're
a guy who figures out a way to win.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,330
There's a lot of guys that when it's
going bad, they don't come back.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,180
When it's going good, they went
forever. But when it's gone bad,

13
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:38,380
it's hard for them to come back.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,060
You figure your way through bad
situations and you make adjustments

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,680
even when something is
going wrong with my body.

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,100
I didn't have seven operations
on my arm, you know, it'd be

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,680
like surgery breaking, you know, just
breaking my arm turned my boss up, um,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,980
break breaking my hand. You know,
many times in my, in my fights,

19
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:05,270
I broken my hands and still
fought, you know, tore my boss.

20
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:08,800
He'll come in with third degree burns,
you know, all that stuff. Like I'm a,

21
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,230
I'm a true warrior, you know,
I always think I'm like,

22
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:17,250
if I do something, like if I break my hand
or when I told my boss up in the ring,

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,460
my whole mentality is training,
change it to what?

24
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:23,100
That motherfucker had a fall off. That's
why I'm glad I got to keep fighting.

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,710
I got to keep going.
I'm a warrior, you know,

26
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,711
and you can never tell you no because
I still throw it with bad intention.

27
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,910
You know, I'm still, you
know, lending and hitting it.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,790
Just like with the Chris Areola fight.
When I broke my hand and tore my bicep,

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,730
my camp,
my team knew I broke my hand,

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,100
but I didn't mention I tore
my bicep cause I'm like,

31
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:47,940
well I tell them I don't want no one
to panic. I'm not worried about it.

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,660
I'm going to keep throwing it.
I got to keep me in.

33
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:53,130
Chris was so surprised that I did all
these things that we're still able to

34
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:57,540
throw it. It's just a mentality when it
comes to comeback, like my mentality,

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,970
just overall logist I feel I'm the best
and if you're going to come and beat me,

36
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:06,810
you got to come and beat me.
He's just not going to be easy.

37
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,940
That's why most of the guys,
when they fight me,

38
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,270
they bring their a game every
last one of them, you know,

39
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,050
because they know it's going to be tough
and they also know I have the power to

40
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:18,900
get them out of there. You
know, and a lot of guys,

41
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,710
you know that they're afraid of that
because I mean over and over again,

42
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:26,550
like I said, my power last from
the first through the 12th round,

43
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:31,320
you can never be too comfortable with
me because of that, you know? And,

44
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:34,920
and that's big for me to have. You know,

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,920
I've always sat back and like saying,
you know,

46
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:40,120
I've said the same question
myself. Like, damn well you,

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,940
you got all this power light and you know,
me being the person with it,

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,270
I felt many times where I felt dangerous.
I felt like,

49
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,520
I felt like at times it can be too much
power because I get scared of myself at

50
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,521
times because I know I got the potential
to potential to hurt someone seriously.

51
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,480
You know,
just Dylan when it,

52
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,140
just looking back and seeing some of
the guys I've knocked out and seeing the

53
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,150
reactions and you know,

54
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,290
the unim broke guys arms out and
broke the ice soccer is to, you know,

55
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,810
put them in seizures,
you know,

56
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,370
almost killed speaker in New
York. You know, he laid there for,

57
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,240
for a while. You know, I didn't
even see him breathing, you know,

58
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,940
and so forth and so on.
You know,

59
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,610
it's been amazing to have so much power,

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,010
but still trying to understand it.
