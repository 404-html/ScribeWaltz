1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,950
Right,
there should be massive.

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:06,540
So social pressure against those kinds
of noxious political commitments.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,040
But if someone misspeaks or it's an off
color joke and they weren't as like,

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,550
they weren't trying to offend
anyone and they're just, you know,

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,270
they wish they could take it back and
like, and, and, and that links up with,

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,100
I mean, did you say you must've
seen the norm macdonald? Yes.

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,280
I mean that was brutal. Yeah. Right.
Like at what he was, you know,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,260
he knew he couldn't use the word
retard. Right. Because it's like that,

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,310
that's gonna get them in trouble. And so,
I mean, it, it, it's hilarious. In fact,

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,930
what happened. Okay, so he was, he was
on Howard stern show, wasn't he? I think,

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,860
I think so. Saw a, he was, I could have
this wrong, but the gist of this is,

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,723
is right.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,740
I believe he's on the Howard
stern show and he was a bounty.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,740
Use the word retard. So, so,
okay, we'll walk this back now.

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,380
Now it's coming back to me.
He was defend.

16
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:01,540
He was talking about his friend,
the,

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,570
the ordeal that Louis C K has gone through
in this just massive exile experience,

18
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,810
right. That there's massive
social shunning. Uh,

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,310
and he said he,
he was describing it in a way where it,

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,710
he then got accused that he was cared
more about what Louis CK was going

21
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:23,490
through. Then the women who felt it
felt very victimized by Louis C k.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,410
And that was not his intention at all
apparently. And so when he went to, uh,

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,850
to clarify this, he was
about to say, but you,

24
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:36,230
you'd have to be retarded to think
that I cared more about Lucy Kay.

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,360
His ordeal than the ordeal of
these women who had, you know,

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,100
felt like their careers got derailed.
Right.

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,750
But as the word retard was come a retard,
it was coming out of his mouth,

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,560
he tried to course correct and because
he doesn't know what the fuck he's

29
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,330
talking about. He says you'd have to
have downs syndrome. Right, right.

30
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,980
Which is worse, right. As more
specific. And of course, like,

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,760
and then you've got all these
parents with down syndrome who are,

32
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,600
who have kids with down syndrome
who are just, Oh my God.

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,030
And so now he's just, he's, then
he was, he showed up on the view,

34
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:10,950
right, with this, this, uh,
uh, on, on this apology tour.

35
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,720
And I mean, that's just amazing video to
see him on the view surrounded by these,

36
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,710
these four women who know he's not a
bad guy. Right? Like they're trying,

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,330
they're trying to,

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,020
they're throwing them a lifeline after
lifeline and he's so beaten down. Right?

39
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:28,050
Yeah. And he's so walking on eggshells
and you got Whoopi Goldberg, you know,

40
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:32,370
trying to just pull him back,
you know, from the lions.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,860
And, um, it should be, I mean,

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,380
it should be so straightforward.
Like it does it,

43
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,570
is it part of norms,

44
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,630
goal to cause pain for parents who
have kids with mental disabilities,

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,070
right? No, I mean like, and
like, like you, you can look in,

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,100
you can look into this guy's eyes for t
for 10 seconds and know that this is not

47
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:02,710
the big at, you're worried it. Right.
Right. Of course, you know, and um,

48
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,150
and yet people just want him destroyed
overnight. I don't know if they still do,

49
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,250
but it's like the moment like it
was, you know, I think it was a,

50
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,910
a real concern that has his show would
get canceled and be like, this wasn't,

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,500
well it hasn't been there
just for a second season.

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,950
And one of the things that's
maybe that's part of the problem.

53
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,360
It is part of the problem. He was,
he was devastated. I mean, um,

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,340
I'm very good friends with Adam Egan.
He's a guy that runs the comedy store,

55
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:30,400
is the talent director at the comedy
store and he's been on norm show.

56
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,280
He was on norms.
He was like norm sidekick on a show.

57
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,290
He's a very good friend with norm.

58
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,130
And norm really suffered from this in a
way that he never suffered from anything

59
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,440
in his career in terms of
like his own personal feeling.

60
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,440
Like he was devastated by it,
by the blowback and a reaction.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,080
And he wanted to come on my podcast
and talk about it. But Netflix is like,

62
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:52,960
get the fuck Netflix had no press.
Don't do anything. No press.

63
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,340
Okay. So the fact that you
can't talk your way out of gas,

64
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,900
that's the fucking disease.
Well,

65
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,060
the problem is not that you
can't talk your way out of it.

66
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:03,730
The problem is that they wouldn't even
let him attempt to talk your way out of

67
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:04,181
it because they,

68
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:08,170
I think they realized that norms a maniac
and norm is a maniac in the best sense

69
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:11,590
of the word was one of my favorite comics
and he's hilarious. Fucking hilarious.

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,310
But he's also completely crazy in
the best way possible. Right. Norman?

71
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,200
I randomly in some strange way randomly
were seated next to each other on two

72
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:24,310
separate flights. Oh yeah. Just
randomly. It's crazy. Like norm again,

73
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,090
like this is crazy. And we had a great
time just talking the entire flight.

74
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:33,040
And um, we were talking about cigarette
smoking or like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,620
I used to smoke. I'm so glad I quit.
Fucking terrible for you, you know? Yeah.

76
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,480
I mean it's just, but I always wanted
a cigarette and then it'd be gambling.

77
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,690
I want a cigarette, but I quit. Fuck, fuck
cigarettes. Like how long did you quit?

78
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,630
And you're like, ah, I've, I haven't
had a cigarette in years. I'm like, oh,

79
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:50,620
that's great. We land at LAX.
He goes right into a store
and buy cigarettes. I go,

80
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,590
what are you doing? He goes, all that,
talk a cigarettes. I just want one now.

81
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,460
He was lighting it on the way out the
door. He couldn't get out the door.

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,130
He lit it before he did.

83
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,380
You know the automatic door
he was before it was opening.

84
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:06,550
He was lighting that cigarette. I
was like, you crazy. But that's many.

85
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,300
Many comedians are incredibly impulsive
and this is norm. I mean he just,

86
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,820
I mean he's got such a,
he's so off kilter.

87
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,280
He's got a sort of Garry Shandling and
create like you don't know what's going

88
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:21,280
to come out of his mouth extemporaneously.
Yes, but okay, we, we have to be,

89
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,240
let's put this back into
the diversity Olympics.

90
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,110
We need some respect for
neuro diversity. Yes. Right.

91
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:33,250
There are people who are somewhere
on the spectrum toward autism, right?

92
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,330
There's people who are there spectrums
we don't even know about. We are,

93
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,350
we haven't named for sure and everyone
is in some weird spot and people

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,320
misspeak, right. There has to be a way
back to say that's not what I meant.

95
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,011
Right.
Like,

96
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:53,011
like this is like offending people of
this type was not my intention at some

97
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,340
level that has to good enough unless,
you know,

98
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,420
we open your closet and we see that
you've got swastika is all you know,

99
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,340
everywhere, you know, and um,

100
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,040
so I think we have to, we have
to hold the line here, you know,

101
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,540
and very few people are in a position to
be able to do it. I mean, he's, you know,

102
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,690
like you know, Netflix, Netflix
doesn't feel it can do it. Well,

103
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:23,691
Netflix is just so terrified of continual
blowback and they just thought like,

104
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:24,900
if we're going to save this show,

105
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,240
the way to save it as to get him to stop
talking because he's just going to just

106
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,960
take his other foot and
take other people's feet and
stuffed them in his mouth

107
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:31,650
as well.

108
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,650
I think one thing that might help to
illuminate our understanding of how people

109
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:41,040
behave is what you really enjoy talking
about and you really definitely changed

110
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,350
my way of looking at things.
Um,

111
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,200
that they're really essentially
the concept of free.

112
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:50,100
Will's a very flawed thing and that you
have to really take any consideration

113
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,270
who a person is right now and what,

114
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:56,250
what has caused them to be this person
right now and that a lot of us are

115
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:59,490
operating on this really
bizarre momentum of,

116
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,600
of our past and our behavior
and our genetics and life
experiences and all these

117
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:06,300
different variables that really
need to be taken into account.

118
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,650
This idea that you are autonomous and
you are the director of your own life is

119
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:14,670
true to a certain extent,
but it's also very complicated,

120
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:17,010
much more complicated than
we would like to admit.

121
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,330
And when you're talking about something
that happened when you were 17 like

122
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:24,750
Brett Kavanaugh or something like that,
like, yeah, but Jesus Christ, you know,

123
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:26,220
you're going to hold a 55 man,

124
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,700
55 year old man accountable to something
that he did when he was 17 it wasn't a

125
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:34,590
crime and you're not exactly sure what
happened. This is all very strange.

126
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:35,730
This is a very strange stuff.
