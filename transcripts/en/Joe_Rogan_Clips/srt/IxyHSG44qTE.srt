1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,430
Her low freak bitches. What are the
things that you're seeing these days?

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,660
I wanted to bring this up with
you. Now that you're here, Jamie,

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:08,790
pull up my Twitter profile.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,410
There was a tweet that I posted last
night that I found this guy got in trouble

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:17,640
for a fucking joke and he
wound up leaving this, uh,

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:21,840
this company that, uh, I think
he's involved in video games.

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,990
He's been on Dave Rubin's show and
Dave Rubin was a raving about him.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,480
Look at this.
Look what this Guy Ron,

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,290
let's click on the one on the left
right there. This is what he wrote. Ah,

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,980
peace and quiet hashtag a day
without a woman just to fucking joke.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,890
Just real simple Joe. Now
go to the next one. Jamie.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,930
Look with the fucking international
business times wrote kind of funny.

13
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:46,931
He's Colin Moriarity resigns after
targeting women in racist joke.

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,650
Insist it's his personal
decision to resign racist.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,490
Did you see your race known as
women or women of fucking race?

16
00:00:56,491 --> 00:01:00,410
Now did you know that that a
dad joke about women is racist.

17
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:05,130
That gets some brain surgeons over
there. Ib Times got, wow, that's crazy.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,250
Get Some Vac of vacancies for real
journalists to click on that, that,

19
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,470
that quote again, look at this
international business times. Fuck you.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,240
Why did he resign?
Whoever this guy is,

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,960
what does this guy by Mike Lewis
Sluices Luke's is whatever you name is.

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,110
Fuck you man. That is
what you are doing, right?

23
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,810
That is virtue signaling
at its very worst.

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,800
You know that's not a racist joke
that that what you did is you,

25
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,970
you targeted that guy,
you went after that guy and you,

26
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,860
you did it in a very deceptive way.
That is it is. If anything, it's,

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
it's just a joke and you might
not like it. You might think,

28
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:45,060
well that's not really good if you're
working in an environment with women,

29
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:47,850
you know, like you don't want to hear
them talk like that might be sexist.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,830
It's a fucking joke and saying
that it's racist. Is it?

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,060
That is so fucking deceptive and
manipulative and they think I flipped back

32
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:59,220
though. Calamari all, I
don't know why he resigned.

33
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,890
Maybe they're going to fire him, but
what's this guy's article say? Well,

34
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,590
how does he tie in race so that it's
got to be that he has to have something

35
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,510
that go to the, let's go to the article.
There's no, there's no fucking connection.

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,700
How could there be a connection unless
y'all know, unless that's a race,

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,830
unless women are a fucking race.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,990
It's just crazy that someone would think
that it's okay to do that. I liked it.

39
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,970
This guy is punching back though.
I kind of liked it.

40
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,980
He's not just taking
the quietly apologizing.

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,090
Well he quit whatever
organization that is. Um,

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,990
that he was working for kind of funny
and just decided and so many people that

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,760
he was working with shit on him for that
joke. It's just a Goddamn joke. And what,

44
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:43,500
why is everybody so sensitive today and
is it that they're so sensitive or is it

45
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:47,160
that they're super ready to jump
down other people's throats?

46
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:50,160
Because they sense that this
is a very hostile environment.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,560
And when you tell jokes, people
are, what, what are you doing?

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,400
Is this it okay when
you, oh, he updated it.

49
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,640
And by the way,
people,

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,600
I don't think it's the people who took
down the word racist as raised it lost.

51
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,980
You described it as a joke tweeted
by comic, I was racist. It was not.

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,250
The article has been changed to
reflect this. Still Fuck you. Fuck you.

53
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,000
Fuck you man. This is, we've
got a real problem today.

54
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,660
And that people are jumping down
people's throats for jokes and they're,

55
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,820
they're doing it because they sense
that they're soft targets, that it's,

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,210
there's going to be a pylon and
they sense the pile on the goal. Oh,

57
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,340
this guy made a joke about women.

58
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,920
Let's get him a bunch of people going
to be getting them. This is a free shot.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,470
It's kicking someone while they're down.
It's what it is.

60
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:35,160
It's a drunk girl at the party and
you're sticking it right in her ass. He,

61
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:39,000
it's basically the same thing.
They're mean the same thing. No,

62
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,920
but it's the same shitty mentality
behind it. It's that people like, uh,

63
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,110
people, uh, they don't feel offended.
They just feel it's a chance to be mean.

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,380
And you can be mean to someone who does
something fucked up or says something

65
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,900
racist or whatever. So yeah,
people are just content.

66
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,900
That joke is every episode of
married with children. It is.

67
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,790
It's every episode patient. Quite,
yeah. David, a woman, Sha, quiet,

68
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,010
peaceful family come on every episode of,
of um, the honeymooners. So same thing.

69
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,310
That was the word to the moon, Alice.
It was threatening beating her.

70
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,570
I know with his fist

71
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,710
punching her into interstellar space
and it was so great with that though.

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,630
There's literally people
would criticize that,

73
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:23,500
but she was like the first feminist
on TV because she won every exchange.

74
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,080
She was,
she was always right.

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,410
He was at the big dumb fat cell
and he was always fucking up.

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,850
He does get mad and he would always get
mad and she would all the writing and

77
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,560
that the fucking,
the,

78
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,780
there'll be emasculating line she had
there that some of the best lines.

79
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,860
I don't want my salary to leak out
your salary. Couldn't drip out. Oh,

80
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,570
what a fucking great line here.
Right. Your salary couldn't drip out.

81
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,320
It's a great show. Humiliating.
And you know what, one,

82
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:53,550
another thing about that show that was
so great about the honeymooners and well

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,070
that was the last one. A lot of
previous sitcoms. No, I mean this is a,

84
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,720
there was a groundbreaking new thing at
the time that was a, it was on a cow,

85
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,140
I think. Cavalcade it was
called. It was some like the,

86
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,090
all the y'all lost ones are like, some
of them are 15 minutes, 20 minutes.

87
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:08,620
They were part of it as a sketch show.

88
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,770
The honeymooners was a sketch in
an overall show. It'd be like,

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,820
it was like dice when he started.

90
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:17,630
He was just dice as a character in any
Clay's act. That's what that was. Wow.

91
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,610
It just became this thing which
didn't do well and they uh,

92
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,950
came back years later,
but so funny.

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,980
But you could never do that shit today
when you can do it all in the family.

94
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:30,400
You can do it. There was a million
movies that you couldn't do.

95
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,830
You know what I mean?
You try watching like older movies.

96
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,070
What was it that we looked at
recently in that we were lucky.

97
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
There's no way you could do that today.
There was a,

98
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:42,010
an old movie that was a really fucking
funny movie from like the nineties I

99
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,940
remember which one. It won't kill
a mockingbird guy. He's a guy.

100
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,710
He's a bad guesser or not. Definitely.
You probably couldn't do that one either.

101
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,420
No, it was like one of those, Oh, oh, it
was national Lampoon's vacation. I'm like,

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,690
good Lord. I watch national
Lampoon's vacation and she's like,

103
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,520
there's no fucking way you could do that
movie today. There we go. We get to,

104
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,360
I don't remember it.
I've seen it was sexist and eh,

105
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,890
you mean every massage and
Dick? Like everything. Yeah,

106
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,420
like there's no humor.
Like humor has to be,

107
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,280
it has to pass like these
rigid filters now. Yeah.

108
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,660
It's not as simple as say
something inappropriate,

109
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,030
but it's still funny that you
don't necessarily mean like,

110
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,120
one of my favorite comics and I think a
great at one of the greatest of all time,

111
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,570
is Roseanne Barr.
I really put her as very funny.

112
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,050
I put her as one of the most important
comics of all time because I think that

113
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:29,240
what Roseanne did was she,

114
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,430
she had that powerful fuck
you comedy as a woman.

115
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,810
And it was really one of the first ever,
cause women were more sedate in there,

116
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,300
even if they were really
good comics like Joan Rivers.

117
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,360
It was a different sort
of style of delivery.

118
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,430
But Roseanne came out like a
hardcore man club comic. Yeah.

119
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,180
You know, and she was shitting on her
husband for being a fucking loser.

120
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:56,390
It'd be at fat.
And it was just hard and slamming.

121
00:06:56,391 --> 00:07:01,250
And I didn't take offense as a man. I
didn't hear those jokes and going, yeah,

122
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,280
I can't believe she shitting on man.
Can't believe she's shitting on man.

123
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,320
It was just funny to stop this.
This is success.

124
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,860
And it was so this guy saying, uh,
you know, a peace and quiet, like,

125
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm sorry if you're not a Yappy cunt, that
joke shouldn't offend you. Right. Okay.

126
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,390
If you're a person who's a
great conversationalist and
you also happen to have a

127
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:24,320
vagina that shouldn't bother you, even in
the slightest. And it probably doesn't.

128
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,011
It's just like,
oh,

129
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,200
I know that should bother me so
I'm going to be shitty about it.

130
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,510
I don't even think people care that much.
I think they just liked to,

131
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,130
to attack other people.
Exactly.

132
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,920
That's what I'm talking about and that's
why fuck you to that guy who wrote that

133
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,010
article and especially fuck you
because he called him a racist. Yeah.

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,860
He did that on purpose because he
knew it was going to be clickbait.

135
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,620
Who's going to get people to go to that
article and it was good to get people

136
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:44,970
more excited about it without
even reading it. Yeah.

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,710
Cause all they need is the article.
Most people are so fucking busy,

138
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,720
they don't have time to
read the whole thing.

139
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,990
They're so quick to pull the trigger.
