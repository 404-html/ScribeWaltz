1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,780
No, it's a different era. You
have to accept as a different era.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,110
You just, people were different. Look,

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:11,520
people are changing and it's a really
interesting obvious sign that things that

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,940
were super acceptable.
And when was this in living color?

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:19,800
I want to say it was like (929)
029-0490 two [inaudible] 94 yeah.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,830
So that the way you could do certain bits
and what you get away with and put on

7
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:30,420
television, it was just different.
So I think that's one of the,

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,450
like probably one of the least understood
things that's happening with us with

9
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,950
social media is as the rapid
evolution of what's acceptable,

10
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:45,780
not acceptable anymore. And it's changing
very quickly. In terms of subjects,

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,450
in terms of the way you approach things,

12
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:52,500
in terms of like obvious
bigotry or obvious bias,

13
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,510
it's like it's all
getting very highlighted.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:55,581
Well the,

15
00:00:55,581 --> 00:01:00,581
I think the big question is whether or
not you see an artist as somebody who's

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,420
taking their inner vision and putting
it out and you go for the ride or you

17
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:07,310
don't.
Or is it,

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,140
are we supposed to be representing society
in our standup or is it all supposed

19
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,070
to be fair,

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,020
balanced representations of
different ethnic groups and genders?

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,220
You know, and it's like, when did it
all have to become a morality tale?

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,630
When did every depiction of every
race have to be fair? You know,

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,030
can't you have an asshole who's black?

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,160
Can't you have a killer who's gay
without it becoming a depiction of that

25
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,590
entire, you know, subgroup?

26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,421
Yeah.

27
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:42,421
It's like w w what are our real
problem is that prejudice does exist.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,570
So when it does exist, you kind of look
for it and things and you say, hey,

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,140
this has the characteristics of prejudice.
I see this here.

30
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:53,740
I see what you're doing here that I think
this is prejudice. And we say, no, no, no.

31
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:58,360
This is making fun of Puerto Rican men.
This is not prejudice. Yeah. This is,

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,230
uh,

33
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,150
an account of real occurrences
that I've turned into humor.

34
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,050
Yeah. The, the flamboyant
masculinity of Puerto Rican men.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,790
I mean like in New York,
like that's if you,

36
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:17,500
if you thought of a type
of a Latino sort of, uh,

37
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,420
the bravado, you know, the music,
the food, everything spicy.

38
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,620
If you can't make fun of that,
come on.

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,510
I Know Collin Quinn does a whole
thing about how racist, right?

40
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,300
Puerto Ricans who never inside or outside,
they're always both.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,290
There's always a window open. People
on the inside and outside of talking,

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,270
the car door is always open. They're
half in the car. They're half right.

43
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,060
This isn't racist. This is
observation. Can I take an option?

44
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,950
Can I tell you that yesterday,

45
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:49,060
about twice a week I go to this Japanese
market in Mar Vista and they've got all

46
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:50,860
different kinds of, uh, you know,

47
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:55,861
you can get Sushi tempura whatever the
parking lot for this place because 80% of

48
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:02,770
the people that are Asian film it and
put it on a fucking television channel.

49
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,710
It is, it is just people.
Why don't you produce it?

50
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,960
I could announce it like I was Adj Foy.
You're an Emmy award winning writer.

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,200
You could actually do something like that.
He was like a legit writer,

52
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:18,100
you could totally produced that.
Can you imagine announced it like Nascar.

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,270
It's just people like not getting how
to get out of a parking spot with us

54
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:27,271
taking like eight k turns and people on
the wrong side of the street and backing

55
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,280
up without looking over the shoulders
and they're all Asian and it's fucking

56
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,840
hilarious. I didn't, I didn't tell them
to do it. I didn't say it was wrong,

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,393
but it's happening.

58
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,380
Yeah. Dave explained it, um,

59
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,310
why it's a stereotype,
but why also why Asian people would,

60
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:50,050
um, be more likely to walk
straight. And you know,

61
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,790
like if you, if you go to a China or if
you go to any of those, uh, Asian company,

62
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,060
uh, Asian countries, when people
walk straight at each other,

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,750
they all kind of have this way of touching
and they just, there's so many people,

64
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:04,600
they're just grinding past each
other, right? So, yeah. Yeah.

65
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,180
So when you're in China in particular,

66
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,340
people are like indifferent to bumping
into you. It doesn't bother them at all.

67
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,700
They just bump into you.
Like if you're in the aisle of a plane,

68
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,010
they just bump into you.
Yeah. Like they'll do it.

69
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,430
The little kids just walk right through
it. Right. It's just, that's how they did.

70
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,910
It's not rude, just like how's culturally
different because it's more crowded.

71
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,940
Why can't you comment on that?
Or could you comment on that?

72
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:31,060
If that's a real thing. Cause that is
a real thing. They do do that. Yeah.

73
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,940
They also do a lot of great stuff.
I mean, it's not like you're not,

74
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,210
it's a negative judgment on the
entire race because they have this one

75
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:42,040
characteristic. But to ignore
that one characteristic
seems crazy. Yeah. It's like,

76
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,800
why can't I talk about
something like I'm not,

77
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,750
it's not mean I'm not a bad person to
talk about a real thing that you see and I

78
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,200
see.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,460
Yeah. Like what is that? I get,
I can't booed on stage sometimes.

80
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:59,050
Now that never used to happen for
what? What'd he say? I did a joke.

81
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,440
We don't have to say the joke,
but just like, I'll say it,

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,380
I don't care because I don't think it's
offensive, but this, but this person did.

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,150
And it was, uh, you know, I, I go, oh,
it's girl, it's girl scout cookie season.

84
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,390
Those little horrors are out there
popping up their tables wherever you are

85
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,030
selling those stale, shitty, overpriced.

86
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,780
But you buy them cause it makes you
feel good. Like you're a good person,

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,440
you know?

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,410
And then you walk through the parking
lot in some black kid comes up with a box

89
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:26,740
of snickers gone, hey, we use support
my basketball team. And you're like,

90
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,750
that's a fucking scamps

91
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,110
guy goes, Ooh, they're
not all skin. I'm like,

92
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,960
that's not what we're
saying. Stupid. Yeah.
