1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello Freak bitches. Oh, you know,

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:07,650
I mean it is interesting to hear people's
take on the climate issue because

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,490
there's hard left and hard, right.
Hard, right. Is it's a cycle.

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:14,070
It's always happened this way and you're,
you're impeding business.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,460
Hard left is we're all going to die
and then Miami's going to drown.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,320
I mean an Al Gore dirty predicted in
that movie an inconvenient truth that we

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,280
were going to be covered
in water in 2014 right.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,460
Wasn't it 2014 they were predicting that
the ocean levels are gonna rise to the

9
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:32,080
point where we're going to have to start
evacuating some of the coastal cities.

10
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:35,020
That's right. He missed that one
just by a little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,690
But eight came out with another movie.
12 people.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,910
So inconvenient truth
and um, nobody, nobody,

13
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:43,740
I just watched it I don't think,

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:48,660
but it's you see bill Nye when he
was on Tucker Carlson show. No,

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,770
it was very interesting.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,010
It's very interesting cause I'm bill
Nye who's not really a scientist.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,900
What is he? Is he at? He's
an end just in an engineer's
engineer. That's, yeah. Just,

18
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,130
you know,
based to have to be smart.

19
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:04,380
But he calls himself
Bill Nye the science guy.

20
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:06,450
He's bothered by the way
as an Undergrad degree.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,670
So I don't even nice to have a phd.

22
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:12,600
I got one day and they were uh,

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,590
they were talking about climate
change and Tucker Carlson said,

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,390
I'm willing to absolutely believe that
people have an impact on climate change.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,130
He goes,
but can you tell me how much?

26
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,230
And then bill and I kind of got
flustered and you know, he, he,

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,960
he got like a little confrontational,
defensive.

28
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,920
It's really kind of interesting because
Tucker kept pestering him like we're

29
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,000
talking about science.

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,380
So I would like you to tell me how
much of an impact have people had.

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,620
What are the numbers? Is it a narrow
range? Cause you give me a narrow range.

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,220
It's just what he does is he publicizes
science for his own personal benefit.

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,290
Is that terrible show on Netflix?
Bill Nye saves the World Bitchy,

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,320
not saving shit. Okay. You can't call,
you show Bill Nye saves the fucking world.

35
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:02,190
You're not saving the world with
this crazy goddamn song about gender.

36
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,680
And he has all my God.
Yeah. You see that that was,

37
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,700
that was stunning and I ended
up who the fuck greenlit dad?

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,690
Like I love Netflix, but hey, the
little quality controls on a bad thing,

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,700
like just have somebody on set to go
hope what we'll say in the fuck is this

40
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,230
like this, like a sensor like in the
old, but that movie good morning Vietnam.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,530
Yeah. Somebody that sits there and reads
through his material before he does it.

42
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:29,190
Now I saw that now that you know clearly
they don't have anybody who has to

43
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,250
approve his content and shows
you where his mind's at,

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,130
that he's willing to say yes to that.
That's someone who wants to act.

45
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,880
We ask with no uncertain
terms to the left. Yeah,

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,690
like he just wants to every meanwhile
he had a film out of a movie or a

47
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:47,490
television show out years ago while
he was describing gender and it was

48
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:51,300
basically saying there's two genders.
Right, and it's about x and y chromosome.

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,210
I mean, which is what everybody's been
told in science and biology class.

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,620
Then he has this show just a few years
later where now the tide has turned

51
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,630
politically where this is such a weird
subject about gender and sexual identity

52
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,120
and gender identity. And so he's
got these songs about, you know,

53
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,750
like what that lady singing
that song like, Hey,

54
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,590
this is fucking terrible.
Like what you all you're doing.

55
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,260
It's just like the same thing as
president Trump staring at the sun.

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,880
All you're doing is setting
yourself up for rootless criticism.

57
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,150
That's going to diminish any potential
legitimate point that you actually have.

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,750
But I will say this, I don't think he
really got pilloried for it, right?

59
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,590
I mean nobody really. Um, there was
some, there was some line, yeah.

60
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,130
I think some people make fun of them,
but I think bill knife for the most part,

61
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,860
he knows it. That's, that's a very
comfortable place for him to do.

62
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,750
Or for a lot of people, if they say, look,

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,840
I just want to get the adulation of
the left of the far left and then fine.

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,640
I mean that's what you wanna do,
do it.

65
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,090
But you see people that kind
of shift their position.

66
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:56,450
And are happy to be there because they
know they're going to be coddled. And I,

67
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,180
so I, I get why he does it
because it's a base of, of a,

68
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,760
it's an audience that he knows is going
to stick with them as long as he says

69
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,940
the right things. And apparently he
doesn't really give a shit about science.

70
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,300
So he's happy to say anything. Well, I
think he does give a shit about science.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,390
He gives a shit and more about people
liking him and fitting in with this crowd

72
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:18,940
of people. There's a weird thing
that's going on in science and it's,

73
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,320
there's nothing like,
science is fantastic. It's,

74
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,640
it's critical for our civilization.

75
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm not a science criticizer but there's
a weird thing about people that are a

76
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,601
part of science where their own egos and
their own need for positive affirmation

77
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,420
sort of supersede any critical thinking.

78
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:39,090
So there's certain subjects
that cannot be discussed.

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,950
There's certain things that like,
they're, they're almost like, yeah,

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,670
it's almost like science,
religion, you know.

81
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,350
So there's certain subjects that are,
aren't even open to scrutiny.

82
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,340
Well, I think that's right.
And I think part of it is, is,

83
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,900
is also we have gotten to a point where
you can't, and I don't know how you,

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,700
you walk it back, but you, you,

85
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:02,701
you can't have conflicting ideas in the
same statement or the same sentence and

86
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,320
an idea if things conflict all the time.
Right.

87
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,600
And then you can have a truths that,

88
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:12,190
that collide with each other and don't,
I don't necessarily make sense, so,

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,420
but it seems as if now everything has to
be an absolute and whether it's climate

90
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,940
change, so you can't
say, you know, if you,

91
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:22,660
if you just have this middle of the road,
you know,

92
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,960
discussion where you're saying,
well look, of course, you know,

93
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,330
humans I'm sure have some impact. I
don't know what that is. And then,

94
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,190
and you know,
this is a problem,

95
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:33,520
then we do have to do our part and we
do have to work to try to be the best we

96
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:38,440
can be. But that's not good enough.
You've got to, you've got to be a,

97
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:42,600
you know, sort of totalitarian about the
whole issue. And it's not just that it's,

98
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,750
it's any argument. It just seems as
if, and it's not just the millennials,

99
00:05:46,751 --> 00:05:49,320
I'm not wanting to, to, you
know, beat on, you know,

100
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,690
the young kids are the generation of
whatever we want to call nowadays.

101
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,080
Cause I know a lot of good kids that
are out there that are working hard or

102
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,240
they're in the military. It's a
fantastic, you know, group of folks.

103
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,160
So I think we're just fine in that regard.

104
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,850
But there does seem to be something
about each successive generation.

105
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:08,000
And we've gotten now to a point where
people have a hard time processing this

106
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,860
dissenting opinion idea.

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,300
And that starts to shut down debate
and it starts to shut down the,

108
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,800
the idea that you can have a discussion
about science where you have, you know,

109
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,050
these conflicting ideas and how do you,
how do you resolve them?

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,980
That used to be the whole concept about
sciences to test theories and correct

111
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,100
with what works. And anyway, right.

112
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,720
I think it's because we're attaching egos
and personalities and virtue signaling

113
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,540
to the actual hard data itself.
But here's,

114
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,390
here's the thing that we should
all be concerned with pollution.

115
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,250
We should all be concerned
with human waste.

116
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:43,330
We should all be concerned with the
damage that we're doing to our water,

117
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,520
the damage that we're doing
to the environment, the, the,

118
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,070
there's a host of different things that
human beings are involved in that are

119
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:53,230
creating irreparable
harm to the environment.

120
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:54,640
We should absolutely
be concerned with that.

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
But what's weird is that you
hardly ever hear about that.

122
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,050
You hardly ever hear about doing something
to curb the plastic in the ocean,

123
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:04,210
doing something to eliminate that.

124
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:07,300
Some of the sewage waste that
goes into the ocean doing the, oh,

125
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,940
there's a ton of different things
that we're doing that are huge issues,

126
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,740
but instead you hear about climate change
and it becomes this ideological left

127
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:17,710
versus right battle, which is,
it's just very weird to me.

128
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:21,700
And I understand that climate change
is a real issue and if the ocean water

129
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,700
continues to rise,
coastal cities really are fucked.

130
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:26,230
And if the temperature does rise,

131
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,430
we really might have to migrate to
more and you know, better climates.

132
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:33,160
But there's a lot of other shit going on,

133
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,560
but it seems to get ignored
during this process.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,960
I mean, I, you know, I'm old
enough to remember when, uh,
plastics that was an issue,

135
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,050
right? Plastic bags or, or, um, you know,

136
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,380
keeping the oceans clean or, you
know, don't be a little about, I mean,

137
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,090
it was more of a, it was things
that you could accomplish, right?

138
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:54,460
It was things that you could do
with the community. Could do.

139
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,640
So you would have these community drive
to pick up trash or to not use plastic

140
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:02,950
bags or to whatever it is.

141
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,970
And it was stuff that you could do
and you could see some results and it,

142
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,790
and you felt good about it.
And you know, who knows?

143
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,650
Maybe we've gone past that now and so now,
uh,

144
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,600
that's not good enough because now
we've got to save the planet. Well,

145
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:19,900
you save the planet these little
steps at a time, right? If every,

146
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,880
every community says,
well, you know, sorry,

147
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,770
I can't do anything about the polar bears,
so fuck it.

148
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,870
I'm just going to worry about myself.
But if you,

149
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,080
if you bring it back down to those
little things like you would, you know,

150
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,400
maybe implying, then I think
we're better off. Yeah. Right.

151
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,830
And eventually you,
you do make a difference.

152
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,730
But if all you do is talk about
climate change and save the planet,

153
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:40,960
people just get overwhelmed.

154
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:43,240
It's like a lot of other things
in life and you just, fuck it.

155
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:44,710
I'm just going to focus on other shit.

156
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,510
Let's just so strange to climate change
to become this weird ideological debate

157
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,470
between the left and the right.

158
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,010
Yeah.
