1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,890
Are Robots going to destroy us?

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,700
That's a very good question and that's
something that Elon Musk is actually

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:09,410
scared of. Really? Yeah. He stopped a
little, Deval says it's going to happen.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,630
He's a very intelligent guy to just,
besides making a good record,

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:17,280
he talks about us essentially
replacing each other where robots soon.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,910
It's entirely possible. The Way
Elon Musk looks at it is that he's,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,200
he was trying to warn people,

8
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:26,850
but they weren't listening and that
there's no telling how powerful they could

9
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,260
get once they become sentient,

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,020
once they start taking control of their
own destiny and creating new robots and,

11
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:35,490
and just deciding whether or not we
live or die and how they're going to run

12
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,620
things, they're essentially,
they're going to become a life form,

13
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:41,310
an artificial life form that's way fucking
smarter than us. Yeah. And he's saying,

14
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:44,040
do you think it's smart to
army things they've seen?

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,780
It's smart to make this like
he's looking at in terms of, uh,

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,420
he's the tip of the spear.
Right.

17
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,780
And it comes to technology and
an implementation of it. I mean,

18
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,920
think about who this guy is,
right.

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,640
If he's the one who's telling you
everybody's kind of slow the fuck down.

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,210
This is dangerous. You literally might
be making a terminator movie here.

21
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,410
You literally might be making
a terminator movie. Yeah,

22
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,730
we have to worry because we,

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,430
when were you were saying that
you think we evolved from monkeys?

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,480
We evolved from some lower thing. Well,
the idea is that we got to keep going.

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:12,841
Well,

26
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,830
if we might hit a biological bottleneck
and that might be the whole convergence

27
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:19,740
of humans and technology,
that might be what it's all about.

28
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,170
Like biologically this system
doesn't move fast enough,

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,650
but if we can transcend this and move
into some sort of a digital life,

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,490
that life,
we can accelerate all of the innovation,

31
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:34,410
all of the improvements in insane
numbers like years traveled through time

32
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,800
change the fucking,
the nature of life itself.

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,030
That's going to probably be one
of the stages of our future.

34
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:44,280
Whether it's a thousand years from now
or a hundred thousand years from now.

35
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,750
It seems to me like with this adoption
of science and into our daily lives in

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,510
terms of like the technologies
that we're all addicted to,

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,230
phones and tablets and all these
different things often say,

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,030
he says that we're a Cyborg is
already in your extension. These are,

39
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,360
this is just a rudimentary way.
Yeah, he's ready for sure. Right.

40
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,750
You already living people already
living through this. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,300
And he's also coming out with
something called neuro link.

42
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,850
I don't exactly know what it was.
He was very vague about it,

43
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,060
but he was saying he was going to
change the bandwidth to change your,

44
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:16,200
your like your ability
to access information and
people are going to wear it.

45
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,880
You know where this thing on your head,

46
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,630
it's going to literally charge up your
fucking brain. Some strange, strange days.

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,940
He couldn't,
he couldn't explain too much about it,

48
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,860
but he was saying it was gonna
come out in a few months.

49
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:30,570
Like what nef fuck man were we were,
you know,

50
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,890
30 or 40 years away from being
unrecognizable. That's what I think.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,000
I think we're 30 or 40 years
away from being living in.

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,790
What's it look the time
living in a virtual world,

53
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,040
half the time live in an augmented world.

54
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,150
I think people are going to exist in
these weird worlds where it feels real and

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,900
isn't. I think they're going to come
out with programs that are fun at first,

56
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,370
but then become life consuming.

57
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,320
Where you put on these fucking goggles
and this suit and you go into this world

58
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,790
and you live with these in and interact.
We touch each other,

59
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,450
but no one's there physically, but you
feel like you are and it's magical.

60
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,350
You're like, you're living
in Avatar, you're on Pandora.

61
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,850
You're hanging out with the blue
people. Gotcha. Yeah. You with the Navi,

62
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:10,870
that shit could happen.

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,350
You could literally get to a point where
you believe you were there or we could

64
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:19,240
be there now. We could be there. Yeah.
That's a sneaky, sneaky argument,

65
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,180
right? Yeah, but that, that's, that's the
truth of it all. It is a truth. Right?

66
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,960
It could be. We could be there. We
could be a part of a simulation. Yeah.

67
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,180
That's another thing that you want
on my son. I'm like, God damn it.

68
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,990
You're supposed to say no. You're
supposed to say no. It's impossible.

69
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,000
It could all be fake. Yeah. Deja.
Could peach us a glitch? Yeah, sure.

70
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,180
So I just try to live
like my grandpa's said,

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,490
just enjoy a regular
shit as much as you can.
