1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,170
When did you realize that beaver
would delicious? Not till after I,

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:08,490
I think I know the first one when I was
in the first one I ever ate while I was

3
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:09,540
in community college,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,830
I still tell people about the beaver
that you cook for us in Wisconsin and how

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:16,530
good it is. And they look at you
sideways. And Mike, I'm telling you, man,

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,320
it was like the most delicious pot
roast I've ever had was fantastic. Yeah,

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,720
it was really good. There's even
stories about early on with the, um,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,940
when early explorers,
we're in this country,

9
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:31,941
they had a difficult time getting phished
sometimes and beaver were approved for

10
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,500
the Lenten meal because they were aquatic.
Wow.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,450
So on Fridays when you had to have,
like,

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,160
when you're supposed to
have your meat free day,

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,910
you were allowed to eat beaver meat
because they were a water animal.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,140
It was a very popular food
item. You follow what I'm
saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

15
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:53,310
I get it. The first one, the first ones
we ate, I had started reading about,

16
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,510
I'd always read narratives,
stories about the mountain men. Um,

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,650
meaning like when I say mountain in like
a very specific thing like a, you know,

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,330
a rocky mountain beaver trapper who was
sandwiched between who is sandwiched in

19
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:13,191
time between the end of the Lewis and
Clark expedition and the collapse of the

20
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:16,820
beaver market in the 1840 [inaudible].

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,860
It's like a very like finite period
of time was what a mountain man was

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,400
explained to people how
big the beaver market is.

23
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:28,160
Cause this is going to blow people's
minds. Well, America's first, you know,

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,970
asked her,
John Jacob Astor,

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,940
like the beaver market made
America's first millionaires.

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,040
His fortunes came from being a beef or
trader, the richest men in the country.

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,240
Their money came from beavers. Yeah.
And he was in on the business end of it.

28
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,790
He wasn't in on the trap
and then have it right.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,320
He was in on the habits the for companies.
Yeah.

30
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:51,060
The big for our company when we bought,
think about like this,

31
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:55,980
how big it was for us to do the Louisiana
purchase and to buy that chunk of land.

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,240
Uh,
when Lewis and Clark came out,

33
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:05,241
part of their mandate was to suss out
to potential for the trade and beaver

34
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:11,190
hides. Wow. It'd be like buying something
I'd wanna know about oil and gas. Right.

35
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,220
You don't know. It can be
justified this through oil and gas,

36
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,760
they're looking to justify it through
trade and beaver hides. Now also,

37
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,390
there was also language about that
they might find out about whether wooly

38
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,310
mammoth through existing
out there as well.

39
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,550
So there was like some confusion
about what was going on. Wow.

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,470
They really thought that woolly
mammoths were still alive.

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,610
Jefferson was interested in that stuff
because he had, he had been to some areas,

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,720
uh,

43
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,960
he had some familiarity and Ben to some
areas with these large bones and he was

44
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,290
puzzled. Bottom. He was wondering if
this wasn't some, if it may be in fact,

45
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:44,910
was not a, an extinct species, but was
somehow living in the American west still.

46
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,480
How hard is it to real historians
like people, not historian,

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,840
popular historians really love
to make a big deal out of that.

48
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:54,930
Cause it's so weird, but it
wasn't like, Hey, let's buy the,

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,440
let's do the Louisiana purchase
transaction because of the possibility of

50
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:01,780
locating ma'am. It's, I think it was
like an idea that was floated around.

51
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,430
People see it in a,
they,

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,570
people such as me see it and
perhaps overemphasize what it meant,

53
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,830
but it was an idea that was out there.

54
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,060
The beaver trade stuff was
certainly a big factor.

55
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,750
Another thing I was reading about recently
that to point out to your, to your, uh,

56
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,410
that you might think is interesting is
that people have this idea of Lewis and

57
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:27,421
Clark going into this unspoiled
uncontacted landscape.

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,810
I was recently reading a piece by a
historian who is talking about at the time

59
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,060
of Lewis and Clark headed
out into the great plains.

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,310
There were native Americans living on
the great plains who had been to Europe

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,750
and met the King of France and
returned back to the great plains

62
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,180
well year.
They,

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,360
they went out in the early 18
hundreds so they were out in 1804 wow.

64
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,900
You got to,

65
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,050
if you imagine the time from the time
in the 15 hundreds when the Spanish,

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,620
right,
we're poking around

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,670
and come like corn auto,
right.

68
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Coming up from Mexico into the Great
Plains Cabeza de Vaca being shipwrecked,

69
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:16,030
wrong,

70
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,080
the Gulf coast and people pushing up into
these areas that was hundreds of years

71
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,480
prior.
Like the distance that separates,

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,540
imagine the distance has separated Lewis
and Clark from the first Europeans who

73
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:33,331
were doing activities in and around the
great plains is like the distance and

74
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:38,530
time that separates us from Lewis
and Clark more so. Right? Yeah.

75
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,620
It's the distance and time that
separates us from the declaration of

76
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:45,820
independence. It was like a long history
of people messing around crazy. However.

77
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,811
Yeah,
but think about too,

78
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:50,260
like Lewis and Clark were encountering
people who had horses, right? Right.

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,840
And those horses had been,
was horsemen traded up.

80
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,190
So that's just like a side note.
This idea of eating beaver.

81
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,820
So I got from reading
about the mountain men,

82
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
I got interested in decide cause he's
always see like anytime you read about

83
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:06,220
mountain and you're always going to find
the part where the author talks about

84
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,390
how much mountain men liked beaver tail.
Um,

85
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,400
and the first people that tried it and
be retail, it was around when I was,

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,740
I was in community college
at the time and my brothers,

87
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:22,090
I remember stuck a B retail in
the oven for awhile and cooked it.

88
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:26,640
And they report it back to me that like
whatever it is they're talking about. Uh,

89
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,970
isn't that like there must
be some other explanation.

90
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:35,030
We beavertail yeah, yeah, we ate it.
And Wisconsin, we have a, there's a,

91
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,740
there's a hotter, there's like pictures
and an explanation of how to prepare,

92
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:43,520
how to actually prepare a beaver tail
mountain man style in the meat and your

93
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:48,160
fish and game cookbook. It wasn't
bad. It was just blend. It's just fat.

94
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,023
It's fat.

95
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,470
So after that we started thinking that
when they say the mountain and like

96
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,900
beaver tail, we thought it have meant
they like rump based the high end quarter.

97
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,580
So we started when we went.
I would catch beavers. Um,

98
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,010
I'd be careful when skin and
I'm just not get the caster.

99
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,440
The beavers have two large glands on
the inside of their legs. They're like,

100
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,240
talk to him there. What it looks
like if you lay a beaver on its back,

101
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,790
talked to kind of on either side of its,
uh,

102
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,820
of its like if it's a male
like talk to you, your side,

103
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:20,470
it's penis or either side
Clayco you'll, you'll see a, uh,

104
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,920
not call a couple like vent. You'll see
these, these glands that are the size of,

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,450
I don't know if you make like a,

106
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,000
if you take your index finger
and your thumb and make a circle,

107
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,200
there's like a gland on each
side called the cast or gland.

108
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,500
There's oil gland in there.
They used to use it for perfume.

109
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,590
It still has value today.
It's used for a wide variety of things.

110
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:37,580
The smells beautiful.

111
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,090
If you ever walking on a stream bank and
you smell like a strange perfume smell,

112
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,020
it's usually be recast her. Wow.
Smells great, tastes like shit.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,390
Tastes like you're eating. Like you rubbed
roses or something all over your food.

114
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,730
So start figuring out like to,

115
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,120
to skin them and be very careful not
to get the cast or on your knife,

116
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,530
forget the cast or on your hands.

117
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,580
And then we would just take the meat and
put it in crock pots with potatoes and

118
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,360
onions and stuff and just
cook them down in a crock pot.

119
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,840
You could pick them and it was like roast
beef. So when I started eating that,

120
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:13,340
but I still then later I realized that
it read all their accounts of how people

121
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:17,120
are prepared be retail. And if you
take the tail like the Scaly ass tail,

122
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,650
and it really should be from a fall beaver
cause the tail will be twice as thick

123
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:25,310
in the fall than it is in the spring.
They're of Macy aided in the spring. Um,

124
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,710
take the tail and skewered on a stick
and put it next to a fire where the skin

125
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:33,380
starts to bubble and boil away.

126
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,200
And pretty soon you can just peel that
skin away and was hiding under there.

127
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,560
Is the,
the the best equivalent,

128
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,000
like the best equivalent or point
of comparison I can think of.

129
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,580
We'll beat it. Just, it's
like if you had a really,

130
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,940
like imagining you're getting
a grass fed steak, right,

131
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:54,800
but still has that fatty gristle on it.
It's just made up of that gristle

132
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,780
like what a lot of people would
trim away from a steak and eat.

133
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,190
That's what's inside that beaver tail.

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,520
But people eat these individuals that
were doing this for fat starved eating

135
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,950
such lean meat all the time.

136
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,310
I think they loved it because
here's like a chunk of fat. Yeah.

137
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,470
Okay.

138
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,680
And they had ready access to it cause
they're catching them to make a living.

139
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,930
And if you're just eating the meat,
there's no fat on the meat.

140
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,070
And so they would compliment it
with just eating the beavertail fat.

141
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,130
And I'll often tell people about, and I
even gave some to the, there's like a, uh,

142
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,970
culinary arts institute and I gave
some chefs that stuff and everyone,

143
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,190
the eats it points out,
there's not that it tastes so fantastic,

144
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:40,740
but it's just like really interesting to
try and eat it, the fat from the tail.

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,200
And it's like you got to
put yourself in position.

146
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,670
You've probably been in this too,
where if you're,

147
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,430
especially if you're out
hunting and eating, you know,

148
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:51,660
like freeze dried food or not eating great
and you're just exerting yourself all

149
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,770
day all the time, how you're doing what
you want to eat changes a lot. Yeah.

150
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,240
And you, the level of appetite
you have is off the charts. Yeah.

151
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,180
And so just like to eat like a big
slab of fat, it'd be very excited.

152
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:04,080
Was appealing to people.
Yeah.
