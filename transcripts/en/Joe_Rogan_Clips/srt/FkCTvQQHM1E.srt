1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,830
There was a funny story that I heard
about a DEA undercover DEA agent who,

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:09,600
uh, moved in to try to harass another
undercovered DEA agent and they're playing

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,390
each other back and forth against each
other and they didn't know that both of

4
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:13,890
them are cops entire time.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,630
If fucking assholes just wasted money,

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,570
just wasted money
investigating each other.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,720
So fucking stupid.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,490
Both sides undercover
like what the fuck man,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,010
if,
if Trump started talking about that,

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,690
if you really want her
to keep people around,

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,090
if you really wanted to
get people on the side,

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,940
I think what he would do is start
making drugs legal and started saying,

13
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,481
listen folks,

14
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,940
there's a reason why it was a problem
in Mexico and when you talk to real

15
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,480
economists, it really blows.
You were talking about that
on stage last night. Yeah.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,870
Yeah. The real problem is the
drug war make drugs legal.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,990
I wish I was thinking about that,
but uh,

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,730
well first methods of fucking,

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,930
it's just such a fucking horrible drug.
Ruthless.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,040
They make a lot of that in Mexico as well.
It's a ruthless drug.

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,120
It's a ruthless drug.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,170
But I think part of the reason why it's
so fucked up is because all of it is

23
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,490
illegal.
I mean,

24
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:15,720
that's a big part of why it's so fucked
up is because it's not regulated.

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,810
It's not measured.
It's the doses or not.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,080
It doesn't say on the box
what will kill you. You know,

27
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:27,030
you can go and buy this old camp
whiskey at any corner store, right?

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,270
You just go in there and buy it, drink
that whole thing, drink that whole thing.

29
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,820
If you weigh a hundred pounds,
you're dead. You're dead.

30
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,710
We all know it's thinking about that. If
I did run for mayor, I'd have a, uh, uh,

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,250
like they have the gun exchange
programs. You have a meth exchange. Yeah.

32
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,860
Meth for mushrooms. Ooh, that's a
great exchange. Give them good drugs.

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,080
They're doing this because it's cheap and
available. Well, get them on good drugs.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,100
That's, that's actually a really good
way to approach the subject. He wasn't,

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,720
one of the things in
hunters Thompson said,

36
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:02,370
but he's running for sheriff a pick and
county. He said, a, any drug worth taking,

37
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,830
she'll never be sold. And we'll, uh,

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,430
put a stocks in the middle of the seat
in the middle of the city to lock up

39
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,680
dishonest drug dealers. It's
like, drug should be free, a good,

40
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,380
we're going to rest drug dealers.
I think if we made everything legal,

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,770
we'd have real problems for sure
for quite a long period of time.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,420
The question is whether or not you have
enough resources to parent your kids to

43
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,580
keep those problems from
happening to your family,

44
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,240
whether or not you have enough self
control to keep yourself from being one of

45
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:33,090
those problems and drugs
become legal and accessible.

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,860
But then once it's settled down from
there forward, we'd be moving in a way,

47
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:42,630
healthier place. And you essentially
take all of the money out of the cartel.

48
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,040
They're not making any money anymore.

49
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,990
And then they're not going to be
this murderous gang of suck you in.

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,230
It's going to take a while
for things to dissipate.

51
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,980
But look what they did to Columbia.
I mean,

52
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,020
Columbia used to be fucking crazy and
now you can go there and it's supposed to

53
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:56,130
be really nice.
