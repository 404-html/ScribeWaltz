1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,590
Real concern is that just like we are
an evolution of those lower primates,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,800
it's going to be an evolution. I think
that's going to happen. I don't think I,

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:12,120
you know, I, there may not be any
avoiding it. You buy debate again,

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,700
we're the virus, you know, and
this is just one of my thoughts is,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,930
and me saying unequivocably that
but are other virus just yet.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,840
The thing is I like people to know.
I like these, the other side of it,

7
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:25,590
people are cool Trey, that aliens go
ahead and attack this motherfucker.

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,080
So white people and black people have cut
the bullshit and finally have to unite

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,840
like one great movie,
your Red October.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,660
I think we're going to get our asses
kicked and I'm not saying we're not,

11
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,970
but at least at least for
one time humanity, all the
empires would have to unite.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,560
Like that's what I'm saying. I
remember that Reagan's speech. No,

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,430
you never heard it. Reagan
actually said that in a, he was,

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,630
I forget who he was addressing. Maybe
the first person to ax it besides him.

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,720
Put it in the civil right. That, I
mean the King Day you might give me.

16
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:54,600
The only other thing I like about
Ronald Reagan was a very strange,

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,100
he said one of the things that was
really strange about it was that it's,

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,190
it's shut off this gigantic wave of
conspiracy theorist who were thinking that

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,700
they're going to tell us something
about alien contact. Check this out,

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,534
listen to this

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,450
outside universal threat.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,750
I occasionally think how quickly our
differences worldwide would vanish if we

23
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:25,591
were facing an alien threat from outside
this word dude and yes I asked you is

24
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:33,181
not an alien force already among us what
could be more alien to the universal

25
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:39,301
aspirations of our peoples than war and
the threat of tell you what to Ronald

26
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,140
Reagan

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,070
knocked it out of the fucking
park right there. Straight up.

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
I have a song called Reagan.

29
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:50,170
Many of you know wasn't the biggest fan
of him or many of us presidents because

30
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:51,370
I wrapped it up more than him in there,

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,430
but that definitely is going to
make it on a killer Mike Song.

32
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,050
Really I talked to you. Got It. You got
this killer Mike and LP. We definitely,

33
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:01,570
if anybody think aliens are going
to come kill us all one day,

34
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:04,840
so I'm going to maybe suggest to ail,
hopefully we'll use it.

35
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:09,130
But if not fucking I'm gonna do it
when dat shit is amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,111
What do you,

37
00:02:10,111 --> 00:02:13,030
do you think that it is possible that
aliens came down and manipulated the

38
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:15,130
genetics of lower primates
and creative people?

39
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,930
I'm willing big based on all the theology,
I'm willing to accept it.

40
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,800
That's a possibility because I don't
think that we're alone. I just don't.

41
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,653
I there's nothing,

42
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,980
even if there is some divine thing that
woke up and decided to make us and we

43
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,780
were special children and we are on earth,
the who plan,

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,300
there had to have been some other
things made her play with. Right.

45
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,810
I don't think that I think
is very arrogant as a human
being to think that it's

46
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:41,050
just us.
Right.

47
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:45,850
And I think that the possibility that
something made it here and something

48
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,350
happened exist.
Absolutely.

49
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,580
Cause if we're experimenting
on animals and things,

50
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,810
we got like where my daughters army,

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,900
their temperament is mean. They're
curiosity is me. Like I see.

52
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,890
I'm looking at Michael and I'm looking
at an eye and I'm like arguing with

53
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:09,520
tonight. It's like arguing with myself.
She doesn't know why she acts like that.

54
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,180
I don't know. Now if I can look
at my pit bull and say, well,

55
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,270
her mother asked it like this and this
is why I know she's coded this way.

56
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,590
I know her father was his.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,370
Then I have to look at my daughter
and save on a genetic basis,

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,020
23 of my chromosomes.
I know our temperament is like that.

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,340
I know why Michael is not going to argue
she's a smart kid. She's a art student.

60
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,320
But the minute you put her in danger,
she's going to punch you.

61
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,440
You know what I mean? That's
what, that's what is going to be.

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,790
And it's not going to be anything else
because she is going to protect her and

63
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,910
her. So it's like, I have to think
that my curiosity, if nothing else,

64
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:44,300
my drive to do this. So if you take the
primate side, you say, well, you know you,

65
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,500
you know that I have to live in Marxist.
I gotta survive as wolves. Is Lions,

66
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,140
tigers bears out here. I have to
go high, I have to create shell.

67
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,790
There's something else which was a very
small input could have dropped here,

68
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,390
landed here and what's crazy,

69
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,140
if you look into nation of
Islam philosophy of sorts,

70
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,240
they have a Ufo type philosophy.

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,080
Something here in and buy their mind
is scientists created, you know,

72
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,950
all of the win, win, win a Shrek. Rain
kind of created a different races.

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,930
But something could have come here and
it and it gets here and it says boom,

74
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,680
if I do this and this and I create this
and then we set upon evolution and we

75
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,330
ended up here or that's just could be,

76
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,900
you know me stone having watched too
many side five movies. But it's possible.

77
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,230
It is. It's, it is possible.
There's zero evidence for it,

78
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,440
but it's certainly possible that if we
could go to another planet that we knew

79
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:32,860
how in life that it's possible if we
found some lower primates that we would

80
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,694
manipulate them.

81
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,110
It's very possible for a full survey of
another planet we got there and like,

82
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,910
okay, here's the good news.
Good News. A lot of life.

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,610
Bad News is the most intelligent
thing is basically a chimp.

84
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,200
But we've got some ideas and uh,

85
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,790
we're gonna do is we're going to plant
some seeds of our genetics in some of

86
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,271
these champs.

87
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:50,940
They're going to be smarter than the
other chimps and then we're going to

88
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,320
believe mushrooms everywhere. A lot of
that leave the mushrooms everywhere.

89
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,280
Let the chimps eat. Maybe
we're in a fishbowl maybe.
Yeah. Cause again, we're at,

90
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:04,210
we very arrogantly think of ourselves
is as top choice, but maybe,

91
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,410
maybe we're just a virus on this living
thing. Maybe something maybe you know,

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,370
we say anything but you make
about we could go estate a virus,

93
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,340
a amass virus could kill us all.
Yup.

94
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,740
The sure that's what we're constantly
fighting. The Earth wouldn't stop.

95
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,360
But the thing about viruses like get
viruses wholly negative in our eyes,

96
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,370
I don't think we're wholly
negative to each other.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,670
I don't think a virus thinks his holiness.
What I'm saying is that eating you up,

98
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,920
you're having a good party. When
you get the flu, they're like, dude,

99
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,980
it's probably up if this thing
is really a living thing.

100
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,480
If the nerve is really living thing, we
are possibly the worst thing. Sore it. Oh,

101
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:41,290
for sure. Why shouldn't it get rid
of us other than meteors? Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,990
We're the worst thing for
not just the biological life,

103
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,940
but the particulates in the atmosphere,

104
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,670
and now we're creating technology that's
going to eventually kill us and get rid

105
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,210
of us that may be able to live in harmony
with biology maybe. So. Yeah, maybe.

106
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,370
Maybe it's over for us
in a few thousand years.
