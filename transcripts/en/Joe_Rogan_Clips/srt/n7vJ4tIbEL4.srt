1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
We're absolutely not meant to live,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,040
piled on top of each other within,
you know,

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,920
10 million of us in a square mile and
the island of Manhattan, you know? Yes,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,390
absolutely. Do you remember when there
was the floods in Manhattan? Yes.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,710
All the money in the world
couldn't get you out. Right.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,360
You have to walk across the Brooklyn
Bridge to leave Manhattan with everybody

7
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:26,950
else,
you know?

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,381
Yeah.

9
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,930
And there was a word real worry because
of climate change that was going to be

10
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,690
happening every year. Now people
are like, is this the new normal?

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,010
I remember Shane Smith at some piece
on the walkout. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:38,850
Shane had to walk out and,

13
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:43,260
but he had some piece on vice where
they're detailing the inside of his, uh,

14
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,080
apartment building. Like the fucking
thing was completely flooded,

15
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:48,930
like six feet high and water,
you know, and people were,

16
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:52,760
weren't worried like this is going to be
what's happening on a regular basis now.

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,410
Like this climate change
thing has changed.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,580
I've a heightened sense of, oh,
you know, since have three kids. I,

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,060
it's something that I think about. It's
something that I have ready. You know,

20
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:06,530
I bought a generator. I have,
yeah, I checked the batteries,

21
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:08,930
the rechargeable batteries for
all of the equipment that I have.

22
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:10,250
I own solar panels,

23
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:15,140
I own other Duffel bag full of everything
that I need to throw in the back of my

24
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:15,771
pickup truck,

25
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:19,730
grabbed my kids and I know which way to
drive away from the city to go to the

26
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:20,564
cabin.

27
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,810
It's something I've plaid just because
I'm the ward of these small humans whom I

28
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:28,730
love.
You know,

29
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,930
it's funny you talked about like
restriction again and the thing just,

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,790
I'm thinking of preparing,
you know,

31
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:41,590
and the most common thing that people
prepare his food in and they prepare cans

32
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,760
and cans and cans of food,

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,560
but still they eat so much of that
food that the best way to prepare,

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,180
the best way to prepare would
be to start to eat less and,

35
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:56,830
and learn how to live at 1700 calories.
You know,

36
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,860
and learn how to live with
the people around you.

37
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,030
Because if you're going to spend like
two months in the bunker or an a bug out

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,080
location or whatever,
you're nuts,

39
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:11,081
some like asshole to your kids and your
friends and family and people with you.

40
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,510
One of the things that happens to people,
this is really fascinating when,

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,500
when disasters do strike, cause everyone
gets a lot friendlier. You know,

42
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:22,550
and this is one thing that I've
experienced myself this week because, uh,

43
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,900
when we got evacuated,

44
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,880
it was two 30 in the morning on Thursday
and there was fire a rock's throw from

45
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:31,400
my house and I'm not talking
a little bit of fire,

46
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,510
I'm talking to this hundreds of acres of
fire. I mean it was just roaring over.

47
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:38,780
We started see houses,
started seeing the gas lines explode,

48
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,290
houses burst into flames and
it was right down the street.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,150
So we're seeing this and uh, you know,
we're, we're, we're, we got outside,

50
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:49,280
we're in the driveway, the neighbors
come over, everyone's talking,

51
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:52,550
what are you going to do? I
go, we're getting the fuck
outta here. And he's like,

52
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:56,000
have they given the evacuation orders?
I said, no we haven't, but I go,

53
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:59,230
it's right there man. I go,
we got to go. I go, if it,

54
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,590
if we're wrong and we come back in,
the house is still here. That's okay,

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,700
but you want to get out of these things
quickly because they can turn south

56
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,061
quickly,

57
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,560
but there was a sense of camaraderie
and community that that happens and then

58
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,930
quite a few of us all
went to the same hotel,

59
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:17,410
including my friend Tom Segura and his
wife and his family went to this hotel

60
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,480
too with some of my friends
from this neighborhood.

61
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,060
We're all there huddled in
together and but there was,

62
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,860
there was an people were little extra
friendly. There was a, and this is like a,

63
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,030
there was the same kind of feeling after
nine 11 when I was in New York City.

64
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,550
There was,
people are a little more friendly.

65
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,170
We felt that during the ice storm back
in the day, people were, like I say,

66
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:41,440
I saying the street that we
live on, and then they go, well,

67
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:45,240
who's got a wood burning stove? And
they go, oh, Roger does come over.

68
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,430
Then people would go to Roger's house
and all of a sudden all these neighbors

69
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,540
that just wave at each other,

70
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:53,350
we're all at Roger's house
by the wood burning stove,

71
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,750
going back to the houses to get blankets,
planning, sleeping arrangements,

72
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,890
planning food arrangements,
and assessing each other,

73
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,060
giving each other their personal space
and learning to how to speak to each

74
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:12,061
other in a respective manner that we
might have to do this for several days.

75
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,210
Yeah. Through the bed, through tragedy,

76
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,130
a sense of community was built somewhat
or reinforced for a brief moment in

77
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:26,050
time, which made going back to our
regular lives on that street better.

78
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,960
Yeah. You know? Yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,850
If you ever read, uh, Sebastian younger's
tribe, nope. Nope. It's a great book.

80
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,260
And he kind of talks about that,

81
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:40,261
about how in part situations of extreme
stress and when people are really

82
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:42,420
pushed,
um,

83
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,760
those people bond together and they find
that these are the happiest times of

84
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:49,180
their life.
People that even go to war,

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,290
they find that they missed the comradery
of the bunker. They miss the miss,

86
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,090
the camaraderie of being in the trenches.

87
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,120
They missed the camaraderie
of being together, huddled up,

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,850
not knowing what's going
to happen in the future,

89
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,910
but co counting and depending upon
each other for their very lives.

90
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,520
So that's a thing that happens
in very, very, very busy
kitchens. Yeah. Uh, you know,

91
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:12,420
a bunch of no education guys
out of cooking school, working,

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
uh,
uh,

93
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:19,320
difficult restaurant line. You
know, we're working six guys,

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,380
six,
four burners every night.

95
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,040
A difficult menu with a difficult chef
and a very busy restaurant tho those,

96
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,730
those hours,
you know,

97
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:37,560
from 6:00 PM till 10:00 PM at night,
like it's intimate.

98
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,230
It's intimate. Like,
you know, like my nose,

99
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,470
you're bending over to get into
the stove. They get a chicken. No,

100
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,910
I'm grabbing something out of the fridge.
My nose is in your,

101
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:50,910
but your nose is in my, but
uh, you know, I, I need your
knife. You need my knife. Uh,

102
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,680
it's very, very, very close.

103
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:56,650
Quarter is often like some of
my strongest relationships.

104
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,220
Some of his strongest relationships

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,390
are, you know, the bond that I've built
with guys that I've cooked on in lines,

106
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,550
whether in Europe or here are unbreakable.
You know, these guys got your back.

107
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,870
Tony talked a lot about
that, you know? Yeah.

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,090
I think people are better off when they're
struggling. Yeah, I really do. I mean,

109
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,180
I think they're better off when
they're there. They're, you know,

110
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,620
when life creates challenges and there's,

111
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:26,621
there's things to overcome and there's
difficulties to get through and there's

112
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,670
real pressure involved in these,

113
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,180
and there's physical activity
involved in these pressures as well.

114
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,050
It's growing on the Galley,
the century,

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,410
and the cat of nine
tails looming over you.
