1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,530
Well, you got also realized Dj
Dimitris just got shoulder surgery.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,320
So he's still rehabbing from that,
you know,

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,610
and who knows how long that's gonna take.

4
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:13,030
I don't know how complex the shoulder
surgery was, but yeah, that's, you know,

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,260
still interested in that fight. I
mean, it's a, it's a big one for, uh,

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,550
for Demetrius. Jonathan
especially, you know, he needs
that extra little push over.

7
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,870
You know how Shannon gave him some tips,

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,530
some tricks when we were still in the
media towards together for the talk shit.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,280
No, not necessarily to talk
shit, but you know, cause he, he,

10
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:33,450
he's not going to be able to come out
and just talk shit. He's kind of style.

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,930
It's not his style. It
don't work, you know. Uh,

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,090
but to round out his game a
little bit, boy, let's say that,

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,320
I know what you're saying because I,

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,320
and I'm gonna go back to the
most well rounded fighter.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,020
You got to be able to promote to, you
know, you've got to be able to see,

16
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:53,820
people want to want to see you fight too.
And that thing is a stress.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,470
It's a, it's a stressor on you and you're
on your, you're training, like you said,

18
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,380
you got to get up at 6:00 AM because when
you do it, you get more media requests.

19
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:02,910
So you get,

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,150
you get to have those interviews more
and that's a stress and it's something

21
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,410
that you, Barron at your opponent
don't necessarily have to, you know, a,

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,350
a guy like Conor does a lot more media
than, than his opponent though of course,

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,810
it's a bigger stress and you know,

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,710
if you can handle all those stresses
and still go out there and compete, uh,

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,260
then if you shy away from that,

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,160
I got to take that away from you as far
as being the best power fire fighter.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,040
You know what I mean? That's
interesting. But if it's not Demetrius,

28
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,160
and who the fuck is it other than
George and George isn't really fighting

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,980
[inaudible] for sure.
John Jones, you know,

30
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,850
I think George's fighting right
now either. Oh, you saying right,

31
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:42,500
right now in the sport because John,
I mean it's up there. I mean, I don't,

32
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,450
I don't think John took PDDs and
people give me a hard time about that.

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,320
I don't think he did.

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,190
I think he took something tainted just
based on what you saw to has said about

35
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,950
the levels pre and post test.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,120
I think you fucked up and us
that money up man. Oh Man.

37
00:01:57,121 --> 00:02:00,250
I was fucked up money,
but he could still,

38
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,260
he could still come back
and be much bigger. Uh, you
know, like I say controversy,

39
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,950
especially when you know, especially when
you're black in America, controversy is,

40
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,560
is, is one of the best things they
can have until you really, well John,

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,900
when he's loose and when,
you know,

42
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:16,710
like when him and Daniel were in that
press conference and Janet was talking

43
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:21,180
Shit, he goes, I beat you after I did
cocaine with Josh just himself. I mean,

44
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:24,450
he's huge. He's, he's, he's,
he's going to be the biggest, uh,

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,870
he could already been the biggest
star v cell from the beginning.

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,270
If they don't really
suspend him for very long,

47
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,070
100 comes back within a few months.

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,320
It's entirely possible that he could
come back and be the biggest still of all

49
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,640
time. I think he's going to be way
bigger. Uh, especially after, like I said,

50
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,480
controversies is a great one. When
you're black in America, they really is.

51
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,560
It's not just that, it's
like for John, like how much,

52
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,040
how much more focus will there,

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,240
I mean my fear is that he's going to s
somehow now there's sabotage again and

54
00:02:55,411 --> 00:03:00,160
that, that this is not just this,
that these lessons sinking in

55
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,630
because there's been so many of them.
The car accident where the, you know,

56
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,230
broke the lady's arm and she's pregnant
and he runs away and then slamming the

57
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,070
car into the tree. There was so
many. And then there's, you know,

58
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:17,010
the first test positive and then the
second test, positive like fuck the brawl,

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,890
the press conference. Fuck. It's
like, there's so many things

60
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,960
I think that goes back to,
you know,

61
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,620
not being delusional and having the right
team around you and somebody that you

62
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:30,250
really listened to that you really
truly listened to, you know,

63
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,510
not just somebody that you just kind
of hard. Right. Yeah. I hear you, uh,

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,910
because it's easy to get that
way. It really is. I'm sure, uh,

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,530
like it have approached it a couple
of times. You know, you get that,

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,340
especially when you got that confidence
in the thing that made you great in the

67
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:49,960
first place. It can be like a
hindrance to youtube. And I think

68
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,630
a lot of it has been,

69
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,750
or at least a lot of my growth and the
past couple of months has been me getting

70
00:03:55,751 --> 00:04:00,520
in my own head and understanding it
and, and kind of breaking it down. Uh.
