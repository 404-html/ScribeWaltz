1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,340
Yeah. There was a recent one. People are
saying that his son did it. Yeah, yeah,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,230
yeah. My mother always believed that, but
again, sense of conspiracy theory though.

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:11,040
Right, and that's why I don't
really get into, yeah. Yeah. That's,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,350
those are the ones that are out there.
I don't really get into that.

5
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,720
I don't come near the moon.
I don't go near a,

6
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,721
I'm not an Oj truther are you a a Gulf
of Tonkin guy or operation Northwoods?

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,910
Those were all true. There's
nothing, there's nothing.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,560
Those are all true operation
Northwoods is my favorite. Crazy. Yeah.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,580
They stay talked about bombing a ship.
Yeah.

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,470
With people on it and then we're going
to blow up a drone jetliner and blame it

11
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:38,790
on the Cubans. They were going to, they
were going to attack Guantanamo Bay arm,

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,930
Cuban friendlies and have them attack
Guantanamo Bay. Crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,260
That was not, that was not that long
ago. I know. That's why we need you back.

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,360
I can't do it. We know what
peer are too fucking exhausted.

15
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,210
I got exhausting because I would do a
show and then somebody would come up to me

16
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:57,570
after this show and they'd be like, they'd
show me a pizza menu. I swear to God,

17
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,980
Nigga, you see that? And I go, no, what
is it? They go, that's the nambla symbol.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,780
And I'm like, it says it says
garlic knots. And they're like,

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,610
no. They're like, you had to really
look at it. Oh. And I'm like, all right,

20
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:14,220
I can't go with the rest
of my life with that.

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,580
Will they look for it and everything.
Everything's a conspiracy.

22
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:22,530
And then when it comes back to you and
they say, oh, Tim is involved in this,

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,050
and then you go, oh, I see how this
works. Yeah. Just make shit up. Yeah.

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,150
And then they believe it. You're the CIA
is now getting involved in podcasting?

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,160
Yes. Do you guys, you're
their first shelf,

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,910
but they're going to get a few others
on the deeply involved in steam.

27
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,930
Started the Russian trolls.

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,870
I lived at the of the CIA going
and watching sets and be like,

29
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:45,870
who's getting passed at the
store? Oh, you don't know.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,140
I have a friend of mine who thinks that
the CIA started Jim Morrison and Jimi

31
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:51,810
Hendrix.

32
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,950
There's a book about that called Weird
scenes inside the canyon written by a guy

33
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,290
named Dave McCowen. Yes. I'm
going to tell you right now, Joe,

34
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,860
it's kind of interesting. I didn't
tell you. It's kind of interesting.

35
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,590
There was a lot of shit
going on in Laurel Canyon.

36
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,130
I'm sure it probably about pussy. There
was a lot of weird shit going on. The CIA,

37
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:13,020
the Rand Corp was all over there. There
was a lot of shit happening. Well,

38
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,580
I'm sure there was a
lot of shit happening,

39
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:19,350
but there is not a fucking intelligence
agency in the world that can create a

40
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,860
Jimi Hendrix of course, and they're not
sitting there. That book was like that.

41
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:26,220
They were managing the birds. The
CIA was like, they were like, no,

42
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:30,250
it's mister timber. Rattlers like a CIA
guy. Gotta be like, it's tambourine meds.

43
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Imagine being in that time in the country
when everything was just falling apart

44
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,100
left and right around us,
Vietnam war, Kent State,

45
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,320
just fucking Nixon's the president
and it's just chaos left and right.

46
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,180
There's no internet. Yeah, everyone's
doing drugs. It must have been wild.

47
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,580
It must have been amazing.
I always think about that.

48
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,170
A hunter s Thompson quote
about, uh, you know,

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,400
like we talked about the 60s and that
in the 70s it was almost like the wave

50
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:07,210
crested and then just it's crashed act
from fear and loathing in Las pass. Yeah.

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,970
Yeah. But I'm a big,
like I'm a Kennedy Guy.

52
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,060
I think there's something really shady
with that. Yeah, for sure. For sure.

53
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,360
For sure. I mean, that book, there's some
amazing stuff. This book that you gave me,

54
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,260
his family of Seo Secrets, a guy, Russ
Baker, who's a legit journalist and it's,

55
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,820
it's been praised by like Dan
Rather and bill Moyers. Man,

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,420
I'm trying to get you in this. Let me
tell you right now. This will get you in.

57
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,360
We'll get you in. I don't have
that kind of time for George H.

58
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,080
Did you know the George Hw Bush called
the FBI and said that he thought he knew

59
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:36,090
who the killer of JFK was?
Did you know that? No. No.

60
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,140
He called the FBI. The in Houston. Hey,
what's up? It's George George Bush.

61
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,550
I'm in Tyler, Texas, and I
think I know who the killer is.

62
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,920
And he informed on this Guy James Parrot
and James Parrot ended up being like

63
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,590
one of his staffers.
It was this weird cover story.

64
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:54,790
He kind of planted and that came out
in a memo and there was another mental,

65
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,310
these are declassified FBI memos,
freedom of Information Act.

66
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,850
There was another memo that said after
the assassination, j Edgar Hoover brief,

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,370
George Bush and the CIA.

68
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,370
The problem was George Bush should not
have been working for the CIA at that

69
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,540
point. He should have been
just a private citizen.

70
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,700
So it was suggested he was working for
the agency for a very long time and he

71
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:13,570
was made the,
uh,

72
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:17,380
the director of the agency for one
year after the family jewels came out,

73
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,060
which was this whole thing with the CIA,

74
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,940
went to Congress and they admitted that
they had done all these things from,

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,600
you know,

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,600
coups and formenting revolutions and
countries and they made him the director

77
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:34,291
for one year after that happened to break
to make a clean break from all of the

78
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,030
nefarious activities that the
agency had been involved with.

79
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,410
But if you take that memo to mean that
he had had an existing relationship with

80
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,270
them, he was actually just
becoming the door. Cause not,

81
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,580
it made no sense to anyone.
They were like,

82
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,250
why is this guy that everyone called
the lightweight becoming the head of the

83
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:52,390
CIA after the CIA just admitted
to all these horrible things?

84
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,730
They call them a lightweight. Yeah,
they called. Yeah. He was like,

85
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,660
I think Kissinger and said to Nixon,
kissed her and said to Nixon like,

86
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,620
he's a lightweight, admit
him, ambassador to China.

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,700
He was never a guy that had a serious
political capital and he was made the head

88
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,930
of the CIA and then after that memo
was unearthed, people were saying, oh,

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,010
he had, this was an extension of
the coverup. He was being made,

90
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,060
the director at this very interesting
time in history because he actually had

91
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,300
worked with the agency forever and
he was not at all a lightweight.

92
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,770
He was a serious operator and he was
going in there to kind of clean up and

93
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,460
transition them into a new era. It's
a, I'm telling you, I'm already out.

94
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,960
You're done. How are you
out? I can't listen to that.
It's good. It's great though.

95
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,600
I need current shit. I ended up at
Denny's. I'm like, Julian Assan,

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,450
I need something. Right. I need some
Edward Snowden or done. All right.

97
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:44,530
You know to the bush and
I'll get an a sandbox.

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,320
You can get in there. I'll listen to,
I'm telling you in a clinic, if you read,

99
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,490
if you, I'll dabble in the clinic.
If you read a chapter of this,

100
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,040
if you read a chapter of this, I give
me a cookie. I don't have a cookie.

101
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,490
And if I do, I'm taking it.
But you will be, you'll be,

102
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,690
it's very interesting and it's a well
written book cause it's not reckless and

103
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:07,100
slop. I'll read the first
chapter, I promise. Thank you.

104
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:11,300
I will listen to a buddy
of mine gave me a David uh,

105
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,250
Lifton's best evidence on the Kennedy
assassination and that got me into

106
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:21,170
conspiracy theorists is like
92. And I get it. You're,

107
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,910
you're at the end of the
road now where you're like,

108
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,080
this is a lot of people are full of shit
in that world. A Lot, a lot of them.

109
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,490
And that's what people don't realize.

110
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,510
Well then it gets deeper and deeper and
deeper and more and more preposterous.

111
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,070
Have you ever googled Hashtag spaces fake?
No,

112
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,670
but that's sounds,
it sounds amazing.

113
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,690
There is a thriving
space is fake community.

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,010
Have you ever been in space? No.
Good point. It could be fake.

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,880
Come back. Come back to us. Joe. Prove
it. Now what is space? Come back to him.

116
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,850
Well,
this is an extension of flat earth.

117
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,690
It's like for people to think the flat
earthers stupid conservative. They go,

118
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,320
they go deeper. It's like it's not stupid.
They go deep. Those flat Earth Cox,

119
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,580
they want to move into space.

120
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,590
They want to go to spaces bank.
Yeah.

121
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,310
You want to know what's really up
spaces face basis. Fake. Yeah. Crazy.

122
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,670
What I mean I think there are hundreds
of thousands of people that think that

123
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,760
the earth is flat.
Hundreds of thousands educated Western uh,

124
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,220
American human beings that think
the earth is flat. That is wild.

125
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,830
It is fucking crazy.
It's interesting.

126
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,170
It's a lot of people that just
get educated from youtube.

127
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:31,720
The Guardian actually
had an article about it.

128
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,310
I sent it to Eddie and
Eddie's laughed at me.

129
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,710
See I think Eddie's kind of
rational and a lot of ways,

130
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,810
cause I met conspiracy talks with
him about what about well yeah, no,

131
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:46,730
the one that we had wasn't saying a
little government was attacking Malibu.

132
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,970
Well he's the one that
came up to me about,

133
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,190
we're talking about that they were using
direct energy weapons and I was like,

134
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:54,150
I dunno if this is Jackie Malibu,
but with what?

135
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,080
I was like why would they attack mallet,
whatever the fires. But I'm like,

136
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,200
they're rich. Why would they attack mal
boats to rich people? Fire started here.

137
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:03,320
My fucking house. They start a
mal, but they flew through the air.

138
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,130
You know I was one of the first
evacuated. Right. These fucking theories.

139
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:11,090
You're so stupid. It's dry
a shit. Yeah. A fire hits.

140
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,100
The winds are going co did they
make the wind picked? May Do.

141
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:19,700
I am sure always made the wind.
The wind is always been the CIA.

142
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,320
They've always made the wind. Yeah. It's
fucking, it's just any, there's no rest.

143
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,480
There's no peace.
There's no living in the moment.

144
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,460
Certain point you go to just don't
even want to know because it's horrible

145
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,950
things going on. There's
horrible things going on. Okay.

146
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,410
What do you think is like the worst shit
going on right now? Human trafficking's.

147
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:39,830
Very bad. Horrible, horrible
and really dollar industry.

148
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,660
That's not subway sandwich. Artists are
paying for that. Right? Rich people,

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,590
some of them are involved in
some very bad things and they're,

150
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,890
it's their track should be,
they're covering their own
tracks. Yeah. Like that.

151
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:56,891
Jeffrey Epstein that the Clinton visited
the least got an ice cream somewhere.

152
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,540
Anyone with an island and hanging
out with Bill Clinton. Yeah.

153
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,650
If you have an island and you're
hanging out with Bill Clinton,

154
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,980
there's a problem.
Where's the Mataz

155
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,850
crazy. All of that stuff is
very disturbing and he got
a sweetheart deal cause he

156
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:18,240
wouldn't inform on anyone that was on
his plane and now they're the justice

157
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:21,030
department is looking at that again.
It'll probably be fine.

158
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,880
They'll probably just let it, you know
with a guy like that, like what? You know,

159
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,790
how much does he know?
How does it stay alive because it's the,

160
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,110
he's not going to say anything.
Not going to talk.

161
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,940
I wouldn't trust him if
he files on that plane.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,670
I think that's the other thing about see
the aversion of conspiracies as you go.

163
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:44,310
Like nobody would,
people would talk.

164
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,270
The reality is people wouldn't talk
if you were from a prominent family.

165
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,190
If it had been like a religion to stay
silent, if you had had CIA training,

166
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,120
if you would.

167
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,810
These people don't talk and we know that
there have been plots that have gone on

168
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,210
known for a very long time too in Iran.

169
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,340
So guy like Jeffrey Epstein
is so involved, so deep,
he knows he'll get killed.

170
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,310
He won't say anything. Yeah.
He's not going to say anything.

171
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,960
Plus he doesn't want to go to jail.

172
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,700
He doesn't want to go to jail and
he doesn't want to say anything.

173
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:15,080
Middle of the things that
he did. Yeah. So the, the,

174
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:19,250
the child thing is the creepiest of all,
it was gross and unfortunately it's,

175
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,460
it's a, it's a real thing. So what,
you know, people you could talk about,

176
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,850
there's the conspiratorial angles,
the bullshit,

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
but then there's the real
feathers. Sandusky, Sandusky,

178
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,480
like church hundred percent.
That's how the fire,

179
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,210
the people that are in love
with conspiracies never
care about private prisons

180
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,230
or the Catholic Church. And I'm like,
guys, this is not even debatable. Right?

181
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,640
We're not even debating. Right.
Private prisons are ruined.

182
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,200
Kids are being sold into slavery.
Ryan,

183
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,590
about how horrible the
judge in Pennsylvania,

184
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,830
crazy taking an underage kids
and just giving them sentences,

185
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,700
ridiculous sentences for shit.
That's crazy. Exchange for money.

186
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,790
That's not right and now
he's in jail. Yeah. It's uh,

187
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,560
there's some darkness in the world.

188
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,590
It's undeniable and when
something like San Dusky,

189
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,680
when that Penn state thing comes
out and you're like, wait a minute,

190
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:08,550
how long was this going on for and
how many people knew? Everyone knew.

191
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,410
How does everyone know? Yeah, it's
crazy. Turnover. Just he died quick,

192
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:18,270
but this is what I'm course
but doesn't mean he destroyed.

193
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,780
This is what I mean about people where
it's like youtube is gonna like central

194
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,280
conspiracy theory type stuff.
I'm like,

195
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:26,640
all of those things would have been called
conspiracy theories at one point. Yes.

196
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,780
Catholic church. Sandusky, blue grade,
and they said it was a few bad apples.

197
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:34,290
It was a labyrinth of torture. Prisons.
It was a program designed by the Pentagon.

198
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,830
CIA. It's crazy. What is
the youtube going to do?

199
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,170
They're going to censor recommending.

200
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:43,800
I think they just not recommending
conspiracy videos from what I've heard,

201
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,350
but I was reading that thing that
you were telling me about Jamie.

202
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:51,351
This whole like porn or child
porn or pedophile network,

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,820
you're setting account of what
is this, a pedophile, youtube,

204
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,860
what's going on in communication network.

205
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,980
They were communicating with each other
and youtube comments ever responded

206
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:02,310
yesterday and they said that they uh,

207
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,650
disabled comments on tens of millions
of videos and deleted a lot of accounts

208
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,940
that were, they were communicating in the
comment section of like a little kid's

209
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:19,660
cheerleading and whatnot.
How were they communicating to try to,

210
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,180
to share child porn or where
they are communicating to molest.

211
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:27,580
You don't know in the way pedophiles
communicate and their network, but

212
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,500
I'd like you to do a little bit more work.

213
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,390
Pull up an article on due
diligence on the pedophile.

214
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,010
I want you to go under the dark web
burner computer for the download Tor and

215
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,700
let's get moving.
We got to figure shit out.

216
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,200
You got to get a VPN or there that's the
FBI will take over child points had on

217
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:50,490
tour and then Ronnie for a year you
become the talk. Wait, what is that?

218
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,910
What's going on?

219
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,490
I imagine what they see to
see that that's a problem.

220
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,760
It is a problem because you're causing,
that happened that our Kelly Case,

221
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:04,330
there's a video of him doing something
with an underage girl and like I think

222
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:08,170
some people at CNN, it's like we've
seen it but and that's led to him going,

223
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,380
it's like, well what did you
watch? And is that legal?

224
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,770
Probably as legal cause you're watching
under the guise of of dining out

225
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,730
rough. Yeah. That kind of Shit is real.

226
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,240
And the fact that there's these
networks of people that are trying to,

227
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,650
you know, cultivate these
experiences. It's crazy man.
But if you're a rich person,

228
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,330
you have that sick predilection,

229
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,830
you're going to find a way to think of
what they're doing. Like uh, for example,

230
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,330
okay.

231
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,910
The poster remarks that praise the girls
ask whether they were wearing underwear

232
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:47,080
or simply carried a string of sexually
suggestive emojis. Bout two years ago,

233
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,070
hundreds of companies pulled money from
Youtube over concerns about ads showing

234
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:55,870
up next to problematic content from terror
or hate groups and videos is seem to

235
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:58,600
endanger exploit children.
I think, you know,

236
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,300
we've talked about this
before with youtube with the
issues that we've had with

237
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,080
them.
They,

238
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,910
they have way too much content
and way too few people.

239
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,010
There's no way they can watch all of it.

240
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,770
And when Shit like this where people
are doing things in the comments,

241
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,130
it's almost impossible to check.
Yeah.

242
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,230
I mean it's just the youtube comments
are one of the rare free range sort of

243
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:24,850
like unchecked message boards in the, in
the world. I'm sure I'll find out later.

244
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,740
Don't read it. Don't read it
Bro. Who is this fat fuck don't,

245
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:34,180
it's not even a black ballerina.
Why is he here? Who is that?

246
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,880
Don't read it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,

247
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,480
I wonder if there's ever going to
be a time where that is impossible,

248
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,540
where like these child pedophile rings,

249
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,250
they can figure out a way to snuff all
that out. I'm harder now than ever before.

250
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:51,470
I'm imagining. It's very
tough and it's tough, I think,

251
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:56,471
because so few people want to believe
that it's a problem in the way that it is,

252
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,500
because there's good people in the
world that don't think these things are

253
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,150
issues, right. So I think there's,

254
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:06,560
the political will isn't there
because people don't, aren't really,

255
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,420
they don't understand that it's,
you know,

256
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,150
and then the people that are doing
these things are very wealthy,

257
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:11,931
powerful people,

258
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,690
and they have a lot of control and
they can kind of cover their tracks.

259
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:17,990
If they're all wealthy on all of them.
For poor pedophile,

260
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,590
you're not going to a ring.
What are they doing? Some kid,

261
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,700
I know it's bad, but if you're rich,
pedophile, it's a nicer experience.

262
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,660
It's like you go on vacation versus me
going on vacation, you go on vacation.

263
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:33,050
It's a nice experience. I go on
vacation, you know, it's fine.

264
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,760
Sandals in The Bahamas.

265
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,570
No scandals where you go
on a cabin or something.
