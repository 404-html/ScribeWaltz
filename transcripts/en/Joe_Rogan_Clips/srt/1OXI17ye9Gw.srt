1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,400
Let's start with,
um,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,630
what should we be doing with kids to
make them tougher so that, you know,

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,800
as they live in the world is a
safer and safer cars are safer.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,180
The death rate for kids is,
has been plummeting for all,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,370
all causes other than suicide,
which has gone up. Um,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,230
so as kids live in a safer and safer
world, they also have the internet,

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,230
which is going to expose them to
virtual insults for ever and ever.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,390
So how are we going to raise kids to
be maximally effective in this new 21st

9
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:34,620
century world, which is physically
very safe but virtually unsafe. Okay.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,480
How are we gonna do that?
Um,

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,870
and I think the key idea that we need to
put on the table here and that I think

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,700
everybody who works with kids needs to
keep in mind every day is antifragility.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,480
I know you've talked about that on this
show before, but I'll just, I should,

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,690
I can just give a very brief explanation
of it cause it's such an important

15
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,700
concept. Um, so, uh,

16
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:57,750
antifragility a lot of listeners will
know is a word coined by Naseem to lab.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,590
The Guy who wrote the Black Swan,
um,

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,410
because there are certain
systems and he was,

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,050
I think he was motivated by the
collapse of the banking system.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,760
So he had predicted the collapse because
he said the banking system is really

21
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:12,990
convoluted and it's never been tested.
A system needs to be tested, challenged,

22
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,960
shocked in order to then
develop defenses against it.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,590
And our system has not been tested. So if
anything goes wrong, it's all gone down.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,710
All right. You reference him quite
a few tick. Yes, that's right.

25
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,810
He's really concept of venture. Fragile.
That's right. It's a key idea in,

26
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:28,830
in our book and it, I find as I
talk about this around the country,

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,810
once you explain this to
people who work with kids,

28
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:33,120
like everybody gets it
right away. All right? So,

29
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,100
so [inaudible] says there's no
word for this property. He says,

30
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,900
we, we, we know that
some things are fragile.

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,540
And so like if you have a glass lean
of have a wine glass on the table,

32
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:47,490
you knock it over, it breaks. Okay. It
doesn't get better in any way. And so, uh,

33
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,810
you know,
you don't give kids a wineglass.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,840
You give them a plastic sippy
cup because plastic is resilient.

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,740
But if a kid knocks over a sippy cup,
it doesn't get better in any way.

36
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,690
And to let wanted to know what's the word
for things that do get better when you

37
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:04,260
knock them over. And the classic
example is the immune system.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,290
So the immune system is
an incomplete system.

39
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,650
It's a miracle of evolution that we
have this system for making, you know,

40
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:15,030
antibodies. Um, but it doesn't know
exactly what to be reactive to.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,070
That has to be set by
childhood experience.

42
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,290
And so if you keep your kids in a bubble
and you use bacterial wipes and you

43
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,740
don't let them be exposed to bacteria,
you're crippling the system.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,650
The system has to get knocked over.
It has to get challenged, threatened.

45
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:33,060
It has to have a, it has to learn
how to it, uh, expand its abilities.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,900
And so, um, so this is why peanut
allergies are going up. Yeah.

47
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,090
Those are really shocking part
of your book. That's right.

48
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,060
It's stunning how fast this happened.
Please explain that to people.

49
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,250
The whole peanut allergy thing.
Yeah.

50
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:48,150
So peanut allergies used to be really
rare and most of us, you know, older folk,

51
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,970
we brought peanut butter
sandwiches to school. Uh,

52
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:55,940
and when my son Max started
preschool in, uh, 2008, you know,

53
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,990
they went on and on about no nuts,

54
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,010
nothing that touched and not
nothing that looks like a nut,

55
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,210
nothing that has the word Nadia.
I mean,

56
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:05,560
it was crazy how defensive they were
about nuts. And as we write in the book,

57
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,950
I thought back on that and I said,
wait a second, like, why? You know,

58
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,740
we're freaking out about nuts.
And the more we freak out about it,

59
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,450
the higher the allergy rate goes.

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,840
And it turns out there was a study
done and published in 2015 where the

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,920
researchers noticed that the allergy to
nuts is only going up in countries that

62
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,910
tell pregnant women to avoid nuts. And
they thought, well, maybe that's why.

63
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,220
And so they did a controlled experiment.

64
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:35,221
They got about 600 women who had given
birth recently and ha and whose kids were

65
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,740
at higher risk of analogy cause they
had Eczema or some other, you know,

66
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,950
immune system sort of issue.

67
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,020
So about 300 of them are told
standard advice, your kids at risk,

68
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:47,920
the peanut allergy,

69
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,210
so you should not eat peanuts while
you're lactating and keep peanuts,

70
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:57,190
weaken your kid. And the other half
were told here is an Israeli snack food.

71
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,420
It's a popcorn with a peanut,
a peanut powder dusting on the outside,

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,160
give it to your kids,
starting at, you know,

73
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:06,760
three or four months whenever
they're ready to eat. And
so, and they monitor them,

74
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,040
they made sure that they weren't,
you know,

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,580
fatal reactions or sewer or
strong reactions. And then,
uh, at the age of five,

76
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,160
they gave them all a very
thorough immunological tests.

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,350
And of the ones who followed the standard
advice, 17% had a peanut allergy.

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,840
They would have to watch out for
peanuts for the rest of their lives.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,270
Just such a high number
because these were,

80
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,080
because these were kids who
are already predisposed. Um,

81
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,350
and but the half that were
predisposed but given peanut powder,

82
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,480
3%, just 3% had a peanut allergy
at age five. In other words,

83
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:41,860
we could almost wipe out peanut allergies
by giving peanut powder to kids.

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,260
And it just a few months ago in science,

85
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:47,920
the front page article was on doing that.
And so again,

86
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,770
good intentions and bad ideas.
We're trying to protect our kids soap.

87
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,850
Oh keep them away from peanuts.

88
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,840
But that's exactly the wrong advice
because kids are antifragile and so we're

89
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,200
doing the same thing.
Most of them,

90
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,520
the real issue was the people that don't
have an actual severe allergy of what's

91
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:02,260
your child. Yeah. Yes.

92
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:07,030
But that's what this science article was
about was that a exposure therapies are

93
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,380
being tested and they are
the most effective. So

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,460
you just have to start slow. So you
give him a very small, exactly. Yeah.

95
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,580
Cause I was on a plane once and they
informed us that they didn't want us to

96
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,510
even eat peanuts on the plane because
there was someone on the plane that was so

97
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:26,530
allergic, right. That if you eat peanuts
and you chew it and it's in the air,

98
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,140
it could adversely affect that person.
Yeah. And that could well be true.

99
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:30,640
So I have no objection to that.

100
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,480
But the reason we got to that point is
because we started banning peanuts long

101
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,200
ago. So this is one of these I bought, I'm
not sure if it's a problem at progress,

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,650
but as we know it's not
necessarily, but, um,

103
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,990
but it's an example of
antifragility. Right. Okay.

104
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:47,490
So now let's bring this to the playground.
All right. So, um, you know, when,

105
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:48,880
when you and I were kids,
you know,

106
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,000
boys and girls have different social
interactions, but boys tease each other,

107
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,990
right? And salt each other. You
throw around insults, right? Yeah.

108
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,160
And that's part of developing to be a boy.

109
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,630
Now if it turns into bullying like
a bunch of kids or why, you know,

110
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:05,330
is our after one kid day after
day. Okay. That's terrible.

111
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,270
We have to do something about that.
I'm not saying bullying is okay,

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,740
but as we've cracked down on bullying
and as we've gotten more and more

113
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,690
sensitive about harm in general, we're
cracking down on any kind of teasing,

114
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:22,430
cruelty exclusion. So my kids go to
New York City public schools, uh,

115
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,610
which are generally pretty good.
Um, but on the playground, you know,

116
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,180
there's a monitor and the
playground monitor low. You
know, if there's conflict,

117
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,110
he comes and checks it out. If a kid is
crying, he checks it out. Um, you know,

118
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,460
seems like a good thing to do,

119
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,670
but it's like treating kids like
they're allergic to peanuts.

120
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,640
Kids have to have thousands
and thousands of conflicts.

121
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,190
They have to be exposed to
insults and exclusion and teasing.

122
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,540
And if you can imagine,

123
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,470
if you could keep your daughter in a
protective tank where nobody would tease

124
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:53,030
her or insult or hurt her feelings for 18
years, would you do it? Absolutely not.

125
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,350
It's not important. It's important
that they do experience some assholes.

126
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,590
They just have to know.
But the, on the flip side,

127
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,710
there are certain people that are
damaged for the rest of their life,

128
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,880
by bullies and some like I have a friend,
um,

129
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,350
and his brother used to beat him up when,

130
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,650
when they live together and it's
still fucks with him to this day.

131
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,660
And he's in his 50s. Yeah. Like I, he,

132
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:18,300
I think he has a certain
level of depression that's
directly correlated. Yeah.

133
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
I mean, I can't say about your
friend, but the research shows,

134
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,820
the research does show that um,
bullying can leave permanent scars.

135
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,910
So there are a couple things
we have to keep our eye on.

136
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,020
Kids are antifragile yes,
but, but, um, two things.

137
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:37,940
One is they need challenges that are
graded to their level of ability.

138
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,360
So if they're overwhelmed and if
the suffering goes on day after day.

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,850
So if kids are bay,
if their brain is bathed in cortisol.

140
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,810
So cortisol is a normal stress hormone.
You have to experience stress,

141
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,600
you have to have cortisol. And then it
drops goes up and down, up and down.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,500
But kids who are raised
either in an invite where
they're bullied or their abuse

143
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,050
at home, they don't have a
secure attachment relationship,

144
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,190
then they get brain damage, then you,
you're hurting kids if it's chronic.

145
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,670
So I'm in no way saying bullying as,
okay. I, you've got to keep them.

146
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:12,230
You've got to keep the line.
But, but again, you have to
look at each institution.

147
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,800
So each school is not thinking,
hmm,

148
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,180
how can we carefully draw the line
between bullying and valuable sorts of

149
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:24,560
conflict? No. They're thinking, well,
if we do this well, we get sued.

150
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,560
And if we're not really careful
at bullying, we're gonna get sued.

151
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,960
And so let's overreact. Let's go this
way. Yeah. Yeah. That's unfortunate.

152
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,730
Really. Um, but how do you decide
how much bullying is accept,

153
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,660
like venom, but giving them a little
bit so they develop a tolerance. Yeah.

154
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,570
Well, so there's, um, we, so we
did some research on bullying.

155
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:48,440
We didn't put it in the book because
while we suspect that anti bullying

156
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,770
policies that,
that go too far and that band conflict,

157
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,140
while we suspect that those are harmful,
we couldn't prove that.

158
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:55,910
So we didn't put this in the book,
but the,

159
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,440
the traditional definitions of bullying
are actually pretty reasonable. Uh,

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,180
I hope I can remember exactly.
It's like there's a, uh,

161
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,110
there's like a power
differential and it's a chronic,

162
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,370
you know, it goes on for
multiple, multiple days. Um,

163
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,060
and originally there was actually
a threat of violence, um,

164
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,860
had to be at least a threat of violence.

165
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,270
I think that was the original definition.
Uh,

166
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,760
and then that was expanded
gradually. Um, um,

167
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,210
so that doesn't have to be necessarily
thread of violence, but it,

168
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,210
it has expanded so far that like,
my kids use the term.

169
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:34,590
If one kid is mean to another, they'll
call that bullying. And that's too far.

170
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,010
So I think you have to keep your
eye on the key features too far.

171
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,750
If a kid is mean, yeah, but
you can't call it. So, um, so,

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,140
uh, like on the, on the
playground for my daughter,

173
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,030
the girls would form these clubs. And so
my daughter was in the Kitty cat club,

174
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:54,420
that that's what three girls called
themselves and they'd be in a corner and

175
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:56,190
they'd say, Oh, you can't,
you know, you can't join us.

176
00:09:56,191 --> 00:10:00,780
You're not in the Kitty cat club.
Um, that's mean that's exclusion,

177
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,170
right? We can't have that. Right. So the,

178
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,050
so you don't have to like allow everyone
in your group because you don't want to

179
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,190
be a bully. That's, yeah. I don't
know. They called that bullying,

180
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:14,010
but her teacher had a conversation
with them. Now she didn't,

181
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,320
I don't think she exactly ordered them.
Never exclude.

182
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:20,210
So it'd be okay if you use it as a
grounds for discussion, but increased.

183
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:23,580
But some schools have even tried to
discourage the existence of best friends

184
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,150
because if you have best friends, you're
excluding others. That's hilarious.

185
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,360
It is hilarious. But again, it's,

186
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,210
if you fail to understand that kids
are antifragile and you think, oh my,

187
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:33,451
you know,

188
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,270
there's a rise of anxiety and depression
and girls are cutting themselves at

189
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,450
such high rates. You know, we've got it.
We've got to relieve them of stress. Like,

190
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,130
no, that's, that's not the
right way to go about it.
