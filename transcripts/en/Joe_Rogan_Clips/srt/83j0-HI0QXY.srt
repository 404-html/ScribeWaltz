1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,880
I'm on social media now.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,610
Deleting social media
from your applications,

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:10,170
from your phones that give
you a 10% boost to happiness.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,000
What was,
what do you think the percentages?

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,473
Yeah,

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,840
I think probably something like that.
Yeah, that's about right. Good. 10%. Yeah.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,600
I mean,
I mean,

8
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:26,200
the only thing I've kept as Twitter
because I kind of like need some means of

9
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:29,500
getting a message out,
you know? Right. Um,

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,480
well that's about it.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,920
Okay.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,170
So far so good. Well, what's
interesting with you, you,

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,490
you actually occasionally
engage with people on Twitter.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:41,990
Okay.

15
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,960
Yeah. It's what percentage
of that is a good idea?

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,220
Good question.
Right?

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,930
It's hard. It's mostly, I think
it's unbalanced. More good than bad,

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,250
but there's definitely some bad.
So do you ever,

19
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,690
hopefully the good outweighs the bad.
Do you ever think about how odd it is,

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,510
that weird feeling that you get when
someone says something Shitty to you on

21
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:17,160
Twitter and you read it, that weird
feeling, this weird little negative jolt?

22
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,060
It's like a subjective negative jolt
of energy that you don't really need to

23
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,900
absorb, but you do anyway. Like,
well, fuck this car for chem.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,910
I mean there's a lot of negativity
on Twitter. It is, but it's a weird,

25
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,110
it's in its form like the way if
you ingest it as it, if you like,

26
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,970
you try to be like a little scientist as
you're ingesting it, you're like, wow,

27
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:38,940
how weird is this?

28
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,010
And I'm even getting upset at some
strange person saying something mean to me

29
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,930
it's not even accurate.
Well, I mean the, the,

30
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,810
a vast number of negative comments,
uh,

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,460
Slovakia for the vast majority of, I just
ignore them. The vast majority. Yeah.

32
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,200
Every now and again you get drawn
in somewhat good. It's not good.

33
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,120
Make mistakes. Yes. You could make
mistakes. Some mistakes. We're all human.

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,810
We can make mistakes. Yeah, it's hard.

35
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,960
And people love it when you say something
and you'd take it back and you're like,

36
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:17,580
fuck you, we saved it forever.
Fucking screenshot that shit bitch.

37
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:22,260
You had that thought. You
had that thought. They were
like, well, I deleted it.

38
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,760
Not good enough. You had the
thought, I'm better than you.

39
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:30,750
I never had that thought you
had that thought you piece
of shit. Look, I saved it.

40
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,880
I put it on my blog. Yeah. I'm
not sure why people think that,

41
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,240
that anyone would think that to
deleting a tweet, it makes them go away.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,480
It was like, hello. Then the
Internet for a while. Yeah.

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,610
Well it's even like anything is,

44
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,990
they don't refer you to be able to delete
it because the problem is if you don't

45
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,530
delete it and you don't believe it
anymore, it's really hard to say, hey,

46
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:55,830
that thing above. I don't really
believe that anymore. I changed the way,

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,890
the way I view things, because people go,
well, fuck you all right. That over there.

48
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,020
I'm going to just take that. I'm not
going to pay attention to that shit.

49
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:06,490
You wrote her a needed it.
It's on your permanent record.
It's forever, Bro. Tattoo.

50
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,320
Put this on your permanent record. Yeah.
It's like a tattoo. You keep it. Oh yeah.

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,100
Yeah. Well, it's, it's this thing
where there's, it's, it's uh,

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,550
there's a lack of compassion.
So lack of compassion issue.

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,930
People just like intentionally shitty
to each other all the time online and

54
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,140
trying to catch me. Yeah. It's,

55
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,810
they're more trying to catch people doing
something that's arrestable like a cop

56
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,920
trying to like get, you know,
arrests on his, his record.

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,910
It's like they're trying to catch you
with something more than they're logically

58
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,744
looking at it,

59
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,560
thinking it's a bad thing that you've
done or the to an idea they don't agree

60
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:46,210
with so much. They need to insult you.
I'm trying to catch you. Yeah. I mean,

61
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,710
it's way easier to be mean on social
media than it is to be mean in person.

62
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,240
Yes. Ways or, yeah. It's weird. It's,

63
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:58,270
it's not a normal way of human
interacting. It's cheating.

64
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,970
You're not supposed to be
able to interact so easily,

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,420
but people were not looking at yes.
You would never do that.

66
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,790
You'd never be so mean to somebody
looking in their eyes. And if you did,

67
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,810
you'd feel like shit. Most people,
yeah. Unless you're a sociopath,

68
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,030
you'd feel terrible.
Yes.
