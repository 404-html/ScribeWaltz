1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,660
Late two minutes.
I'm going to shit on Bobby Lee real quick,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,300
even though we've only about
Bobby. I love him, but,

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:10,050
and it's not even shitting on him.
I admired him probably when we were on,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,170
when we were on mad TV together.
Eric Price and I were both on there.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,660
We've got hired the last season
and then they canceled it,

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,200
make of that what you will. But uh, uh,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,320
when we worked with Bobby when he didn't
have his dick and balls out eating a

8
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,400
salad, he would watch playback and
we'll just watch himself and be like,

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,230
to the point where Keegan Michael Key,
me and Eric would just point,

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,150
pointed them and go like,
see me, I'm me. It's me.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,970
He would literally laugh at his own shit.
And I admired that about him.

12
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,370
I'm just like, I could never,
it's a mental delusion.

13
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,030
He's got something wrong with his brain.
He, uh, he needs to put it on a special,

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,650
I've been telling him forever,
dude,

15
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:50,820
you are one of the best stand up comedians
alive and you don't have a special.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,940
And he, he still goes to clubs and
he's like, can I just do 20 minutes?

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,260
No one is like, fuck no. What,
we're paying you to an hour. Yeah.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,590
He asked if he could do 20 minutes
over an hour, but he's always,

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,650
he's just so down on himself.
He's like, I don't think I got it.

20
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:09,180
Can I just do like 20 can you let this
guy do 45 really says that when he goes

21
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,850
to a club and last were there
to see last I checked. Yeah.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,900
Cause he's just so down on himself and
get up and just crush you. So funny.

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,900
I talked to him about it. I was like, why
aren't you doing so you, I'm going to,

24
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,730
I'm going to, I'm like,
you're not going to know.

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,470
You've been telling me
you're going to for years.

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,000
I've known Bobby Lee for 20 plus years.
He's never put out a comedy special.

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,140
That's insane.

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,570
Bobby Lee almost got me killed at a strip
club in San Diego are first time I met

29
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,950
him. I already believe it be continued.
We were in our twenties and uh,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,960
and uh,
uh,

31
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:43,980
I met Bobby Lee down there at the La
Jolla comedy store and then we went out

32
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,940
after the show,
this is probably like 90 [inaudible],

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,530
late 90 [inaudible] somewhere.
And we went out afterwards,

34
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:53,490
went out to the Strip club and there was
this Mexican gentleman with a tattoo on

35
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,690
his face and the nineties,
which is rare. And he had long,

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,130
straight black hair. Wow. And he had a
look in his eyes like, he's killed people.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,650
I'm a good, I'm a, I'm a good at
sniffing out danger. I'm like,

38
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,540
that's real danger.
And Bobby was hitting on,

39
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,700
his girl was trying to get a
lap dance from his girlfriend.

40
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,880
Got mean in Bobby's defense.
It's at a strip club.

41
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,850
But this girl was apparently his
girlfriend at a strip club and bar.

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,850
And the guy stood up,
you know,

43
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,820
and he stood up and he said something to
Bobby and Bobby comes over, he's like,

44
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:25,650
fuck that guy. And I looked at
the guy and looked at Bobby,

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,350
I'm getting out of here right
now. And he's like, either I go,

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,260
either come with me or you're going
to walk home. I'm like, fuck you.

47
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm not getting killed for,
you know,

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,150
we all ran out into the car and I had a
Toyota super at the time and I got in my

49
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,550
car and Bobby was like, that guy
ain't gonna do shit. I'm like,

50
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,030
cat in the fucking car. I'm like,
dude, you don't understand danger.

51
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,580
You're going to get everyone killed.
It's guys like you,

52
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,760
Bobby Lee's one of those guys that has
no spidey sense. None. None. Zero. Ah.

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,960
You know I have very strong where
it's tingling, where I'm like, oh,

54
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:58,530
I'm about to get jumped. I needed to
abandon my pride and run down the street.

55
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,220
Right. A was a real one. I was like,
oh, this guy's like a gang banger.

56
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,090
Like this castle. He had tattooed tears.
He was legitimately scary looking. Yeah.

57
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,510
Even if he was bluffing, I'm wanting,
what does that, this is a video,

58
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,460
like what would happen? This
big guy right here, he just,

59
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,300
he gets pissed off and he basically
knocked everyone out here in the bar and

60
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,550
like nothing. Nobody can do
anything about it. Oh God.

61
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,410
He just starts to fire just
one guy. One guy's like, hey,

62
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,780
you need to stop this
guy, Alex, that guy out.

63
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,170
He starts beating up a guy over here who's
beating people up for no reason. Yeah.

64
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,120
Someone must be pissed him off. He was
dancing at the beginning of the video. Oh.

65
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,690
And he's like, he's not
doing anything. This fight.

66
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,170
He's telegraphing every punch.
I'm not even a fighter,

67
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,160
but he's letting him punch him. He just,
well, they're all drunk as shit too. Oh,

68
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,020
they're bumping into him. Oh Man. Oh,

69
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,220
he's a nudge you in the
morning or something like that.
He's a Dick. Yeah, that's,

70
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,000
but that's what could have
happened in that situation.

71
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,650
You have to send this to me because
that looks like my friend Vince Averil,

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,000
who's a comedian from the Midwest.
He's got that same kind of balding,

73
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,310
same size. He's like punching little kids.
Yeah. It's a giant punching little kids.

74
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,540
Yeah. One of my favorite videos
of a bar is a girl and a guy.

75
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,450
The guy got in this girl's
face and she grabs his,

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,800
his collar and headbutts him unconscious.

77
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,300
She grabs and goes wow.
Drops. It's fucking hilarious.

78
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:17,120
Like that bitch must've grown
up in a hard family this too.

79
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,250
Cause this guy's way bigger than her and
it was a dangerous thing to try and she

80
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:25,840
just grabs his collar and fuck. It's
slams her forehead right into his nose.

81
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,180
I think you can, you can get
away with that if you're a lady.

82
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,460
You know what I mean? Cause it's, cause
it's guy, well not that it just skews,

83
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,720
but like you're giving bad advice.
I'm not saying do it.

84
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,290
I'm saying this is it. Yeah.
Watch this. The guy like put,

85
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,440
they get closer to us.
Look at this. Boom, Kod.

86
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,840
Go to sleep, bitch. Holy Shit.

87
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,290
I looked at her just strolling away that
Carl's done that before and that guy's

88
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,150
like, Sheila, you killed again.
Yeah, whatever gets you help,

89
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,150
whatever. Who's going to rest may you
don't. You don't tell him he's moving.

90
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:02,080
He's like, we didn't give you a
bionic limbs to let you do this.

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,530
There's just got to play
[inaudible] when she was six.

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,870
Yeah. Your hands on your
chest. That guy had to be like,

93
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,780
what are you going to really,
he didn't see it coming touched.

94
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,590
You never let people touch?
No.

95
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,470
Even if it's a girl girl grabbing
like very careful. That's a red flag.

96
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,530
If someone does that you you feel tension?
Yes.

97
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,670
Feel like they're about to do something.
Yeah.

98
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,680
If you're a dumb dude and you think you're
invulnerable and then wake up with a

99
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:33,850
shattered nose, get headbutted
into oblivion. That was insane.

100
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,930
The real scary thing is falling out.
Did the,

101
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:39,900
the the thing about getting hit is that
you fall in, your head, bounces off.

102
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,440
That's the most dangerous thing. Yeah.
I mean I'm so tall I would probably,

103
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,410
I would have permanent brain damage.
Right. All the falling. Yeah.

104
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,130
Cause you kind of just, you're
just a sack. A sack of Jelly.

105
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,460
Maybe that's why Bobby so cocky because
he's not falling very far. That's it.

106
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,550
He's just woken up on the ground
rules like and roles. He's like,

107
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,890
I was talking to that guy and I must
have bumped my head on something because

108
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm, I woke up in the alleyway,
but I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,570
Have you ever done his podcast? No. I
gotta reach out. He's a good dude. I love,

110
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,300
I love hanging out with, he really
does do a comedy special this year.

111
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:18,620
I really do. Cause he's so funny.
He's a no brainer for Netflix.

112
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,150
No brainer. Right. Diversity. How
should he go? Yeah. And he's a nut.

113
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,250
He has great stories. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
He told me a story once about, uh,

114
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,880
he's, he's at mad TV. They had
a table read and uh, he, uh,

115
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,650
hadn't slept in a couple of days.
He'd just gotten back from Mexico.

116
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,120
He had a giant Bowie knife,

117
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,740
like tucked into a shirt and it was fucked
up on pills and he was just sweating.

118
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,670
He been up for days and
he's at the table read.

119
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,400
And that was before he
decided to clean his act up.

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,740
I was lucky enough to come across
like, well after those days, uh,

121
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,770
and we, they wrote, they wrote
a script to fuck with him.

122
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,030
They gave him the wrong script.

123
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,900
We'd like extra lines with a monologue
that took up like the whole page so that

124
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,210
he would have to remember it. We
know no, he'd shut her, read it.

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,270
And everyone's like,
like cheap.

126
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:09,620
They tell everybody like don't worry about
that part where he thinks he's a bird.

127
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,900
And so Bobby's like, I'm
a burden. I'm supposed to.

128
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:15,050
And like the writer was coaching. I'm
just like, do the wackiest bird boy.

129
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,123
And he's like,
God,

130
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,050
God supposed to fly car and I'm a
birder and he looks up and we're crying,

131
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:22,300
laughing and he see someone screaming,

132
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,560
fuck you got any through
the script across the room.

133
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,480
And I remember just taking
pictures of yeah, just to,

134
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,960
they just did it like on his birthday
or something to mess was like the best

135
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,960
prank. Wasn't mad TV like
the longest running sketch
show ever outside of center.

136
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,630
It was. Yeah. That's crazy. Nobody
watched it. It 10 people watch that show.

137
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:42,720
It costs too much. I think what it was,
yeah, because they do a lot of like um,

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,720
song parodies and things like
that and, and uh, it, it just,

139
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,900
I mean I wish it would've kept going.
It was one,

140
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,860
of course you were working on it,

141
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,980
but it was one of those things where it
was like, you'd see here it was still on.

142
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,380
You're like, Whoa, that
show's still on. Oh yeah.

143
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,560
Cause I was on it with
Brian Callen in 1994.

144
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,460
Brian Callen and already Lange like 94,
95 95 that's crazy.

145
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:10,160
That's a long fucking time
ago yet. And then all those
years later, I'm like, what?

146
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:15,140
It's still on dude. When I got the call
to audition was still on the television.

147
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,160
This was 2008 that is or
shocking. Crazy. Yeah.

148
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,610
2009 it ended 1995 to 2009 that's insane.

149
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,220
We shot the last,
they cancelled it,

150
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,110
I want to say January of 2009 and it was,
they can't do it on my,

151
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,040
they told everyone my day on my day
off. Oh. So it was original network.

152
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,730
He was on Fox. And why does it say the
CW two they tried to bring it back.

153
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,830
Tried to bring it back.
Yeah,

154
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,030
like what Adam Ray was on it and
a couple of people, I don't know,

155
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,480
but what is the CW, is that
a real, oh look, there I am.

156
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,830
Set up like a drug dealers, money
laundering operation. The CW network.

157
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,390
What is that?
