1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,190
Well his work,
um,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:06,210
that DVD series that he did magical Egypt
was amazing and I had seen your work

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:11,211
before that in that mysteries of the
Sphinx thing that was narrated by Charlton

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,770
Heston,
Heston and Basei 1993,

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:17,700
I think in many ways it was the
mystery of the Sphinx that really broke

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,910
everything open. It brought
everything to the public attention.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,120
I've had many people tell me,
I'm not trying to brag or anything,

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:29,121
I'm just saying factually that this really
opened up a new field if we could put

9
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,970
it that way. A new, um, you know,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,480
way of looking at things in the
popular, among the popular, um,

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,880
public crash,
the popular media that,

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,890
but people around the world versus the
academic scholarly journals and the back

13
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,770
and forth, that type of thing. You
have to remember, I'm a faculty member,

14
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm at Boston University and my academic,
uh,

15
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,970
and many of the academics have poo pooed
should we say over the years bringing

16
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:59,760
things to the public.
But I think it's been important to do.

17
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,860
Now what we're talking about
for the people that are
uninformed is the idea that

18
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:09,861
some of the structures in ancient Egypt
are far older than conventional wisdom

19
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,590
or conventional modern day archeology,

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,510
modern day egyptologist.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,380
They would like us to believe that all
of this spawned from a very specific time

22
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:24,120
period and people like John Anthony West
and yourself and some other folks like

23
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:28,470
Graham Hancock are proposing that it's
entirely possible that there were many

24
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:33,030
different era's of construction in Egypt
and that there were some structures

25
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:37,410
that are far, far older than
we think. Yeah, exactly.

26
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:42,300
And this what I was alluding to is
this really opened up with our work on

27
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,420
redating, the Great Sphinx,
and I think you know the story,

28
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,720
but maybe just to summarize it
in the smallest of nutshells,

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,130
John Anthony West,
before I met him, he was,

30
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,260
became a follower,
should we say,

31
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:57,660
or I shouldn't say follower
because that sounds wrong,

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,520
but sounds like it's a religion dogma.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,930
But he became interested in the work of
the late Schwaller de Lubitsch who died

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,080
passed away in 1961 but he had mentioned
in a one line that does things had been

35
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:15,600
weathered by rain,
I would say precipitation as a geologist,

36
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,590
not wind and sand. So this, if
it were true and it is true,

37
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,590
would put the Sphinx back
to a much earlier period,

38
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,160
which would tie in with [inaudible]
work and John Anthony West.

39
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:31,161
His subsequent work that there were
indications that dynastic Egypt as we know

40
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:32,340
it,

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,340
going back to about 3000 BC was really a
legacy of what I call now earlier cycle

42
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:43,740
of civilization. A something that
goes back much, much earlier,

43
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:47,070
which at this point I date back
to the end of the last ice age.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,840
I say Chen at 9,700 BC.
Just to put it in perspective for people.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,860
So when,
when did you first get on board with this?

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,100
Hi John Anthony West. Come to
you or John? Anthony West. Okay,

47
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,340
so the story goes this way. John Anthony
West published serpent in the sky.

48
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,230
His probably most famous book,

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,500
First Edition 1979 he was then looking
for someone that could really validate or

50
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:17,350
at least assess from a
scientific point of view,

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,810
this theory about this Sphinx,

52
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:24,790
which he had just barely sort of
touched the surface based on Schwaller.

53
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,480
That may be, it could be older, but
this was really a geological question.

54
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,690
He mentioned that in 1979
and serpent in the sky,

55
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,190
John Anthony West went on to become
very involved with Egypt and he start

56
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:40,000
traveling to Egypt.
He led tourists to Egypt.

57
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,030
He wrote the travelers key to ancient
Egypt in 1985 also mentions in appendix,

58
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,690
I think it was just the
older sphinx theory,

59
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:53,740
but really looking for someone to
at least assess it scientifically.

60
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,580
He met a fellow at in,
um,

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,800
in Egypt actually at the time,

62
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Robert [inaudible] who is a
phd in English literature,

63
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,310
I believe,
something like that,

64
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:10,660
but he was teaching in Cairo and
American University in Cairo, I believe.

65
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,210
Then he came to Boston University.

66
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,510
This is late 1980s I was and still do
teach at Boston University full time.

67
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,620
Robert, Eddie and myself. Got
To know each other. Robert,

68
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:28,621
Eddie mentioned me as a geologist to
John Anthony West and that may be,

69
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,920
this was someone who seemed
fairly knowledgeable,

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,710
fairly open minded about things in time.

71
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:40,490
Did you have any rules
on Egypt or, oh, I, I I,

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,060
my interest in Egypt goes way back.

73
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,180
I was reading about ancient Egypt when
I was literally six seven eight years

74
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,120
old.

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,800
I had a grandmother who had a wonderful
library at the time and I would go

76
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:58,120
through her library shit books from the
British Museum on ancient Egypt going

77
00:04:58,121 --> 00:04:59,530
back to the turn of the century,

78
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:03,610
so I was prepared in a sense
I was open to such things,

79
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:08,230
but I didn't imagine getting involved
in Egypt in any way professionally.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,580
Did you have any thoughts about the
dating of the Sphinx or the pyramids or

81
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,670
anything back then?
There were two things,

82
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,420
so there were two things
going on in my head back then,

83
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:23,950
which may be prepped me for this. Number
One, I knew the conventional story.

84
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:28,870
I knew that this things goes back to
2,500 BC according to the standard

85
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,871
Egyptologists in 1989
which is when I first,

86
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,510
I believe it was 1989 I first
actually met western person.

87
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,690
I had in my mind that the egyptologist
must be correct because they've studied

88
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,280
it.
They must know what they're doing.

89
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,660
I was coming from an academic
point of view. I um, I'm not,

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,030
I'm just giving, you know,
saying where I'm coming from.

91
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,530
I had gone to Yale University to get
my phd in Geology and geophysics.

92
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,680
I was very well grounded in quote,

93
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,000
the status quo academic point of view.

94
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,710
So I thought when I first went to Egypt,
I would just prove west wrong.

95
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,340
I would just prove that the egyptologist
knew what they were talking about. But,

96
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,110
and this is an important,
but I was also trained in many ways,

97
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,520
both as a graduate student and going
back to my grandmother who I had great

98
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,950
respect for and was also very,

99
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,830
should we say liberal and
open minded but critical.

100
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:28,130
You always have to follow the
evidence wherever it goes.

101
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:29,870
And that's always been my rule thumb,

102
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,290
that not everything is always the way
people say it is even if they're quote

103
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,710
authorities.

104
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,450
And something I already knew when I went
to Egypt for the first time was that

105
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:45,170
some of the very old
egyptologist in the late 19th,

106
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:49,850
early 20th century had actually
suggested that just the way it looks,

107
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:51,290
the feel of the Sphinx,

108
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,510
not based on hard evidence really that
may be, it was older than the pyramids.

109
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,160
That may be,
it goes back earlier.

110
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:03,161
So I felt that it wasn't all
said and done and you know,

111
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,370
pat and sound that the egyptologist
necessarily knew what they were talking

112
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:11,990
about in modern times because some of the
earlier Egyptologists who they held in

113
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,160
very high respect supposedly had
set different things. Secondly,

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,180
and I hate to bring this up, but I will
because it's part of the background. I,

115
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,570
my grandmother, who I
mentioned a second ago, uh,

116
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,850
was a theosophist and Thea,
if you know anything about theosophy,

117
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,700
it also suggests that,
you know,

118
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,190
maybe there's things that go back earlier.
I don't,

119
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,880
what is the theosophy theosophy this,
it's, it's a, how do I explain it?

120
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:44,180
You have you heard of Blavatsky
Madame Blavatsky? No. Okay.

121
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,180
Whoop.
I'm losing my headphones.

122
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,010
Theosophy was founded in
the late 19th century.

123
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,280
It questioned a lot of
the materialistic values,

124
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:59,420
a lot of the dogma of Science,
of the time, of religion,

125
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:04,421
of the time it looked to the east
in particular to other philosophies,

126
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,120
other worldviews.
So basically it was a way,

127
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,720
this is what it did for me at least.
And I'm not a theosophist,

128
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,970
I don't want to say I'm a theosophist.
Uh,

129
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,100
but reading theosophical works on
top of everything else allowed me,

130
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:24,101
I think to expand my horizons and to see
that maybe the dogma of the day is just

131
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:30,080
that the dogma of the day,
that there are other possibilities.

132
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,890
And not that we accept something just
because someone said it or it because it's

133
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:37,580
old or because it's this religion or
that religion or that supposed to be

134
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:42,080
ancient culture. But no,
you keep everything open.

135
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,140
You look at the evidence,
and that's really where I was coming from.

136
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,290
But my point is that even in late 1980s
early 1990s when I first got involved

137
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:53,960
with this,
if I looked at it critically,

138
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,680
the evidence was not that definitive
for the age of the Sphinx.

139
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,320
So I was going in with
open mind at possibilities.

140
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,520
But honestly,

141
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:10,521
when I first went to Egypt
with John Anthony West in
1990 I thought before I got

142
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:15,360
off the plane that this would be simple,
open and shut case.

143
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
I would prove him wrong in the sense of
his assertions that may be the Sphinx

144
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:22,164
was older.

145
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,170
I had no doubt at the time that my
colleagues in Egyptology must know what

146
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:28,320
they're talking about.

147
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,270
And all of that changed literally
within 30 without exaggerating,

148
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:38,190
30 to 120 seconds of foreseen
reasonings. Yeah, it really did.

149
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,180
It was really big impression because my
first impression of the spanx was now

150
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,730
that I saw it on the ground in person,

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
there was something wrong with the Egypt
to logical dating because when you look

152
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,720
at the Sphinx as a geologist
with a geological I,

153
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,020
this was not weathered by wind and sand,

154
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:01,080
this was not desert erosion.

155
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:04,680
And weathering that I saw on the sinks,
the body of the Sphinx,

156
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:08,730
which is very difficult to tell because
it's been heavily repaired and reworked,

157
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,660
but particularly on the walls of what
are known as the Sphinx enclosure.

158
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,990
The Sphinx enclosure is important because
it preserves a lot of the details and

159
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,620
if you haven't,
if the audience has not been to Egypt,

160
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,630
they should realize that when they carved
the Sphinx, it's all solid bedrock.

161
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,280
Only the head initially was above
the ground surface. You carved,

162
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,020
they carved down into the rock to
free up the body, what I call it,

163
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:42,021
the core body of the Sphinx in it's
that core body and the walls of the

164
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,240
enclosure,
more or less the quarry around it,

165
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:50,241
if you want to use that term that show
these ancient weathering precipitation

166
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,690
erosional features that are incompatible
with the last 5,000 years of climatic

167
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:00,180
history on the eastern edge of the Sahara.

168
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,360
So immediately I knew there was something
wrong geologically had to figure that

169
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:06,090
out.

170
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:11,090
Either this was a weird geological
anomaly or something else was going on and

171
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,740
the Sphinx might go back
to earlier period. Also,

172
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:21,741
I want to point out that when you look
at the Sphinx and other geologists have

173
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,370
looked at this as well,

174
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,870
they did not just chip away at the
rock to carve the body. More or less,

175
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,010
you could have chipped away at the rock
with pick axes and that type of thing.

176
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,570
Shoveled out chips of rock in baskets.
That would've been the easy way.

177
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,530
What they did is they carved
out huge blocks of stone,

178
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,040
and when I say huge, we're
talking multitenant, tens of tons.

179
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,790
Some of them may be over 50
tons or more of limestone.

180
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,030
They move those due east of the Sphinx
and built what is now known as the Sphinx

181
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,540
Temple, which is still there in ruinous
condition and the valley temple.

182
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,800
So you had these two huge
temples and what is interesting,

183
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,770
a lot of people don't realize
this or they don't think about,

184
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,420
I think those constructions which are
contemporary with the oldest portion of

185
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:12,850
the Sphinx in some ways
are more impressive.

186
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,660
If you think about the technology
and what went into constructing them.

187
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,440
Then the age of the Sphinx itself.
So it's not just the Sphinx,

188
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,360
it's also these limestone temples
that are associated with it.

189
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,230
And we're built contemporaneously.

190
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,010
So Jamie pulled up two photos here of
the first one that he pulled up was a

191
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:34,020
computer image that showed
the Sphinx and showed a,

192
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,590
I'm looking at it now. Yes. And,
and in this image, what you can see,

193
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,810
that's a computer image that's
actually from mystery of this fakes.

194
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,970
And then there's a inset that's an
aerial photograph, the real thing.

195
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,240
And that shows how when
they were carving the body,

196
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,450
they cut out huge blocks and then put
them in position to make what's known as

197
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,520
the Sphinx Temple due east of the Sphinx.

198
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:01,270
And the second image is the Sphinx Temple.
You look at this,

199
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,070
it says the Sphinx faces due east,

200
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:06,790
the rising sun and right in front
of it is this Sphinx Temple.

201
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,100
So this is a humongous temple made
out of these huge blocks of stone,

202
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,480
which were carved out when they
carved the body of the Sphinx.

203
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,400
And here you see in this image
another picture of the Sphinx Temple.

204
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,940
And so these erosion,
if you can see they are,

205
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:27,940
you can see how big they
are. They're enormous. Okay.

206
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,660
These are ocean features on the blocks.
Don't worry about them for the moment.

207
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,990
Okay, let's go back to the
Sphinx enclosure itself.

208
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,020
It's a sphinx enclosure where
you see the rolling undulating,

209
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,890
profiled the Roche no features here.
You see it in that picture,

210
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,510
the vertical fissures.

211
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:49,570
And I know you're familiar with this
personally because I've heard you talk

212
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:54,220
about it with John Anthony West.
That can only be caused by precipitation.

213
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,820
The rocks are like a layer cake,
so takes out the software layers,

214
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,860
it receipts, um, the software layer sound,

215
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,490
the hardware layer stick out further,

216
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,260
but the water also finds its
way down crevices and cracks,

217
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:13,261
natural features that are slightly softer
in it forms these vertical fissures.

218
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,770
I wanna make the point because a lot
of people get confused. They say,

219
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:22,060
couldn't it be rising Nile
floods? No. Geologically,

220
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,880
that would give a very different
signature on the rockets,

221
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:27,100
not floods coming up from the bottom.

222
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,310
It's actually precipitation and rainfall
runoff coming from above and rainfall

223
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,340
over thousands of years. Well,
there's two aspects here.

224
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,350
It could be thousands of years,

225
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,550
it could be much stronger rainfall,
you know,

226
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,130
huge flash floods,
that type of thing.

227
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,310
And part of the story that I hope we'll
get to is that initially I'm jumping

228
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:52,310
around here a little bit,

229
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,300
but initially I was thinking five to
7,000 BC that was very conservative based

230
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:04,850
on the geological data, based on the
seismic, which we have to get to also.

231
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,060
But now I believe we're talking prior to
9,700 BC for the original construction

232
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:17,051
of this things and we can talk about why
the dating and at 9,700 BC we have the

233
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:22,880
end of the younger Dryas,
the end of the glacial epoch,

234
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,830
the end of the last ice age.

235
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,130
I have now put together the story based
on evidence and when I ever see I say if

236
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:33,140
I say I believe something
or I think something,

237
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:37,400
it's always based on evidence that I've
been piecing together that what we had

238
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,460
ending the younger dryas ending the last
ice age was a huge eruption from the

239
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,670
sun, a huge solar outbursts,
huge climatic changes,

240
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,840
which put among other things
a lot of precipitation,

241
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,220
a law of moisture into the air,

242
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:56,840
which came down as precipitation
with huge floods, huge,

243
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,180
um, essentially thunderstorms, et cetera.

244
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:04,181
And I think a lot of the initial erosion
that we still see on the walls of the

245
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,860
things enclosure,
go back to that period.

246
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,010
So you had the situation where you
would get this incredible weathering and

247
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:17,390
erosion and then it continued for
thousands of years after that and was

248
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:22,391
reinforced until you had the Sahara
coming in in relatively recent times and

249
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,080
geologically Holocene Times
desert the Sahara desert.

250
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,980
So before that it was some
sort of a rain forest. Ah,

251
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,160
it's Savannah to rainforest.
It actually varied over time.

252
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,570
And before that it was very fertile.
Savannah,

253
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,540
lots of plants there.
People have seen it,

254
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,850
even in popular movies and whatnot,

255
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:47,330
how the Sahara at one point had
water and all kinds of animals.

256
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,150
That's before the end of the last ice age,
before this,

257
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,470
these incredible changes
that we have at 9,700 BC.

258
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,370
So that's where, um, the Sphinx,

259
00:16:58,371 --> 00:17:01,370
I think the original Sphinx
goes back to that time period.

260
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,610
And that's what the Egyptians called Zep
Tepi this was a first time for them or

261
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,530
what I call an earlier cycle of
civilization. The last cycle,

262
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,750
the one that we're still
part of in my terminology,

263
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,760
is the last 5,000 years.

264
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:21,761
So civilization arising re-emerging I
should say about 3000 to 4,000 BC coming

265
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:29,540
into really what we have now is,
you know, high technology, etc.

266
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,880
But before that there
had been earlier cycles,

267
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:37,580
civilization that was essentially
snuffed out or brought to its knees,

268
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:40,520
if you would,
by the end of the last ice age.

269
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,070
And just to map this out,

270
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,310
a period from about 9,700 BC,

271
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:51,311
this is what I'm reconstructing now to
about 4,000 to 3000 BC where we have

272
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:55,830
civilization reemerging
between that period.

273
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,150
So thousands of years,

274
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:01,380
9,700 BC to say 3,700
BC for round numbers,

275
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,290
6,000 years.
We have essentially a dark period.

276
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,590
And what I've been now calling siddha
solar induced dark age sort of ironic,

277
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,790
the sun will induce a dark age because
of brought civilization back to an

278
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,990
earlier stage if you would. I'm
just not sure I follow that. Well,

279
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:23,820
how did the son do this? Um,
solar outburst, essentially
coronal mass ejection,

280
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,350
huge eruption,

281
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,970
bigger than anything we've ever
seen on earth and mas is massive.

282
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:33,240
Thunder showers and we
exactly new modern history.

283
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,460
Modern history is even close to this,
but we do have isotope data,

284
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,313
et cetera.

285
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,860
That indicates this has happened in the
past at the end of the last ice age and

286
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:48,150
I'm sure it's happened many times over
and you have a lot of markers that

287
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:53,040
indicate this. You have vitrification of
rock. Um, in fact, a lot of the markers,

288
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,610
and I don't want to be
debating the issue necessarily,

289
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,850
but a lot of the markers that people
have used for a comment at the younger,

290
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,860
dry ice or during the
younger dryas through a,

291
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,100
most of them are at the
beginning of the younger dryas.

292
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:11,940
That's what they're claiming. But of
the, uh, a lot of the dating is very,

293
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:15,930
very iffy. Um, I found it
interesting. For instance,

294
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:18,960
someone will use something as a marker
for the younger dry ice and that will

295
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:23,310
give a date of 12,000 plus
or minus 4,000 years. So,

296
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,360
you know, this is just
the way geology is, but.
