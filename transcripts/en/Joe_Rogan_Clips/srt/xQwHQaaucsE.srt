1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,520
So I figured something out that
I thought I'd tell you about,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,060
just took me like 30 years to figure
out and I figured it out on this tour.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,800
So there's this old idea,

4
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,040
you know that you have to rescue your
father from the belly of the whale, right?

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,740
From some monster that's
deep in the abyss.

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,400
You see that in Pinocchio for example.
But it's a very common idea.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,530
And I figured out why that is.

8
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:24,531
I think so imagine that we already know
from a clinical perspective that you

9
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,080
know,
if you set out a path towards a goal,

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,370
which you want to do because you need
a goal and you need a path because that

11
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:36,300
provides you with positive emotion, right?
So you set up something as valuable,

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,450
so that implies a hierarchy.
You set up something as valuable,

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,240
you decide that you're going to
do that instead of other things.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,390
So that's kind of a sacrifice because
you're sacrificing everything else to

15
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,224
pursue that.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,400
And then you experience a fair bit of
positive emotion and meaning as you watch

17
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:54,240
yourself move towards the goal. And so the
implication of that is the, the better.

18
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:59,010
The goal, the more full enrich
your experience is going
to be when you pursue it.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,390
So that's one of the reasons of,

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,200
of that's one of the reasons
for developing a vision
and for fleshing yourself

21
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:07,530
out philosophically because you want
to aim at the highest goal that you can

22
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:10,050
manage. Okay? So you do that.

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,560
And then what you'll find is that
as you move towards the goal,

24
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:15,090
there are certain things that,
that,

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,910
that you have to accomplish
that frighten you. You know,

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,630
maybe you have to learn to
be a better speaker, a better
writer, a better thinker.

27
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,610
You have to be better to
people around you are,

28
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,850
you have to learn some new skills and
you're afraid of that whatever cause it's

29
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,520
going to stretch you if you,
if you pursue a goal and it's,

30
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,070
and so that'll put you up
against challenges. Okay?

31
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:35,310
So all the clinical data indicates,
well,

32
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:38,550
the opposite of safe spaces as
Jonathan Heit has been pointing out,

33
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:43,551
that what you want to do when you identify
something that someone is avoiding,

34
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,150
that they need to do because they're
afraid you have them voluntary can

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,600
voluntarily confronted. And so you
break it down. What you try to do,

36
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,030
if you're a behavior therapist,
as you break down the thing,

37
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,830
they're avoiding into smaller and smaller
pieces until you find a piece that's

38
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:58,441
small enough.

39
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,130
So they'll do it and it doesn't really
matter as long as they start it, you know,

40
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,290
then they can put the next
piece on in the next piece.

41
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,730
And what happens is they don't get
less afraid. Exactly. They get braver.

42
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,630
They get, they get, it's like there's
more of the you can and here's why.

43
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:17,631
So imagine you do something
new and that's informative,

44
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,240
right?

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,080
There's information in the action and
then you can incorporate that information

46
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,920
and turn it into a skill and turn it into
a transformation of your perceptions.

47
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,000
So there's more to you because you've
tried something new. So that's one thing.

48
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,530
But the second thing is,

49
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,630
and there's good biological evidence for
this now that if you put yourself in a

50
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:37,590
new situation,

51
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,890
then new genes code for new proteins
and build new neural structures and new

52
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,740
nervous system structures. Same thing
happens to some degree when you work out,

53
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,410
right? Cause your, your muscles
are responding to the load,

54
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,210
but your nervous system does that too.

55
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:56,211
So you imagine that there's a lot of
potential you locked in your genetic code.

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,360
And then if you put yourself in a
new situation, then then the stress,

57
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,960
that's the situational stress that's
produced by that particular situation

58
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,600
unlocks those genes and then
builds new parts of you.

59
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,340
And so that's very cool because who knows
how much there is locked inside of you.

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,930
Okay,
so now here's the idea.

61
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,680
So let's assume that that scales,

62
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,480
as you take on heavier and heavier loads,
that more and more of you,

63
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,090
you get more and more informed because
you're doing more and more difficult

64
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,850
things,
but more and more of you gets unlocked.

65
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,460
And so then what that would imply is
that if you got to the point where you

66
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,430
could look at the darkest thing,
so that would be the abyss, right?

67
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,700
That would be the deepest abyss.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,920
If you could look at the harshest
things like the most brutal parts of the

69
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,130
suffering of the world and the
malevolence of people in society.

70
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,210
If you could look that,

71
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,750
look at that straight and and directly
that that would turn you on maximally.

72
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,840
And so that's the idea
of rescuing your father.

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Because imagine that you're like
the potential composite of all your,

74
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,530
all the ancestral wisdom that's
locked inside of you biologically.

75
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,000
But that's not going to come out at all
unless you stress yourself, unless you,

76
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,360
unless you challenge yourself. And the
bigger the challenge you'd take on,

77
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,770
the more that's going to turn on.

78
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,810
And so that as you take on a broader
and broader range of challenges and you

79
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:23,920
push yourself harder than more and
more of what you could be turns on.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,670
And that's equivalent to transforming
yourself into the ancestral father into

81
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,660
all because you're, you're like
the, what would you call it, your,

82
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:36,661
the consequence of all these living beings
that have come before you and that's

83
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:40,390
all part of your biological potentiality.

84
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,130
And then if you can push yourself,

85
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:46,030
then all of that clicks on and that
turns you into who you could be. That's,

86
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,900
and that's the representation of
that positive ancestral father.

87
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,750
So that's why you rescue your
father from the belly of the beast.

88
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,110
So you think that this ultimate
goal of sack of sacrifice and of,

89
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:03,451
of risking your life in order to save
someone who's truly important to you,

90
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,530
that this somehow or another maximizes
your potential as a human being? Well,

91
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,960
I think, I think you can think
about it religiously too.

92
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:14,890
So they think about it this way. So
in the Christian story, for example,

93
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,430
you have Christ does two
things that are met. Messianic.

94
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,660
One is takes the suffering
of the world onto himself.

95
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,990
He's not some weird idea.
Okay, so what does that mean?

96
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,870
Let's think about it psychologically.
Well, maybe it means that, well,

97
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,370
that's your job is the world's full of
suffering and you should accept that as

98
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,890
your responsibility past,
present, and future.

99
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,920
You're supposed to do something about
that as much as you can about it.

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,910
And maybe you start with your own
localized suffering, you know,

101
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,540
put yourself together. But then you expand
that outward and you decide that it's,

102
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,130
you're not a victim of that even though
you know your part and parcel of it.

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,820
But you're,
you're the potential solution to that.

104
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,730
And so you accept that as
a responsibility. So that's
part of taking on load.

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,460
That's part of bearing across.
You could look at it that way.

106
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,360
The cross is sort of a symbol of the
place of maximal suffering. Okay.

107
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:08,510
So you accept that as a challenge,
not as a,

108
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,940
not as something that
you're victimized by.

109
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,060
Maybe you accept that as the price
of being. Okay. So that's one,

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,100
that's one responsibility.

111
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,220
You're responsible for addressing
the suffering in the world.

112
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,680
So that could give you some meaning,
seemed to me.

113
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,320
And then the next thing
is there's a story.

114
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,390
Of course the Christ met
the devil in the desert.

115
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:28,250
And so that's the
encounter with malevolence.

116
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,820
So that would be the other thing because
the two major problems that people face,

117
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,060
obviously our suffering,
tragedy and malevolence.

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,570
And so that's the other thing that
you're responsible for is that you're

119
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:43,130
supposed to look at the capacity for
human evil as clearly as you possibly can,

120
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,840
which is a very terrifying thing.
You know,

121
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,590
that causes post traumatic stress disorder
and people that aren't accustomed to

122
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:52,220
it and in the mythology that's
associated with the encounter with evil,

123
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,080
it's almost always the case that the
entity that does the encountering,

124
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,830
even if it does it voluntarily,
is is,

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,990
is hurt by it.
So the Egyptian God Horus for example,

126
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,610
who's the I and the Falcon,

127
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,810
the thing that can see and pay attention
when he encounters is evil. Uncle Seth,

128
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,280
who's the precursor of Satan,

129
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,840
he loses an eye because it's no joke
to encounter malevolence you know it.

130
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,980
It can really shake you,

131
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,220
but the idea would be that if you can
face the malevolence and you can face the

132
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,010
suffering,

133
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,010
then that maximally that opens the door
to your maximum potential and then the

134
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:34,280
option, the optimistic part
of that is, and this is,

135
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,070
this is why it's so useful
to peer into the darkness,

136
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:41,420
let's say the optimistic part of that is
is that although the suffering is great

137
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,820
and the malevolence is,
is deep,

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,550
your capacity to transcend it is stronger.

139
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,550
So what you get out of the most negative
viewpoint is the most positive possible

140
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,280
consequence because one of the things
you'd like to know if you want it to know

141
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,590
something deep about yourself is
that you could face the worst,

142
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:00,980
that there wasn't prevail. And I
believe that's Cape. I believe that's,

143
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,710
I believe that,
that people are capable of that.

144
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,180
I think that despite how tragic life
is and how malevolent things are,

145
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:13,370
that fundamentally our spirit,
let's say, has the capacity to,

146
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,940
to confront that and to fix
it, like psychologically, to,

147
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:20,390
to,
to confronted courageously,

148
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,520
to be able to bear up under
that if you do it voluntarily,

149
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,670
but also to address it not only
to deal with it psychologically,

150
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,700
but to deal with it practically and
that we could make things much better.
