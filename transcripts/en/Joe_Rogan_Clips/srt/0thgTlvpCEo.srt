1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,180
What are you thoughts on multi versus,
well,

2
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:07,320
you see this is different because
this is the what? Sequential.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,340
So I don't call it a multiverse verse.
They each influence the next one.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,280
And so they're not independent worlds.
Right.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,020
But indeed the possibility
of Independent. Yeah. Well,

6
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,320
you see, there are two reasons
for believing multiverses.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,870
One of them is the quantum reason that
maybe we have the shouting is dead

8
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:31,860
Katherine and the livecast,
they in different worlds
and they separate universes.

9
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,900
I don't believe that argument.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,210
I don't think that's the right
way to look at quantum mechanics,

11
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,170
but many people do.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,400
And that suggests that you might have
these multiple universities in some sense

13
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,850
on attractive about that to you.
It doesn't explain what we see.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,620
So he wanted the theory, which explains
the world we see and the world we see.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,970
You get collapse they state does.
And to explain that,

16
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,200
well it's only because we've drifted off
into some world and another version of

17
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,500
ourselves as drift into another one and
some c one and the other side of the

18
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:04,140
other.
And they're all in super position.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,410
It doesn't explain why.

20
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:11,850
You see one world and she
has this kind of coherence.

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,520
I mean lots of people try and there are
many attempts at the sort of thing. It's,

22
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:20,670
it's quite a widely held view and
if you believe quantum mechanics,

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,500
the collapse is not real and it doesn't
happen. And all the alternatives,

24
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:28,740
the dead cat under LiveCap
coexists in different worlds.

25
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:33,360
That's the interpretation. That's
a view. I don't think that I want,

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,630
I want an explanation for the world
we live in and you don't see cats,

27
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,660
different worlds with cats
and well it's a long story.

28
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,040
I mean it's clearly,

29
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,250
it's a view you can hold to and if
you don't want to monkey with quantum

30
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,850
mechanics is where you lead. So that's,
that's right. That's the alternative. I,

31
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:55,980
they don't make a single triad to
change quantum mechanics at all.

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,570
And then you are led to this multi world,
many,

33
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:05,520
many world picture. I think it
even doesn't make that much sense.

34
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,500
So you've got to be careful about it.
That,

35
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,850
whether they are really like different,
distinct worlds, I don't think it really,

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,470
my view is it doesn't really work
well let me not trying to attack that.

37
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:16,860
And I think I have a different view,

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,750
which is that the theory is not quite
quite right. Right. And that, um,

39
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,420
there is something which makes the,

40
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,890
the collapse into a
physical process and uh,

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,520
the, there's only one world
now the other many worlds view,

42
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:37,521
which is comes from a different reason
and that is that they seem there seem to

43
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,940
be various accidents, um, in,

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,110
well maybe one of them being that the
neutron is just slightly more massive than

45
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,590
the Proton. That's one. There
are lots of other accidents.

46
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:53,400
We see that if they were a little
different than life as we know,

47
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,840
it couldn't happen. And so how do you
explain this? Well, some people say, well,

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,870
all these universes with different
values of these constants all coexist.

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,600
It's just we only see the one that we're
in because the numbers come out right

50
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:11,110
for us. So that's what's
called an anthropic argument.

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,330
Okay. I can see the argument. I
didn't like it much. It's sort of,

52
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,410
I think we need a better explanation for
why the numbers of what we see and so

53
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:24,490
on. But that's that that one makes
more sense to me than the other one.

54
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,170
So I saw, I think one, maybe
it has to take that seriously,

55
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,560
but certainly not the viewer I'm
presenting here with this picture.

56
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,920
It's for someone like me.

57
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:39,430
It's so interesting to know that
there's still a considerable amount of

58
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:44,080
speculation. Yes. Oh
yeah. Well it's, it's,

59
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,970
there's a lot of speculation,

60
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:50,620
but a lot of it is pretty off the wall
and then other people think mine are off

61
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,310
the wall and see whose,
who's to say, okay, I'm,

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,660
I'm no man. And so, okay. You know,

63
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,530
did in decent things in the past,
but you just didn't trust this abuse now.

64
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,640
So I guess that's what people
think. I don't know. But
you see, if it was just me,

65
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,570
I could understand that.

66
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,820
But I've got these posts and I have an
Armenian colleague who's done things on

67
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:17,640
this too. And A, it can't be that we're
all all off the rails, I think. No,

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,500
there's something out there.
And now with their hawking points,

69
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,780
there's something people can
really go out and look for,

70
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,110
and if they don't see it and there's
something funny going on somewhere,

71
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,720
if they do see, then there's
something else going funny on which,

72
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,840
which they'll have to think of another
explanation, unless it's my explanation.

73
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,910
They'll have to think of a different
view from the current inflation view,

74
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:40,360
which is in real trouble with these
observations. As far as I can see.
