1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,850
Dude, you're running out of space to
tattoo. I'm going to tell you right now,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,330
I'm actually getting tattoos on top
of a tattoos. That's outrageous. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,040
I just got this, uh, Lj for xxx.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,450
I'm going to get an a, I'm working on
some new ones. I've decided to go back in.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,940
You kind of like remix in
him at this point, you know,

6
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,650
like getting tattoos on top of tattoos.
Have you ever gotten lasered? Yeah,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
once I had it like a new wife and I
divorced my ex wife and she wasn't really

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,930
stoked on the ex wife's name on me.
Yeah, that sounds like a problem.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,770
So I lasered it cause it was right on
my neck and she always had to see it.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,360
And um, but that's the only time I've
ever done it. I, there's nothing on me.

11
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,480
I really want to get rid of her. I'm
like, oh that it's all a story to me.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,930
It all tells a story. It's like a moment
in time. And I got it for a reason,

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,050
but I was trying to be cool
and you know what I mean?

14
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,120
Trying to be respectful and make her
happy at the time. That makes sense. Yeah.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,100
I mean it was amazing.

16
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:56,100
She hung in there all the way to being
married with another chick's name on your

17
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,500
neck. Yeah, that's true woman. True.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,890
But in that regard. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah,

19
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:08,640
I love tattoos, man. They're
addicting you. I love him
too. Once I figured it out,

20
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:13,620
they didn't hurt at the age of 15 it
was on, I didn't let people tell you,

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,040
they're like, oh, it's so
painful. And then you get, when
you're like, wait a minute,

22
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,450
it's not so bad. This is like,
it's Kinda like a, a slight burn.

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,730
It's like being kind of
therapeutic to bed. I fell asleep.

24
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:30,930
I was getting tattooed. Same,
same. When I did my back piece,

25
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,740
I fell asleep and I had two
artists working on me at
the same time just because

26
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:39,570
I fucking hate wasting time. So they,
yeah, they did my back together.

27
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,320
They did my head together to either heads.
Impressive. Let me see the head. Yeah.

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,890
Let me see what that looks like.
When did you get that done?

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,530
I did my head like, I don't
know, six years ago. Wow. Yeah,

30
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,521
I started,

31
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,630
I had like a piece on the side of my
head that Mr Cartoon did back back in the

32
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:01,830
day. Love that guys work. Yeah. Cartoon is
such, he's amazing. He's got great shit.

33
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:05,130
He's, he is a legend. He's a
legend. Even outside of tattooing,

34
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:10,080
like low rider culture. He's, he's
one of the illest but um, yeah, he,

35
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:12,270
he did that and then
that kind of set it off.

36
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,870
I always had like praying hands on the
side of my head and then I shaved my head

37
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,970
and I've never grown my hair out
since cause I'm like fuck it.

38
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,380
It's permanent haircut,
you know.

39
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,020
But what is up there?

40
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,130
It's hard to see what all little shine
I have like Virgin Mary writes. Oh Wow.

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,960
Um, I think I have like a rose you
think you had on the, you know,

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,700
you get a lot of tattoos on my head.
I have like a transplant,

43
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:43,290
the gas mask on the back of my head.
I have one life. One chance. Um,

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,210
yeah. And then like some writing.
Wow. Now when you got burned,

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,860
did it affect your tattoos? Did you
have to tattoo over it? Yeah. So I lost,

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,600
I lost all of my tattoos on
my legs. Wow. Yes. I lost,

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,490
I lost my first tattoo ever,
was a dag nasty tattoo.

48
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,960
This hardcore band punk band that I
loved forever. And a bones tattoo,

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,550
which was my nickname growing up.
Um, but I lost everything on my legs.

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,380
So then they do like they do, it's
called that grafting. So they, oh,

51
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,300
and I lost some dead dudes when my back.
So they take,

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,480
it's like a cheese grater and they grade
all of your skin off your back and my

53
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:26,521
thighs and then they staple it to you
with pig cadaver and they will wait for,

54
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:31,270
uh, for you to start healing. Um, so yeah,

55
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:35,500
so I lost a lot of tattoos and then
I, I did, uh, like on my thighs.

56
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:39,850
You can't really see. I did, I did
memorials for, for though Chris Chain,

57
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,780
a Dj am who, uh, who all
passed away in the accident.

58
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,490
So I put them on my legs over the graph.
So you can't really see it. But yeah,

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,630
I mean I got out pretty well man. Like I
mean you can kind of see it on my hand,

60
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,520
my hand,
you can see it's discolored and stuff,

61
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,860
but for having almost 70% of my body
burnt, like you can't really tell.

62
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,200
That's amazing.
Yeah.

63
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,180
I can't really tell it all because
you're so tattooed up that up.

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,320
The pain of healing burns is
supposed to be excruciating.

65
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,490
It's the fucking worst thing ever.
Well for for me too.

66
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,760
I mean I don't think you guys ever think
about being burnt. I know I didn't,

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,590
I would just be like,
I dunno,

68
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,580
I just never think about
fire until you're on fire.

69
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,310
And then you're like, oh shit. And then,

70
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,030
and then the,
you know,

71
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,040
the treatments afterwards to like
do everything, you know, like, uh,

72
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,830
like they would put me in this big pan
that was literally about as big as this

73
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:38,320
table with different
people all around you.

74
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:42,520
And they would scrape all my burns with
a metal brush to get rid of all the

75
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:44,950
infection. Cause I had,
I basically, when I,

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,830
when I jumped through the emergency exit,

77
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,020
when I open the emergency
exit before the plane blew up,

78
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,770
I was in such a hurry to get out
of the plane and exit the plane.

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,760
I jumped right into the jet,
which is full of fuel.

80
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,000
So my whole body lit up,
you know,

81
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,990
so I had jet fuel just in my whole body.

82
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,630
Like I burped jet fuel for
almost like three months.

83
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,890
So they had it like that was the main
thing to get rid of the infection as they

84
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,940
scrub you with a metal brush to get rid
of all of it and all of the dead skin.

85
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,200
And then,

86
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,370
and then I did about 30
surgeries to repair everything,

87
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,720
like skin graft surgeries.

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,420
They saved my foot because at one point
they were going to amputate my right

89
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:27,760
foot. Yeah, it was wild.

90
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,620
I always have pictures that they're
going to have to amputate my right foot

91
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,550
almost didn't make it.

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,630
Was it because the way it was was it was
necrosis or like what was going on that

93
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,080
they were going to amputate it I think
because that was the thing that was most

94
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:44,800
soaked was,
was my shoes and socks.

95
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,400
I jumped into the jets,
you know, and I had done,

96
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:52,000
like I had exited the plane,
I'd started running,

97
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,670
I had started like ripping off my clothes,
just,

98
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,650
that's what my instinct told me
is just get rid of everything.

99
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,580
But little did I know I would still
be on fire because the jet fuel was,

100
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,780
you know,
I was soaked in it.

101
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
So I'm actually running
towards the highway highways
right on the side of me and

102
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,830
I just hear some guy yell, like stop,
drop and roll. And it just like,

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,210
I heard it out of all this chaos of
every sirens and everything and I stopped

104
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:17,901
dropping,
rolled.

105
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:22,570
And the only thing that was still on
fire was my feet and am came in, um,

106
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,590
pat and I'm out. So I think they were on
fire the longest too. So still like my,

107
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,390
I think my right foot is probably
like over 50% of it to graft. Wow.

108
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,280
Yeah. Was Wild. But, um, yeah, that
was like, I never, like I said,

109
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,310
I never even thought about it.

110
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,490
It's not something you think
about until it happens to you,

111
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,660
but being burnt is like a.
