1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,180
Yeah. I got into all the gas
monkey garage, Jay's garage, uh,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,420
getting that gas monkey guy on the
show. Oh, Richard Rawlings. Yeah.

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:11,680
I just got an email yesterday. Fuck
yeah, I love that guy's a fucking right.

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,220
I love that guy.
Ask him about my favorite episode,

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,600
my favorite fucking episode of that.
Cause he always like,

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:22,270
I watched that show so much.
I knew the number he was going to come at,

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,900
they'd be like, okay, what
do you want for this gun?

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,030
And he always get them to say it first
and they'd be like, yeah, I mean I was,

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,340
I was thinking like a five
grand and then he'd be, oh wow,

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,450
he's five now, man. I can't,
I mean, I mean I could do,

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,930
I could do like 2,700,
right.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,750
And then the fucking guy would then go
down to four grand and he would come up

13
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:47,410
like, like 300 bucks and he'd end up
getting the car for like three grand.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,580
Like whatever the fuck you want it.
Right?

15
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,700
So one time he went out and he
busted this guy down on like a f, uh,

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,300
an old trans am or a
Firebird is some shit.

17
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:59,110
I forget what the guy sells
it to them for like fucking,

18
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:02,170
he wanted like 18 grand or something.
He sold it to him for like 11.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,960
So he fucking gets the car over there.

20
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,020
He's talking about he's going to do about
with it and all of a sudden the guy's

21
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:09,850
brother calls up and says,
Hey,

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,780
that guy didn't have the fucking right
to sell that car. That's also mine.

23
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,450
You got to, you know, I'm
going to come down and got,

24
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:20,170
I got to buy it back from you. So the
guy comes down and he's, you know,

25
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,720
asking what he wants for it in
Richard's just like, I mean,

26
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:26,740
I was thinking like 20 and
the guy goes, he goes, dude,

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,900
you bought it from my brother.
I know what you paid for it.

28
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:31,060
He actually got embarrassed.
He's like, Oh man, that's sorry.

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,950
It's the only time I ever saw him
get like embarrassed. He wasn't,

30
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:38,740
he just went into like his, his
thing and like, I swear to God,

31
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,810
like watching that show,

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,020
like you get better at like
negotiating and like, uh,

33
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,800
and like occasionally he does
like the sketches to where he,

34
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,530
he'll do like a character imitating like
an old school used car salesman and you

35
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:56,130
just how good he does it. Cause you
know, it's like he's a performer,

36
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,570
an actor or anything. How good he
does. It's like this guy is like,

37
00:01:58,571 --> 00:02:02,680
this is just in his blood. He's just
been a car guy. He's been flipping cars.

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm trying to, I'm seeing the
show in a minute, but like,

39
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:10,100
he used to talk about how he, uh, uh,
you know, by the time he was like 19,

40
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,840
he was on like his 30th car or something.
Like, he was just like, I liked that car.

41
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:15,430
I'm gonna buy this car. I like
that one. And he was just,

42
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,730
every month would just
flip them. Um, those cars,

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,600
there's something about
those shows that it, those,

44
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,950
an auction shows or anytime
like a pawn shop shows,

45
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,020
there's something about wanting to
know how the deal plays out. Yeah.

46
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,410
That is so compelling for people.
There's something like, and I'm a moron,

47
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,540
I'll just sit there staring like,
how much are they going to get?

48
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,990
How much are you gonna get for that?
Yeah. Who that civil war coins,

49
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,770
what are those worth and how much
say down and just like, yeah,

50
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,500
I mean that Guy Richard.
Richard's probably the best I've seen.

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,130
He's the most entertaining cause
he's like a fun guy to watch.

52
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,870
It's a performance. He's like, aw
man, I man, I was thinking, Oh man,

53
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:58,120
I don't know. Yeah. And then he goes up
there and he pulls out this giant Wad.

54
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,190
It's like, dude, you
had, you had the money,

55
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,110
the other guy has to
sit there and watch it.

56
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,400
Then he kind of makes fun
of him afterwards. Yeah. You
know, we can kind of make,

57
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,120
you know, in a funny, like a
funny way or whatever. But um, um,

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,570
it's a funny thing to that
how appealing that is to men.

59
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,190
Like I bet if you looked at the number
of women who watch those car shows versus

60
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,830
the number of,
like Neil motor trend has a channel now.

61
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,890
They have their own channel
and I guarantee you that
is 97% dudes and 3% women

62
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,710
complaining. 3% women going,
what the fuck are you watching?

63
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,660
Like if you looked at the actual numbers,

64
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,650
like what is it about cars
like girls can drive cars,

65
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,280
girls drive cars all the time. Girls
liked cars. They don't like cars.

66
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,490
The way guys like cars, it's just
most of them generally speaking. Yeah,

67
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,350
I'll say like Danica Patrick and a
few psychos. Yeah, I met her one time.

68
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,990
Yeah I saw a picture with you.
She took me around.

69
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:54,210
The Indianapolis Motor speedway is coming
down that straightaway and seeing like,

70
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:56,620
you know where they have the leaderboard
and everything was iconic and I've been

71
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:00,880
to that race a couple of times
so it was crazy. And as we going,

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,260
she ended up, she only went like
half the speed of what the car,

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,620
how fast they would be going or something.

74
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:10,600
And we got up to maybe like one 40 but
we were like going around turns and like

75
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,710
my face is doing this.

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,160
But what I loved about her was
she had like test pilot vibe.

77
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,540
Yeah. Like she came up and it was
just vice like handshake and shit.

78
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,410
Beast. Yeah. It was
pretty, uh, you guys are,

79
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,020
yeah. She was just totally
like a difference in her
sunglasses. In my sunglasses.

80
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,040
I definitely, I have
passengers, sunglasses. You
know what he's talking about?

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,980
They look the same. No, no, no. Those
are like right off the fucking shelf.

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,040
What's wrong with your sunglasses
or his or hers? Like you'll see it.

83
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,270
I don't tell him the details.
Come on, man. That's like
we, you know, I, I probably,

84
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,820
you know, your crescent kick
probably looks to save his fucking,

85
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,320
some guy in a strip mall to me. I mean, I,

86
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,520
he said crescent as one of the
rarest kicks anybody ever pulls off.

87
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,590
It's leftover from the 80s, whatever.
Um, but that's kind of legit.

88
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,790
Cressend kicks kind of legit.
