1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,320
The joe rogan experience.
That's what I get.

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:07,240
Probably something something
representative of Chicago back home. Jeff.

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,220
Fuck on Chicago.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,930
Deep dish pizza in a broad like get a
old style and a hat dog on my shoulder.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,990
Shit,
a snow shovel and a fucking bratwurst.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,010
He's got a high cholesterol chart
reading everything is up at the top.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,320
Problem problem, but everybody's
fine. Don't worry about it.

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,530
Everyone's got affect gut
and then find in a big smile.

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,860
Heard you making fun or Joe
Rogan's making fun of us stone.

10
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:37,080
I don't like that and she
can't go tell him to fuck off.

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,610
That's what I say to Joe Rogan.
Swell.

12
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:43,611
Boycott your fucking shitty show on
June 8th hey is your [inaudible],

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,360
is Joe Rogan in? No. Seth Rogan's to
get a broader Joe Rogan. They know it.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,030
They don't each other these different
than that other guy. Different guy.

15
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,560
Seth Rogen. He not fake.
Got Mad at me. He goes,

16
00:00:55,561 --> 00:01:00,000
everyone spells my name wrong cause
are you sorry dude. Who is this?

17
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,730
A dumb way of spelling it.
You got to stop using an e at the end.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,840
Rogin rock n route again.
It's Rogan.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,620
Rogan Gan to English. Mine's
Irish. His his English.

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,670
But do you see this crazy as
fuck? Yeah. This is $500 uh,

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,270
gravity bomb.
It's a little too much for a gravity bong,

22
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:22,950
but it's just smoke a joint.
$500 for gravity. Bong. I
look at it. It looks crazy.

23
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,430
Yeah. She shares with a real
good idea. Look, we want to joint

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,080
wash and flipped it looked at, he flips
his shit right upstairs in the lighter.

25
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,030
Yeah. Gas Station. Lighter joint.
We're good. You don't need a $500 bond.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,590
Seth Rogan so serious.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,220
I handed him stoner of the year award
once one of the high times awards,

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,880
500 bucks out of the woods.
That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,100
People are always trying to
give me these fucking things.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,020
Did you get stoner of the year award?
Yeah, I got it once right? Did I get it?

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,750
They were offering it to me.
I think I might have had to go to get it.

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,170
As you said, you probably
were like, I can't go a man.
Yeah, I'm Muslim. Gonna go.

33
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,090
I'm not going to say I can't go. I hosted
the doobies one year, which was fun.

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,220
It was like an award show that was
in like 2001 yeah. And then uh,

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,460
I gave an award to Seth
Rogan and another time,

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,850
but they've asked me to perform at
those before and I did it once where the

37
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:22,140
doobies it's just everyone's
high as a kite. It's all weird.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,160
It's this, I mean you
just, there's so out of it.

39
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,690
Crazy show ever. It's the
underground comedy show in Toronto.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,400
Do you haven't done that place dude,

41
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,070
they have a bong shop and in the
back room it's all a comedy show,

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,860
but it's all people
smoking pot in the room.

43
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,980
It's a hot button while
you're doing the show. Yeah,

44
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:47,730
they have bongs on the tables,
dude. People are blitzkrieg.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,100
You are so high when you're on stage,

46
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,600
you can't remember what you were
talking about three seconds ago.

47
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,900
I mean it's so bad and it's thick.
Like smoke everywhere. Like the hope,

48
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,390
there's no ventilation you
kit to material. You just
have to go fuck around. Yeah.

49
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,030
I mean you could try to do material.
I definitely have tried,

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,730
but like I took Tripoli there
and AAA doesn't really get high.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,270
At least he didn't, I don't
know. I don't think he does time.

52
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:12,250
I think he might've been sober,
but dude,

53
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,880
he got blitzkrieg just breathing the
air in this place got fucking ripped.

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,960
The whole, the whole place is bomb.
There was, I don't think it was a,

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,550
I don't think anyone bombed
bombed venue where you're like,

56
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm never going to do well in here.
They don't fucking,

57
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,930
they're not paying attention. You're just
out of it. It's just the whole thing.

58
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,570
You're off, everything's
off right. You're so high.

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,380
But that's also where I did a thing on
the iron sheik came on stage and that

60
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,180
place he ever seen a video of the Iron
Sheik Joe Rogan's and he starts talking

61
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:43,570
to me and that's when I realized
the price that pro wrestlers pay,

62
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,800
like the health, like this poor
fellows in crutches and shit,

63
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,080
he can barely walk.
That's him and me on stage

64
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,403
chocolate.

65
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,640
The toughest for the Olympics
is freestyle wrestling serve.

66
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,330
I'm 30

67
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,770
know to

68
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,250
one of the highlights.
Lots

69
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,810
of my life being on stage.

70
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,730
Hi is giraffe pussy talking to the iron
cheek in a room with a pot leaf behind

71
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:42,380
me. That's a big old pot
leaf. Was He ripped to sober?

72
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,350
I in the house? There was no one
sober in that place. I don't, I don't.

73
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,080
I literally don't think it would be
possible to be sober in that room.

74
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,480
I just don't think you could be. There's
no air in that room. They trap you. Yeah.

75
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:52,460
I like all the fire.

76
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,610
There's fire like they are little
candles and stuff on a table,

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,340
like it's running on air.
They don't have any air to stay lit.

78
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,250
The flame is flickering out.
It's all, we had smoke in here.

79
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,300
Everybody's like lists. Like the whole
idea is less candles burn on weed. Joe.

80
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,070
It's fine, but the shows, they're always
real weird. People go there and just,

81
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,840
it's in Vancouver? No, it's
Toronto. Toronto, Toronto.
I forget what it's called.

82
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,120
Comedy underground. Something like
that. Puff Puff Mama around comedy club.

83
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,830
Underground comedy club.
Yeah.

84
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,530
We've done it a couple of times and
he's still doing shows and shit there.

85
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,320
I don't know. I think so.
Yeah. They don't give up.

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
They forgot every time they get to high,
they forgot they got through high.

87
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,320
We had to stop it, but we didn't
remember. Dude, who's coming up there?

88
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,210
Give them a plug. Underground comedy
Puff Mama. Dot. Ca. There you go. Fun,

89
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,760
fun place though. And very, very
nice people did it a few times. Dope.

90
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:45,770
And they did tell a bunch of people
that I was coming and it wasn't coming.

91
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,430
And then people got mad at me and like,
Hey, Yay. I didn't fucking sales coming.

92
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,090
Somebody set a fire in there somewhere.
Promotes your shit, and you're like,

93
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,090
did I say it or did you
hear it from another party?

94
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,430
You didn't hear me promising you fucking
which you going to be there, bro.

95
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:02,450
We booked tickets, this chores before
Joel get tickets. Which your older boys.

96
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,810
Hey, just so many people. There's
just so many people in the worship.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,570
Okay.
Okay.
