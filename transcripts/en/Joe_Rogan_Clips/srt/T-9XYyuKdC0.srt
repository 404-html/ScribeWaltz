1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,050
And it's like, what am I going to
do? Biceps and chest. It's over.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,630
Hey Dude, to 25 ever again. Yeah.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,400
That was my workout since I was like
18. I'd go in, nothing. Nothing changed.

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:19,290
It was two 25 years.
And then let's do some curls and a,

5
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,520
you know, neglect the abs
and go home. The legs,

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,500
no legs. Although I did have
a, I played soccer growing
up, so I did have those, uh,

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,630
soccer lakes.
I got like Earl Campbell thighs.

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,800
Yeah, soccer is one of the
best exercises ever. I mean,

9
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,350
it was also a great way to blow your
ACL out. Totally. Everybody's, you know,

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,970
it's shifting left and right and all
that. There's a fucking picture, you know,

11
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:48,950
big boy, the a, the a,
the Dj, his fucking son.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,020
There's a video.
He retweeted it.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,310
His son is a football
player and there's a,

14
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:57,470
there's a video of his son where,
you know,

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,180
someone's trying to tackle him
and he moves like a fucking ghost.

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,530
It's incredible.
You watch him like it was one,

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,090
one of those rare things where you see
something and you're like legitimately

18
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:11,300
impressed. Like, Holy Shit, I
watched it like five times in a row.

19
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:16,130
This kid's footwork is incredible.
Yeah. But footwork like that,

20
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:18,830
kind of like, like who's in
better shape than soccer players?

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,660
They're constantly sprinting dog games
like you and you have to maintain that

22
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,820
stamina.
You're constantly sprinting.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,420
There's a lot of mileage you're
putting on in a, in a soccer game.

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,120
Although you know what
gives me and you're, you're,

25
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:36,140
you are probably going to laugh as
well as your listeners. Believe me.

26
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,700
Pickleball, you ever played pickle
ball? What does that pickle pickle ball.

27
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:46,430
It's like pennys and pink Pong.

28
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,470
And you played in a gymnasium. So
it's like a, it's a net and it's,

29
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:55,730
you got paddles and talk about
moving side to side. It's,

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,470
it's fun and you burn a ton of
calories and you do it in a gym.

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,290
You didn't have an gym and like a,
like a basketball court.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,230
So it's like racquetball, but
there's a net, there's a net.

33
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,860
So it's a bouncing off the wall. You're,
you plan it like tennis. It's, yeah,

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,500
it's a court, small net. And you have, uh,

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,500
like in Venice, those little
small courts. It why of old.

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,640
Hello, my name is Fred. This is, listen,
you're going to laugh. All right.

37
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:30,140
There's a lot of old people that
play this, but I'm telling you it's,

38
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,610
this is embarrassing. So you each
have your use for people. Yeah,

39
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:35,540
you could do doubles,

40
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:40,490
but me and my buddy play just one
on one and I'm telling you it's not,

41
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,880
it looks like it's not only fun,
but you,

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,350
you burn a lot of calories and you don't
even know you're doing it because I'm

43
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:53,180
diving and it's, uh, it's one
of the exercises that we, uh,

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,940
we really enjoy it when he's got you
doing and he's got you doing polities

45
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,310
pickle ball. What's next? I have no,

46
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,780
he's working his way. He know what he's
working towards. I don't have to tell him.

47
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,340
I'll call you. I know a lot of 68
year old people play this, but, uh,

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,770
if you're looking for a low, uh,
kind of impact, fun activity,

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,400
uh, it looks good if you're
looking at it and go, oh, it does.

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,410
Tennis is fucking hard. And it's man,
it's another thing. This is like a,

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,710
this is like tennis reduced
to a smaller court basically.

52
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,420
Probably Healthier for you. It's not
as hard on the ankles and the needs to,

53
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,360
it's not as hard.

54
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,400
I will have to go after we have our steak,

55
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,290
we would one go to him.
And of course in Venice beach.

56
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,130
That's what I thought it was.

57
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,550
I've always seen these small tennis
courts there and I know really what people

58
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,540
were playing. So they're calling it
paddle tennis. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe this,

59
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,300
but this is what, this is what it
is. These guys look ridiculous.

60
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,080
They should just go home. This is
outrageous. What are you doing sir?

61
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,490
I'm telling you. Put a little
English. Listen, I grew up ping pong.

62
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,950
I'm really good at Ping Pong.
Yeah.

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,140
So this is like a larger
version of ping pong.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,270
Yeah. It looks like it's fun. All bullshit
aside. That looks like a good time.

65
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,290
It's fun. Believe me, I know your
listeners at night and left and right now,

66
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,580
but I'm telling you it's,
it's uh, it's, it's good.

67
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,480
So that's what I'm doing.
Show.

68
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,690
So you take your trainer with you on
your road on the road. That's the move.

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,600
Where's this? Where'd you meet this
guy? I've known him for 20 years.

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,880
I met him on the set of days of our lives,

71
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:39,360
doing extra work days of our lives.

72
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,330
When I first came out to la in 1998,

73
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,210
I was the type of guy,

74
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:49,860
I would do these weird like
mailings to get work right.

75
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:53,940
So for days of our lives, not, gee, it
was general hospital, General Hospital,

76
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,230
take a headshot and then
take a post it note.

77
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,620
And I would write on the post
it note ready to operate,

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,040
stuck it could had shot and I sat it out.

79
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,340
So I would do these like weird
little mailing. Oh, you know,

80
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,360
maybe the personal opened
in the mail would go, oh,

81
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:15,160
I get a little chuckle and whatnot.
So I met him doing extra work.

82
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,580
This is what I used to do, uh,
for, for some extra cash. And uh,

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,520
we became fast friends.
He's an Italian kid and uh,

84
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,640
w w w similar upbringing, middle class.
He's from New York. I'm from Chicago.

85
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,620
And, uh, just a great, great guy.
