1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,890
This, you're a very popular, what
I would call conservative thinker.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,130
Yeah. But you're very young.
Like how did this all happen?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,610
How did you become this Fox News
personality? Conservative thinker?

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,860
Yeah. I mean I just like launched a
youtube channel and ah, fucking youtube.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,470
Yeah. Youtube where, where magic
happens. You choose a strange place.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,810
It's a strange, strange place. Yeah.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,770
Well it's the internet and the Internet
stream things happen on the Internet.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,950
But yeah, I just kind of, I
was really passionate. Um,

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,700
I understood I had studied for like,
it sounds strange,

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:38,650
but like I spent a year underground
like studying politics once I had my red

11
00:00:38,651 --> 00:00:40,600
pill moment, if that's what
you want to call. Explain that.

12
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:44,170
Because you used to be a liberal, right?
And then you became a conservative.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,940
That's correct.
So what was it?

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,500
So the story like really starts
with like high school I guess.

15
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:53,080
Like you know how things can happen to
you in life and they don't make sense

16
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:54,610
when they happen. You're like, why God me?

17
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,160
And then when you get a little older and
you're like, this makes perfect sense.

18
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:57,790
Right?

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,790
So I was the quote unquote victim of a
hate crime when I was in high school.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,180
When you say quote unquote victims,
no, I hate the word victim and it's,

21
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,010
I'm like Anne again early.

22
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:12,460
I can see why early on I've sort of
developed this mentality that like being a

23
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:12,610
vague,

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,310
there's no value in being a victim and
people rush to call people a victim.

25
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:16,900
They rush to call
somebody to get aggressor.

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,540
So how do you describe it that
you experienced at his experience?

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,010
Something that was labeled a hate crime?

28
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,450
I W I wouldn't even call it a hate crime.

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,280
I think we live in a
label obsessed culture.

30
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:28,960
And before we seek to understand what
happened, we seek to like put it in a box.

31
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:32,300
Yeah. Like so what? Someone has to be
a demon and someone has to be an right.

32
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:32,800
Right,
right.

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,800
So what happened was I received some
voice mail messages from about four kids

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,770
and the like, you know, the language
was, it was pretty strong. It was like,

35
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,070
we're going to tar and
feather your family. Um,

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,570
we're going to put a ball in the back of
your head that we did the Martin Luther

37
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,990
King, like you know Edward Edward, Edward.
Um, you received these on your phone?

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,790
On my cell phone? Yeah. How'd
they get your phone number? Well,

39
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,850
there was a prank phone call,

40
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:57,760
so I didn't know I was like four male
voices and I was like in high school at

41
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:59,020
the time and I was like,
okay.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,020
I cannot think of for human beings
that want me dead, that would say like,

43
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:02,620
we're going up,

44
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,010
put a ball in the back of your head like
we did to Martin Luther King and Rosa

45
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,380
Parks. Like naming your own school.
Where were you? What part of the country?

46
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,590
Stanford High School in Connecticut.
Okay. That's a shit hole. Yeah,

47
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,480
it's a total shit hole.
Hey Connecticut. Yeah.

48
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,280
No I didn't because I
think it's on a shit hole.

49
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,620
It's a running joke. I'm sorry. Oh Shit.
I gotta grab my Buddy Tommy Junior.

50
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,540
He lives in Connecticut and
I'm always telling him, dude,

51
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,530
you gotta move out of Connecticut.

52
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,950
And it became this terrible running joke
where I talk about the Connecticut's to

53
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:28,670
worst. Have you actually
been a bunch of times? Yeah,

54
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,840
I used to work there all
the time. What's it? Well,

55
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:35,040
I used to work in all over Connecticut.
When I was doing standup,

56
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,590
I would drive from
Boston into Connecticut.

57
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,370
I did like a lot of gigs in Hartford.
I did gigs.

58
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,990
Hartford is a shit hole.
It's a shithole bridge is a shithole.

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,730
Shout out to Mario and starling
junior though. Yeah. Um,

60
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,250
he was a boxer that came out of a
Hartford. Yeah. Big Time boxer. Marlin,

61
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,790
Marlin, starling. Um,

62
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,350
but when you were in high school,
right,

63
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,730
somebody

64
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,390
started doing this prank call
and shit on you and was this,

65
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,670
it was all in one, like four
voices is tied to like a boyfriend

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,820
boyfriends house. When I got the
calls and I just put to silence,

67
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,290
it was like blocked number. So I was
like, I didn't think anything of it.

68
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,560
And then like when I listened to it, like
it was like some pretty horrific stuff.

69
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,000
Like I definitely cried, you
know, I was 17 years old. Um,

70
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,300
and then the next day at school I took
this like philosophy class and like,

71
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,630
I don't know what the topic was.

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,560
I don't know what prompted me to raise
my hand and introduced what had happened

73
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,430
last night as like, you know, a segway.
Maybe I just needed to get off my chest.

74
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,100
But like the teacher like
spazzed out and was like, get up,

75
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:42,850
we're going to the principal's office.
Like, you know, you have to report this.

76
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,480
He brings me into the office.
The principal like freaked out.

77
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,780
Like she just like the language was like,
you know, if it was shocking, you know.

78
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,530
Um,

79
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,030
and then she called like the resource
officer and then like the next period of

80
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:58,600
my life was like a blackout because it
turned out that three of the kids I had

81
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,900
never even met.
Like they,

82
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:02,170
this was like maybe some kids
that had their first beer.

83
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,450
One of the kids I was like friends with,

84
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,720
but we were arguing because he was upset
that I was like spending so much time

85
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,940
with my boyfriend, but
he's gay. Like he was,

86
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,440
it wasn't like he just was
like Jelly, like, you know,

87
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:15,190
like just like I using Alpha everyday
started hanging off my boyfriend was a

88
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,900
stupid thing. Wasn't a
hundred percent. Yeah, no,

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,240
he's a 100% gay from what I'm told.
But um,

90
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,010
yeah, so, uh, petty. Yeah.
And then it was like,

91
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,070
here are my three friends and they were
all going to get drunk and call these,

92
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,960
call this black girl. And you know, it's
easy to say awful things until like this.

93
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,760
Like you're don't have
to look at a human being.

94
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,210
Like it's easy to say awful things.
But unfortunately for me,

95
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,900
one of the people in the car happened to
be the current governor of Connecticut

96
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,743
Sun.

97
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,480
So this turned from like some kids prank
called to like said some awful things

98
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:53,980
to like front page of the newspaper
throughout the entire shift. Connecticut,

99
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:58,360
a little bit in New York,
Naacp outside of my school I have to,

100
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,270
it was like this situation that
was talk about outrage culture.

101
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:05,320
My first like introduction to outrage
culture and the things that sort of formed

102
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:09,280
my thoughts. Like this was a very
formative experience in my life. Um,

103
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,750
which to me it was, it was nonpolitical,
but it was like my life wasn't mine.

104
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,880
Like I went from like
sitting down watching,

105
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,660
I was watching Talladega nights with my
boyfriend to being the most discussed

106
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,460
person in the state of Connecticut.

107
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:25,510
And what was interesting about it was
just that because it was the governor of

108
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,100
Connecticut sign that was in this car,

109
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,530
they had to get the FBI involved to
determine the authenticity of the like,

110
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:34,240
like maybe she called herself right, they
heal instead of just saying like, yes,

111
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,074
it was my son.

112
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,680
He actually let the FBI investigate for
six weeks and waited for a son to get

113
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,340
arrested six weeks late.
You know what I mean? Like

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,050
was just want to see if he can get
away with it. Cause this is politics,

115
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,610
you know what I mean? Like,
can we get away within,

116
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,250
is it plausible for us to
get away with it? You know,

117
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:52,060
so six weeks of the entire
state, I didn't, I left school.

118
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:56,490
People were like fighting on my behalf,
fighting our school home school. Yeah.

119
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,970
Yeah. It was, it was just like,
yeah, yeah. This was just like,

120
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,950
it was like a monstrosity of a situation
and it was one of those things where

121
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,680
like literally like letters to the editor
and be like, mom's like, talk about,

122
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:13,550
you know, outrage culture. Right. I don't
believe Candice, yeah, this happened,

123
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,770
this girl,
I believe she called herself like,

124
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm just looking for attention one night
and I just decided to say I was going

125
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:20,210
to hang by family from a tree.

126
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,260
Isn't it funny that someone would
even have an opinion on that? It's,

127
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,930
it's bizarre. Like I believe her
writes letters to the editor. Like I,

128
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:29,930
the whole thing is weird retrospectively,
right? Like I don't believe her,

129
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,210
but that is what like life is about,
right?

130
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,130
Like you have to write
a youtube right now.

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,610
I still know this is how you're
gonna fucking, yeah, exactly.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,420
So it was the situation that like,
it was just completely out of my control.

133
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,540
And then as quick as it,
how did these kids got arrested?

134
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,720
And then as quick as it happened,
it was over, um, for like everyone,

135
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,630
but not for me. Are
these kids, right, right.

136
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,880
Like so I never wanted these kids
to get arrested. Like if no one,

137
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,490
like this whole situation
was taken out of my hands.

138
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:01,190
People thought I didn't go to the police
and like my teacher went to the police.

139
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:05,150
It turned into this do these kids
were labeled publicly racists. Right?

140
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,350
The youngest kid in the car,

141
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:10,280
it was 14 I'm not comfortable with ever
labeling a 14 year old racist. Right.

142
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,970
Or any of these kids racist.
These are kids and in my opinion,

143
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,100
adults that failed to act like adults.

144
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,490
Adults that failed to take a step
back and say, okay, why would,

145
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,910
what would prompt these kids do this?
Why is it so easy to be mean? Right.

146
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:27,020
Why is it so easy nowadays for
children to be mean and no one to me,

147
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,340
like when I really thought about that,

148
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,330
I went through like five years of like
anorexia because of the situation.

149
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,800
Because of that one and I was
the victim. Yeah. And Yeah,

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,760
you went through Anorexia.
Yeah.

151
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,480
Which is so weird now because
like people that know me now,

152
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,730
like there's no way you never didn't eat.
But I did.

153
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,610
I did like did not eat
for like five years.

154
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:50,510
I had issues with Anorexia because
I mean I actually has a disease that

155
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,840
genuinely is about control.
It's about asserting control of your life.

156
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,010
And I felt that I had my,

157
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,490
like my life was fine and then
like people took the narrative, um,

158
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,270
and I can decide to determine what
the narrative was. You're in your,

159
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:06,740
you're a victim or maybe you're a liar,
you know, you're, these kids are racist,

160
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,680
these kids are this.
And just nobody really thought that.

161
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,480
Like you actually wrote all of our lives,
right.

162
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,230
Like for a little bit like these kids
went on to have like Duis and get arrested

163
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:19,520
and got into drugs and it was because
of this outbreak of everything that

164
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:23,200
happened. Yeah. And I was like, would have
been totally cool with an apology. Like,

165
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,270
you know what I mean? Like, sorry.

166
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,330
Well good for you for
looking at it that way.

167
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,620
And as that's hard to do because everybody
loves when they are allowed to get

168
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:34,360
outraged.
Everybody loves get outraged.

169
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,780
Obviously what they did to you was
horrible. But I think a lot of kids,

170
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:38,890
especially if they're drinking,

171
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,410
they don't even understand
how stupid and gross it is,

172
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,530
what they do and they just know they can
do it and they get a thrill out of it.

173
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:47,920
And then there's that mob mentality when
there's like a bunch of people together

174
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:50,780
doing the same thing. Exactly.
Amp it up and start saying crazy.

175
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,950
We understand the,

176
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,870
when you just like think about it as a
human being and not as somebody who has

177
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:58,110
to opinion, like you're like, hey, we're
going to call this black girl, right?

178
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,660
You've got a bunch of kids were going
to just say mean things to her on the

179
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,630
phone and you don't have to
look her in the face. Right?

180
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,770
It's like if I hold up this pen
and I'm like, just say mean stuff.

181
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,550
Like someone's going to get, you could
say anything to this pen. So it's,

182
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,180
it's sort of, um, it, it was a
formative experience that um,

183
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,330
in retrospect I understand has so
much to do with why I am who I am.

184
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,530
Cause I hated that.

185
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,830
Like that label obsessed culture and
the outrage machine and then like,

186
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,450
oh okay we're done. But like, you know,

187
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:27,210
forget the people that whose
lives we just like, no.

188
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,310
Do you know those people anymore?
I don't,

189
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:32,880
I I know like the siblings of them because
I was friends. Like that's the thing,

190
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,380
like one of the people that was involved,

191
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,240
I was very good friends with
his brother and it's like,

192
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,340
you're just going to tell
me this kid's like a racist.

193
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,520
Like I actually knew the kid's
mother, you know, like nobody cared.

194
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:46,230
It was just a hot story.
Really Racist. Just stupid.

195
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,320
I mean stupid did something
stupid and they do that.

196
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:51,390
That was a way that they could scare you,
right.

197
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,390
That they could and they
might've been drunk like drunk.

198
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,250
Maybe it was their first beer.
Right.

199
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,580
But people can do well,

200
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,750
the youngest was 14 the youngest and
this person was labeled a racist.

201
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,370
Like that's to me is like, that's harsh.
People say, Oh, you're too forgiving.

202
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,270
Labeled him a racist, they said
was most certainly racist. Yes.

203
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:16,110
The words are racist. Right. Can
Somebody, I guess the question is,

204
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,580
can somebody say something,

205
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,150
say a word that is racist and
not be a racist human being? Yes.

206
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,750
I think now I'm going to tell
you why. Yes. Okay. Okay.
