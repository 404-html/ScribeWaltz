1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,220
You live in New York, where
you live in, in New York,

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:06,660
when Tribeca flooded a few years
ago, what was that like? Well,

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:09,540
I mean I think in a situation like that,
um,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,690
most people emerge from a particular
disaster and think, my God,

5
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:19,710
since this is so awful,
it must be an anomaly.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:25,110
And you know, I think New York was
really horrified as a city by Sandy,

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,550
but there's going to be, sandy is,

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,600
I don't remember the exact stat like
once every five years by the end of this

9
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,960
category storm Sandy, I think it
made landfall as a category three.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,890
So it's not even a five.
Yeah. So if a five hidden,

11
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:44,640
is it possible for five to hit New York
as a too far north? No, as possible.

12
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,330
Totally possible.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,230
I was talking to a really prominent
climate scientist a few months ago who is

14
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:53,410
like one of the, he was one of the
lead authors on the UN report, um,

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,550
lives in New York, does a lot of
consulting with the city. And I said,

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,930
so we're going to build a sea wall
to protect New York from flooding.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,080
And he was like, oh, absolutely.
You know, Manhattan real estate,

18
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,880
it's way too expensive to let flood.
So we'll definitely build a seawall.

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,360
But an infrastructure project like
that takes at least 30 years to build.

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,310
And if we started right now,

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,870
we wouldn't be able to finish in time to
save Howard beach and parts of Brooklyn

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:23,280
and Queens. If we started
right now, he said, he said,

23
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,120
the city knows this and you'll
see in the next few years,

24
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,430
they'll stop doing
repairs on infrastructure.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,910
They'll stop attending to the
subway lines in those neighborhoods.

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,530
And even a few years after that,

27
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,810
they'll start staying explicitly
to the people who live there.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,440
You might be able to continue living
in these homes for a couple of decades,

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,220
but you're not going to be able to live
them, leave them to your kids. Whoa.

30
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,331
This is in New York City.

31
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,820
It's like the richest country in
the richest city in the world.

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,310
And he a huge parts of,
um,

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,050
huge parts of southern Brooklyn and
Queens are going to be underwater.

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,500
So for the people that live there right
now, what parts are you talking about? Um,

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,370
well the one that, the
one that he mentioned most
explicitly was Howard beach,

36
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:06,360
but, um, which is, it's kind of an inch.
It's like a mob neighborhood and you know,

37
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:10,040
it's still, yeah. Really well. Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,840
So cause that was like the
Gotti neighborhood, right? Yeah.

39
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,760
That's where they buried all
the dead bodies. Wow. Um,

40
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,370
I didn't know that was still a
mob neighborhood. Well, you know,

41
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,540
to the extent that there
is a mob. Yeah. Um,

42
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,760
and yeah, I mean that's true
everywhere on the coast, everywhere.

43
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,700
It's not just New York. New
York's not exceptional. You know,

44
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:34,440
their projections that like $30 billion
of New Jersey real estate could be

45
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,980
underwater by 20, 30, 20, 30.
Why does that not as alarming

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,480
was born in New Jersey. It's
not as alarming. And then,
you know, Miami beaches,

47
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:50,220
you know, Miami beach has done for, yeah.
Miami beach is almost inevitable. Correct?

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,990
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know,
they could, they could build
a seawall, but that, those,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,960
that's not going to help because of the,
the ground. Right. It's just so expensive.

50
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,690
So you really have to,
um,

51
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,890
you really have to pick your poison and
then when you look around the world,

52
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,770
you know,
it's like Bangladesh,

53
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,200
that country is going to be
almost entirely underwater.

54
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,790
That's hundreds of millions of people.
If we wanted to build a seawall,

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,600
they can't afford that. Who's going to
afford, who's going to pay for that?

56
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,160
And this is all because of the raising
sea level because of the melting ice,

57
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,010
because of the temperature and all of
this is happening and I think, you know,

58
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:27,250
we think of sea level is really a
thing that happens on the coastline,

59
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,450
which it is primarily,

60
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,920
but it also increases flooding on rivers
because the water is all connected of

61
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:33,280
course.

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
So flooding in the UK is expected to
grow 50 folds by the end of the century.

63
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,530
What will that life d fold?

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,960
London is already like
underwater a couple times a year.

65
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,540
I mean not the whole city, but it
is this Jamie, this is Bangladesh.

66
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:51,490
I just went to oh dash underwater
video that pops up. Oh my God,

67
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:54,850
these people are fucked. Yeah. It
says 18 million residents live here.

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,940
That's a swamp. Yeah.
That looks crazy. Like it.

69
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,900
Like if you are a real estate projector
and you're flying over that like uh,

70
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,770
yeah, yeah, yeah. We
can't belt here. Yeah.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,230
Jakarta will be totally underwhelmed
person as apartment buildings.

72
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,990
Like you could see the water level.
Look back up a little bit.

73
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,230
This is just a running little
thing. But if you see, look at like,

74
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
doesn't that look like
a water level on the,

75
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:16,820
the apartment buildings in the right
hand side near where your cursor is like,

76
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,380
like that's gonna go up to where
that orange level is fucking Christ.

77
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,530
Well, I mean over millennia where
they're going to rise hundreds of feet.

78
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,640
Oh God.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,400
I mean it's going to take a long time
so you can adjust to that a little bit.

80
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,080
But um, but that's always
been the case, right? The,

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,050
they're still fine.

82
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,070
They find these artifacts and things
in the middle of the ocean areas where

83
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:45,430
people used to be able to live and
now they can't live anymore. Yeah,

84
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,540
I think that'll be, we have
to move, people have to
move. So what's a good spot?

85
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,440
Alberta, anywhere, anywhere,
anywhere. Off The tin.

86
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,790
That's the spot now. I mean I think I
would like that all the time. And I say,

87
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,031
you know,

88
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,780
honestly the place that I would move
to is somewhere in Scandinavia really

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,770
because, um, you know, I talked about
the impact of economic growth before,

90
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:07,870
but they're going to
be parts of the world,

91
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:11,290
the benefit economically from this
anywhere in the north. So Canada,

92
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,580
Russia and Scandinavia will benefit
because, but why don't go to Scandinavia,

93
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,470
go to Canada. It's right
there. Well let's get a,

94
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,490
seems kind of keep pretty hard to
me. I did that. Scandinavia is nice,

95
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:24,580
but Canada is like our neighbors,
they also,

96
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,140
they have wildfires there to Canada
and in the Arctic Circle in Finland,

97
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,640
bears and outlines. But so
you know, these, these guys,

98
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,610
the economists who study
this stuff say that, um,

99
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,560
there is actually an optimal
temperature for human productivity.

100
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,300
It's 13 degrees Celsius,

101
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,270
which is the historical media and
temperature of the u s it's also the

102
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,060
historical median temperature of Germany.
What does 13 Celsius?

103
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,740
Was that 60 degrees or
something like that?

104
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,630
And I think it's like in the high fifties.

105
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,213
Well,
we've got Jamie,

106
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,840
Google doesn't give it to you,
right whenever I'm in Canada,

107
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm always like, I don't know what you're
saying. Yeah. They're like, Holy Shit,

108
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:05,420
it's 22 degrees, 55. Um,

109
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,930
and so for every degree north of that
you lose about a percentage point of GDP.

110
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:16,691
So the u s is now at about 13 and a
half a degree Celsius at our media and

111
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:17,391
temperature.

112
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,780
That means that we're losing about a
half percentage point of GDP every year

113
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,614
from it.

114
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,910
But there are parts of the u s that were
cooler than 13 and are now brought up

115
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:30,810
to this optimal level. Silicon valley is
like exactly at 13 degrees right now. Um,

116
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,550
which is,
you know,

117
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,960
notable cause they're like super
productive and that's going to be,

118
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,880
so that'll be true for
Scandinavian generally.

119
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,420
And it may be part of the explanation
why there's been so much economic

120
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,240
productivity in Scandinavia over the
last generation is that they have already

121
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,670
started doing better with temperature.

122
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,950
Crops are going to be
more bountiful in Russia.

123
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,340
Like Russia will have better
agriculture because of global warming,

124
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,410
which is why they make
such a, you know, there,

125
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,440
there is such a complicated figure in
the geopolitical story about climate.

126
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,790
So they are a petro state.

127
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,460
They have almost all of their economic
activity activity has to do with burning

128
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,310
oil, but there are also poised
to benefit from warming.

129
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:11,690
So they're doubly motivated to produce
more global warming and they have such a

130
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,450
fuck the rest of the world perspective
that they're not going to stop.

131
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,150
Whereas Canada probably
they're like likely to,

132
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,620
even though they'd
benefit from more warming,

133
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:22,930
they'll probably get on board with any
program to avert warming. But that is a,

134
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:26,510
um, that's a dilemma that
faces every nation. You know,

135
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,630
like Justin Trudeau gets,
you know,

136
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,680
talks a lot of shit about Donald
Trump and his climate policy, but he,

137
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,500
Justin Trudeau is also approving new
pipelines on Glen. Marco does the same,

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,510
but she is retiring,
um,

139
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,620
nuclear so quickly in Germany that
they're having to use dirty energy. Um,

140
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,820
and even though they've had this
incredible green energy revolution there,

141
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,890
their emissions are going up. Um,
and every country in the world is,

142
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,360
it's a collective action problem.

143
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,280
Every country in the world is incentivized
to behave badly and let the rest of

144
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,360
the world clean up the mess.

145
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,940
So I was talking to this guy yesterday
about wildfires and he was like, you know,

146
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,620
California is doing so great, you know,
with all of the emission standards,

147
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,680
they're basically,
you know,

148
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,210
holding themselves to the Paris accords
even though the country as a whole isn't,

149
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,950
but that impact isn't local.
It's global. So it's dissipated.

150
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,940
The temperature impact on California
wildfires will be determined by it.

151
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:24,860
Like I said earlier, basically what
China does. So in terms of, you know,

152
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,250
what any individual area with any,
any individual nation is doing,

153
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,740
the motivations are really,
really complicated there.

154
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,640
And in California in particular,
this is a bit of a tangent, but um,

155
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,110
you know, the state has done incredible
stuff with emission standards,

156
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,630
fuel efficiency,
green energy,

157
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,620
and yet all of those gains now are wiped
out every year by the fires because

158
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,530
fires are trees,

159
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,890
trees or burning trees are basically
coal in the sense that they are stored

160
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,770
carbon when they burn,
they release carbon into the atmosphere.

161
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,890
So every time there are wildfires like
they were last year in California,

162
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,940
it literally wipes out all of the
progress that the state made in all of its

163
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:10,800
green initiatives that year. Um, yeah,

164
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,240
and you know about in, in,
in, in Brazil, the, um,

165
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,650
the president of Brazil wants to
like basically de forest, the Amazon,

166
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,220
the Amazon is responsible for something
like 30% of the world's oxygen, um,

167
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,100
and is a huge, so all plants obviously
absorb carbon and produce oxygen.

168
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,600
Um, to plant life is really good
for fighting climate change.

169
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:37,350
When you say he wants a divorce, the
Amazon, at what scale? What does he,

170
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,400
what does he talk about doing?

171
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,460
So the scientists who have studied his
proposal say that his plans would be the

172
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,190
equivalent of adding
over a 10 year period,

173
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,970
adding a second China to the
world's global footprint.
