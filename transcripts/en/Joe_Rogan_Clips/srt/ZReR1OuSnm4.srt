1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,900
Do you watch those movies and shake
your head? I like him. I just, yeah,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,560
I like science fiction, you know? Right.
You know, so yeah. I don't sit there.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,040
I grew up with star wars. That was
my, when I was nine years older son.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,290
Finances just don't, yeah,
I'm not having this. I did,

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,390
I did a an igert with Neil the grass,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,240
not an argument but a debate with him
about lightsabers ones cause I claimed

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:24,750
that they're physically the in
principle there possible. Um,

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,070
and he was trying to say that they aren't,

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,720
but they are what did have to loop back
around cause the light's not continuing

10
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,900
to like the fact that it goes to
a certain distance and pauses.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,360
We'd have to have a mirror
or something, I guess. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:38,850
Something that's going to be the end of
it. Right. That's true. So it wouldn't,

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,560
it'd be a different kind
of lights out there.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,720
The only point I was
making is that photons,

15
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,540
particles of light can
bounce off each other.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,800
So we see that in really high energy
experiments in parcel accelerators.

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,930
We can collide photons together.

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,790
So my point was a bit of a pedantic
physicist one but he's, cause he,

19
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,160
it is true that it light can bounce off.

20
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:02,580
It can hit light but very,
very high energy.

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,560
But when they press that button
to a certain distance, I wasn't,

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,030
that's engineering. I agree with you.
I agree with you. The distance thing,

23
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,890
I agree mass to it. Right. So
as you're swinging it around,

24
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,640
you wouldn't have the
leverage of a long thing.

25
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,960
So why not make it really long? Cause it
wouldn't be difficult to swing around.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,920
Like you get stabbed someone with a
light saber a mile away. That's true.

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,020
Right. That's just to laser and it,
yes. Like why, why make it so short?

28
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,250
You have to swing, you got to be
close to hitting a person with it.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,470
It's a silly silly design.

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,730
You are picking holes correctly
in the engineering. Part of my,

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,460
the only point I was
making is that physics is,

32
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,800
that we showing is quite interested in,
is like can bounce off light.

33
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,400
So,
but it would have to do,

34
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:58,340
it would have to be something that causes
it to stop at the very end. Yeah, yeah,

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,650
yeah. Which would be, you're
right, it have a mirror it,

36
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,460
but he wouldn't look cool with it if
there was no kind of thing within,

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,730
which drives me crazy about star
wars is not the light sabers.

38
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,720
It's the lasers. When they're shooting
the guns. I'm like, why can I see that?

39
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,310
Well I can't see bullets. Yeah. This is
supposed to be way faster than a bullet.

40
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,660
Like easy to see this cause
it's like George, you can duck,

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,190
you can get out of the way. Those
things, they really slow. So angry.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,020
I feel like this is so dumb.

43
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:32,370
I could go warp speed in this Millennium
Falcon and travel the speed of light,

44
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,510
but for whatever reason,

45
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,450
these lasers are so slow that you
could duck out of the way of them.

46
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:38,880
That's so dumb. And he's not only
star wars is, it's everything.

47
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,970
Every single film does that.
Yeah. Yeah. Why we slightly,

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,120
it's like films, like also I worked
on one of these films years ago.

49
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,400
Sunshine Klove underappreciated.
Moving. Yeah, I think so.

50
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:57,750
I think brilliant film. But in that,
so they asked me or Danny said,

51
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,850
I want to do it right.
So do the spacecraft without any sand.

52
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:05,760
So when he's traveling through
space, there'll be silent
and it looks shit in it.

53
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,130
Just that when you watch,
yeah,

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,350
it's the same way when you try and fill
master naughts and you and they're in

55
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,410
zero g and they always move slowly.
It's like why, you know, you're right.

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,460
You're right. You'd be able to move very
fast as you want, but it looks silly.

57
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,470
So this kind of, uh, uh,

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,120
I suppose it's what audiences
had got yeast to over the
years. And so in the end,

59
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,830
you have a best friend has best
apart from 2001 which didn't do it.

60
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,070
Yeah.
Silent in 2001 well,

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,240
Kubrick was a stickler
for science and for you,

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,690
he was apparently he would do complex
mathematics in his spare time.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,460
What fascinating guy. That must have
been. Yeah, I read that they just, um,

64
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,810
someone just found an interview,

65
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:51,250
didn't idea the day where he explained
the ending of 2001 I didn't say that.

66
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,530
Yeah, I saw it yesterday
actually, and it was,

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,200
it was kind of a really simple
version of it. He just said, well,

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,700
the sea for intelligent beings
take him in and put him in a zoo,

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
could basically and watch him grow old
and then send him back to the earth as a

70
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,830
super being,
but that's it.

71
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,770
That's the worst explanation at
the end of 2001 I've ever heard,

72
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,750
but he was key bricks. That's what cubic
said, so that he falls into the monolith.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,270
Yet they just put them in this room,

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,360
which is kind of a bad version of a
French chateau or something watching grow

75
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:29,170
old and then send him out to the
earth as a super being. Wow. Okay.

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,720
That was Kubrick's. Yeah,
Persian. I strange. It's a,

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,320
it's a, it's a weird genre, right,
because sometimes people get things right,

78
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,870
like didn't hg wells predict a,

79
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:45,400
a significant amount of scientific
inventions in the future?

80
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,120
Well, there was these, I mean
it depends which one doesn't it?

81
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:51,880
There was a moon one wasn't there.
He did an agenda to the moon.

82
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,470
I mean he's time machine is not able
to do that really worked out yet.

83
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,710
But yeah, I think it's, I
always liked science fiction.

84
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,330
I like Arthur C. Clarke a lot. You know,
cause I, I think it is, you're right,

85
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,173
it's is a,

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,710
a form that you can let your imagination
wander and address things with that

87
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,350
restriction. I think, did you like
the alien series? I loved it. Yeah.

88
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:20,080
So I leave when I was, uh,
I, when I was at school,

89
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:24,310
he's nine 79 and we had a school
film club in the Seventies.

90
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,520
They weren't like they are now,
you know.

91
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,300
So the first films they
put on the three films,

92
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:32,960
I was 11 and it was alien apocalypse
now in life of Brian. Wow. Which I,

93
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,720
so that was my introduction to, to cinema,
how well those are three great choices,

94
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:43,000
but I feel like really Scott's original
alien is probably one of the greatest

95
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,920
horror science fiction movies of all time.

96
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,700
And one of my all time favorite movies.
But I really like the newer ones as well.

97
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,410
Like I like promethium and I really
liked covenant the, the last one. Yeah.

98
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,370
From atheists. I don't know. I,
yeah, it's not the best one. Oh look,

99
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,370
they're like what they're
trying to do with it. The,

100
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,850
the whole idea of what the engineers
coming back in time and that's it.

101
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,320
That's why I was disappointed with it.

102
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,730
Cause I thought the up the opening is
brilliant and I thought this is just going

103
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:08,564
to be brilliant.
Right.

104
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,310
And then I thought it just lost its way
and it was a disappointment because it

105
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,860
could have been so brilliant.
Yes, I agree with you. Yeah.

106
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:20,810
The beginning was fantastic, but I
think covenant was more, more exciting.

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,420
And what's also preposterous, like
if you went to another planet, I,

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,500
the last thing you'd be doing is
just breathing in the air. Right?

109
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,440
I mean we'd have to be really cool
if there was a life on the planet,

110
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,040
we'd have to be really careful.

111
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,300
A not to contaminate but be not
to be contaminated. Right. Yeah.

112
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,770
I mean, yeah. There's
also, I mean, you know,

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,350
the other thing is science
fiction films is gravity.

114
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,570
Cause you always give me an alien.

115
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,160
You always just say the spaceships
got gravity. There's again,

116
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:50,770
there's only 2001 right where
everybody floats around. Yeah.

117
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,560
Because all has a spinning thing.
The spaceship has gravity,

118
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:58,520
and then when you land, the gravity is
exactly like earth. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah.

119
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,390
But it's, you know, it's
ridiculous. Yeah. I mean,

120
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:04,880
with what are the odds that you would
find a planet that is exactly like,

121
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,580
even if a planet was one and a
half times the size of earth,

122
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,340
it would have far more
gravity. Right. And that's,

123
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,680
that's really common for a planet to be
like, just a little bit bigger. Yeah.

124
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,690
And then we'd be like, fuck
everywhere it'd be walking. We'd be,

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,420
we'd be getting crushed. Right.
I agree with you. Yeah. Well,

126
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,720
I suppose that's not the point.
It's about ideas, isn't it? Science.
