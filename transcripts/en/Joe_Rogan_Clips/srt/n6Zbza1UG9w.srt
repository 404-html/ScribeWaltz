1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
I know it's a very basic way.

2
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:04,140
I mean we've been talking about
good and evil since the time of uh,

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,440
the men were able and women were able to,
you know,

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,130
write and write and philosophize
and though, but I don't know,

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:16,131
it just seems to me lately like I've
see it feels to me like evil and good is

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,330
actually a force that we're
struggling with. And I know there's,

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,110
I know like some people would
say that's kind of a, you know,

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,100
a primitive way of thinking,
but I do kind of feel like, uh,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,200
it actually is a very,

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,930
a real tangible thing.
And that,

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,680
what makes you think this
look your personal feelings?

12
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:44,160
Is it based on like your intuition?
Like what is it

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,890
I, yeah, it's intuition. It's
like a vibe. It's like a,

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,210
it's just like a,

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
maybe because I'm showing up at church
and kind of like searching a little bit.

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,970
Myself and I,

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,450
I am very much about good people doing
good things and I'm just been kind of

18
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,420
conscious of it. But then there's
always like these, this rise of evil,

19
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:08,600
they like comes up like all of
a sudden white supremacists are,

20
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,350
these riots are these horrible things
against people in different parts of the

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,640
world. And it's, it seems like
it's this ongoing struggle

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,210
look almost like why hasn't caught up
yet to the way you look at the world,

23
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,840
the way a lot of people look at the world.
Yeah.

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,860
It's a lot of people look at the
world like, like if Tom Papa,

25
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:28,250
if you were in charge and if you had to
push all the buttons that would sort of

26
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,150
decide how people behaved,
that was a possible thing.

27
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:34,880
Of course you'd have one of the first
thing you do is eliminate all the violence

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,330
and all the horrors of the world.
Yeah.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,200
And then also, I'm sorry to cut
you off, but you also see the,

30
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,840
all those horrors are done
by these men and stuff.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Who when you sit in like kind of analyze
them and they've been the victims of a

32
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:54,280
lot of things and there's like genetic
victimization and social and it's like,

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,290
so where's that coming from?
Why are these,

34
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,490
this kid that could have been okay ends
up in this life of crime and ends up

35
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:03,190
murdering somebody and
where's that coming from?

36
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:08,191
Is this just a genetic mutation or is
there like a force of good and evil?

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,690
I think we're still, we're still
dealing with the echoes of the past.

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,730
That's what I really firmly believe.

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,080
And I think also the way maybe you and
I are having this conversation the way a

40
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,200
lot of people are having these
conversations today, just like us,

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,600
like basically the same sort of rational
people sitting around with no agenda

42
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,820
going, why does this exist? Why, why
does all the horrors of life, why,

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,710
why is all this injustice? Why is
that there? I think this is, uh,

44
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,420
we haven't been here that long.

45
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,010
I just really think that that's real
and I think we need to absorb that much

46
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:44,600
better.

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Or our time spent in modern civilization
versus the time of life on earth is a

48
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,260
joke.
The time on life,

49
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:55,560
on earth and in relationship to the
time of the universe is a joke, right?

50
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,510
The numbers are insane. We
can't understand that. We,

51
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,810
we were monkeys just a couple
of weeks ago. Right. Well,

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,270
the bit that I have my act about the
United States being founded in 1776 that's

53
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,890
three people ago. Lindsey, behind her,
that's three people go really is. Yeah.

54
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,750
That's nothing.
So three people go,

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,010
people were these creatures that,
uh,

56
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,970
had to make fire to stay warm.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,390
They didn't have electricity,
they didn't have engines. Yeah.

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,280
They made boats at a trees and they use
the wind to drift across the ocean while

59
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,270
staring at the stars with a fucking
gigantic harp looking thing. Right?

60
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:34,751
What was the thing?

61
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:39,751
A sextant that thing that they use to
figure out where the other ones are.

62
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,480
So he had a trust that these motherfuckers
had mapped out the universe. Well,

63
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,460
he could make it across the ocean.

64
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,470
And a lot of people died of scurvy along
the way. Like, fuck man, that's crazy.

65
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,304
Not long ago.

66
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,660
So God damned recently
when I was listening to Dan
Carlin's hardcore history,

67
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,450
one of the best podcasts ever of you,
I don't know if you're so good,

68
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,950
but he has this thing on the mon goals
called the wrath of the cons and what

69
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,210
freaked me out is not just how crazy
that world was back then and what

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,100
unbelievable damage and destruction
the Mongols created and how they just

71
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,860
conquered empires just
moved across the world,

72
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,660
killed millions and millions of people,

73
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,220
but it was really fucked up was I think
Google this to make sure I'm not wrong.

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,760
I think that was only like 1200 BC.

75
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,740
I don't think that was that long
ago. Right. That's really recent.

76
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,400
That's really racist.

77
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,480
I think Gingiss Kahn died in the
1200 to five remember correctly?

78
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,070
508 not BC. A d. Oh, did I
say BC? I actually met a date.

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,470
I said BC, but it really did mean
a DJ in the more recent 800 years.

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm a little stone if I'd
have made it tomorrow,

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,400
but that 1200 well 1,260 would still
be still be pretty fucking recent,

82
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:01,300
but 1,208 d, which is what I
meant to say was so recent. Yes.

83
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,390
That's just not that long
ago. Yeah, that's the,

84
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,970
we're starting to make wine and
sour dough, right? Ish. Other way,

85
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,023
other way.

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,760
92 seven nine two 792 years ago a guy
killed 50 million people during his

87
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:22,030
lifetime with his actions. Right. They
changed the carbon footprint of the world.

88
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,600
I mean they, they oid I mean they, they,

89
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,690
so then you're saying it's more right?
I was right.

90
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,380
You're saying it's more surprising that
we're doing this kind of stuff and that

91
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,230
we have electric cars and the medicine
and all this other kind of like,

92
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,190
it's more surprising that we're doing
that than it is that people are running

93
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:42,250
around killing each other.
Well, Nazi Germany too.

94
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,040
That was 1940s it's crazy.

95
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,220
That's maybe crazier than anything.
You know,

96
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,620
if you and Carla and has
some great stuff on that too.

97
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:54,030
And the history of World War One and
World War II. But if you're, you're,

98
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,750
you're watching a documentary on that and,

99
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:00,590
and you watching those people move around,
especially the one that you showed me,

100
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:04,310
Jamie, that's been digitally remastered.
When you see it in color, is that Ken?

101
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,650
Is it Ken Burns it to
that? Yeah, I think so.

102
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,760
They digitally remastered some footage
from World War One and you get to watch

103
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,700
these people move around, look
in real time, you realize like,

104
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:17,380
oh these are just people.
They're just like you. I know.

105
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,310
And this is like a hundred years ago,

106
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,870
hundred years ago were involved in this
crazy ass war and then a few years later

107
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,430
involved another crazy ass war.
So why can't we figure it out dude?

108
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,760
He goes, how long he was
present? I don't know. I think,

109
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,570
I think it used to be the only
way that people got by, I think.

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,290
I think from going from
small groups of people,

111
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,380
which like in the small groups of people,

112
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,170
they would have interpersonal conflicts.

113
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,810
They would have fights
with members in the tribe,

114
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,740
but they would sort it out and there
would probably be some sort of rule that

115
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:53,000
they would all try to live by.

116
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,450
But then they would get invaded by
people that didn't have anything.

117
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:59,330
And then when looking for your stuff and
they came over the top of the hill and

118
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,510
they killed and they raped and they,

119
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,480
they stole women and they just
did that for a long ass time. Man.

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,790
They did that for a long ass time.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,330
This was the history
of the steps like that.

122
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,800
Dan Carlin maps out in this wrath of
Khan thing makes you go, Jesus, Chris,

123
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:20,801
imagine being born then Nanchang just
imagine how crazy that me being a baby at

124
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:26,810
seeing arrows flying around and if
people could open to people were lighting

125
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:31,220
people on fire and launching them
onto roofs with catapults, right?

126
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
This is the footage for World War One.

127
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,180
So look how they digitally
remastered it and

128
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,990
yeah, Peter Jackson is taking a
movie, I believe, or a documentary.

129
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:42,270
That's the craziest thing.
When you look at history and you think,

130
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,500
well that was then it's like no, they're
just us. Just happened to be there.

131
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,730
Really no different than you and

132
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,100
dude, we haven't been here this
long. We haven't been here this long.

133
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,490
This is the thing like
people that looked like this,

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,540
that awaring like uniforms
and that are you know,

135
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,980
have like decent stuff, nice wheels to
their wagons, all that kind of shit.

136
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,110
That's real recent man.

137
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,751
No,

138
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,440
I know it's reached in his
fuck and there's been a
bunch of different ways that

139
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,140
people have done it,
you know?

140
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,750
But even if he go back to like the
Egyptians but isn't it the act of like,

141
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,000
okay so we know like that guy
let his house on fire. Yeah,

142
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,140
we know that is a just instinctually we
know and have known during even all of

143
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:28,910
us this history, we've known that that
is evil like right. You know what I mean?

144
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,380
Like it's insanely selfish.

145
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,650
It's not like we went from having to
like eat each other and that we're trying

146
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,530
to get our act together. You
know what I mean? There is a,

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,240
we all know that that is such a evil,
evil thing.

148
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,840
I think it exists.
I think we have to fight it.

149
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,910
It is evil, but it's ego
that's causing that. Right?

150
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:51,640
That guy didn't want to go to jail.
It didn't want to shoot himself,

151
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,760
didn't want to kill himself
and didn't want to go to jail.

152
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,740
So he decided he was going to kill a
bunch of people to make up a story.

153
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,850
He had a plot in his plows to
save himself. All right. You know,

154
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:07,350
and that's when people get trapped in a
situation where they're allowed to make

155
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:10,650
decisions and they're allowed to,
you know,

156
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,390
if not allowed to.

157
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,840
But if they choose to make decisions and
those decisions are horrific and then

158
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,500
they have to somehow or another justify
those decisions cause they never look at

159
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,660
their own behavior.
They always judge other people.

160
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,760
And this is a pattern
that people fall into,

161
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,300
whether it was looking for other
people to always be wrong, right?

162
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,850
And they never grow.
And so like a guy like that,

163
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,340
if he was so psychotic that
he could kill somebody.

164
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:34,110
And then he has this decision to make.

165
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,150
This decision is to kill the wife and
the kids still the keys just like always

166
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,440
gotta be right. You know what I'm
saying? Like he's always, he's got an e,

167
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,020
he's trying to cover his tracks,

168
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:47,460
he's trying to lie always like this
is the type of person that could do

169
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,270
something like that horrific pattern or
thought and it might have been triggered

170
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,390
by the murder itself. So it's just a
chemical flipping his brain that says,

171
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:55,620
now I can kill people.

172
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,860
Like he hasn't done it his whole life
and he's just going into the subway and

173
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:03,861
getting a sandwich with all the stuff on
it and just be like watching the Monday

174
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,180
night football.
And then the next week he's like,

175
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,540
something flips in his brain
is like, no, now I can kill.

176
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,210
I don't think it's a little
painful that I know and love.

177
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,920
I think in a fit of rage, in a fit
of rage, he does something horrific.

178
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,670
And then I think he's one of those
people that tries to justify his actions.

179
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,950
So it just totally tries to figure
out a way where he can justify it,

180
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,350
that they're, they're going to be in hell
anyway cause the guy's dead. You know,

181
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,590
they'd,
they'd probably

182
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,110
deep he could. You think we're crazy
man. They come up with justification.

183
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,460
We came from the side, like
we said before, this is an
Italian dude like us. Right?

184
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,690
But he could've also,
we don't know if he's medicated.

185
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,590
Do we know that it's a
big warning in chemistry.

186
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,080
We don't know what he was doing.
You know what I mean?

187
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,840
He could have been on
something which, uh, you know,

188
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,170
makes people do horrific things. Do
you think, do you believe in Karma?

189
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,760
I think for sure that when
you put energy out there,

190
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,390
it affects things around you in terms
of the way people interact with you.

191
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,500
And that in turn affects the way they
will interact with other people as well.

192
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,320
And I think there's like,
there's, there's a certain amount,

193
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,140
there's an energy you put out,
you could call it that,

194
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:23,880
but that makes it sound like you got a
crystal in your pocket, right? Not really.

195
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,380
Energy is real. It's like energy is
a real thing. There is a real right.

196
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:32,930
If I was, if I was a murderer
and came and sat in here,

197
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,690
there'd be a different vibe than what
you're feeling from me. Yeah, for sure.

198
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,590
You know what I mean? For sure.
Yeah. A chronic masturbator well,

199
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:45,591
it's also people that are off and then
struggling with the fact that they've

200
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:49,080
done something awful. Right.
There's like an energy to that.

201
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,920
It's like a constantly being on
edge energy every and punishment.

202
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,520
That's still CFC. Yeah. I never
read that. Oh, you should read it.

203
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,390
It's so he kills someone
and this is the east caring.

204
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,830
It's the Gill greatest description of
the guilt. Just carrying that thing.

205
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,050
Now that guy's going to admit an energy,

206
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,700
but you don't think there's Karma just
for like you'd do something bad and then

207
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:12,850
so something bad will happen.

208
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,420
I think a genuinely believe,
and this is no crystals in my pocket,

209
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:20,800
I genuinely believed that if you do
something that you know to be awful,

210
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,830
that that has an equal
effect coming back at you.

211
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,370
Like whatever bad that you've put out in
terms of like doing something evil to a

212
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:37,570
person, the way you feel
personally about yourself,

213
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,220
you will take an equal blow.
I really believe that.

214
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,360
And where does that blow come from?

215
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,510
I think comes from your
own introspective thinking.

216
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,500
I think maybe even worse. You know,
you might even feel worse than that.

217
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,040
Like you could say something rude to a
person just because you're tired and then

218
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:58,210
you realize you said something rude,
annoying. All right, why did I do that?

219
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,690
I didn't mean. And then they can be like
Tom, Papa's right now. I'm not really not.

220
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:05,200
I just, I'm so tired, you know, and you
just ask me something stupid. I'm sorry.

221
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,810
But it's like, it's hard to
turn that around, you know?

222
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,310
So you might hate yourself more
than they even get mad at you.

223
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,360
So Karma is really you
dealing with the energy.

224
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,150
It's not the universe saying now
something bad's going to happen to you.

225
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,380
You're kind of creating it with
your own actions and your own stuff.

226
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I think it's real dangerous when we
pretend that we have any sort of real

227
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,140
understanding of the patterns of all
the events that take place in the world.

228
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,060
So when you start to say like someone,

229
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,080
something happened to someone
because of Karma, that's okay.

230
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,930
The problem was saying
that is what about babies?

231
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,340
What about babies with leukemia?
Where they bad babies? What happened?

232
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,590
Why did they get cancer?
Why did they die young?

233
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,940
Why did they die in car accidents? Why
the day? That doesn't make any sense.

234
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,800
They didn't never done anything bad there.

235
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:58,650
But that's where you could say that, uh,
you know, bad shit happens to us all,

236
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,710
but can you create more bad ship?
You find your balance possible

237
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,750
co two.
And it's,

238
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,320
it's also entirely possible that you're
creating more bad shit but feeling bad

239
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,090
about yourself because
you've done bad shit.

240
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,540
So you create more of this negative
energy that you carry around with you.

241
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,280
I think that's entirely possible too.

242
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,900
But I think that we also have this
weird need to define things, you know,

243
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,340
and that I think that we're,

244
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:25,990
we're looking to this thing that we're
calling Karma and we're saying that this

245
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,681
is like this,

246
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:31,180
this definite correlation between action
and reaction and between the good you

247
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,620
put out there and the
good that comes back.

248
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,270
And my take is that I think there's
definitely something going on,

249
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,840
but I don't think we should define it
yet cause I don't think we really know.

250
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:45,090
And I think as soon as we box it up and,
and say it's this thing and this is the,

251
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,640
the absolute reaction that the world
has when you put good out there,

252
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:53,420
good comes back. Good people die all
the time, folks. Good people die.

253
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,940
I think we're, I think that
there's, I think there is
an energy and the, you know,

254
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,430
we know it from the work that we do. I
think it's both. When you stand on stage,

255
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,530
there's an energy in that room,

256
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,590
that transference between you and the
people that are out there and you're

257
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:12,330
playing with it and it's a
real thing. It's a very real
thing. It's like hypnosis,

258
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:16,230
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it
is. And, and then they can,

259
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,260
they can reverse hip hypnotize you.

260
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,910
They can bring this other energy the
other way so that there is this energy of

261
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,950
all of us out there and running around.
It's,

262
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:31,680
it's not that far to think then there
couldn't be good energy and there's bad

263
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:36,300
energy and theirs.
And is that ultimately good and evil?

264
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,550
Maybe it is all generated
from human beings.

265
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:42,150
Maybe if you educated everyone and they
could all be kind and try and come at it

266
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,700
that way, we could actually
feel that there was more good.

267
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:47,720
But that's just more good coming
from people. I don't know. Well,

268
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,380
if you want to get really spacey
with this, Surely Really Spacey,

269
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,370
it's the holidays you go, okay, well what,

270
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,810
what exactly are people doing? That's
what you do. You, what are people doing?

271
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,200
What are they doing? Like what,
what's our purpose to be being here?

272
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,360
Look at us from an outside perspective.
Like pretend you're not a person, right?

273
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,470
You're looking at all the
people like what are they doing?

274
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,240
They're moving really fast.

275
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,090
They're spending most of their time
doing things they don't want to do and

276
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,810
they're buying stuff bustling around.

277
00:16:15,811 --> 00:16:18,140
So because they're throwing
all this money at stuff,

278
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,580
the stuff keeps getting better.

279
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:23,690
So every year this stuff keeps getting
more complex and more capable and more

280
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,860
high tech and more space age. This
is bananas, man. I've got to watch,

281
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,490
I can call it people like fucking
Dick Tracy man, right? Yeah.

282
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,690
And that as people keep going on and on
and on and on with this stuff. This is,

283
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:41,270
we need some sort of energy behind this
innovation and a lot of the energies,

284
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,460
conflict, conflict and resolution,
conflict and resolution,

285
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,140
conflict and victory, victory and defeat.
And if it defeat makes you work harder.

286
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:56,141
And there's all these interacting forces
that are constantly moving together.

287
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,380
I'm with you, ended this,
a lot of it is expressed.

288
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:04,280
The success of this little game has
expressed in material possessions.

289
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,170
The success in this game is expressed in
Hamptons mansions and private jets and

290
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,120
Bentleys and Pam,

291
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:16,121
I'm winning this fucking crazy game off
stuff and there's a lot of value and

292
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:18,020
winning the crazy game.
Who Stopped?

293
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:21,770
So we let these people acquire all this
stuff and you've got all these diamonds

294
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:26,330
and fuck, yeah, this is,

295
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,190
this is forcing more stuff to be
made better and more innovation,

296
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,300
which will eventually,

297
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,150
and this is where it gets space
just of all waiting for this part.

298
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,460
This is going to be what people become.

299
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,430
People are going to become some
sort of symbiotic organism,

300
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:44,630
but something that's tied into electronics
and that this, it's happening now.

301
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,860
It's happening slowly and we're making
it with stuff and as we keep making,

302
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,620
it's eventually gonna get to a part that
was the thing you would like to do more

303
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,270
than anything is having to enhance
your experience on earth. Right.

304
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,520
I want to be able to take pictures. Yes,
yes. I want to be able to email people.

305
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:03,870
Yes, yes. Yeah. But I also want to, I want
it to make my experience on earth better.

306
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,440
Well then we're going to have to
integrate with your circuitry, Tom, papa,

307
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,090
and then live forever. Maybe. Maybe that's
what the organisms are trying to do.

308
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,163
They're trying to

309
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,750
get rid of the monkey that wants to
start the wars all the time. Right.

310
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,300
It's enlightenment. That urge that
none of our goofy ass system evil.

311
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,110
What if only some that would be a great
science fiction movie with this is the

312
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:30,090
future and they probably
were already made it.

313
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,620
But if only some people went on board
with the new enlightenment that you'd get

314
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:37,440
from these like headsets.
Like remember the dude from Star Trek,

315
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,910
the blind guy from sesame street.
Remember he was,

316
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,250
he used to be on sesame street,
right? Yeah. The, he was the uh,

317
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,520
the vibrating Rainbow Lavar yeah. Reading
Lavar Burton. Barbara, yeah. Yeah.

318
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,570
If we all had those things on, there was
only like 10 of them flooded. Know No,

319
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,630
like falling into those people bought
into it and those things completely cure

320
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:02,400
you of a, of any evil.
It just moving along.

321
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,420
I think that, uh, I don't
know. I mean there is,

322
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,770
maybe there is no purpose
to us being here, but it is.

323
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,780
So you got that shit for pep boys,

324
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,500
that's a filter.

325
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,730
That's a really cool air filter at the
top of the muscle car, isn't it? Yeah.
