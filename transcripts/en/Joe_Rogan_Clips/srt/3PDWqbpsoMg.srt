1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,460
That,

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,080
I think that unfortunately extremism
is winning in the country and the vocal

3
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:10,081
minority just has a much larger
megaphone or microphone and the non vocal

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,210
majority.
I think most people do that.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,860
But I don't think the people that do
that waste their time posting about it or

6
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:21,250
taking up the, you know,
just filling the narrative.

7
00:00:21,251 --> 00:00:23,530
So it looks like there's only two
positions. That's a good point.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,820
I would love to see some
return to moderation.

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,810
Just get extremism in any shape.

10
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,490
I feel very uncomfortable with people
who go to any length like that. Well

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,570
I think people are getting more and
more upset at it and I think as people

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,520
recognize that it's more and
more preposterous, they're
getting more and more,

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,730
there's more and more pushback
and resistance. You know,

14
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:49,710
it's really interesting with progressivism
is that people are getting in trouble

15
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,690
now for things that seem like there's,

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,940
there's something like
Martina Navratilova, uh,

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,210
just got a bunch of shit from people
calling her transphobic cause she was

18
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,600
saying that she didn't think that
biological male should be competing with

19
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:08,601
biological females and that there are
people who identify as transgender who

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,160
keep their penis and compete
as a man. And you know, her,

21
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,920
her position was like that or
compete as a woman rather ship.

22
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:21,330
And her position was like that.
Listen, that's not, that's not a woman.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,940
That's a man.
And they have an advantage.

24
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:28,941
And she was citing all these instances
and so she got all this shit from people.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,980
So then she said, I'm going to step
back and I'm going to research this.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,070
So she stepped back and researched
it and then came back and said, no,

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,500
I've looked at all the data and
she probably came back harder.

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,500
She did come back harder and now
they're attacking her and calling her

29
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,480
transphobic.
Like let's say this is not trans phobia.

30
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:46,020
This is a real thing that you're going
to have to address when you're talking

31
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:49,470
about physical activities.
When someone identifies, look,

32
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,620
if you want to identify as a
woman or identify as a male,

33
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,990
I think we should all support people
doing whatever they want to do as long as

34
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,460
it's not hurting anybody.
Totally agree.

35
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:01,461
But when you're talking about competition
and you're talking about someone

36
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:05,220
identify,
I don't care if you identify as a Giraffe,

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,250
if you compete in an apple picking
competition with a Giraffe,

38
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,070
you're going to fucking lose.
You're not a giraffe stupid, right?

39
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,400
I mean this is just, I mean
this is an extreme version
of it, but that's nonsense.

40
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,420
That doesn't make any sense.

41
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,560
If you decide that you're a woman
and you want to enter into a fucking

42
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:23,670
weightlifting competition and you weight
220 pounds and you're beating all the

43
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:27,750
other women by like Oh
fucking insane numbers,

44
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,930
like there was a a few world champion
weightlifting winners that are women that

45
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:39,000
are actually biologically male, so they're
winning weightlifting competitions.

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,110
Just like, what the fuck are you
talking about? Like this is great.

47
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,470
This is not a matter of whether or not
someone should identify with something,

48
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,191
but it's,

49
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:52,191
you're talking about making it
fair for actual biological women.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,970
Like there's a reason why women don't
compete with men is because physically

51
00:02:56,971 --> 00:03:01,230
they're not as strong. So, and obviously
there's some exceptions or some weak men,

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,991
some strong women,

53
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,360
and there's some sort of a spectrum
and you find yourself somewhere on it.

54
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
But if you're allowing biological males
to compete with biological females and

55
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,980
just say, oh, he identifies
as a woman led him in, Yay,

56
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,860
we're all being very progressive. And
then you look at the results and you go,

57
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:21,370
well, he just broke all the world
records first time in the class.

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,310
And everybody's like, yes, amazing.
What a wonderful woman girl power. Like,

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,250
that's not girl power. You're,
you're, you're monkeying
with biology here. This is,

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,030
this is crazy. So what's the route?
What's the road out of that? Like,

61
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,650
what does that give you getting upset?
And it, the time, time, being timed,

62
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,630
you know, of these instances, um,
enough of these things happen.

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Enough discussion where enough of the
actual reality of the facts and the data

64
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,780
are shoved in everyone's face enough that
the new generation comes to some sort

65
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,670
of a rational understanding about what
is and is not fair as opposed to where

66
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,070
people are now, where
they just, no matter what,

67
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,040
they're scared to not push
this progressive agenda.

68
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:08,041
And they're scared of the blow back of
Martina Navratilova who is an LBGT hero,

69
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,810
right? Yes. She's a fucking hero.

70
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,170
She was a lesbian woman who was
a world champion tennis player,

71
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,440
and now they're the left are
attacking her. So they're,

72
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,820
they're eating their own in a spectacular
fashion where you have these trans

73
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,270
people who don't want to look at reality
and then people that support the trans

74
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,360
people because they don't want
to be considered in any way,

75
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,810
shape or form anything other than
the most progressive of progressive.

76
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,760
And it's nonsense.
