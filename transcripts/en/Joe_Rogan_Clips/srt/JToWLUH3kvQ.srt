1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
How many, what percentage of people like
to be peed on? It's got to be below 1%.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,710
That's still a lot.
It's 300 million people.

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:09,480
That means 3 million
people or to get peed on.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,270
That's just in this country alone.
That's a lot of pee clean up.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,820
You know what I mean?
I don't even think it's 1%,

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,700
but even if it's one 10th
of 1% is 300,000 people.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,200
Like I love a chocolate Sundae,
but if you smeared it all over the place,

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,340
then the after the clean up I probably
back. You know, I'm not into that. Yeah.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,100
Think what do you, what do you went
to? It's a freakish thing you're into.

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,450
I'm surprisingly tame.
I'm not in anything freaky.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,090
I've never even done like
whip cream or anything.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,470
Mm Hace what about when a girl
asks you to like choke or a little,

13
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:48,450
how do you feel about that?
Um, that's a scary request.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,860
I'm not into that. I'm not. Um, I had
a girl that I used to date who, uh,

15
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:57,160
wanted me to rape her. She
told me the raper that's, hmm,

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,100
that's tough and problem.

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:04,101
When she was fucking hot and I was like
I do not want to get interested in doing

18
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,970
this. Like the, the, the worst
thing would be you really liked.

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,540
Yeah cause I was in my twenties.
What if,

20
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:14,541
what if I just had it came up then I got
into like only girls that want you to

21
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,210
like force them to do shit.
And that's, that's very true.

22
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,790
When you are young and you're
forming your sexuality,

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,910
whatever you first got your like when
I first dance with a girl and I noticed

24
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,500
her hips were wide.
I,

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,710
I got like a boner and there's like an
eighth grade cause it was like this is,

26
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:36,711
she's different link and four years till
I was like in my early thirties I could

27
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:41,370
not dance with a girl
without getting a hard on.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,350
I was at a wedding once and I asked
this girl to dance, I never do this.

29
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,920
But she was like alone and she was
hot and I got on the dance floor,

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,990
my mother's there and I got like a boner.

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,610
I don't know this girl at all. And
I had to tell her, cause you know,

32
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,970
you know like your wedding
pants are not keeping things no.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,720
And so full pitched and I, she probably
already knew. So I was like, I'm sorry,

34
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,090
can you help me off off the floor?

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,740
And I had to how humiliating it says I'd
asked this girl to like Shimmer me off

36
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,430
the floor away from my
mother. Yeah, she had a good,

37
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:21,860
luckily a good sense of humor about it,
but it was luck ameliorating. Well she,

38
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,220
well I shouldn't say she
should be flattered but a
grownup, but sense of humor,

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,640
if you flattered. She invited to
her Halloween party after that,

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,260
which is a good sign. But that went bad.
I, I got all dressed up as the universe.

41
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,660
Like I, I, yeah,

42
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:41,220
I had like a whole black outfit and I
glued like planets to my body with velcro

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,870
and then grown man.
And then I go to her house on time,

44
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:48,360
which I didn't realize that you
don't go to parties on time.

45
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,350
I just gotten to La and then
I went and I went to hug her.

46
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:56,340
I knocked over the skeleton on the wall
and there were a dog ran up and like bit

47
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:01,270
Venus off my leg and took off and I'm
just in the room and no one's dressed up.

48
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,300
People are coming and they're like,
have a bad day. It's like I'm a pirate,

49
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,610
but no one's really dressed
up except for a meal.

50
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,900
So I was a pariah and then no one taught
me, say put the at the end, this guy,

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,560
because all our friends were like, frat
guys. He goes, can I ask you a question?

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,280
And I was like, yeah, like I want someone
to talk to me. He goes, you a faggot? No,

53
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,540
yeah, no. It was like
really? Yeah. Was like,

54
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,950
now I'm in is all started with me getting
a boner with this girl. But anyway,

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,360
I gotta go and Jesus Christ what a Dick.
Yeah,

56
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,150
it was kind of a dick. Was
he a dick before that? Yeah,

57
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,570
they were all kind of like a
jockey jockey and they were drunk.

58
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,360
And I think I seem like a target
cause I had the universe, uh,

59
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:44,380
on my body seemed like an
easy target. Yeah. But that's,

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,170
that's a severe weakness.

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,840
Unless you were doing something. I mean,
why wouldn't they think that was funny?

62
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,760
Like what are you doing man?
What's with the outfit?

63
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,160
And then he started talking and you start
laughing. Everybody has a gate. Yeah,

64
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,250
we would have had a good time.
Yeah, you went right. Yeah.

65
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,880
Yeah. You know that's funny
though. The boner thing. Yeah.

66
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,330
Cause there was a girl that I dated
when I was in high school and she,

67
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,130
she was into like rubbing her feet on me
and I had a foot thing for a long time

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,930
because of it. What, where was she
rubbing her feet idea? I mean that

69
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,980
I meant like where are you at your house,
school or whatever.

70
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:30,860
She would just rubber feet on my legs
and put her feet on my girlfriend. Yeah.

71
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,170
Yeah. I used to go to this
math class, 10 30 ugly teacher,

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,880
but her smell boner every time.
And I knew, I was like, ah,

73
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,250
I gotta go get a boner in this class.

74
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,100
That's hilarious.

75
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,130
But that is a real thing
about like getting connected
to like a particular like

76
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:54,940
thing, like whether it's choking
someone or any of that guy. That girl,

77
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:55,840
the girl wanted me to rape her.

78
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:59,870
Also would grab my hand
and put it on the back row,

79
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,820
like get me to force her head down.
She was crazy.

80
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,380
She was just really into it,
but it took a while for her to warm up.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,260
It's almost like when we first started
fooling around, she's like, come on,

82
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:15,850
don't tell him this mother
fucker what I like normal.

83
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:19,330
And then one day she wanted
to Russell. Okay. Yeah.

84
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:21,640
She's like warm rustic
gateway draws like what?

85
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,520
She's like when a Russell you I've
put on kick your ass. I was like,

86
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,410
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like what are you doing?

87
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,500
You just beat her up. You
lost. I didn't, I didn't,

88
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
I didn't beat her up,

89
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,710
but I was trying to figure out what
we're doing while we're doing it and she

90
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,710
turned it sexual. She got into it. Yeah.
I think like, like Louis C K I like,

91
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:45,240
I remember he's show like one of the
first episodes he had a show rogue,

92
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,570
an older girl asked him to jerk off in
front of her. And I was always like,

93
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:52,450
I bet that actually happened.
And that got linked up.

94
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,090
You can't really decide what
links up your sexuality,

95
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,760
what it is a turns on.
It just could have,

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,280
I have no information. But that's my
guess. If people are into weird shit man,

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,950
what are in the weird shit I
ended the weirdest is this,

98
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,920
is this smelling the shoes.
Oh

99
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,910
Marla maples trumps x.

100
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,530
Put a camera in her bedroom because she
kept in her closet cause she kept losing.

101
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:20,480
She did have one shoe and it
was some friend would come in,

102
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,800
they got the economy just like just
coming in and stealing sniffing or she's

103
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,510
Christ has zakat linked
up. Ah. Anyway. Yeah,

104
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,230
there's a lot of that stuff, right?
Like stealing underwear, stealing shoes.

105
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,840
Yeah. Men are, the thing is, I
mean men get picked on cause we're,

106
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:39,860
we're pervs and that's,
it's true.

107
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,950
But if we weren't pervs this species
wouldn't be, or let me tell you why.

108
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,020
Because we were down
to like 70,000 people.

109
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,800
If we didn't have this super
per game to go through the snow,

110
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,400
get some pussy I think is
less than 70,000 people.

111
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,210
They were saying that after one of the
super volcanoes it might've gotten down

112
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:58,880
to is it's just a few thousand ma.
Well,

113
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,940
there's a definite, what does it Sumatra?
Is that where it was? Indonesia? Some,

114
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,360
some massive supervolcano
70,000 years ago.

115
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,570
Killed off almost everybody.
Oh, I didn't know about that.

116
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,470
We got down to extremely low number.

117
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,830
I think they estimate it's somewhere
between like two and maybe like 10,000

118
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,490
people. Yeah. You need people who liked
off bug a lot that are real curvy, curvy,

119
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,640
jump that up. Well, you know,
Bret Weinstein, who is a, yeah,

120
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,100
he was a professor. Sorry. What's going
on man? I smoked weed before the show.

121
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,250
I'm not going to lie
to people. Um, he, um,

122
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,970
was explaining with his
wife who's also a biologist,

123
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,690
that there's two different
things that men are attracted to.

124
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,200
They're attracted to a beautiful woman,
but they're attracted to a hot woman.

125
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,230
Like a hot woman doesn't
necessarily have to be beautiful,

126
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,030
but what she does is offer an
opportunity for like very quick sex.

127
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,260
Like you could just have sex with her.

128
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,550
You don't have to court her like a girl
with a short skirt and her tits are

129
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:09,530
popping out and she's wearing a lot of
makeup that what that signals is that

130
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:13,580
there's an opportunity for you to
spread your genes and you have no

131
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,310
responsibility. You wouldn't have to
take care of it. You wouldn't have to,

132
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,120
you wouldn't have to spend a lot of
time with her court her that she was,

133
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,580
she's the type of person that
allows you to just fuck her.

134
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,430
You can move on and spread your genes
elsewhere. That makes sense. Yeah,

135
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:30,431
that there's a like an evolutionary
reason for that being a stimulating thing

136
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,970
for men.
Like for men,

137
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:36,440
like this idea of like these loose women
like loose women are very attracted,

138
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,850
very attractive to us for that reason.
It's not just that like, oh yeah,

139
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,880
if I get some not deal with
all these bitches in there. No.

140
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:48,881
It's literally an evolutionary trait that
we have adapted to the disease thing.

141
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:52,580
Knocks it back a little bit for me.
I'll go like,

142
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,770
oh my big disease there is,
I have anecdote,

143
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,920
anecdote and antidote for cause I don't
feel like there's any woman who could,

144
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,490
no matter how hot like come and and and,
and uh,

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
take me away or like a force me to like,
what am I trying to say?

146
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,540
Seduced me. Why you're here. It is,

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,140
I think a woman could seduce you now if
I don't want her to. I have an anecdote,

148
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,110
anecdote
I haven't handed out and it's,

149
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,990
I've been developing it over
years and people can uh,

150
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,950
listening can take this if you like,

151
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,620
let's say you fell for
somebody and she didn't like,

152
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:32,940
and she jumped you and you're still
pining over her. Put her first.

153
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,960
You'd like think about like the blood
moving through her body and her and her

154
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:40,780
skeleton and you put her on the toilet.
You think about like she's making by,

155
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,120
I know it's gross,
but that's,

156
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,800
you think about her as this animal and
you think about her on the toilet and you,

157
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,340
whenever she pops up, you put her
on the toilet. You're welcome.

158
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,900
That doesn't work with me. It
will. I won't care. No, no, no.

159
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,660
If I think she's hot,
but she's really struggling on the toilet,

160
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,840
I struggle on the toilet
so you can bond over that.

161
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,640
I take, I eat a lot, man.
I'd take some horrific shits.

162
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,720
But think about like the Bachelorette
or something. They're there.

163
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,570
Fantasize a lot of times early
on there's like this fantasy and,

164
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,290
and uh, you know your, your
marriage. Yes. So you're, you have,

165
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,320
there's intimacy and
you get past all that,

166
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,340
but that early on fantasy make filling
in the blanks as perfect person.

167
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:27,020
You usually leave that out.
It never bothered me. I don't,

168
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,500
I don't give a fuck about periods. What
about, I'm thinking about their skeleton,

169
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,850
anything? Does that kind
of go oh yeah, yeah.

170
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,380
If you just imagine there's a skeleton
underneath this woman that I'm like

171
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:42,260
pining over. She's just like, all right,

172
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,230
this doesn't work. It doesn't work on
me. It works for me to tell you, man,

173
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,870
if I think someone's hot,
I think they're hot.

174
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:51,510
I don't care if they just took
a diary of Shit. How about this?

175
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,360
I imagine they have bad
breath. I'll be like, God,

176
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,170
but she has bad breath and I'd tell her.
