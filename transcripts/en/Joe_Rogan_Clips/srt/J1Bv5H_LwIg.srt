1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,680
Plus this China make it to the moon.

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:03,620
They grew cotton on the moon
apparently already. Right.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,570
They grew something in the moon
but it died. Yeah, it died quickly.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,400
I was happy that it was that
cotton because seeing as
how they're their biggest

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:15,000
investor in Africa and China was growing
cotton that didn't go well for black

6
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,220
people 500 years ago.
So I was just like,

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,150
please don't let cotton grown in the moon.
I don't know what the trends move.

8
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:24,120
Atlantic slave trade, the start and
I have to learn mandarin and shit.

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,420
So you do you think they actually set
up shot before us or as American steel

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,380
number one because they feels like, I
feel like we lost that day. We went,

11
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:38,190
China landed on the moon. Yeah. I feel
like I feel like, oh shit. You know,

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,880
you know I've grown up being, you know
like I'm black, I'm American, but I like,

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,120
I come here, a lot of people I'm saying
I live from here. I like America. Yeah,

14
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:47,760
exactly. I feel like we are
bad. Like Frederick Douglass.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,870
When asked would he leave? Was
I, and I answered, you know,

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,390
like what the fuck am I going to leave
for when I see something like the moon

17
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,690
landing the China, the growing the plants
and landing there, there what, what,

18
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,500
what exactly was it? Was it, uh, what,

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,510
what was the kind of ship
that they landed on the moon?

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm going to put one on the morning.

21
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:09,000
Apparently some type of role on the dark
side though right on the side that we

22
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,430
didn't make it to her or just went
and told him he got a video of,

23
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:15,360
it was a drone, right? He said what? It
was some sort of a drone. I think of that.

24
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:19,140
I honestly think about that as a
win for science and for innovation.

25
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,800
I don't think about it in terms of like
nations cause I feel like that is done

26
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:24,890
by scientists.
That's done by the wizards and the,

27
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,290
so are you saying we're going to steal
the scientists because when Kennedy gave

28
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,124
the fucking speech,

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,300
Kennedy made it seem like the moon landing
was going to make us the preeminent

30
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,380
nation. And I think that's the
propaganda China's going to run it.

31
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:37,470
You don't think,
well,

32
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:41,340
I think they have some fucking amazing
technology and to deny that would be

33
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:44,370
ridiculous. But I also think that
it's important that everybody,

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,940
everybody be competitive in this.
Like if they,

35
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,130
if you really want to make things better,
you're not gonna,

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,590
you're not going to do that in a vacuum.
Gotcha.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,800
What helps the technological innovation
and one of the reasons why it's so

38
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,630
accelerated is there's so
many people working on it.

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,300
It's not just a few people trying
to make cell phones better.

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,440
I got fucking so many geniuses out there,
so when I see something like this,

41
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,290
like they landed on the moon, I go, did
geniuses one you just gave me hope. Yeah.

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,670
Yeah. They're Chinese people, but they're
just people. We're all just people.

43
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,540
Absolutely.
You know,

44
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,530
and the idea that they're going to all
get those people on that side to think

45
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:18,660
the same way is what we're
worried about. Right. That we're,

46
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:22,890
it'd be US versus them and
their technology is going
to impact our lives the way

47
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:25,560
we frame it as the country.
Yeah. We always worry about that,

48
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,990
but you have to admit that that's what,
that's the way we frame it.

49
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,000
But if you look at the history
of the world that's been,

50
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,410
that happens so many times.

51
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:35,280
I think it makes sense to be worried
about the rest of the world. I get it,

52
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,240
I'm on it and I'm on this side of
the fence, so no problem with that.

53
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:42,870
But you know,
you know I'm an American,

54
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,670
so you definitely want to know if it's,

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,970
if red October is going to
happen tomorrow, fuck man,

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
I think Russians don't hate us.

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,290
I don't think anybody has a
quarrel with anybody over there.

58
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,310
It's the the government's.

59
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:57,810
It's what's the hustle is that the real
interaction is between a very small

60
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,100
amount of people that involves all,
these are the people that are with them.

61
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,360
For some strange reason,

62
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,450
I think they should just be thrown
essentially in a stadium to fight to their

63
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,310
death would be the king of
the word. Fuck everybody up.

64
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,570
And that other dude that runs the other
little country next door that was on

65
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:16,690
real sports. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That guy is a huge supporter of MMA.

66
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,140
Fucking bad ass.
There's some bees over there.

67
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,790
You know bad Putin would fuck up Trump.
Oh Christ.

68
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,510
You can't fight to the death with Putin.

69
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,910
I where I would actually probably bit
poon versus Obama too. Yeah, for sure.

70
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,360
Look, Obama is probably better than it.
Debate. Yeah. Pools a real, exactly.

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,840
That's what I'm saying.
It's a real cat.

72
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,630
You'd have to go all the way.

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,050
Bush one I think was bad ass. Maybe as a
younger man, I need you to leave the CIA.

74
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:52,900
You gotta have some killer in.
Yes. You know, he was a tough guy,

75
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,600
but I probably have to get all the way
back to Kennedy in terms of physical

76
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:59,290
prowess, and his back was bad. I think
you've got to go to Abraham Lincoln.

77
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,600
Lincoln. Yeah, he was wiring. He wasn't
that farmer bill farmer strength. He did.
