1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,570
I don't think that there's much truth
in today's progressive left. No,

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:10,230
I think there's an ideological war going
on and I think especially with Trump in

4
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:10,561
office,

5
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:14,370
they feel like the gloves are off and
all rules are out the window and anything

6
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:15,121
goes.
Yeah,

7
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:19,040
I think people are flabbergasted and while
I was telling Jamie at for the shower,

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,100
like I'm not,
I'm not without my criticisms for Trump,

9
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:27,960
but I got it meant every time stuff just
rolls off his back like water on a duck.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,020
I started fucking laughing like they
were like the stormy Daniels things going

11
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:31,890
to sink them.
I have,

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
I have a friend of mine who's who's gay
and he's the nicest guy in the world,

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,810
but he's so ridiculous. He's like, that's
our Monica Lewinsky. She's our Monica.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,500
I go, dude, it's not going to work. I go,
no one's going to care. It's going to,

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,560
it's going to disappear in a couple of
weeks ago. We're in a 10 hour new cycle.

16
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,420
Do you understand this?
I go in 10 hours,

17
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:51,570
some new shit comes along and nobody gives
a fuck about Brett Ratner anymore and

18
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:53,040
nobody gives a fuck about this guy.
Nobody.

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,890
And there's a new guy and there's a new
thing and there's a new problem and it's

20
00:00:55,891 --> 00:01:00,060
a new thing. There's a new thing and
you saying that this porn star thing,

21
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,140
this is not 1994 this porn star
thing is not going to sink him.

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,670
He's going to deny it.
Fake News,

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,600
fake news and he's going to keep moving
and there's going to be nothing. Yeah,

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,540
I don't even, I don't even know
what happened with that exactly,

25
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,250
but to me I was remember I just was like,

26
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:16,560
I got to disconnect for a bit because
I've been just going, going, going.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,580
So I disconnected and I'm like kind of
popped my head in for half a day just

28
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,510
because we're moving to a new studio,

29
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,360
kind of like you've been doing and pop my
head. It was like, well, what's in there?

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,560
What's this outrage right now?
Do I need to know about Donald Trump?

31
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,670
And they said no.
Yeah,

32
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:30,300
he called a Haiti a shit hole and I
just popped my head back on. I'm like,

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,530
of course it is. That's it. No one
cares. He was like, of course Haiti is.

34
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,220
It doesn't mean you hate Haitians.
Said,

35
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:38,160
why did these people from these
shithole countries want to come here?

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,440
That's what he supposedly said. He says
he didn't say it. Some people say he did.

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,660
Other people say he didn't. Who Cares?
So we're in a weird quagmire. Yeah.

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,990
If he says that he did.
Yeah.

39
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,550
It's not the appropriate thing for a
president of the United States to say.

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,250
But does it make sense that
Donald Trump would say that? Yes.

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,240
You want to know all,

42
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:02,430
you know it's a shit hole because French
Canadians are some of the most racist

43
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:05,250
people you will find. Love you mom.
But they create these French laws.

44
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,470
I've talked about this before.
Pure Glen,

45
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,970
it means pure wool because they want to
get rid of all the England phones. Right?

46
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,400
And so then they had a huge Haitian
immigration because there's a lot of,

47
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:11,551
you know,

48
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,520
French and people from Cameroon I special
diseases and breeding and they were

49
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:17,660
furious. So they tried to create laws to
keep the Haitians out because they were,

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,730
you know, they, it was just a clash
of cultures. Here's the thing,

51
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,830
Haiti is whether Donald Trump said it
or not, as a country, a shitty place,

52
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,860
and I don't think anyone cares anymore,
doesn't mean I hate Haitians,

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,450
doesn't mean I'm not empathetic to them.

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,390
But how fortunate that
they're in a bad place.

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,840
But how was it racist if especially
you're criticizing a government which

56
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,540
comprises of black people who
are screwing a black citizenry.

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,530
They've been doing it for decades.
They've never gotten it right.

58
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,100
Rainn Wilson took a picture from sandals,

59
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,000
like a pickle picture
from Club Med sandals.

60
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,150
Most people don't even know what that
is. The resort. That's so funny. Yeah,

61
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,250
I think it is. It's a Bahamas, I
think Jamaica, a few of those things.

62
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,970
This is one of those places.
No local,

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,850
no locale and come all the
other shit holes. I mean,

64
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,220
I just think it's one of those
things where I think if nothing else,

65
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,510
Donald Trump has allowed people
and we weren't Trump people.

66
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,820
We've got so much flak from the alt right
because we didn't support them. Right.

67
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,760
I remember that. And you were more
in support of Ted Cruz, right? Oh,

68
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,940
I'll let Carly Fiorina and Ben Shapiro.

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,680
I mean Ben Carson a little bit. Right.
I just thought it was hysterical. Oh,

70
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:25,150
he's smart guy. He's like, it's so
crazy. Yeah, he's like a Jim Henson care.

71
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,780
My favorite thing was him with Jesus,
the painting, but Jesus on his shoulder,

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,420
my woe,
Ben.

73
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,450
So you can get a neuro surgeon because
you were an absolute genius in that,

74
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,320
but you don't have the sense of like,

75
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,710
maybe I in put Jesus on
myself like I'm a car.

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,620
Well Jordan Peterson said
something that's very brilliant.

77
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,240
He said there is absolutely no correlation
with being smart and being wise.

78
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,890
It's true.
It's true.

79
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,710
There's a lot of people that
are really fucking smart things,

80
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,180
but they are not wise in terms of how
they behave and how they think and how

81
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,020
they conduct their life.

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,080
Okay.
