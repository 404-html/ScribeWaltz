1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,490
You know, so I'm going to,
I, I work in a lot of fields,

2
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,980
but I would also consider
myself an astrobiologist. Right?

3
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,670
Which is a pretty kind of wild idea that
you can do astrobiology even though you

4
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:10,140
only have one example,
which is the earth.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,690
But we've learned so much and now we
can start asking ourselves about the

6
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:17,400
possibility of life elsewhere. So finding
even a microbe like even of Friggin,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,370
you know, Amoeba on Mars would be, or
even evidence that there used to be me,

8
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,850
but it's hard is the evidence
that they've discovered on Mars.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,820
What they found was, um,
organic chemistry, right?

10
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,410
And so our but organic chemistry and I
hated chemistry when I was growing up. Uh,

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,890
and I hated our getting again,

12
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,490
was that just basically chemistry
involved in carbon, you know,

13
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,200
so you can have non,
or you know,

14
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,600
he does organic chemistry
doesn't mean organisms,

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,570
but it's the kind of chemistry
that organisms live. Right?

16
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:46,130
So finding evidence that there was
like they drilled and they said like,

17
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:50,130
we send a freaking robot to Mars, they
could drill through a rock, you know,

18
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,300
and then in just the rocket and then
send the data back, cross space,

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,470
you know, pretty good for a bunch
of hairless apes. Yeah. Um, so what,

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,120
what they found was evidence
for fairly complex, um, uh,

21
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:07,800
you know, uh, organic chemistry, which
meant that way back when Mars and this,

22
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,990
we know for sure, right? Mars had water
on it. We know that for sure. Now Morris,

23
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,930
it was a blue planet for at least Mars
was hit by an asteroid or a common or

24
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,420
something along those lines. Everything
got hit by comments. That's how we have,

25
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:20,430
you know, we have chunks of Mars
here, right? That, you know,

26
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:22,410
the thing in [inaudible] 96 or
whatever, when they were like, oh,

27
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,790
we found life on Mars.
You know,

28
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:28,080
they thought that what they found was a
fossil bacteria in a chunk of our Mars

29
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,220
that they found in an article.

30
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,790
So the planets had been swapping spit
for like the entire history of the solar

31
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,710
systems, fossilized bacteria that they
found is that been confirmed? No, of it.

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,590
Most people now think that the Allen
Hills, uh, media, right. That probably,

33
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,470
you know, it's inconclusive and it's
not conclusive enough to be like, yeah,

34
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,680
we found life. It's like a
tiny little squiggly worm
look. And that's what it was.

35
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:46,861
Yeah.

36
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,830
But it was so small that it was like
way smaller than any of the microscopic

37
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:54,330
fossilized bacteria we've
ever seen before. So people
in general are like me. Um,

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,200
but by fine, but that's what started,
right. That's when Clinton was like, okay,

39
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,870
we're going to send a lot
of shit tomorrow. Cause
after, you know, back in 90,

40
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,210
you're early nineties,
people were kind of done with Mars.

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,720
And so that's what triggered the whole,
you know, one space probe after another,

42
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,580
the rovers and like,
so you know,

43
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,190
the thing we found was a
direct result of that effort,

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,690
which was this organic chemistry,

45
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:17,520
which says that back in the day Mars had
had a lot of this stuff lying around,

46
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:18,720
had a lot of these, you know, these,

47
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,600
these organic chemicals line
around which if your life,

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,450
that's what you're going to be using.
So that's like one more step.

49
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:29,430
Like we've been putting up the Lego blocks
for the argument for life on Mars one

50
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:33,330
piece at a time since the, you know,
since the first rovers went there. Yeah.

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,680
If we did discover just even
plants on some other planet,

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,130
even just a planet with some
sort of plant like life. Yeah,

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,310
that would be, that'd be a
game changer. Game Changer.

54
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,610
Because we don't know if
there's, we've, you know,

55
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,420
are we the only time in the entire history
of the universe that like this crazy

56
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,210
thing where got,
we went from non life to life.

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,510
Like is that common or is that never ever,
ever happen.

58
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,220
So that's the question we want to, you
know, we want to answer and I, you know,

59
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:00,761
I mean like,
you know,

60
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:03,820
that argument I was given before is
I think from the probable arguments,

61
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,070
I'm saying it's like, you know, it's,

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,010
it's almost overwhelming that you had
probably happened somewhere. Again,

63
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,510
it doesn't mean anything is here,
but we need evidence. Right. Science.

64
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:15,350
So we got to build that evidence.
Yeah. And if we do find something, the,

65
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:15,541
the,

66
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,240
the one of the weirder things would be
if we found something and there was a way

67
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,410
to get there. Yeah. You know, we, we
find something and we're like, yeah,

68
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,610
we find something,
but it's,

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,570
we're pretty sure there's some kind of
life and it's 3 billion light years away.

70
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,880
Like wow, that's cool.
Yeah. What do we do? Yeah.

71
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,310
It's nice to know that
we're not the only ones.

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,340
It's interesting like how much
would that change, you know,

73
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,250
even if we found like evidence for this,
cause this is a debate.

74
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:42,880
Like if we found evidence of
a technological civilization
we saw like alien mega

75
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,790
structures, like that star
they felt was that nonsense.

76
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,260
And it wasn't really nonsense. It
was something floating around. Right?

77
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,460
So here's what they
saw. So that, you know,

78
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,180
the way we discover planets is we look
for when the planet passes in front of

79
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,220
the star, you get a little
dip in the light, right?

80
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,370
It blocks out a little bit of light, took
a little eclipse. Um, and so, you know,

81
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:03,310
we've now, that's how we should know
that every star in the sky has planets,

82
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,160
but there's like,
they found one that just make no sense.

83
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,690
Like the light would dip
then what stopped it?

84
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,610
And then it would dip again three
times and it would stopped dipping.

85
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:13,570
Sometimes it was lower, sometimes it was
higher. Um, and you know, for a year.

86
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:17,660
So people were like, fuck
it. You know? And so, uh,

87
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,990
Jason Wright and others, a,
Jason's a friend of mine, you know,

88
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,360
they wrote a paper where they
were like, hey, you know,

89
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,720
at least cause this is what the future's
gonna look like. We can't say, we can't,

90
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,560
we have to at least consider the
possibility that these are artificial

91
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,200
structures that are like
orbiting the star, you know?

92
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:36,580
And would have to be ungodly, huge,
ungodly, huge alien mega structures.

93
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,670
Like that's the best word ever. Like the
size of a country, right? Yeah. Yeah.

94
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:42,100
These things would be huge. Right?
But that's what people think. Like,

95
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:44,490
you know when people think about
advanced alien civilizations,

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
the idea of building large
scale structures is you
think that maybe the next

97
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,810
thing you do once you reach
a certain point, like, um,
you know, the Dyson sphere,

98
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,100
the idea that you could collect all of
the sun's energy and use it for yourself

99
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,670
by building a giant sphere around the
sun with solar panels on the inside.

100
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,830
People think like that
goes back to car to chefs.

101
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,800
They idea of this Carter chef scale
back in the 60s where he's like, look,

102
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,950
there's going to be a natural progression
of civilizations that goes first.

103
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:12,100
You collect all the energy you can from
your planet and then you use that to do

104
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,934
amazing things.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,520
And then you collect all the energy
from your star and then you do that.

106
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,120
You know, you do amazing shit with that.
And then you know, the whole galaxy.

107
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:22,480
So he know Carter Chef thought there
was a scale that that civilizations

108
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:25,960
naturally progress through and hopefully
don't blow yourself up along the way.

109
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,130
Well, I think that's the question.
I mean, I've criticized the,

110
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,360
the chef scale in one of the papers I
recently did because what it fails to take

111
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,830
into account is the fact that like,
you know,

112
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,700
on your way up to the type one type one
is when you harvest all the energy from

113
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:40,980
your planet, which basically means
somehow covering your planet in, uh,

114
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,650
solar panels or something that neglects
what we've learned since Carter Chef

115
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,230
wrote his paper in 64, he said, you
know, planets don't like that shit.

116
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,040
Like planets, the plants going to feed
back. You try and build, you know,

117
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,820
massive shit on your planet. The
planet has its own, you know,

118
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,690
biospheres pretty powerful and you've
got to take the biosphere and account or

119
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:56,441
you get climate change.

120
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,750
You get had the planet being pushed off
in another direction. So, but whatever.

121
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,870
So for the, um, for the alien mega
structures, people thought like, oh,

122
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:06,200
maybe this is like a piece of an, uh,
of a Dyson sphere. Right? This is like,

123
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,280
you know, that's so, you
know, when he proposed this,
people went bonkers over this.

124
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,570
Right. You were just
saying, he's like, look,

125
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,210
here's the 15 different things could
be and I'm going to have to at least

126
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:18,440
consider the possibility that
it's artificial. Um, but for me,

127
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,820
and some people got really
angry at everything,

128
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,330
but I felt like this is what they get
angry because there's been a thing in the

129
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:27,050
community over the years, you know,
said he got a bad name, right.

130
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,900
Setting for a bunch of [inaudible]. He
was sort of thought as being like, oh,

131
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,480
only whackadoodles do that and why?
Why is that?

132
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:36,770
Just because there was no results. Ah, I
just think, you know, there was, you know,

133
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,130
it is, it's because of Shitty
TV, you know? I mean, I
really, in some ways, right?

134
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,710
It's all, you know, it's prosthetic
foreheads, right? It's the whole,

135
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:47,160
we've had so much kind of crappy,
you know, speculation about aliens.

136
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:49,160
They're trying to do anything scientific.

137
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,070
Always had this whiff of sort
of being a little, you know,

138
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,330
and then there's the Ufo stuff,

139
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,860
which is completely separate as
nothing to do with it. Let's see.

140
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,060
Seti never really achieved any results,
right?

141
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:03,710
There was that one big blip that
was highly popularized. Wow. Signal.

142
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,070
But here's the thing about setting,
we never really did set he that much.

143
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,690
You know what I mean? Like
people have this idea like, wow,

144
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,290
we've got telescopes all over the
world and they're looking at, you know,

145
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,920
the government never funded a study study.
I bet. Anything Major, right? So people,

146
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,250
you know, the, all that said he has
done is like basically, you know,

147
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,820
some dudes on a telescope get a little
extra time like, hey man, I'll quick,

148
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,510
let's go look at a star. Right? You know,
Jill Tarter, who's one of the founders,

149
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,480
one of the greats of Seti, she
compares it. It's like, you know,

150
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,670
we've got an ocean that we
need to look at and we've,

151
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,610
so far we've looked at a thimble,
right? But she, the Jodie foster care,

152
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,890
the Jody foster character, yet we're in
contact. Yeah. Yeah. So she's laying on,

153
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,650
it's a good point. Like we haven't really
looked yet. So the idea that, you know,

154
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,530
the stars are silent or anything,
it's like, man, come on.

155
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,290
We haven't even begun to
do a comprehensive service.
