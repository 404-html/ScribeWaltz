1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,870
And, and it's so much fun
to do. I love playing the,

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:08,690
the straight guy cohost to his
fucking insane character. But uh,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,490
yeah,
we've done these live shows and they're,

4
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:14,360
they're really a lot of fun and
he's just a, he's a great guy.

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,680
Fucking,
oh my God,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,150
it's so ridiculous.
He's got to stay and look at those pants.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,520
That is hilarious.
Did the places like packed and it's crazy.

8
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:33,420
You guys reading? What are the notes?
Oh, he, he wanted us to, he wrote,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,240
he wrote like a,
almost a play,

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,860
but it's all just kissing chips ass and
how wonderful chip is and how thankful

11
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,190
we are going to be there.
Like it's so God damn funny.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,970
I love it. He's a, he's brilliant man.

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,410
He's just a great guy and very
fucking funny. I knew from the first,

14
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,450
I think that also a kind of,
I'm not blaming Jimmy or anything,

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,610
but I think that helped to kind of
break up the o and a show in time.

16
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,840
I think opie started resenting the
little bit of that comradery that me and

17
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,600
Jimmy were having.
Um,

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,200
me and Jimmy kind of slowly
started pulling away and
doing our own thing like it

19
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,720
was, and the humor is, you know,

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,420
the more twisted the better. I
love sick humor. He does too.

21
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:23,320
And we laugh.
We did a whole bit on,

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,900
on like Lacy Peterson and Scott
Peterson the murder. Yeah.

23
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,734
And you would think like,

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,740
obviously he murdered his pregnant
wife and dumped her in the ocean.

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,840
What could possibly be funny about
that? Well, people wrote tribute songs,

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,380
uh, with this guy wrote a tribute song
to her and it another one of these self

27
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:44,240
centered assholes that thought he was
going to go viral by making a attribute.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,880
And we started changing the words to the
song to make it just horrible involving

29
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:54,540
seaweed and things. So it was terrible.
But me and Jim are literally crying,

30
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:59,340
laughing and all of these just kind of
sitting there like not really able to

31
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:04,200
jump in or not kind of getting why
we're laughing at this sick shit. Uh,

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,130
so it kind of pushed us further
apart, um, at that point. Yeah.

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,930
We,

34
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,930
we both as people changed over the course
of the 20 years we worked together 20

35
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:19,080
fucking years with any
body. Dude is, is nuts.

36
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,310
You get a girl at Suck Your Dick Every
day for 20 years, you're going to be like,

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,120
Oh fuck,
stop sucking my Dick.

38
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,180
But now it's think it's open
across from me, you know? Yeah. Uh,

39
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,750
so you're going to get
on each other's nerves.

40
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,660
And I'm not innocent in the
whole thing either, but I was,

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,050
I'm a lot more laid back.
Like I,

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,090
I knew what real work was.
I worked for fucking living.

43
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,530
I did heating and air
conditioning installation and
it was freezing cold in the

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,710
winter and boiling hot in the summer.

45
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:51,300
And when I got that first gig
and radio because of Opie,

46
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,440
and I'll always thank him for that.
Uh,

47
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,850
I knew what it was like to work
and I didn't want to fuck that up.

48
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,150
So I plastered a smile on my face at
every turn and did the show four hours a

49
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,610
day. Everyone has someone at work
that they don't get along with.

50
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,630
You don't leave the whole fucking,
you know, you just deal with it.

51
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,830
And that's eight hours.

52
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,790
I had another 20 hours of the day that
didn't involve Greg [inaudible] Hughes so

53
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,230
I could deal with it.
Uh, he was more like,

54
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,120
he had an express himself a little more,
which I guess is healthy in a way, but,

55
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:30,010
uh, I didn't need to, so I didn't, I
didn't text him. I didn't call him.

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,700
I, uh, we got in an argument
once and he goes, dude,

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,180
you never even been to my
house. And I go, alright,

58
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,140
get everyone from the show in here. Jim,
have I ever been to the house? Nope.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,090
Travis? No. Sam, no. Iraq. No,
I've never been to anyone's house.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,090
Let me tell you something right now.
Yeah, that's somewhat, chick would say,

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,360
I know that when my house toad,
it's exactly that.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,290
Been to my house type of relationship.
Does that mean we didn't see even moon?

63
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,160
I never been Africa. What the fuck are
you saying? I'd never been to Spain.

64
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,760
What does that have to do
with anything that we've,

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,780
if you had a problem with
me not coming to your house,

66
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,960
why didn't you ask me to come to your
house? Yeah. Like is there like a,

67
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,050
you asking me every day and I'm saying no.
Everyone. I was saying no. Right, right.

68
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,470
What's going on it, it was always
something like that. And believe me,

69
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm not going to sit here and shit on
the guy. I that my shows for that, uh,

70
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm not gonna fucking around. Uh,
I'm not going to sit on the guy.

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,570
But there were definitely personality
quirks and that, I guess we both had,

72
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,970
but there was something like if,
if I,

73
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,930
I would party all the time and,
and you know,

74
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:36,400
I had to be there at 6:00 AM
and I'm driving from Roslyn
Long Island to New York

75
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:41,290
City. It's, it's 25 30 miles of
just fucked traffic every day.

76
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,300
He has to get there.
It could be 35 minutes.

77
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,010
It could be an hour and a half based on
if someone's pulled over on the side of

78
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:55,540
the road, some asshole crashes in
Queens, whatever it was. It was, uh,

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,360
it was a shit drive every day
and you had to be there at six,

80
00:04:58,361 --> 00:04:59,950
right at six o'clock the show started.

81
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,180
And so even at sixth it'd be that
kind of traffic. Yeah. Yeah. There's,

82
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,860
it wasn't as bad as it got it, like seven
or eight, but you never really knew.

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,590
It could, it could. I was never late late,

84
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,800
but there were times I'd come in at five,
after eight,

85
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,100
after six was pretty much as
late as I would, I would be.

86
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,460
It was never more than that.
But he would go like,

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,840
he never had to say anything like this
music starts, there's a little, uh,

88
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,910
bumper at the beginning, and
by the time it starts, I,

89
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,790
I'd sit down and he and Mike would go,
um, well, I guess there was traffic,

90
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,290
Anthony just getting in and other
bosses are listening. And it was,

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,370
it just wasn't necessary to do that.
You know, it, it kind of, I was like,

92
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,390
guys don't do that guys don't do that
to each other. You fucking sit down.

93
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,970
Don't say a word. No one
would know I'm late. You know?

94
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,860
And that's what happened. And it, there
were instances like that. All the,

95
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,220
it's all in my book, permanently
suspended. There's that book out now.

96
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,850
It's out now. Borders,
border's Barnes and noble.

97
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,280
I think we have a copy of the
agreement. Ah, yes. Very good.

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,610
But I talked to my house,
it's in my house.

99
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,640
I talk a lot about obviously
the relationship and, and uh,

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,580
with opie and, and how it kind of
slowly, uh, came apart at the seams,

101
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,350
I think toward the end.
Uh, he just, it had,

102
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,050
if he didn't want to do a show with,
with me anymore,

103
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,010
I don't think you want to do a show with
Jimmy either. That didn't last long.

104
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,590
And I knew it wasn't going to last long.
They,

105
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,000
I was the buffer between the two of
them. That ended bad. It really did.

106
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,160
It really did. Uh, if you talked
to Jimmy about it, like yeah, yeah,

107
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,690
he doesn't, he doesn't
express that kind of, no, no.

108
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,230
He doesn't like Jimmy's a
very loyalty driven guy.

109
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Like he takes that very seriously and
if he feels somebody fucking with him,

110
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,150
he really gets pissed.
Uh,

111
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,960
usually it can get talked
out and everything's cool
after a little while. Uh,

112
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,760
but this one who follow this,
this is pat. I didn't work.

113
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,920
Yeah, no, I think honestly the way
you guys interacted with each other,

114
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,560
what he was good for was sort
of directing the whole thing.

115
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,090
That's the impression that I got and I
mean how many times I do the show dozens,

116
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,440
right? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how
many times it did it. Absolutely.

117
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,050
But I was felt like what he did really
well was like sort of guide things like

118
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:31,940
sit back more, let you guys
be funny, but, but guide,

119
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,600
like figure out like maybe we need more
of this, maybe we need more of that.

120
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,300
And there was real value to that.
Absolutely.

121
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:42,560
But do you think that's fun when you go
out and do an appearance and everyone's

122
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,600
clamoring about a bit that me and
Jimmy did or something for handyman.

123
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,300
Yeah. And he's sitting
there going like, well I,

124
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,850
I pushed a button and I drove
the ship and I, you know,

125
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,920
went to spots and if he knew it's,
it's,

126
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,790
it's funny cause like, yeah, you're
not going to be appreciated as much,

127
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,920
but it's like a guy who is good at
defense. He doesn't score a lot of points.

128
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,690
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not going
to be Lebron James. It's necessary.

129
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,150
Guys who score the points though or the
ones who everybody wants to talk to.

130
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,930
You ever see a, I think of OFI like, um,

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,200
do you ever see the prestige, the
movie, the prestige, uh, with the,

132
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,420
the two magicians? No. [inaudible] it's,
it's a good movie. It's a good movie.

133
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,810
But at one point,
because he has to use a body double,

134
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,850
the actual magician has to drop below
the stage and the body double comes out

135
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,330
and gets all the applause
and he's under the stage.

136
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:46,070
The real guy that did the whole act is
under the stage and he shuts his eyes and

137
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,940
puts his arms out. Like trying to
enjoy the adulation from the fans,

138
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,400
but it's not even him getting it.

139
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,370
And I think that kind of
mindset was there. There's,

140
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,920
and then resentment starts bubbling up
and you start doing things like saying,

141
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,860
Anthony just got in, um, you,

142
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,750
you hold things over people's heads.

143
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,890
The contract negotiations
were a nightmare every time.

144
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,300
And opie always wanted a one year deal.
I'm like, what the fuck are you doing?

145
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,080
Let's sign for 10 years. Who gives a
shit? You know, if they want to fire you,

146
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:26,370
they're going to fight anyway, the
contract or not, but let's lock them in.

147
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,750
So if something happens, at least
we have, uh, a settlement portion,

148
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:34,440
we could take half the, the what they
owe us for five years, whatever it is,

149
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,300
not one year deal.
That's all I want.

150
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,510
Because he always had
this delusion of grandeur.

151
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,310
Like there was always something
better waiting, uh, for us to grab up.

152
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,110
And it's like the truth of the matter was,

153
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,640
the glory years of the ONA show were
gone. The New Year's and the, you know,

154
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:52,740
all that crazy fucking radio.

155
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,600
We were damaged goods after the sex
in Saint Patrick's cathedral debacle.
