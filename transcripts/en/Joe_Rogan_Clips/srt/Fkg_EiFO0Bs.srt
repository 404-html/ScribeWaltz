1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,770
The joe rogan experience. Future
Science. Yeah. That's what you're into.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,770
I'm way into future science.
I wish we lived in the future,

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,280
so that's where it goes. Fit in.
I just go, I mean future science.

4
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:16,240
I think I just think time.
I think time is an illusion.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:21,190
I think that I'm more, did you
ever see interstellar? Yes.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,720
I'm more in that zone.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,320
That's that smacked of good science
to me. Like I was like, yes.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,340
When you say time's an illusion,
you mean like the watch is real?

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,850
Like if it says four 30 that's when the
movie starts, right? That's all real.

10
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,150
No, that's just coordination. That's
it's, it's within our species.

11
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:46,210
We're coordinating together.
We're working as an ant colony.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,380
We are sending signals,

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,220
which happened to be time signals
were using math to coordinate,

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,940
but if you go underwater and hold
your breath for five minutes,

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,990
that's real five minutes. No, that's
just when you run out of oxygen,

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,280
so that five minutes,
that is the counting of that time.

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,970
Doesn't mean anything. Doesn't mean
anything. No, it doesn't mean anything,

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,520
but if someone's five minutes late, you're
like, bitch, you're five minutes late.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,300
Well, I'm never mad about
that because I'm always late.

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,310
That's interesting.
Um,

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,570
well the only time supposedly is now
and everything else is just are pathetic

22
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,640
attempts at measuring it and trying to,

23
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,620
that's just coordination on like, you
know, people like that's all we're doing.

24
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,510
Like how old are you? Um, you know,

25
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:35,380
and then that just means how crispy
you are from going around the sun.

26
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,510
That's not like really anything.
Sorry. Yeah, you're like, sorry.

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,450
Right skin.
Cracklin you know,

28
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:47,680
like it's just kind of that and to me
like time is just, it's just space.

29
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,380
It's like how far are you away
from this gravitational pull?

30
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,150
I think gravity is way more interesting.

31
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,750
I think time is just us
coordinating with math.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,890
Well, we definitely are, but it's
also like when the sun's coming up,

33
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,730
like check your watch, six 15 sun's
coming up. That's a real thing.

34
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,970
We're just clocking a spin of an earth.

35
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,480
It's the same thing with the
lungs under water. The earth spins

36
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,220
disagree with you at the same time.
Yeah. That's fine. I think you're right.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,390
But I also think the fucking
movie starts at four 30.

38
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,990
That's another human putting on a movie.
It's true.

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Coordinating with giving me an example
of time that is a manifest thing outside

40
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:29,180
of human coordination.

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,960
Um, well you could the
oldest, and I don't mean

42
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,460
like things happening, right? I mean time.

43
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,720
Is that helpful in any way?
Other than for us?

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,030
I don't think it exists
in the universe really

45
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,790
well. If the universe had a big bang and
that was a point, I don't want Starbucks.

46
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,450
Sorry. What do you think?
I think we're looking at,

47
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,290
okay. Black holes, you know,
say there's a train, right?

48
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,050
We're at a where the depot.
Okay. I love that word.

49
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,890
Try to depot depot or home
depot or a train depot. Okay.

50
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
And there's like a giant but of
a train. Right? Huge. I Dunno.

51
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,410
20 feet tall.
18 feet wide.

52
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,640
Yeah.

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,780
Filled with that. Likes that,
that feeling of like, oh my God,

54
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,170
there's great mechanical power.
And then it leaves the depo,

55
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,110
but you're still there. You
didn't get on it. Right. And it,

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,770
it just travels in the distance
into a Tinier and Tinier, Tinier,

57
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:32,920
tinier speck until it's just a little
point. They, you can't see it anymore.

58
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,210
Did the train shrink? No. Okay.

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,770
So when you see all this
matter going into a black hole,

60
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,480
is it really hitting a singularity or
we really condensing matter to that

61
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,711
extent?

62
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:52,270
Or is it just condensing to a certain
extent and traveling in the distance?

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,810
Is it going somewhere?
And that's why we perceive it as gone.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,030
It's, it's basically a run
this by an astrophysicist,

65
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,970
then they break out the worm hall.
But that's not the same thing.

66
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:04,440
That's not what I'm saying.
Like,

67
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,850
and I think the big bangs or
the other end of that process,

68
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,660
the under end of the process of coming
out, that's a, that's a real, uh, thought.

69
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,750
They think that, well, every galaxy
has a super massive black hole,

70
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,690
black hole that's in the center of it.
One half of 1% of the mass,

71
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:27,410
the entire galaxy. So the
larger the galaxy, the largest
supermassive black hole,

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,710
the prevailing theory is that,

73
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,570
or one of the prevailing theories I
should say inside every black hole may be

74
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,620
another universe.

75
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,640
It's entirely possible that
there's another universe
of hundreds of billions of

76
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:43,880
galaxies, each with supermassive
black holes in center of them,

77
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,810
and he'd go through that one you go into,

78
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,110
it's fractal and it just goes
on forever and ever and ever.

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,190
That's entirely possible

80
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,810
philosophy. And I think the
whole Universe is spinning.

81
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,870
I think the whole thing's
a spiral. Yeah. Mm.

82
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,170
I think they think that don't pay them
within the spiral. You get the eddies,

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,800
right, which are the galaxies
and the irregularities and stuff,

84
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,870
but the whole Shebang is also spinning

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,160
the multiverse ideas
like legit scientists.

86
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:11,090
Talk about that now that there might be
different for that number of universes.

87
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,210
Yes, I agree with that.
There's so much more sense.

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,250
What makes some kind of like the people
that go, wow, that's crazy. Well,

89
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,340
the universe is crazy.
It's crazy.

90
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,910
It's crazy that you look out and
you see forever. That's crazy.

91
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,210
That's fucking crazy. And when
you look up, you're looking out,

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,450
you're sitting on the side of a planet,
like in the middle of the whole thing,

93
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,820
right? Yeah. You're in the middle
of this soup of, of reality,

94
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,690
but to think that that's crazy, but
that's as crazy as it gets. Like says who?

95
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,590
Why would,

96
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,920
why would you think this fucking infinite
numbers of these things out there that

97
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:42,020
were just a part of
something that's so big.

98
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,990
Like if you looked at all
of the Zeros on that number,

99
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:47,630
you wouldn't even be able to wrap your
head around it. You'd be like, what?

100
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,560
What's a billion? How many? How many
zeroes is that? How many billions is this?

101
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,570
How many trillions is a billion and
what? There's no way. It's too much.

102
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,620
There's this thing, I love it so
much and it's talking about it.

103
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,150
It has to do with why we haven't
seen aliens yet. The Fermi paradox.

104
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,410
Yes. Yeah. I think that's it. Yeah. The
Fermi paradox is like questioning why?

105
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,740
Because there's so many different
life. I mean, some different plants,

106
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,330
it could potentially support life because
like if there's 100 billion galaxies

107
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,590
or hundreds of billion, and each one
has a hundreds of billions of stars,

108
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:25,100
how many of those have habitable
planets and the if the, if so,

109
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,390
why haven't they contact? Yes. Yeah,

110
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,980
and like the math is overwhelming that
either we're the first or they kill all

111
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,640
the comers or,
or there we're like,

112
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,020
or we turn inward
and go into the,

113
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,320
what's the turn inward
turning inward is the,

114
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,120
the idea that we all go virtual and
then we become some sort of a symbiotic

115
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,180
thing connected to this,
this hive mind,

116
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,790
this real electronic reality.

117
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,660
Okay.
Okay.
