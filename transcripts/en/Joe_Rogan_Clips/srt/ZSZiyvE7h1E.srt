1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,660
You know,
man,

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,800
it's like even what's going on with the
pope just recently said there's no hell.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,780
And everybody went crazy.
Like what? What did Hsi,

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,090
the pope said, there's no hell. He's,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,160
he's slowly bracing you for the
fact that all this is nonsense,

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,310
but right now we're going to get rid
of hell. Like this is like one of the,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,170
one of the purest examples of like the
change in people's attitudes towards a

8
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:27,240
religious real. Yup. Yup.
The Vatican denies that,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,940
but the Vatican did not say,
there is no hell,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,410
we'll find out an article where it says,
he did say that 50% shit,

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,030
he's not going to cut it back.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,590
Go back in time and find an article
where he did say the guarantee you,

13
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,970
he did say it. Let's just assume at
one day that, see this is what they do.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,430
They say it a little bit
and then they take it back.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,040
So they get used to the idea that they're
saying it. That's what it is. I'm,

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,260
I'm full Eddie Bravo right now.
I'm full conspiracy dude.

17
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:59,870
This is how they set it up.
They start out with uh, uh, uh,

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,670
they tell you the hell is not real.
And then they say, we never said that.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,090
And then a year from now they say, look,
we're pretty sure hell is not real. This,

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,590
this pope probably place fort night and
shit. And he's like, he's a cool pope.

21
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,290
He doesn't have the pope. He's got his
Connie liaison. He's the cool pope.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,210
He is the cool pope. He got rid
of the throne. Oh yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,120
He had a big giant crazy ass thrown
for the last guy. The creeper.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,560
He's got a Gamer chair down those
racing chairs. The headphones.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,330
It's got one of those Pope
Francis in the fucking house.

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,080
Pope Francis has no problem
with gay people either.

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,270
See Pope Francis fighting with Yo litter
kid. Yeah. See, look how he swapped.

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,620
You look at the old, the old thrown versus
the new look at the two side to side.

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,963
The guy on the left to God,

30
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,970
they just kicked out for crimes against
humanity and the guy on the right is the

31
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,750
new guy who's just got a sensible
chair. Much better. Yeah,

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
the throne is creepy man.
That is crazy.

33
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:03,660
And He dresses much more conservatively
two. He's not wearing crazy wizard robes.

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,180
He's wearing like a one color wizard robe.

35
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,190
He dresses like r Kelly on a Sunday.
Just crazy.

36
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,140
Like if he came out and like a
polo shirt and a pair of jeans. No,

37
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,030
right? No. Everybody like,

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,750
hey you can't be the Paul put
without the fucking magic outfit.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,610
Where's your fish head hat? Come
on Bro. He's got body armor on.

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,390
He's got that hat on like a golden salmon
that's coming out of the top of his

41
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,100
head. Like show me that
hat is fucking hat.

42
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,970
Sad is preposterous. That's out.
That's like a monster and a,

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,590
that's a mouth of a monster. I
ah, like a like a giant snake.

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,760
It looks like a Napkin at a restaurant
when you go there and it's sitting in.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh and it's nicely done in south Wales.
A little rings.

46
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,100
He probably put it on by mistake.
Like he's just like, look at me.

47
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,990
I can't believe they're making fun of our
Holy Father Cause just on this fucking

48
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,330
show sucks.
You'll make it fun of our Holy Father.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,190
He's right there with the smoke.
Oh my God.

50
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,450
How is this still legal?

51
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,980
Look at these kids dressed up like
they're in Harry Potter's seminary until

52
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,980
Dwarf that. They look good. They do.
They look like they'd go to that.

53
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:18,520
What's that Hogwarts school. They
do. This is fucking ridiculous.

54
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,550
Universal talking to this dude who's
holding up a golden version of where the

55
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,870
savior was murdered,
right?

56
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,620
He's got a golden cross is crosses all
over the place like don't forget about

57
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:33,280
the cross, and he standing
there dressed like a wizard.

58
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,370
This is craziness and everybody's
gonna know this is our religion.

59
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,060
This is our culture. This
is weird. This is weird,

60
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,730
and I'm not saying it's not beautiful.
It's absolutely beautiful.

61
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,580
I'm not saying it's any weirder than
going to the opera because I think that's

62
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,800
weird too,
but this shit is weird.

63
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,890
This is some really old form of education
slash entertainment that people used

64
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,690
to do before they had plays.
They get together and some room.

65
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,180
What's fucking crazy?
Different colored glass windows in it.

66
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,640
Why didn't he have a mic on?
Why did that kid got to hold the mic?

67
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,590
And because Jesus doesn't
want him to be magnified.

68
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,240
That's a thick mic though.
Yeah. Manager. It was pink.

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,570
She had a pink Mike. What's the deal?
What's up? Why's it have to be silver?

70
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,270
I like pink, pink, pink Mike. It's uh,

71
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,540
it's crazy, you know, and it's a
billion of us and I was raised there.

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,430
I mean I was from when I was real little
kid did at least one year in Catholic

73
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,820
school, but was around a lot of
Catholics. You know, I don't,

74
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,140
I'm not claiming to be an expert in it,

75
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:41,640
but I don't have to be that Shit's
bananas. I used to be an altar server.

76
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:45,200
I used to hold that. Mike,
did you really? Did you,

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,250
were you ever in the middle of doing
that? Going, what in the fuck am I doing?

78
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,521
Not,

79
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,390
well the most of the times we did it
when it and me and my friends talk about,

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,640
we would get out of class so we would,
because I went to Catholic school,

81
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:58,120
there'd be services during the day and
funerals even sometimes we get paid to be

82
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,670
out of class and then we would like
miss two or three hours of school.

83
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,130
Wow,

84
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,340
20 bucks, get some donuts, miss lunch. You
know? That was really all we were doing.

85
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,700
I used to just have to light the candles
like me and this other kid would come

86
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,110
out and late.
All these candles.

87
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,270
I always wanted to be the guy that puts
them out with that bell bell and the

88
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,104
hook.

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,880
That's so bananas when you're
in that room and they'll see,

90
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,890
you see those benches all laid out up
to the pulpit like this is so crazy.

91
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,943
This is,
it's,

92
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,730
it's like people figured out some way
to make the bridge between physical

93
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:40,860
evolution and mental evolution.

94
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,670
Like there's this bridge between
us not being monkeys anymore,

95
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,530
but still we just want to get
out of the barbarian behavior.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,800
We've got to figure out a way to get
people to like have reverence for

97
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,450
something.
It's all and just control their behavior.

98
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,570
We've got to slow down the chimp in a
set a monkey and that's what it looks

99
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,600
like. A monkey. The monkey statue,

100
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,580
the feast of the chair of Saint
Peter and addressed what is the,

101
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,240
the statue is just a bronze statue
of Saint Peter is a dark statue.

102
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,350
Try and tell you St Peter was black
truth.

103
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,160
There's a, it's weird. When we
were in Charlottesville, the,

104
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,100
they had the black Israelites there that
were right out in front of the building.

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,920
They'll,

106
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,580
they used to set up shop all the time
and New York is to run into those dudes.

107
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:39,140
Just wander down the street. I was told
that because I'm Italian, I'm not white.

108
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,070
I said, Oh yeah, two told me that. I
was like, thank you and do you see true?

109
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,270
I know what you are. I did
see that. I did see that,

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,380
but yet I'm certainly not black,
so keep telling it.

111
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,000
According to these black Israelites,
I am not white, so I'm okay.

112
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,840
The nit true nation. Is that them?
Cause I love how they dress. They,

113
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,570
I mean they take that whole
pope shit to the next level.

114
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,600
They're like fuck that man won't be
like he mad master of the universe.

115
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,820
God Damn dressing. It's crazy.
Look at how they're dressing.

116
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,620
They have shields and shit bro. Go
to that. Make that picture bigger.

117
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,330
Please make that picture bigger. These
are serious people there on the street.

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,380
They're reading from the Bible. One
guy has a sword, kids guys got an ax.

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,810
The other guys got to pick acts
like he's going to go find gold.

120
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,450
This is one of the craziest pictures
of this is real. Is that real champion?

121
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,220
Be Real. That's like, go
back to that please. Jamie,

122
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,950
go back to that police for a
second. What did, what did it say?

123
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,440
There was something in the um, the
text that went with it. Is that it?

124
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,240
Yeah, there it is. What does
it say? Passover 2012 Isu p. K.

125
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,870
Passover from Wikipedia.
So

126
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,920
it looks like a mix tape.
What is that High Holy Day
Passover in Harlem, New York.

127
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:02,420
2012. Oh my God. So that's the black
Israelites at the high holy day.

128
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,380
Passover,

129
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,640
black Israelites who think there are
different kinds of Jew that the so called

130
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:12,090
Jews that looks like
fun. I'll do that. Um,

131
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,500
it looks like fun until someone gets
drunk and starts swinging an ax around.

132
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,190
What do they got there?
They're teaching white people stuff.

133
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,590
They got these posters. Six, six,
six. Preach on brother. Okay.

134
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,730
They dress cool though. Look at that
outfit. All leather. Giant star.

135
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:33,320
David Dude has a sword. No big deal. Just
two dudes walking around with a stored

136
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,920
there. It is like a fucking like, oh, it
looks like a holiday inn or something.

137
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,910
Right? This isn't like some sort of
banquet center. When they have the sword,

138
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,970
they showed the picture of the sword.
Where are they?

139
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,970
Where the fuck is that going on that?
That seems like a very public place.

140
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:53,330
That was sword. So what's that place
