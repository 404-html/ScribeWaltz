1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,360
Sometimes just, dude,
sometimes people hang things.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,630
They hang things in their
garage and the cold too.

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,600
So you mentioned were hanging
on I think about is Jesse some,

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,000
oh my God.
Talk about said No.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,080
Whole bunch of people
back in one interview.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,040
Crazy story itches. It
such a mess. It's a mess.

7
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,090
And I think was really awful about
it because his story, it was,

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,720
it was like good and bad of it to good
of it was when people thought that he was

9
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:38,790
violated and he was a victim of a
hate crime. It wasn't just gay people.

10
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:43,080
There was a Russian to support him.
It was like thug dudes,

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,410
you know what I'm saying? It was like
some real motherfuckers. Dell was like,

12
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,600
I mean, I saw exhibit, make a comment.

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,990
It was a community of people away from
the LBG community to thought it was

14
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,620
really fucked up. Yeah. And that's,

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,760
that was the beauty of the incident
because it kind of put people together.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,070
But the fun thing about it was just a
lot and it's so fucking unfortunate.

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,970
It's so unfortunate.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,730
Somebody would play on people's emotions.
Yeah.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,650
For or to benefit
themselves. It's, it's awful.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,330
Well this a certain narcissism that
exists in show business there. Thank you.

21
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:26,130
And I both know very well,
you know,

22
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:30,810
we've all seen it and thankfully the
people that seem to be the best for

23
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:33,240
whatever reason, they have the,
with some of the best handles on it.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,470
Like Dave doesn't show any of that.
Right?

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,120
But there's some people that do and that
narcissism is weird that that wanting

26
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:43,710
it to be all about them and then they'll
do sneaky shit like faking attack.

27
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,950
Like that's, that's a symptom of
that same kind of thinking. It just,

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,770
it just got desperate and
went in some crazy way.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,840
It was officer a reason
because you have people,

30
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:55,720
like when I first went down you had
people that normally people that you would

31
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,010
look at,

32
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,180
okay that's my friend or whoever you
started having side eyes and that's just,

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,880
it's just,
it's so messed up.

34
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:06,990
And I think also as messed up as much as
people wrote for him when they thought

35
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:10,020
that it was an injustice, everything,
nobody's really talking about it.

36
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,660
Nobody's addressing. They're like,
you know, this is our movement.

37
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,910
These are things that we were
trying to progress toward,

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,920
but this was an isolated incident
and just say how awful it was.

39
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,750
Yeah.
You know,

40
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,050
the beautiful thing is that people are
way more tolerant than they ever have

41
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,110
been before. They're also beautiful
things. Attack didn't happen. Right?

42
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:31,080
So I don't have to think of one more
atrocious thing that people have done to

43
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,600
another person for no reason.
All right? So that's good.

44
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,290
And it's also good that you get to see
where that kind of stuff heads where

45
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,110
you're always looking to be a victim to
the point where you realize there's like

46
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:44,360
some sort of currency and being a victim.
So people fake being a victim, right?

47
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,620
So they can get all this fucking
attention. It's good for us.

48
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:50,070
It's good for us to see. Cause you see
that now next time a story comes around,

49
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,850
that's just a little fishy. You
going to second guess it. Exactly.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,290
It's like the boy who cried wolf.

51
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,740
And that's what's unfortunate about it
because anytime someone says that they

52
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:02,170
were a victim of such a heinous crime
like that, you want to believe them.

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,940
You want to believe them. I
mean they said, well this is,

54
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,200
it makes you start second guessing thing
and that's another thing that was awful

55
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:12,970
about the whole thing and all the smoke
he's getting right now and he deserved,

56
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,330
because I've been tearing his ass up
on Instagram on everything he did.

57
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,780
He deserves every bit of it. He knows he
deserves, everybody knows he deserves it.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,290
I read,

59
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,290
I read a story once about this dude who
said that he punished his daughter by

60
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:29,680
making her sit in the backyard by a
tree and then he went out there an hour

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,060
later and she was gone and the suspect
that coyotes got her and I remember

62
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,480
thinking that story going, man,
that just does not sound real.

63
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,090
That does not sound real.
It just seems weird. Yeah,

64
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,300
you just kind of left a baby in
the backyard and coyotes got it.

65
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:46,990
Like reading was like a new, like not
walking or anything like that. Well,

66
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:50,580
he left the baby like to punish the baby,
like a two year old left it in the,

67
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,410
well, it turns out he really didn't
do that. The kid died and he,

68
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:57,280
he'd stuffed it in some drainage
ditch somewhere. So this, uh,

69
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,460
I don't remember how the kid died.
What was the reason for it?

70
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:02,860
But it was one of those stories
where you hear the story like, Jesus,

71
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:06,340
it doesn't sound real.
Sometimes stories don't sound real.

72
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,840
The next thing we're going to be
second guessing everything. I hope not.

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,490
But when it first went down,
I thought it was a,

74
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,030
I've thought it was a situation where
Lee Daniels and Jesse sat down in a

75
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:23,080
writer's room and Lee
Daniels, Lee, anybody got any
ideas for any new episodes?

76
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,530
It just like, I got one. Nobody's
going to believe it. Look,

77
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:28,010
I'm going to be hungry and shit.
Right?

78
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm going to go to subway to get a 12
inch footlong elite. Dan, who's like,

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,023
I believe that.

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,980
I believe that part day with her, the
whole story elite. Danny said some,

81
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,550
nobody's going to believe it. Jesse
got upset. It told the totally dance.

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,350
We'll see.
I'm going to shoot him myself,

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,520
and he walked to into that whole
scenario and it's just awful.

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,730
That's entirely possible. That's
what it sounds like. It sounds like.

85
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,610
Now you're gonna say now anybody
that was a fan of empire,

86
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:01,150
which I know a lot of people that are
listening, we're being very sarcastic.

87
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,670
When I say that,
they're going to be like second guessed.

88
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,040
The storylines of so many of those shows,
the storylines of everybody,

89
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,940
whoever's said today,
we're done wrong or anything.

90
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,160
The awful thing about this is now people
are going to be ready and quick to just

91
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,810
second guessed anything that you say.
