1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,870
Hello Freak bitches.
So speaking of a citizen Kane,

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:10,871
Orson wells and conspiracies last night
I rewatched the episode of Geraldo

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,980
Rivera is good night America when they
introduced the Zapruder cause you know,

4
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,160
Dick Gregory just died. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,230
They introduced this approved or
film to the American public, uh,

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,060
13 years or 12 years, 12 years
after Kennedy's assassination. And,

7
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:28,830
uh, then I went and read that paper, uh,

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,360
the articles that was the printed
a couple of weeks ago that a,

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,420
you even tweeted about it,

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,510
about the CIA questioning the official
story of the JFK assassination. Yeah.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,300
Yeah. That was interesting, wasn't
it? Yeah. It pass a CIA guy.

12
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:43,550
What do you think about that?
Well, first of all, Zapruder

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,330
film I ate,

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,160
that's the most watched piece of film
in history of film has it really,

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,860
which is really interesting. Um, but
uh, yeah, it was interesting that the,

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,181
you know,

17
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:56,210
as typical with a lot of these things
that the headline doesn't necessarily

18
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,340
actually match once you get
into the body of the story.

19
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:01,580
But the idea being that the agency

20
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,960
had some concerns over

21
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,640
the idea that perhaps Cuba was behind
the assassination Wa the Russians to some

22
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:18,050
degree or more likely in a
combination of the two. Um, look,

23
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:22,220
I think, you know, I do, I
think that, uh, that, uh,

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,240
he could have taken that shot. Yeah.
It was not a, yeah, it was not, I said,

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,840
I've been up in that book depository from
that point of view, that vantage point.

26
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,680
We did a story on the, on
the, uh, the whole, uh,

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,120
issue of the conspiracy theory
and what could have happened.

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,440
Then we tried to find some
new witnesses and, you know,

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,260
could he have made that shot?
Yeah. That was, uh, that was,
it was a straightforward,

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,100
you know, effort with someone who
had some training. He was, you know,

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,450
he wasn't the world's best shot,

32
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,930
but he had sufficient training to make
that shot. No, that's separate from,

33
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,430
you know,

34
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,430
his motivations and any potential support
that he may have gotten a during the

35
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:59,270
course of that. And, you know,
I think that he, in his mind,

36
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:04,040
he, he genuinely felt that this was going
to get him into the revolution, right.

37
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,590
That this was going to,

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,760
he had a very unhappy experience in
Russia when he was over there living,

39
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,900
came back,
saw what was happening in Cuba,

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,110
desperately wanted to be
part of that, uh, took, uh,

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,790
unexplained trip down in Mexico.
Uh,

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,890
which could well have been in an effort
to find somebody who could support his,

43
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,750
his desire to,
to take some sort of action,

44
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,120
whether he had formed in his mind that's
what he was going to do at the time or

45
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:33,560
not. So, you know, is there
a still a possibility that,

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,620
um, the Cubans, which would there,

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,830
the Intel service there would have had
to file on him? I mean, he was a very,

48
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,350
very well known quantity.
Obviously by that time for the Russians,

49
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,550
the Russians are solely responsible for
training up the Cuban Intel service.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,920
So there's a massive file on
him. And they knew, you know,

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,120
who they were dealing with. They knew
his weaknesses. They knew his, um,

52
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,710
they knew his motivations.

53
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:02,170
They knew what to do in terms of trying
to get leverageable, you know, um,

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,210
information on him. So I think that
the jury is still out. I'm not,

55
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,830
and I'm not a conspiracy guy,

56
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,000
but I think there's
enough there that says,

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,300
you know, yes, it's kind of like what
we're talking about, climate change.

58
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,760
I believe this, but I, this
is, this also could be true.

59
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,010
I think he could have taken
that shot and for sure, uh,
and, and, and, and succeeded.

60
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,790
I think it's also possible that he
may have had the encouragement of,

61
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,550
in particular the Cuban until service,
uh, through the Russians. They were,

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,960
because at that time in particular,
they didn't do anything there.

63
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,730
Cubans didn't do anything without the
Russians support blessings and direction.

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,350
So that is entirely possible.
Um,

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,110
do I think that there were a variety of
other things at play, you know, was it,

66
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,230
did they help him get the, the, uh,
the weapon? Did they, I mean, you know,

67
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:57,280
it was her actual logistical support in
there. I don't who did, I don't think so.

68
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:00,150
But that'd be on maybe. Yeah, it's,
it's a, it's a fascinating thing. And,

69
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:04,830
and you know, again, nobody wants
to think that something that, uh,

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,440
impactful could have been
just one guy who, you know,

71
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,240
had a dream about being a hero of
the revolution, that they just,

72
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,240
it's such an awful thing to think about.
You want something bigger,

73
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,850
you want something more
behind it. And it's, it's,

74
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,760
I will say the one thing that I
think there was something else too,

75
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:25,360
was the MLK issue of Martin
Luther King assassination.

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,960
Well, let's get to that for sure.
But here's the thing about the,

77
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,650
the Lee Harvey Oswald assassination.
You know,

78
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:34,670
a lot of people think that there was
people in the grassy knoll and that they

79
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:38,600
shot at the president and there was more
than one shooter. That's possible too.

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,630
And here's the other problem with people
saying that Oswald could have never

81
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:46,160
made that shot. Of course he could
have a 100% he could of, is it likely,

82
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:46,851
listen,

83
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:50,660
people throw three point shots that
have no fucking business on a basketball

84
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,570
court and they hit nothing but
net. It happens all the time. Yeah.

85
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,620
It doesn't mean it's,

86
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,730
it's not likely that a guy could
get off three shots that quick,

87
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,564
but it is possible.

88
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,070
Well, there was more time in there than
they originally thought. There's been,

89
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:07,060
there's some misinformation out there
about how condensed that timeframe was and

90
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:07,681
now after they've,

91
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:12,520
if they've researched into a fare thee
well at that timeframe extended a little

92
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,280
bit, but he had, more
importantly, he worked up there.

93
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,610
So he had the opportunity to recky
that site. Right. So he was like,

94
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,750
he was sitting in a blind weight
and, and figuring out, you know,

95
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,150
what am I going to be doing here?

96
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,140
And that's a tremendous
advantage and clear daylight.

97
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,780
Target's moving right in the
line with you. There's no wind.

98
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,070
Not only that, it's not
that far shot. No, it's not.

99
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,270
It's not like everybody thinks it's like
a half mile away or something like that.

100
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,330
I mean, how far was it? It was 150
yards or something like that. Yeah,

101
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:39,830
I'd have to go back and it's been fine,

102
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,950
but I've stood on that spot where the
limo was and hooked up on the site and I

103
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:46,100
stood up there and not that far down.
And it's not that far.

104
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:49,380
And it's a total makeup. Makeable
shot on a deer. Yeah. I'll give you,

105
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,260
we're going to shoot a deer with
a rifle. He be like, Oh yeah,

106
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:54,350
that's definitely an effective
range. No, there was no,

107
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:58,040
how far is it would go 260 feet.
81

108
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,530
meters. That ain't shit. Yeah, that's
a bowshot. Yeah. You could shoot a,

109
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:06,200
an animal with a bow from 80 meters if
you're really good and there's no wind.

110
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,940
Yeah. So that's a really close shot. So
the idea that he couldn't make that shot,

111
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,550
he's a bad shot.
That is so fucking stupid.

112
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,810
He absolutely could make that shot and
that anybody could make that shot from 81

113
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,450
meters. That's nothing. We
looked at the grassy knoll issue.

114
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:24,890
We looked at the end of the day. What,
what the, the train yard engineer, um,

115
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,940
reported seeing,
um,

116
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,960
with a sort of a puff of smoke that he
thought he saw over by the fence line.

117
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:34,250
And, and we looked and he's like, yeah,
you could, you know, from that position,

118
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,040
they opened that place up and we were
able to go back up there and you could see

119
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:37,131
it.

120
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,700
We ran a couple of tests and fired off
a few shots and that's always fun if you

121
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,060
want to have got a good time to take a
rifle to Dealey plaza and fire off a few

122
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,190
shots without the tourist knowing
what the hell is happening.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,790
And The Dallas police, by the way, were,
were tremendous during the course of that.

124
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,140
But, um, why don't you guys do this?

125
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,370
And we did this a while back for a
show called American declassified,

126
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,690
which isn't running anymore, but
it was on a, on a travel channel.

127
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,160
Jesse Ventura did that.

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,580
He went up there and with a
mantle linker carcanos same rifle.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,780
And I was like awful shock.
No one could make the shot.

130
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,730
Please dawn. I love Jesse.
I think he's awesome.

131
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,750
That's everything.
Did conspiracy

132
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,390
significantly on that side. It's to
the point where, you know, that's,

133
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,550
he's leaning always toward the conspiracy,

134
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,580
which you want to do is you want to do
every investigation. And I, you know,

135
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,590
this company that I've got, we,
we do a lot of investigations, we,

136
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,880
and you've got a bill just like with
a homicide case or anything else,

137
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,350
you've got to build it on
stable ground. Right? Right.

138
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,390
So you have to start from the very basics
because if you start building ideas

139
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:47,300
and investigative inquiries on something
that's not sturdy underneath it,

140
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,020
you know, not based on evidence and
fact, then you've got a problem.

141
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:55,450
The whole thing becomes
suspect and usually comes
toppling down. So, you know, I,

142
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,610
you got to keep an open mind about all
these things and I think it's important.

143
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,080
Um, right now people are
like, Oh, well I'm sure that
agency, the CIA was involved.

144
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:06,370
So I'm a terrible source of information.
I've, I've heard that before. I said,

145
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,470
you can't talk credibly about this
because you know, the CIA was involved in,

146
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,920
I think he is a thing of the CIA was
involved. It's not you, you weren't there.

147
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:17,360
And I was 62 last time I checked.
I was not there in 1962 and a,

148
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:22,040
and also I will tell you this much.
Or was it 63 it was 66 58 63 if the age,

149
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,040
if the agency had been involved,
this is the honest to God's truth.

150
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,950
There's no way that secret is still kept.
People can't keep their Yap shot.

151
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,090
They can't.

152
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,980
And secrets have a way of coming out and
certainly a lot quicker now than they

153
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:41,060
used to. So now the idea
that secrets then, I mean,

154
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,940
we're talking about so
long ago, how much, yeah.

155
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,120
Talking to him more than 50 years ago,
it's like, you know, it's like, get out.

156
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,680
It's like the DB Cooper issue.

157
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,360
My biggest reason for believing db Cooper
died and his shoot is hanging off a

158
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:57,000
tree and that's a vast wilderness
up there. Yeah. Is, uh,

159
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,180
is it people just,
they can't help themselves at some point,

160
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,550
people talk or somebody talks,
somebody associated with,

161
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:05,280
or somebody nearby or somebody involved
with somebody on their deathbed or

162
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,330
somebody said something they
shouldn't have. Um, it's, you know,

163
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:12,600
the idea that they've maintained this
sort of secret over a period of time,

164
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:16,050
I find hard to believe I'm
not discounting it. And again,

165
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:19,650
you've got to leave a little space open
for something that could be just amazing.

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,930
But anyway, so that's,
that was that. But I, yeah,

167
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,490
I agree. That shot was not, uh, was not
a tough shot. One meters ain't shit.

168
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,500
That's nothing in particular
in those conditions.

169
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:35,520
And I will say those conditions were
ideal. Unfortunately for that event.

170
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,930
People are like,

171
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,170
there's a video of me shooting a
fucking hard drive at a hundred yards,

172
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,890
a hard drive. You must hate
it. That hard edge. Oh wait,

173
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:47,940
you're just getting rid of some hardships
and thought it'd be fun to take it to

174
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,550
the rifle range.
So I take it to the right for it.

175
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,510
And obviously we're dealing with modern
rifles are probably more accurate,

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,350
but I'm shooting something
that's basically two inches high,

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,930
laying it down on the ground at a 100
yards and blown to smithereens. Yeah.

178
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,260
That's how accurate a rifle
is at a hundred yards.

179
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,680
You tell me he couldn't get a
headshot at 81 meters. That's crazy.

180
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,080
Again, Marsico wind of course he
could go to light. Did he though?

181
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,910
Who did he that's right. Yeah. That's
the question. The question is, you know,

182
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,450
we have some pretty good indication
as to what he was thinking and what is

183
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,490
obviously what his motivations
were and that's important.

184
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,310
It definitely was in with the Russians
definitely was involved in a lot of weird

185
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:26,900
shit with communism.

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,730
Who knows what his entire full background
was cause there was a lot of covert

187
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,540
shit going on.
Right.

188
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,021
Did He,

189
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:36,860
did he express a desire to do something
like this to the Russians at some point

190
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:40,320
and they, you know that, okay, well here's
an interesting opportunity, right? Yeah.

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,060
They would have,

192
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,720
they would have sparked on that and they
would have thought about it. They would.

193
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:48,540
They have actually, you know,
no play on words intended,

194
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,350
but would they have pulled the trigger
on an operation trying to push him into

195
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:55,670
doing an act like this? Maybe
indirectly through the Cubans. Exactly.

196
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,890
Especially, they thought like this crazy
fuck might go ahead and do this for us.

197
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,960
Yeah.
So after the Bay of Pigs,

198
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,510
people have to realize there was a
lot of people pissed off at Kennedy.

199
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:04,344
We locked the shot.

200
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,410
Hey Buddy hated Kennedy. Yeah. And so

201
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,180
well that infamous video where he's
banging his shoe down on a table,

202
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:12,140
we will bury you.

203
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,380
Yeah, yeah. No, it was, it
was, uh, the, the environment
was right for them and they,

204
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,041
and again,
the Russians,

205
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,530
it shouldn't be any surprise to anybody
when you talk about what they did during

206
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,460
this election. I mean, they've
been doing this forever, you know,

207
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,270
they've been there.
You go back to 1940s and,

208
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,820
and the Russians were spending a lot of
time and effort and money here in the

209
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:31,120
states trying to keep us out of the
war back before Hitler invaded Russia,

210
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,320
when they were allied with the
Nazis still. So they spend,

211
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,560
a lot of times they set up
independent association.

212
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:41,820
Supposedly they paid off a lot of unions
and union members know journalists.

213
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:44,940
I mean they were doing everything they
could to create this or to strengthen the

214
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,010
idea of isolationism just to keep us out.

215
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,610
They've been doing this for as long as
they've been around, so anybody who says,

216
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:53,490
well, I can't, you know, it's,
it's shocking. The Russians
would be engaged. This is,

217
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,340
that's ridiculous.

218
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,580
They've always been. Again, we by the way,
have been engaged doing that with them.

219
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,790
What? That's what I hear.
Fine. I've heard that online.

220
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,210
I find that Alex Jones story,

221
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,280
I do believe that bothers me the most
about the Kennedy assassination is the

222
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,890
universal support for
the magic bullet theory.

223
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,940
I think that fucking bullet is ridiculous.
I've shot things.

224
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,280
I've shot a lot of things.
I know what happens to bullets.

225
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,830
Everybody that I know that's a marksman.
Everybody know that's a hunter.

226
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,720
They see a bullet that has hit bone.
It fucking never looks like that.

227
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,220
When a boat goes through to people and
comes out looking like you shot it into a

228
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:30,160
pool of water, that's what it looks
like. I don't buy that at all.

229
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:34,720
And the convenience of finding it on
Connolly's Gurney when they rolled them

230
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,590
into the hospital. Oh look guys, we found
the bullet. Got It. And it's perfect. God,

231
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,240
I don't buy that for a fucking second.

232
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,470
And the problem is there's more
metal fragments in Conley's body,

233
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,860
then we're missing from the bullet itself.
I think that bullet itself,

234
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,380
you look at that bullet get Gatti here,

235
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,400
that thing didn't hit shit.
No, it's exactly right.

236
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,000
The condition of this with people that
have never shot guns and they could watch

237
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:02,440
[inaudible] proven that's not that
broke bones and a bullet breaks bones,

238
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:03,370
they get fucked and well,

239
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:08,170
it's a jacketed bullets
when it's a jacketed bullet
breaks bones, it gets fucked.

240
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:10,060
Yeah. You're talking about
something that's going, I mean,

241
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,590
how fast is a bullet from that rifle go?
It's gotta be kind of that.

242
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,980
That would be interesting
thing to pull up,

243
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:18,910
but I would imagine it's in the thousands
of feet per second. It's got to be,

244
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,930
when it hits bone, it's just going to
blow up. There's always distortion.

245
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:25,730
Even if you're, I mean it, so I don't,

246
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,070
but when you have a conversation about
this and it is somebody who has no

247
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,570
shooting experience or you know,
it just, all right, that's fine.

248
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:38,440
I understand why you're fascinated by
it. But do, when you do your research,

249
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,770
you know, it's, it's like with
news, read everything, right?

250
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:44,260
Read The Wall Street Journal. I read the
New York Times, read the Financial Times,

251
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,820
read, read the economist,
but read everything before
you form your opinion. Right?

252
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,700
And, and, and everybody
is so siloed nowadays.

253
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,230
And you get the same thing
with conspiracy theories.

254
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,270
I absolutely believe this
and I'm not going to,

255
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:58,240
I'm going to discount everything
else that's out there and,

256
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:03,130
or just not pay any attention to
it. Um, yeah. But it's hard to say.

257
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:06,160
And here's another thing, the magic
bullet path. People are like, well,

258
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,930
how is that possible?
Well,

259
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,990
let me tell you something that's the
most believable thing about the magic

260
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,910
bullet.
There is the path of the bullet,

261
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,840
because bullets do wacky shit when they
hit bone and you can't predict it at all.

262
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,870
I know a guy who, uh, in Iraq,

263
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,940
they shot a guy in the head from the
front and it went out as eyeball.

264
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,460
The bullet came out of
his eyeball back forward.

265
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:32,830
It ricocheted inside of his skull and came
out as, I know you can't, I mean, again,

266
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,551
you can't put you right,

267
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:36,000
you can't predict it and they'll try to
model these things and figure out a way,

268
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,700
but you know, there's an unknown
there. And so, yeah, I agree. I mean,

269
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:43,820
I think that again, it's, it's
one of those things where it, it,

270
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,360
it's never going to get
resolved. Um, and it,

271
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,000
it's going to continue to live on because
a, it was such an important event in,

272
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,160
in the history

273
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,730
of the country and B, it's, I keep
going back to that same thing.

274
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,050
People don't want to believe that really
awful shit can happen sometimes in a

275
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,550
very simple,
straightforward way.

276
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,350
And so it's much easier to think
it was a broad base conspiracy.

277
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:09,710
There were lots of moving parts.
Sometimes bad shit happens in,

278
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,470
it's just as simple.

279
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,570
Plus it seems that it is possible.
Conversely,

280
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:14,610
people don't like to
believe in conspiracies,

281
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,790
especially when it's evolved
in an assassination of
president. Right. You know,

282
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,210
the, the reason why they came up with the
whole magic bullet theory in the first

283
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,820
place is pretty shady in
the first, in fact, they,

284
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,640
the reason why they did it because the
guy got hit by a ricochet underneath the

285
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:30,660
overpass and they blamed
that bullet on one of the,

286
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:34,500
one of the shots from Lee Harvey Oswald
and the book depository. So they said,

287
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:38,910
well, all right, so now we have less
bullets that could have hit Kennedy.

288
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:43,050
We have all these wounds and we have to
tribute a series of wounds to one bullet,

289
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,020
right? Right. So that was the,
the, the thought process behind it.

290
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:49,980
But the Zapruder film was the one
that got people weirded out by it.

291
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,210
But I tell you about,
man,

292
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:55,350
I've watched that film a bunch of times
and one of the things that don't jive is

293
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:58,140
if he did get hit from the front, you
know, his head goes back to the left.

294
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,330
Why is the blood spray out
forward? See it's, it's,

295
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,270
it's weird the way the
impact of the blood is the,

296
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,030
it's like the blood sprays forward and
then his head goes back into the left.

297
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,730
It could have possibly been that
he was hit from the front end,

298
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:14,850
the back at the same time.
That's entirely possible. I mean,

299
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,160
that is a tactic you would do,
right?

300
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:20,500
You would roll something into an area
where they would be in a crossfire and

301
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,220
they'd get shot.

302
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,250
Well, they came in, if there was,

303
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:26,850
if the grassy knoll was in fact
a second site for a shooter,

304
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,270
then by the time it hits that corner and
starts its path just before the shots

305
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:37,770
were fired from the book depository and
Oswald, if you, if you're going with that,

306
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,070
if you had another shooter up
on the grass, you know, you're,

307
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,660
you are basically looking right
at the, the, uh, the, the,

308
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:51,970
the front of the vehicle and because of
the way that it's positioned in the nols

309
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:54,480
kind of turned,
and then it's just that,

310
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,170
it's just that there's not a lot
of concealment up there. Right.

311
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,960
And they had that, they had
the defense, the picket fence.

312
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:05,370
It's not the original
one that's there anymore,

313
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,080
but it's basically in line with it.

314
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:10,260
And you can see there's plenty of
pictures of the, uh, previous fence.

315
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:14,700
It was up there at the
time. Um, and you had that,

316
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,830
you did have the train yard engineer
report sometime after the fact that he saw

317
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,650
a puff of smoke that he wasn't
quite sure what that was all about.

318
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:27,120
And he'd seen a couple of people
back there so that, you know,

319
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:30,870
that was, that's an interesting thread
to pull on. Right. And I think that,

320
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:34,290
that it's been, you know, it's
been researched ad nauseum.

321
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,980
It doesn't mean that you couldn't still
find something that also doesn't mean

322
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:42,510
anybody's going to really
find a conclusion after the
fact, right. Firstly today.

323
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,480
Yeah, no, and that's right. And you,
you know, it's like everything else,

324
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,470
as time marches on, you loose, you know,
you lose witnesses, you lose, you know,

325
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,950
people that were there on site. And
even witnesses, when someone gets shot,

326
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,260
especially with the president gets shot,
not credible.

327
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,800
You'll have five different stories from
five different people and gunshots heard

328
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:02,750
from the moon. Nobody knows what that fog
just from a of robbery, just straight.

329
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,920
Yeah. A car accident. And you
say, you'll say, what did you see?

330
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,270
If you separate people out,
you're right.

331
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,270
You get five different versions from five
different people. Yeah. And you know,

332
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,130
so yeah. I wasn't no waiting
to see a counselor at, tend
not to be a particularly,

333
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,050
uh, credible. And you've
got to, you know, you, you,

334
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:19,290
you got to take them and then you got to,
you know,

335
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,590
match it up with other information. You
can, you can pull together forensically,

336
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,780
but it's, uh, it is fascinating.

337
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:34,610
Okay.
