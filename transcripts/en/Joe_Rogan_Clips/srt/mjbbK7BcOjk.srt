1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,130
The joe rogan experience. What I wanted
to talk to you guys about is, uh,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,200
some of my favorite stuff
that you've done. Um,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,660
and so my favorite stuff that
you've done is the undercover shit.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,400
And one of the things that I've found
the most disturbing was when you posed as

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:18,630
a gay couple and you went to that place
where they were advocating transgender

6
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:22,680
children and transitioning children
as young as three years old,

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,480
three years old, but puberty
blockers they were talking about.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,430
But I think it was really fucking
yet. Oh, no, no. You know what,

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,180
actually three years old was Owen
Benjamin gotten an argument on Twitter and

10
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:38,181
lost his manager because he was saying
that someone is fucking insane for giving

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:43,140
puberty blockers to a three year old kid
for giving hormone blockers to a baby,

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,670
which I am. Fuck yeah. That's not
even a strong enough word. I mean,

13
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:52,200
it's insanity. Fucking insanity. I mean,
you're, your body's not even developed.

14
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,990
You're not even close.
We're not talking about 18.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,810
We're not even talking about 21,
which is arguable is still crazy.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,720
Like you really should probably wait
until your fucking frontal cortex fully

17
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:02,040
developed.
You figure out who you are,

18
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,530
but the idea that you're
going to know at three,

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,920
who are you going to be when you're 30
well, they present the other side. Banana.

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,110
They act as though you're crazy.
No one said. They were like, well,

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,000
you know the things with the puberty when
we're that person looked like Smi with

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,240
looked like SMI from hook.
Well let's play with,

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,160
let's lay some of it because it's,
it's fucking nuts. When I watched it,

24
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:22,710
I was like, oh my God. Like
what are these people saying?

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,400
And the there've been taken down since
you asked me about that to really? Yeah,

26
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,610
we have to set the blur. The Guy, well,
I'm not afraid who checkerspot drugs.

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,200
Dr Rex, but who shows up in price
name? My name is regs, but diarrhea.

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,210
We have a business card. Real world.
We're in a goddamn simulation.

29
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,530
This was a town hall. We're in a
simulation. This can't be real guy.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,470
His name is rex. But, and he got
to the dig for a living, you know,

31
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,640
and you do back to back. Yes.
Okay. Let's play some of this.

32
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:58,641
And if there's a w for most of the
people are listening rather than watching

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,990
Jerry, do you know what, let's set
this up and turn. So what was this?

34
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,950
Okay. Uh, it was, well not gay, Jared
and I, so here's the one, let me,

35
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,170
can I preface this with some again,
we don't like,

36
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,630
we're not undercover journalists,
right? We do a late night show.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,130
That's what we do. We
do, we did the modeling.

38
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,730
Would you joke sketches and we do
interviews and then every now and then we

39
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:19,980
stumbled across something. And
when you're doing, for example,

40
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,500
like Antifa and they hand you a
knife and they talk about shooting.

41
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,540
Been talking about that too.
But the point is,

42
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:27,870
and then when the media just lies
about it, like we feel compelled to,

43
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:29,460
this isn't our thing,
right?

44
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:31,750
It's just this is what this particular
one was kind of a throwaway.

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,840
It was a throat. We were joking.
It was a goof. It was costumes.

46
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,110
If you just walked in separate
queer, it was what? The health care,

47
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:41,820
transgender town hall. We was like,
oh my gosh. Trans Gender, town hall,

48
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,600
transgendered. Tom. Where was it at?
Vermont. Vermont. Burlington, Vermont.

49
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,463
That place is crazy.

50
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,280
I wasn't a plane with Bernie Sanders
on the way there to wow. It was,

51
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:53,300
it was Kimmy. I'm on money. I'm
going to give it to the blacks,

52
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,150
the blacks blocks. Right.
That's fine. All right.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,430
He's about six now.
He has said that

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,630
it feels like a girl or first playing
with dolls and of course we don't want to

55
00:03:09,631 --> 00:03:14,010
discourage it. Um, we spoke
with our primary care physician.

56
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:17,280
He said, wait until the,
the boys fully developed.

57
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,010
Develop is a little thick. That's
me. I would say a little bit

58
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,670
from the research I've
done the kid 18th too late.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,470
It was just like, okay, get rid
of the poke. Puberty blockers.

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,160
They just go through late puberty.
Everything still lined up.

61
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,800
There's no indication that there's
any dance. That's not true.

62
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,390
Puberty blockers are not reversible.
That's the entire point.

63
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,660
That's not the point. Top of it. And, uh,

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,590
someone at the pre adolescent age going
into those adulent it's going to change

65
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,464
the way your body,

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,230
no question at all. I mean there's no
way giving a kid a puberty blocker,

67
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,860
letting them go through life with a
puberty blocker and then at 17 or whatever

68
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,690
the fuck it is decided
to take that shit off.

69
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
You're going to be the exact same human
being you would have been without.

70
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,500
People were worried about
a little estrogen and milk
cartons and this guy saying,

71
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,240
hey, free plastic cause I don't want
it to ultra my hormones. By the way,

72
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:14,840
I'm going to chop off my balls and do
puberty blockers at eight. But this is,

73
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,770
I mean you can't,
you can't let a kid make those decisions.

74
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,190
You can't make those decisions for a kid.
They're too young.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,580
He just remember he had a
wiener five minutes ago. Yeah.

76
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,870
Was I thinking about these
things? No, no. He's just fine.

77
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,100
His book or off on the couch three
minutes ago and now you're letting them

78
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:35,870
decide is hormonal profile the idea that
a child who's six years old or whatever

79
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:36,950
would know the consequences,

80
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:41,450
but them saying that 18 is too late and
that it's not that they would disagree

81
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:43,100
with your primary care physician,

82
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,430
that it's too young based on
the research that I've done.

83
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,040
What fucking research have you done?
What you,

84
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,510
you can clearly point that it's a good
idea to transition a six year old.

85
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,090
Well here that's a problem.
Here's another problem.

86
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,360
We don't know if youtube is going to
ban this video because of what you just

87
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:03,020
said. [inaudible] t you this video is
going to get marked for demonetization.

88
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,800
Well, yeah, the,

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,950
the Jordan Peterson one just got
flagged and we talked about this book.

90
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,630
We talked about uh, the 12 rules
for life. We talked about, uh,

91
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,470
guidelines for living a hell just reading
it. That's great book. Let's keep going

92
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,980
to understand themselves and the task
or reach a particular day length and the

93
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:27,220
diameter and the penis is developing
up. Then there'll be enough if, if,

94
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,710
if you're going to check, if you're
going to transition to it away material.

95
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,220
Oh cause that's a problem. I be like,
you know, jazz material, creative vagina.

96
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:39,670
If the testicles and the peanuts are
developed enough, did you know this?

97
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,190
Did you know that unless
your penis gets big enough,

98
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,760
you can't get a fake vagina because
there's not enough tissue to in.

99
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,970
So he's like, this is him. He's like, no.
If you decide to transition the other way,

100
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:52,530
meaning if you decide to not transition,
eat.

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,840
Remember how everyone made fun of
this? Uh, the beauty pageant girl,

102
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,220
when she was asked about gay
marriage, she's like, and then,

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,980
and gay marriage or opposite marriage
and everyone laughed and it was silly.

104
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,750
You know what I mean? She was
conservative. It was silly.

105
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,860
But he's doing that right here.

106
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,890
Like should you choose to transition
or transition the other way?

107
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,890
You mean should you choose
to not cut off your penis?

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,380
That's transitioned the other
way. Now, not only that,

109
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,390
there's a lot of people in
the transgender community.

110
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,150
I think it's offensive to assume
that you have to get an operation,

111
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:19,070
get your penis removed,
nor to be transgender.

112
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,000
And what some of those guys making this
big assumption that this is what you

113
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,680
have to do in order to transition.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,820
I know a lot of people
that are transgender that
do not have the operation.

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,870
I don't know a lot of people.

116
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:34,340
I just say I'm in a community focus
groups with transgender people.

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,960
By the way, let me say I'm 100% in favor
of grown adults deciding to transition.

118
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,530
I don't know. I think you should have be
able to tattoo your face. Get nose rings.

119
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,740
I don't give a fuck what you
do. I really don't. I mean,

120
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,570
you're also asking the government to pay
for your face tattooed. Yes, that's true.

121
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,460
Well, and there was another thing here.
I'll, I'll send this to you, Jamie.

122
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,910
Um,

123
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,910
that was some research today
that someone put out here.

124
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll play this and I'll, I'll forward
this to Jamie. I'll Texas to keep playing.

125
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,390
That's it. That's it. That's
that clip. I Dunno. But yeah,

126
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,450
I mean that was the thing is, that's a
good example. It's a public town hall,

127
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,430
which we attend and it gets removed from
youtube because someone who handed us

128
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,580
his business card, rex, but
business card Arius, by the way,

129
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,440
like we didn't eat the rest of us.

130
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,000
We weren't nearly as mad about this
as we were just, just, just in,

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,270
in doubled over in laughter
at the guy's name is rex.

132
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,420
I had trouble getting less secure in
the URL, writes do his own nation.

133
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,790
There was a gun politely to her website
and you run a have to go to the URL.

134
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,600
Yeah, I just sent this to you, Jamie.
If you follow the tweet. Um, it is, uh,

135
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,270
by Dr Deborah. So, and uh, it is, um,

136
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,950
uh, article, uh, from the National
Institute of Health Study,

137
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,630
Dr Zero van meter, a pediatric. Oh, okay.

138
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,490
Oh, well, she's anti all this.

139
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,450
They don't give any leeway to Asians.
I,

140
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:59,720
it's the minority group that they
actually get more crap. It's like, well,

141
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,030
you're up. You have to be better than
everyone to get into a good college,

142
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,590
to just so many. Really good
ones. Okay. A doctor, Q van meter,

143
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:10,730
a pediatric endocrinologist with
extensive experience in gender dysphoria,

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,880
which by the way is hate speech says
there is 0.0 evidence that the concepts of

145
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:21,840
gender fluidity and gender identity
have any scientific basis. Yeah. So um,

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,150
this is why she includes 0.0
that's the second zero there.

147
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,300
She's money thinking about cash.
Does it mean anything?

148
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,820
She's thinking about cash money.
Well,

149
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:36,350
I guess you could have 0.01% you could
have one 100 she wanted to make sure

150
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,810
there's no doubt. Yeah, she
started in those extra characters.

151
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,360
You've just got your house Bro.
She's very,

152
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:45,080
the extra two 40 characters
you say like hate speech,

153
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,010
gender dysphoria is still in the DSM
five the actual like the psychiatric

154
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,390
journal and the use of reference book,

155
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,730
but they literally call it
hate speech now. Yeah, I know,

156
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,370
but it's the actual medical condition.
What's crazy that undercover,

157
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,211
God bless my wife,

158
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,700
she went with us because we need other
people to have hidden cameras and so she

159
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:04,110
posed as a lesbian movie kind of lesbian.
You're like, really? You exist and like,

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,720
Eh, she's taking even how the fool
they were, they couldn't say anything.

161
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,190
Well she remember said like
I feel I identify as someone
with bigger breasts and

162
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,740
she was asking how to get
this covered under Medicare,

163
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,530
medicaid cause they were talking about
getting all these operations and in Mr

164
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:21,110
Rec, God bless him Dr. Brooks, but I
think we should mention that, you know,

165
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,650
talk about that.
Gender dysphoria.

166
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:26,370
So for her they use gender dysphoria
to try and file it medically to get new

167
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,710
tickets on the taxpayer dime.

168
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,740
But it's considered hate speech to say
it to the train and the transgenders in

169
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,640
the room.
It's just crazy.

170
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,920
Like you can't make sense of it and
I don't need to make sense of it.

171
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,860
I just need to not be banned for dot.
Want to be the woman she was meant to be.

172
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,980
Right. Well I mean anything
that you can mock is bullshit.

173
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,860
I mean if you can mock it that openly,
if that's that obvious,

174
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:47,940
like getting the point of getting bigger
tits because you identify as someone

175
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,570
with bigger tits. I mean that's
bullshit. That's why it's so funny.

176
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,510
I've don't think I've ever been more in
love with my wife then when she did that,

177
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,430
I wouldn't expect that
she's looking at me.

178
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,450
She kind of not identified as
someone who has bigger breasts. Well,

179
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,130
did you see that guy that got busted,
uh,

180
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,610
molesting children and said he
identifies it being a six year old boy,

181
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,100
that was a really recent case.
I mean,

182
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:11,160
people are trying this out when
they get caught doing things,

183
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,130
and I'm not saying that there's not people
out there that identify with being a

184
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,160
man when they're actually a woman or
vice versa. That's not what I'm saying,

185
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,750
but what I'm saying is there's all a lot
of fucking crazy people out there a lot.

186
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:26,310
And to deny that and just because it's
dealing with gender, you're, you're in.

187
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:31,110
We're in Narnia now. We're in Lala land.
You're, you're not being real. No. Well,

188
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:33,720
let me, let me ask you this, because like
you said, you're, you're not right wing.

189
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,160
I'm pretty open about the
fact that I'm right wing.

190
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,930
I remember watching your show a while
back and you had a little little guy,

191
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,620
little guy, Jamie Kelsey,
a buck, buck angel. Yeah.

192
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,680
Little guy that used to be
a gal. Yes. Yeah, exactly.

193
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,180
And then I don't know what I said,

194
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,620
but at the same kind of
conversation we have here,

195
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:51,240
like I don't just go out and look
at the school, you you're training.

196
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,140
I said why don't I just
don't buy it. And he, he,

197
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,340
he wanted to get into a fight with me.
You wanted to have a fight.

198
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,700
Let's fight him out of this. This was
years ago when you had a fresh shot,

199
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,500
a test jacked. But you know it's
huge at one time. Oh was he?

200
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,071
Oh yeah.

201
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:10,071
It got up to like one 85 like super jacked
cause just banging test in there and

202
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,370
fucking lifting.

203
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,390
But he was saying that his joints hurt
really bad when he was doing that.

204
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,610
It's almost like, it's
unnatural, so crazy.

205
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:23,060
But back then when you get them on jacked
jacked and I had a role with that guy,

206
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:28,100
I'd be like fuck it. Go. No, come on.
And you wouldn't have problem with that.

207
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,350
That'd be kind of, yes. Yes,
exactly what the point is back then.

208
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:33,240
Let me ask you this. Did you
realize it was gonna get us insane?

209
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:36,090
Like where did you just
think of the tunnel? This is
an interesting guest. Well,

210
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:39,780
he's a nice guy and you know, I, I'm
more than willing to call him a man.

211
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,140
And that was one of the things
that I said. I said, look
man, you're a person, um,

212
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,060
who, whatever your name is with its
buck or Fred or Wilma, I don't care.

213
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,310
I just,
whatever you want to be called,

214
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:55,310
I'll call you whatever noise that you
connect with you as a being. Yeah,

215
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,163
I'm fine with that.

216
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,610
And if you can explain to me where
you feel happier being a man,

217
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,500
I'm 100% in support of you doing that.

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,450
What drives me crazy is people
making decisions for six year olds,

219
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,000
people pushing six year
olds in certain directions.

220
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,460
And I know that this does happen.
I know and I,

221
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,310
I can't get too personal about this,

222
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,460
but I have a friend who has an ex wife
that turned his child into a girl.

223
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,510
Yeah. And, and like tried this and was,

224
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:30,160
was pushing this and kids
are very fucking pliable man.

225
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,750
This is not,

226
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,440
I mean maybe some boys would have rejected
it and maybe he was leaning that way

227
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,530
anyway, but she was excited
about it. And this is,

228
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,540
this is something that a lot
of people are excited. I mean,

229
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,970
we're talking about a 14 year old,
I mean,

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,610
I just don't think you
know who the fuck you are.

231
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,250
You know what is that girl's
name? Ruby rose. Is that her name?

232
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,530
The attractive a lesbian with the tattoos.

233
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,890
She said that when she was young she
wanted to transition and she's very happy

234
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:58,960
that she didn't, she wanted to become a
man and she's very happy that she didn't.

235
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:02,230
And she's a lesbian and she's happy
and she's open and super successful.

236
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,530
But she's advocating the sorta
the same thing that I'm saying.

237
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:09,310
It's like let people become a God
damn adult and then make these in,

238
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,410
in alterable life.
Changing decisions.

239
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:16,330
This guy saying that hormone blockers
can be turned off and then you could go

240
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:20,800
through a normal puberty.
You're out of your fucking
mind. Right. I'm not a doctor,

241
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,160
but I have enough understanding of
biology to know that. That's crazy.

242
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,800
That's just not true. No,
it's absolutely not true.

243
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,380
And that's one of those things is,
listen,

244
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,600
anyone can get lost in the weeds
and make someone look stupid.

245
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,800
Something specific, you know,
whether it's, it's, I mean,

246
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,260
you were showing me that compound
both there. It's fascinating.

247
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,540
I don't know anything about it.
I'm going to be a moron. You know,

248
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,860
less than room temperature Iq.

249
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,550
Some doctor can come in
who's pro transgender and
explain something and make it

250
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,120
sound like we don't know
what we're talking about. So
when it comes to that, see,

251
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,400
I don't, I don't agree with
you there. Well, I don't
agree with you on their terms.

252
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:49,840
We wouldn't know. Right? Doesn't matter.

253
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,590
What terms are there that you don't know
about a child's biological development?

254
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,650
Well they,
what they point to the,

255
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,670
well actually there are these studies
that showed up the, you know, the, uh,

256
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,390
the brain alterations occur before,
across a hormone sex replacement therapy.

257
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:04,270
And it's actually, it's not true. So we
had a few transgender people on our show,

258
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,240
but the point is with these, whether it's
a conspiracy or, or that you'd say, okay,

259
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm not a doctor,
but I can't just appeal to authority.

260
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,370
I can't just say this doctor says x.

261
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,810
So I do have to at this point accepting
that I'm not a doctor except the

262
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:20,110
preponderance of evidence from
the overall medical community.

263
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,110
And combine that with the
anecdotal and combined that with,

264
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,660
is there a motive here?
Is there an agenda here?

265
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,260
Like a lot of conspiracy theories and
just doesn't add up because who benefits

266
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:33,160
from telling you, you know, the
world is flat, who benefits from it?

267
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,670
Now I can understand how someone might
benefit from a conspiracy was like, oh,

268
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,080
they make a lot of money off of this.

269
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,260
Or was it Tim Kennedy as a hunting Hitler
thing? I'm not saying it, but it's like,

270
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:41,831
okay,
I understand.

271
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:45,250
After a war they thought maybe they had
Hitler and they needed the healing for

272
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,450
the country. Go, okay, I can understand
that. But with this, there's, there's,

273
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,960
it just doesn't add up to none
of the arguments they at ups for

274
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,000
millennial parents to whack off turning
the age of their children to social

275
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:56,960
experiments.
It's

276
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:07,650
okay.
