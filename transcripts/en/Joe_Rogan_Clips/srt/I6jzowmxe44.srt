1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,560
I,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,210
I'm a fan of the best fighters in the
world getting together and whatever we

3
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,240
have to do to facilitate that,
that's what I want to see happen.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,850
You know what I mean? I, you know,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,610
I just think that there's gotta be a way
to make this happen. There's got to be,

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,660
what are you talking about here?
Yo Mother fucker. Hey Man. I mean,

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,290
I'm just, I'm, I'm going,
going day by day, you know,

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,700
I'm enjoying the process. I mean we, we're
in talks right now. Things are going,

9
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,000
things are going smoothly,
things are going, things are
moving forward. We'll see.

10
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:33,870
Uh, we'll see what happens. I mean,

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,100
I know you have to say all this to say
all that. No, I mean that's, but that,

12
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,840
that is true. I mean, I want to fight
the best guys in the world and know, oh,

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,400
there's not a day. There isn't a day that
goes by that I don't get, I mean shoot,

14
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:49,230
you posted that thing this morning and
there was 287 likes and 30 or comments

15
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:53,010
and, and you know, five minutes
and it was all like, finally, hey,

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,730
when are you going to go?

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,280
When do you guys like I and
I get that every single day.

18
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,980
So there's not a day that goes by that,
that I don't,

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,480
it doesn't get talked
about or thought about.

20
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,630
But especially after anyone over there
became the champion. Yeah. Right.

21
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,680
And everybody knows about,

22
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,380
I mean that's one of the things that I
talked about when Eddie first came over

23
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,870
to the UFC was go,
I was telling people,

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,680
go watch the wars that he
had with Michael Chandler.

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,120
And then I've said that also too,

26
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:17,400
when I've seen you coaching people or
being in someone's corner, I'm like,

27
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,710
that right there is one of the best
lightweights in the planet. Yeah.

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,830
And I just really would love to see you.
I mean,

29
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:27,100
I don't want to undercut Beltour. I don't
want it to bell toward, you know, no,

30
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,350
I mean it's at the end of the
day, I mean there's, there's,

31
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,800
it's a competition between the two.
You know, the two organizations,

32
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,500
there's guys in both organizations that
are great, like you said, Lima and,

33
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,360
and all these guys course correct
off. I mean there's, you know,

34
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,680
and the pit bull brothers or whatever.
I mean there's,

35
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,410
there's some great talent in both
[inaudible] and you saw it back in the day

36
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:48,060
with Strikeforce and now all of a sudden
a lot of these Strikeforce guys are,

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,250
you know, UFC champions as well, you
know, so it's kind of interesting,

38
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:55,130
weird the way fighting is today
as opposed to the way boxing.

39
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,220
It's like a perfect example is like,

40
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,800
like the Gennady Golovkin
fight this weekend. You know,

41
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,180
we went to see him and you know,
you go to your,

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,800
you're basically going to see one
of the best boxers on the planet.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,310
You're not going to see him because he's,
you know,

44
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,860
the fucking WBC guy or
the IBF guy or the Wbo.

45
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,450
Oh yeah. People don't really give a
shit about that. He's a world champion,

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,250
but the the war, the one, but it's
versus Bella tour versus the UFC.

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,870
It's a big difference in
the way people look at it.

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,220
Like the average public,

49
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,990
the people don't give a shit if you're
the WBA champion in boxing or the WBC

50
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:36,080
champion, they don't give a
shit. They just want to know
who's a bad motherfucker.

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,090
Like is it,
you know,

52
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:41,840
is it Deontay wilder is an Anthony Joshua
who these are heavyweight champions.

53
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,360
Let's see him fight.
They don't look at it that way.

54
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:48,350
When it comes to Bella tour in the UFC.
I don't know why I have my,

55
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,880
my speculation is first of all,

56
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,460
because UFC has been around
forever and it's like the NFL,

57
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,710
it has that name value tips and they've
done a good job of building the name

58
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:01,740
value. It's also a really good name.
Yeah, UFC is a great name. Bella.

59
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:05,850
Tor is a shitty man. It just is.
It's just, you know, you go to the,

60
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,250
the average person like, oh, I'm going to
watch Bella tour tonight. They're like,

61
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,340
the fuck is up to her.
They don't know what a Bella Torres,

62
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,960
but ultimate fighting championship
makes sense. It makes sense.

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,900
I just wanted to just call it
paramount MMA, I think. Uh, yeah.

64
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,100
I mean I think there,

65
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:25,030
I mean there was all kinds of new branding
going on with the whole new paramount

66
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,400
stuff and all that kind of stuff.
I mean there,

67
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,620
if there was ever a time it would have
been now, but I mean, I think they're,

68
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,110
they're stuck to it. They like it. I
mean it's kind of one of them things.

69
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,200
They should get their money back from
spike Lee and when they had a pay spike

70
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:39,790
Lee, did they? Yeah, they paid them
off. He was crazy. No, he was sued.

71
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,210
He sued them. He said that you stole
the name from me and they're like,

72
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,140
what the fuck is basically just one of
those frivolous lawsuits that you have to

73
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,980
settle and they fine take bike wanting
some cactus Gash, take this money.

74
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,230
I want to how much they gave him. How
much do you think they gave him? Let's,

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,650
let's say, guess how much you think
they gave Spike Lee? 3.2 million.

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,470
Really that much? No, I don't
know. I made that a million.

77
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,690
If they have to give him a million,
I bet they gave him a meal.

78
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,330
I bet you're right.
I'm going to go with 1.2 I'm going to,

79
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm going to be in the middle.

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,770
I'm going to be the middle
guy and see how much the guy,

81
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,540
do you think they disclosed it?
You think? Yeah, he did. He did.

82
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,020
He like actually trademark spike TV and
like someday he might actually have his

83
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:18,900
own TV channel type of
his, his thought was, well,

84
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:21,300
what about Spike Jones? Is he like,
where's my fucking money? Yeah.

85
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,090
I think he just was felt like his name
was so not like the named spike was

86
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,240
synonymous with him. I don't know. No.
