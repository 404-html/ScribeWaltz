1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,160
Her low freak bitches. It's like
there's no, there's no respect for like,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,590
like what we have, how much different, how
much higher standard of living we live.

3
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:12,660
Then the vast, you know, uh,

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,950
most humans that are alive today and the
vast majority of humans who have ever

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,750
existed. I mean, it's like, what is, I get
this from a Jordan Peterson lecture, uh,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,250
but he said, uh, it was an 1895.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,390
The average American lived on a dollar
a day adjusted for modern inflation.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,730
So in 1895, you know, it's like,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,970
like central Asia level poverty in
America and that's just everyone.

10
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,660
Before that living in backbreaking
poverty was like just life.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,500
That was just all of life. And it's like
we figured something out in these last,

12
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,420
uh, uh, less than 200 years, you know,

13
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,460
like we figured something out
a little more than 200 years.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,410
We've figured something out. Wait, what
am I saying? No, no, no, let's listen.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,030
200 years.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,750
We've figured something out
in this industrial revolution
that like now lets us

17
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,210
live up here on this end.
It's like, we can lose that.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,630
And a lot of it has to do with freedom,
but the whole thing to me is freedom.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,030
The whole thing is that we
embrace, look, if you look in
in the year, um, uh, and uh,

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,100
that you had on your show,
Thaddeus Russell, who's great,

21
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,340
I just did his podcast recently and
he put it this way, uh, where he goes,

22
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,600
you know,
in the year 1800,

23
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,990
cause I was talking about
what an incredible thing
the 19th century was and how

24
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,720
it transformed humanity.
And he goes to the,

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,380
in the year 1800 Americans are all making
their own clothes in the year 1900.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,300
Uh, Americans are shopping
at Macy's. Like we,

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,570
if you had said in the year, you know,
in the year 1845 and been like, dude,

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,400
in the next 65 years,

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,580
slavery is going to be abolished in
the West and we're going to have an

30
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,740
industrial revolution.
You know,

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,950
it's like magic happen and that's
why we live the way we live today.

32
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,660
And no one is even interested
in that story, right?

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,220
Like why do we have this much wealth?
I like what you said.

34
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,310
I think it's all about freedom and when
you have a guy like Bernie Sanders who

35
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,470
harps on and on about income inequality,

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,370
I have a real issue with that because
it's one of those blanket statements that

37
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,380
sounds really good at a campaign speech,

38
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:02,700
but freedom itself breeds
income inequality. Yes,

39
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,950
because freedom means you
can do whatever you want.

40
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:07,950
You can do very little or you
can work like a maniac. Well,

41
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:10,860
if you're going to work, like if
you're, if here's the game, okay,

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,490
you do something for that.
Something. You get currency,

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,410
you use that currency to buy things or
to make sure you don't have to work again

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,180
by food and goods and take trips
and travel. The more you work,

45
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,270
the more you decide that you
want to pursue something,

46
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:30,780
the more chances you have to acquire
their currency. If you do it correctly.

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,320
That is income inequality due to freedom.

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,420
I mean take away all the other factors
that might be, you know, in play,

49
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,760
whether it's racial discrimination
or sexual discrimination.

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,530
I'm not denying that those things exist.

51
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,630
But what I am saying is that the idea
that you are going to have income equality

52
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:52,110
in a capitalist society where anybody
could do whenever they want, you know,

53
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:56,910
people that is so counter to what we
know about human behavior. This is,

54
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,530
you're talking about a
fantasy person who exist,

55
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,040
who has motivations outside of
wealth outside of, uh, you know,

56
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,540
that most people want some sort
of reward for what they do.

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,430
And if everybody gets the same amount,

58
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,340
there's no fucking reward
for working extra hard.

59
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
And that's going to where you're
not going to get Microsoft,

60
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,410
you're not going to get IBM. It's
going to get just, I mean, it's not,

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,760
it's not just, I mean they
talk about fairness a lot,
which is a strange concept,

62
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,760
but it's not just that somebody works
twice as hard and doesn't get more,

63
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:27,010
I mean that's, that that's not
the right thing to do anyway.

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,180
But like what you were saying,

65
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:30,460
and I just think it's like
they use the term so much,

66
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,620
but what's misleading about it?
You're absolutely right,

67
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,390
that freedom breeds inequality.

68
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,470
But what's misleading about it is that
people think like the poor get poorer.

69
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,770
And that is objective. That is a,
a you like objective lead false,

70
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,840
demonstrably false.
It's not that, you know,

71
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,780
they make it out like the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer like that old

72
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,940
saying, but it's like that, you know,

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,490
if you think it through like that
can't really continue like that. No,

74
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,960
but the poor guy was going to have rich.

75
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,961
But if the poor work hard and figure they
haven't possibility to escape whatever

76
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:00,250
economic situation they're in,

77
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:05,200
it is possible with freedom and
homeless people here live better than,

78
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,710
than rich people in Third World countries
or I'm certainly at least better than

79
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:11,140
average people in third world
countries. Uh, so it's like,

80
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,550
it's not just that the inequality grows,

81
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:15,730
it's like everything moves up
and the inequality grows up here.

82
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,750
And this is like what I just, what
I can't understand. And, and again,

83
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,590
it's like why I was saying before,

84
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:24,910
like if you have any concept of the fact
that we're by far the richest freest

85
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,430
human beings who have ever
existed in recorded human history,

86
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,940
at least recorded human history. Who
knows what is going on in ancient Egypt,

87
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:33,400
but like a pro before in Geneva.
But uh,

88
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,300
but if you realize that we have this
incredible amount, then it's like, yeah,

89
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,860
it's like just being like,
oh,

90
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,850
we need all of these policies to like
give handouts to poor people. It's like,

91
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,851
well actually let's continue this train
of getting richer and richer and richer,

92
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,210
which is not at all, you know, like what,
what people like Bernie Sanders, man.

93
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:55,580
It's like, well, it's a hustle.
Bernie's got a hustle going on. Yeah.

94
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:56,790
And just find out a shell.

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,980
So you find out it's a hustle when you
find out he's got a bunch of houses and

96
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,940
his wife tried to buy up all this fucking
land to expand a university that she

97
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:07,120
was running and she killed the
whole fucking school. Like you.

98
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,080
How about the fact that the motherfucker
and we haven't seen, so first off he,

99
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,350
he made $1 million off a book on how it's
wrong to be a millionaire. I mean it's,

100
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:16,410
it's like how are you not,

101
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,020
how can anyone look at you like as
a serious leader when you did that?

102
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,720
So you know saying what people want
to hear and there is something,

103
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,490
some truth to some of the
things that he's saying.

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,930
I think that the world would be a better
place if we had more social programs in

105
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,810
place. I think the world be a better place
if college were free. If we, I think,

106
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,940
I mean I don't disagree with
like the thought behind that.

107
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,150
I think that all of these things
would be better suited in voluntary

108
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,310
arrangements then some
force government monopoly.

109
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,750
But I do agree with you that like sure.

110
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,140
I'd like great schools to be very
affordable or free if possible.

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,710
I'd like everyone to be [inaudible] and
Bernie Sanders certainly addressed some

112
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:53,950
very real problems. Like he would
point things out that were very real.

113
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,830
Like he would be like, you know, they
claim it's a great recovery, but you know,

114
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:59,540
90% of the new wealth has
gone to the top 3%. You know,

115
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,880
like he eat up some points.

116
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,130
I only do one or two and that has to
apply to every New York Jew who's out

117
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,500
there. Uh, but like,
so like there is some,

118
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,870
and I don't care if Bernie
Sanders makes $1 million,

119
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,640
but there is something like number one,

120
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,330
making $1 million while claiming it's
kind of a moral issue that some people

121
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,930
have so much. What others have so bad.
All Endorsing Hillary Clinton. I mean,

122
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,270
I just don't know how you can,
how you can look at the guy who goes,

123
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,440
the problem is incoming inequality
and these [inaudible] and the banking,

124
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,860
you know, cartel. But I'm going to vote
for the candidate of the big banks.

125
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,490
Like to me that's, that's
insane. It, it would,

126
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,210
to me it would be if Ron
Paul endorsed McCain.

127
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,500
Well don't you think the big banks sort
of were on both teams? Yeah, well not,

128
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,270
I don't know if they were on Trump's team,
but they've certainly been on.

129
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:48,810
Every other team decides that now. Yeah.
Yeah. No, certainly. I'm absolutely,

130
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,280
it's only like the team. They
run the Treasury Department
in the Federal Reserve,

131
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,420
like they run the whole system,

132
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,810
but the fact that Bernie Sanders never
had like a fiery speech about what

133
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:01,640
happened at the DNC about
how they literally conspired
to ruin him and to take

134
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,320
him out of the race with
Hillary because they,

135
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,510
the DNC wanted Hillary
to be the candidate.

136
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:15,620
Okay.
