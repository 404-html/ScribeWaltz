1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,390
The rumble. Johnson fight was a
tough one for you to swallow too,

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,720
because it was in Stockholm.
It was this enormous event.

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,830
Everybody was there to see you.
And I'm in that fight.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,580
We didn't pick it up while the fight was
going on. But you guys collided heads.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,250
Yeah. Yeah. It was a
head. But yeah, I'm not,

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,140
I'm not taking anything away
from Anthony Johnson hit.

7
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:23,230
That guy is a beast and he hits a hot,
he's one of the hardest hit her in the,

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,820
in the no fucking sport. No doubt. I mean,
no one's taking anything away from him.

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,120
He's truly exceptional. But the thing
is, I would throwing my, my, my,

10
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:35,121
my kick there and he just came in
there and he's forehead hit my,

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,410
my chin. Yeah. And from, and
I just, I just blacked out.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,460
I didn't, I went down, I went up again. I
was in the Ma, I was in the match again.

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,420
He just, you know, we need to get a
taste of blood. He just goes for it.

14
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:52,200
And I should just keep my guard
up. I'm, I'm very like this. Right.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,240
And I'm very lengthy and he just
caught me as I'm doing all that. Well,

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,160
this is not one of those situations
where until you've been there and you,

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,040
you been that hurt in a big fight
like that. It's like the experiences,

18
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,730
it's an alien experience.
It is. It is. It's, it's,

19
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:12,930
you don't recognize any of it.
It's like you can't,

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,590
nothing controls your mind
trying to control your legs,

21
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:21,220
your arms like this and that. But it was
just, I was just disoriented and man,

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,130
it was four in the morning in
one of the big stadium in Sweden,

23
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:29,940
four in the morning. We fill it
up, we fill it up, and it's huge.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,520
It was huge, man. And, and, and, uh, and
like I said, four in the morning, I do,

25
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,150
you know, when the people told me like,
oh, we're going to do this. I'm like, no,

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,700
he's not gonna. It's not gonna happen. How
should we manage to fill this place up?

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,370
Right.
But still people went there to see it.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,380
It was just amazing
feeling stepping out there.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,270
Well for people that don't
understand why they did it,

30
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,630
to coordinate it with American
paper view. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,060
So yeah, that was it. That was
it. Yeah. It was rough, man.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,260
It was a rough loss.

33
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:00,720
And now rumble just decided he
doesn't want to fight anymore,

34
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,750
which is kind of crazy. Yeah. Every
now and then he thinks about it.

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,090
He says he wants to come back
as a heavyweight, Huh? Yeah.

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,810
I don't think he was even going
to make it to light heavy anymore.

37
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,710
Now he's suspicious.
I've seen,

38
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,000
it's so crazy to think that
that guy fought at one 70
at one point in his career.

39
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,700
I can't even, I can't even,
I can't even see that. Now.

40
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,340
I can understand how even did it,
I mean, it's just such a mess.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,870
His neck is like the size of his
head and he has no small head.

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,640
He has like this big round head and neck
is the size of his head. So he's now,

43
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,240
he's a big guy. I really, big guy.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,520
I ran into him once while
he was fighting one 70. Uh,

45
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,460
he was in the lobby of a hotel. I
came downstairs and I go, Anthony,

46
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,230
how much do you weigh? And he's
laughing. He's like, dude, 30 I was like,

47
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:48,020
two 30 you weighed two 30 you got it.
That makes my week.

48
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:51,370
I they see, I'm telling
them, I mixed my wake at my,

49
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,690
it makes my week at easy. I'm
not, his weight cut was horrific.

50
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:58,500
He used to his whole, his cheeks, she's
just sucking. He has prominent cheekbones.

51
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:03,280
Right. So like when his weight
cut was fully dehydrated,

52
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:07,020
when his body was like, really? It
was like horrible. It was like, look,

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,430
go a skeleton. Oh Shit. It's like, man,

54
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,030
that's an echo for you had all missed
wait a bunch of times to, no, no.

55
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,030
I'm going up to like takeaways.

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,500
He's probably the best thing he's ever
done in his career. I agree. Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:20,620
I was Kinda stunned when he decided to
retire, but what he said was interesting.

58
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:24,250
He said, uh, I'm not a fighter.
He goes, I'm an athlete. He goes,

59
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm just really good at fighting.
How does it, I don't like fighting.

60
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,710
I don't know if that's correct though.
I would say more like,

61
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,170
I like it like a fighter, you
know, he's a great athlete, but,

62
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,630
but I see him more like a, like a
hardcore fighter. I don't, you know,

63
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,540
we are all athletes doing this, but, but
he's more like the fighter, you know,

64
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,230
Phil Davis is, he's an athlete. He's an
athlete. But this guy, he's just like,

65
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,580
it's a fireman.
I'm telling you.
