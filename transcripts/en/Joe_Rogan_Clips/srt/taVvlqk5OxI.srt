1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,340
Weed is tricky in Texas
though, right? Yeah. It's not
legal yet. It's going to be,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,840
um, in California though.
That's right here.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,630
I got that Elan Musk trouble.
We'd, what is that? This is a,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,220
this is what's called a,
a blunt

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,020
tobacco on the outside and marijuana on
the inside and nurtured or car shit at

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,280
drop. Tesla's stock 6% one day. Oh My, uh,

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,320
my manager in PR person out there.

8
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:35,630
I just literally shitting their pants
right now. But it's legal. Well,

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:40,680
it's legal here, right? Yeah.
There you go. I believe in the law.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,560
It's a hundred percent legal.
Here

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,190
it is on a percent. Who's
the dude that, um, oh,

12
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:54,930
Mike Tyson just brought you something.
His wheat. Is that how it comes?

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,020
This is the box of death
and life right here. Well,

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,150
Mike Tyson's box of death
and life. Yeah. Look at this.

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,280
This is how hard Mike Tyson roles look
at the sides of these fucking joints he

16
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:08,490
gave me. I know the camera's
not gonna be able to follow me,

17
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:12,480
but I'll be right back. Ladies
and gentlemen, look at this shit.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,350
Look at the fucking size.

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,670
Oh, that's just insane.
That's to you, bro.

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,540
I can't tell you that I can't
take it away on the plane.

21
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,180
How do I get on the plane?

22
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:34,560
Then you just think thinking
you'll appear at the seat. Foresee.

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,223
That's the key.

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,390
I would recommend any meaning more
than that for me. All right, Jamie,

25
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:45,140
we'll take one more.
Yeah.

26
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,870
He gave me these joints that would make
you think about people you fingered in

27
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:52,140
high school and want to find
my Facebook and apologize.

28
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,080
This is just, what is that?
That's a goddamn cigar of
marijuana. That's outrageous.
