1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
I did and like I told you, I'm not going
anywhere else no more in Los Angeles.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,980
I'm going back to the store,
no improv science spots,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,340
especially after I shot the
Netflix special and everything.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,660
It all came to me after that, that 10
years and especially after she died.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,523
You know how people,

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,710
you ever go to like an acting class
and people refer to Stanislavski.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,673
I don't know all this shit.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,740
10 years from now people are going to be
referring to the Mitzi short technique.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,640
There was something that every car I
was talking with a dunk and it by it.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,840
I talked to Ari about it.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,370
I know she said something to us at
one point that we were like, wow,

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,740
something I remember

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,280
who is Thomas on my podcast that there
was a times she didn't like you doing

14
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:44,890
that in the cobit and the mass
swing.

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,260
Let me do it in the main room in the
original. How fucking crazy as that.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,730
That's to show you how genius in
a way, like she was like, Joe,

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,710
you could light yourself on fire. And
they originally, I don't give a fuck,

18
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,460
but in the main room you can't do
that because you're killing my room.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Like the comics afterwards
just could not follow it.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,590
Like they could just not
follow that lesson right there.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,960
That was about it was brilliant,
but it think about it.

22
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,370
There's no good versions of that bit
anywhere. This one version than I did.

23
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,630
That's up on you.
It's terrible.

24
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,100
It's a terrible version that there's
no solid versions of that pit.

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,340
But that bit was right when that guy died.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,340
J Howard Marshall and myself that him
getting Anna Nicole Smith to do shit to

27
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:36,310
him before he died. Father,
she's trying to take your money.

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,060
I don't give a fuck. I want to get
my boss' leg or something like that.

29
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:40,841
The crazy bit.

30
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:44,350
But Mitzi didn't like it too because she
didn't like bits that were making fun

31
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:48,260
of old people cause you know,
her health was deteriorating till she,

32
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:50,250
there was a couple of bits of it.
She didn't like

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,560
fucking picture him.

34
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,110
He's a million years old and she's hot
as the sun and she's sitting on his lap.

35
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,110
Look at him. Look at the smile on his
face. Dog. Yeah. Oh Man. I loved him.

36
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,660
I loved that whole scene.
I loved what it was.

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,830
I loved it because it was so blatant.
You know? It was just so blatant.

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,190
But she didn't like that bit. She
didn't like the Hugh Hefner bid either.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
She didn't like that bit.

40
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,410
When you have to told those really
good and she's kissing them. Oh,

41
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,970
I Jesus Christ.
Oh,

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,900
he's in a wheelchair where
she's married him. I mean,

43
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,920
it was a damn classic that, that, that,

44
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,340
that scene of him and her getting married.

45
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,760
She's so young and so hot and he's so old,

46
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:41,080
wrecked and rich as fuck in a wheelchair.
It's such a classic scenario.

47
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,510
It was so good call though.
Kentucky Fried Hookah.

48
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,210
I had him card, Kentucky Fried. If
she wanted that money, she had it.

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,600
She had to keep doing shit.
That shit.

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,610
He's calling father.
That's awesome. This like,

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,670
it's time to lick my

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,690
it's time. Yeah, man.

53
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,930
I just love the fact that that guy
was that wealthy and yet still,

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,280
I mean,
I guess when you're that well,

55
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:23,050
was he born at that time
more than a billion dollars?
Yeah. He was a billionaire.

56
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,130
He was an oil magnate, right? Wasn't he?

57
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,560
I don't think she got the money though.
I think the kids fought her

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,570
hundred Maillian what?
That's peanuts. Yeah,

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,650
it got hot dog and Nicole Smith's daughter
is now the fourth richest woman in

60
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:50,370
the u s it's what? Oh, I know.

61
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:54,930
It says 37 billion now let's Koch,
Koch brothers.

62
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,520
Oh, I see. I see. He was
69th on the list. Ah,

63
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,390
but fourth richest woman. Do you know,
out of the richest women in the world,

64
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,660
Google the richest women in the world,
like where they got their money from?

65
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,720
It's rough.
It's rough out there guys.

66
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,710
They ain't fucking starting
businesses that Mary had. Dummies.

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,920
Really? Is that how it goes? Divorced?

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,990
Almost all of its divorce money.
