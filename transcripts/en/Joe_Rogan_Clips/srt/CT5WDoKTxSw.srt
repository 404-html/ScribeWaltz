00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,970
Hello Freak bitches. Well, it becomes
a thing like with Floyd Mayweather,

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,750
you know,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,250
like a big thing about Floyd Mayweather
is how much money he makes is not just

4
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:15,170
that he's a great boxer.
It's that he's going to make $300 million.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,270
Apparently it's gonna be even more than
that. And you see the paper view numbers,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,070
they're talking about 6.5
million paper view bys. Wow.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,870
So it's more than 2 million more than
the Manny Pacquiao fight. That's insane.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,340
Does that include the re
potential refunds? Did they
that's good question. Well,

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,810
to be fair, he did nickname of self
money Mayweather. Well, he did.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,610
He was pretty boy Floyd. He
changed it, but yeah. Then
he built the persona around,

11
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,770
I spend money he doesn't have to do.
I mean it is cool and good for him,

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,220
but he did make a big thing about spitting
money that one time he showed up like

13
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:57,090
a hundred million dollar check
was so stupid. I'm like, wait,

14
00:00:57,091 --> 00:01:00,090
why is that on like a regular ass check?
Yeah.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,060
She was just like in a
regular chase bank check.

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,340
It wasn't even a big cardboard one.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,970
Nate even net or print it
out or print it out on a,

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,740
or even a wire or something. I wouldn't
get that wire. Yeah, laminate that thing.

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,670
I think that's real. He's really
holding on to a $100 million check,

20
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:22,671
but it was just a regular ass check that
you would buy groceries on in eighties

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,820
yeah. Yeah. That 100 million. Yeah.

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,960
I guess he wrote it to himself. So it's
made with it promotions. General artists.

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,900
Yeah. Yeah. You got 100 million
in a bank of America, I guess so.

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,990
It seems like he just holds onto
it too. Hey, he doesn't catch it.

25
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,830
That's a weird out of his book bag at one
of the, uh, yeah, I saw it, but I mean,

26
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,050
why is he hanging on to that?
Why does it,

27
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,050
but you should probably catch
that in his other account anyways,

28
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,460
this Mayweather promotions account.

29
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,730
Who cares instead of bay where the
personal account, the checking.

30
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,560
So he's probably gonna make more than
$300 million from this last fight.

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,580
Sure. Yeah. Amazing.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,890
I can't imagine that
they won't do that again.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,930
That him and Connor won't do it again
with a wet finger if he kind of can figure

34
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:11,130
out how to not get tired.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,470
If he could convince people like say
if he fights Paulie Malignaggi he's in.

36
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:22,080
That beats the shit out of
Paulie Malignaggi and then
says Freud do it one more

37
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:26,700
fucking time. And I think
Floyd, Nah man, come on.

38
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,140
We did that.
Oh I know.

39
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,790
He starts thinking about
that and money could bro,

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,920
if you can figure out a way to
get people excited about it,

41
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,710
Connor could get somehow,

42
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,650
somehow or another get more people
to pay attention because it was an

43
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,800
interesting fight for the first
three or four rounds. It's made it,

44
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,870
he made it look interesting,
but it really wasn't interesting.

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,200
I thought it was interesting, but then
when I thought back it wasn't interesting.

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,970
Well he caught point clean.
You know,

47
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,650
he caught him with an
uppercut in the first round.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,870
Nobody hits Floyd clean like that. Lloyd
underestimated in my thoughts. So wasn't,

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,920
he wasn't doing that shoulder roll.
No, he was. Cause he wanted to,

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,690
he didn't believe in kindness pops.

51
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,691
So Floyd usually boxes and you think
that's what it is when you always see him

52
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,020
boxing that like he box
Canelo and he does that and,

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,240
and he goes off of that counter.
I don't think that's what it was.

54
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,640
I think he knew the Conner was going
to get tired if he was backing up.

55
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,610
You know that Connor has an
endurance problems and uh,

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,110
as long as he wasn't throwing a
lot of punches, which Floyd wasn't,

57
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,920
and he's constantly faking and moving,
he's got kind of backing up. He could be,

58
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,580
it's way easier to be defensive
if you're not being offensive.

59
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,800
So if you're not thinking
about hitting the guy,

60
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,890
if you're constantly like fainting and
you got your hands up and you're moving

61
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:41,440
forward, but really what you're
thinking about is what he's throwing,

62
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,410
you can get away with a lot and you're,

63
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:46,360
you can press forward a lot more because
you're going to see the punches coming.

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,240
Cause you're not really thinking too much
about throwing your own punches unless

65
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,480
he's like a clear wide opening.
So for the first couple of rounds,

66
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,060
he's mostly like putting pressure on them,
sizing.

67
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,580
And Mom when I watched it after the fight,

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,100
it became way more obvious like why
you're watching it. You're like,

69
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,680
what's going to happen? What's going
to happen once you already know what's,

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,950
what's happened? Then uh, then
I watched it and I said, oh,

71
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:08,230
I could see exactly what he's doing.
He's fainting,

72
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,530
putting a lot of pressure on Conor
and he's making kind of backup a lot,

73
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:15,910
which is exhausting.
And then also kinda is not very efficient.

74
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,330
He's not a boxer. So like there's a
lot of energy being wasted. Like he,

75
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,030
he's going to get tired more
easily and then he doesn't run.

76
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,880
So he doesn't have the same kind of
endurance of Floyd has. It's a lot,

77
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,890
a lot of factors in there.
Yeah. It was a Honda 11 punches,

78
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:31,680
but some of them were like, yeah,
all the ones that Connor landed.

79
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,870
You mean it was a few of them that were
like little [inaudible] yeah. Yeah.

80
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,670
There were also like
weird ones like patty,

81
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,810
patty peck punches to the side of the
head. They in the back of the head.

82
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,990
This is one meme that it sells is kind
of this and it just says fuck this box

83
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,980
and shit. Well, you know,
you get used to that in MMA.

84
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:55,700
You know you get used to hammer fists.
Well, I think that's what I saw.

85
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,450
I was talking about the ENA and a lot
of other people were just wondering if

86
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:04,010
muscle memory is going to just kick
in and he was going to do some weird

87
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:08,570
information and it did kick in a little
bit, but not to the extreme. Yeah,

88
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,260
there was some massive penalties for any,

89
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:16,261
so if he had any sort of a point
deduction or anything that they did,

90
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:18,880
is something illegal.
I think he had a massive penalty,

91
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,590
more than a million dollars for
each thing. He fucked up 10 mil,

92
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,590
10 mil each one.
That makes sense.

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,470
That tin mill makes you get your
shit together. As long as he's not,

94
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,640
doesn't get disqualified.
It might be worth it.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,190
Like 10 million for one
fucking knee to the body.
