1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,830
So Dude, last time I was on, I was
just about to go to Venezuela and um,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,170
that was insane. I went and vetted
myself in the protests there. Holy Shit.

3
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:12,490
Is the media line about that too?
And then, um, they're, you know,

4
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,670
vices on the ground acting like bad asses.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,390
They're embedding themselves
in the protest and being like,

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,670
look at these fucking awesome dudes.
Um,

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,540
it was basically fascist mobs tried to
land just and we got chased out of the

8
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:27,460
country and then our colleague got
shot because we dared to tell that um,

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,520
the death toll that we kept hearing
in the mainstream media that Maduro is

10
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,800
mowing down all these protesters,

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,480
we found out that the majority of the
deaths were actually caused by the

12
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:38,440
protesters. Like either shooting
people, lynching people alive,

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,580
burning them alive,

14
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:44,581
or doing these giant roadblock heads
where they would light giant flaming piles

15
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:49,210
of trash and people would be flying off
the freeway or getting an accidents and

16
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:53,950
shit. And so once we just reported those
facts, then this lynch mob came after us.

17
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:56,380
It was very, very scary. And look, I mean,

18
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,950
the media is lying about the popular
support that that Maduro's government has.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,030
Um,

20
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,530
there was massive pro-government rallies
there and the country's pretty divided

21
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:10,060
where it just depends on who you talk to.
What is vice doing over there? I mean,

22
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,100
vice is, is an imperial arm. You should,

23
00:01:12,101 --> 00:01:14,340
everyone should check out my brother's
documentary called the barriers and

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,270
imperial. Oh Dude. 100% of the u s
government, Shane Smiths and imperial.

25
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:23,140
I'm Smith. Welcome to Obama and Biden
into their office. And they were like,

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,640
BFF dude, the COO of vice was like
Obama's like spokesperson. I mean,

27
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:31,150
good friends with Shane. I know him. I
know him very well. I mean, vice repeats.

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,710
He's not an imperial guy.
I'm saying they're lying.

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,510
They're lying. They're lying. The line
not lying the line because they look,

30
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,310
I think Obama and Biden are war criminals.

31
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,700
So I don't think it's cool as a
journalist to not challenge power.

32
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:49,210
And so when you invite these people into
your office and are really buddy buddy

33
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,240
with them, I'm offended by that.
You're such a radical lefty. I love it.

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,030
It's trailing Obama and Biden,
a war criminals,

35
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,120
even though the lefties fucking
lutely even the lefties,

36
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:01,960
like what does it look so fucking they
drone king bayed drone king. Yeah.

37
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,900
There was definitely a lot of drone desks,
but um,

38
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,750
check out a very heavy agenda and my
brother's documentary just goes over kind

39
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,780
of a lot of stuff about vice. But I think
the problem that I have with device is,

40
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,870
is just like the problem that I have
with all, all other corporate media,

41
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:14,441
like we were saying,

42
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:18,460
there's always align that's uniform that
basically promotes the US empire and

43
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:19,660
promotes American exceptionalism.

44
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,060
Clearly you've never, when you
fucked, that's delicious. You know,

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,110
what is that best show on vice
longs world, Eddie Wong's world,

46
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,300
those two? What's that? Action Bronson
is fuck that. Salicious that's his show.

47
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,890
You know, Action Bronson has the rapper.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I haven't watched it.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,410
Never had a human being come in
the studio and smoke more weed.

49
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,670
Never seen anybody smoke
nonstop.

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,160
We had an ashtray that we
took photos of it afterwards.

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,820
Like this is how much weed action
Bronson smoked while he was on a show.

52
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,720
I just ran into him the other day at
the UFC. He smoked like how many joints?

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,570
10 joints, easily. Big Ass joints,

54
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,610
big fat boys just puffed him
down to the NUB. And we were,

55
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,400
we were with Jamie and I were stunned.
We were like, how's he keep going?

56
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,070
That's my advice to vice
does have a lot of good shit.

57
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:10,550
Got a lot of the problem is that when
it comes to coverage, a foreign palsy,

58
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:14,840
I think they really missed
the boat. I then they're good
on lag. That's the thing.

59
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:18,230
It's the, it's still accept. Um, you
know, it's like anyone can kind of submit.

60
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,510
It's a kind of like Huffington Post.
It's like a huge tent.

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,520
I think they have a hard time filtering
everything out. I think they've gotten,

62
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,031
you know,

63
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,950
they were this radical sort of like
upstart where people hadn't heard them

64
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,550
before and they were doing wild shit and
they had some really cool videos, like,

65
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,530
like the guide to travel.

66
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:39,060
And they did that thing where they went
to Liberia and met with general butt

67
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:42,070
naked and he's explaining about eating
children and cutting their heart's

68
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,060
fucking insane.

69
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,900
So that was all Shane machine did a lot
of that stuff and that was the early

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,420
days.

71
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,470
But that that's I, I appreciate that,
that kind of style of journalism,

72
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:54,560
but I feel like what's missing is the
context behind it. Like just vice,

73
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:57,470
we'll go to like India and be like, fuck,
this is fucking nuts. And you're like,

74
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,870
well, why is there this massive
disparity? And you know, it qualities.

75
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,750
So it's a different style of journalism.

76
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,390
But I do think that they really
missed the boat on Venezuela,

77
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:08,990
Russia and Ukraine and some other
things when it comes to covering global

78
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:09,381
conflicts,

79
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:12,770
because that's just the problem with a
lot of journalism and corporate media in

80
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:15,830
general, is that you're toeing the
line because you're an American.

81
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:19,340
Just like we were talking about Israelis.
I mean, you have preconceived notions.

82
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:23,120
You have your own bias, you have your
own ethnocentric lens about world issues.

83
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:25,010
So it bleeds over into those conflicts.

84
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,690
And unless you're like
an internationalist,

85
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,060
can you see the world
from a different Lens?

86
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,800
But when I was on the ground in Venezuela,
I was like,

87
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,600
this is not what we're seeing.
