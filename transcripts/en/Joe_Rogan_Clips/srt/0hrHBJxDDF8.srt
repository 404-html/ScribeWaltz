1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,060
When you, uh, set out to do trigger
warning, what did, what was the,

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:07,160
what was the initial premise and how
much of it did it change until when you

3
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:07,360
need,

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,000
once you got to production and once you
started filming one of the only people

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:12,880
who have asked that question, you
can look, this isn't a sparrow. Yeah.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,290
Straight up bro.
Yeah.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,020
Originally we shot it with FX and we over
we over did it. It looked really good,

8
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:27,160
but it looked really TV. Uh, and
um, it could have been dealt,

9
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,790
but it would have been a parity of a
very real thing I was tempted to do.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,030
And right now I'm talking to my
crib. Nicola, what it turned out at,

11
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:38,680
turned into at Netflix was a real

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,363
mmm.

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,010
In your face.
Simple and plainly shot

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,890
documentation of the possibilities
of barbershop arguments.

15
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:58,090
Right? So in a barbershop
argument, you get to say, you know,

16
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:02,290
the only thing that separates alcohol
from Joe Kennedy is Al Capone got caught

17
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,320
and eventually died in prison. And Joe
Kennedy went on to produce presidents,

18
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,730
but they both had been bootlegged,
you know,

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,370
people say Shit like it's
barbershop talk and you need,

20
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:12,640
you have to go home and be like
yourself. Like, well, well damn,

21
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:14,170
if Papa Joe did it was a bootlegger.

22
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:16,930
Like technically it could have went
fucked up for him and we never would have

23
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:21,931
had an American dynasty
versus owl catching Sibley's
in shit and it not going so

24
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:22,481
well.

25
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:27,340
But him being the preeminent marketing
campaign in face of any Capone like

26
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:30,280
thing, you want to sell cigars to
a restaurant, right? So it got it.

27
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,940
I got a chance to say, you know, Shit,
what if I could do this for my guys?

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,300
And again, giving it a shot
and giving them to try it.

29
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,160
I thought of that shit at 15 years old,

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,060
I started trying to figure
out how to do it 10 years ago,

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,110
Daniel and I got it done eight, nine
years later. And now you have this. And,

32
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:52,180
and I say that just to say that I read
Brian Koppelman and the creator of

33
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,660
billions, um, is a brilliant writer to me.

34
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,370
And he's a phrase a friend also,

35
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,730
but Brian has been putting up lately
these just encouraging things,

36
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:03,910
telling writers to write,
even if your stuff is getting body,

37
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:05,670
even if you don't think is good to write,

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,980
to to push yourself to
push the idea forward.

39
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,300
And I've been taking a lot of inspiration
for that because Daniel Daniel

40
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,550
Minefield and I wanted a co
writer who's in cocreators.

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,300
Daniel and I have been talking and
developing this over 10 years now.

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,480
I know how to do it, how to go on
a room, how to get it, you know,

43
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:26,350
it won't take me 10 years for the next
one, but it was worth the struggle,

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,160
you know, it was worth doing
that. It was worth tweaking.

45
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:33,520
My ideal is worth critiquing my idea to
be like the first time around like nine.

46
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:33,911
It's not,

47
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,940
it's not what it should be because I
was nervous as shit the night before it

48
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:41,800
came out about everything in it.
You know what scenes were shot,

49
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:46,600
how did it look to production value and
now seeing people get it and unlike a

50
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,880
lot of other artists, not have to call
yourself a genius. Let me tell people's,

51
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,570
like every artist thinks days it changes.

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,930
Every comedian thinks they're fucking
Richard Pryor and some part of your mind,

53
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,270
you have to think you're
great or why do it?

54
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,610
You have believe there's greatness in you.
Right?

55
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,090
But I'd never want it to be the guy. I'm
a fucking genius. You know what I mean?

56
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,320
I just never want it. But
to see it, because I always
thought the idea was genius.

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,640
Like fuck that shit.

58
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,670
You remember real people that used to
come on in the seventies eighties I

59
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,750
remember watching that show as a kid
looking at motherfuckers like, wow,

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,930
these motherfuckers exist in it and he's
off far off places like Iowa and Kansas

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,320
and I wanted to approach it.
I wanted to approach people in a very,

62
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm here right in front of you, kind
of way. Not Above you, not celebrity,

63
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,150
Michael Morris.

64
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,200
The people know I'm a rapper and it gave
me that opportunity and people can say

65
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,770
as genius and I'm going to say I'm humbled
and honored but you're fucking right

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,850
and it's genius because I'm engaging
people at a regular human level,

67
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,920
not at the level of celebrity or power.

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,950
There used to be an engaged but one
that allows them to fully open up.

69
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,630
I haven't seen it on TV since.
Some shit like real people or no,

70
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:57,250
I haven't seen revolutionary TV like
the Jeffersons or you know all in the

71
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:02,230
family or mod and I think that the world
is getting scary and pussy to be honest.

72
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,250
You know,
not to,

73
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,250
not to disrespect pussies cause pussies
are tough but I think that something

74
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,320
needs to be dangerous.

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,300
The best compliment I got on this press
run has been like Ambrosia Ambrosia for

76
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:13,900
head said.

77
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,710
How's it feel to have some most dangerous
show on TV and it's dangerous because

78
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,800
it unites people.
Does it separate people?

79
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,040
It gives you alternative answers
and the ones you thought you had,

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,710
it forces you to think it doesn't solve
all the problems or wrap it up pretty at

81
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,590
the end. Gives you some options to
do and some shit to think about.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,080
And it's funny as fuck. And so first
if in dark and I like it. I was,

83
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:36,490
I got an imagine Netflix give
you plenty of room. Yeah.

84
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,750
Hell they weren't tripping man. They
don't trip. Don't trip. Just go.

85
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,810
You know what you're doing.
Go ahead. Yeah, exactly.

86
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,210
And then you walk in the room
like how the fuck I'm doing.

87
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,590
But there is smart enough to let people
create their own shit for standup

88
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,041
comedy.

89
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,230
There's no one better in terms of like
interacting with them about a special,

90
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,170
you don't have to give them any
notes on the material. They,

91
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,070
they know that you're going to do your
best. I stope yeah, they don't stop.

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,690
They can't help you.
Like no one can help you as a comic.

93
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:08,950
There's a another person,
like an executive is going
to help you do your best.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,790
You gotta you gotta be looking at it
yourself ruthlessly and you'll figure it

95
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,150
out. And so they trust you. So I would
assume they did the same thing with you.

96
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect.
Beautiful. All right. What a
world. Yeah, the forever the,

97
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,431
it was the opposite.

98
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,140
There was 50 fucking cooks in the kitchen
and everybody's pulling you this way

99
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,700
and you need to do what to do. It's just
shit. You need a fucking theme song.

100
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:31,630
You got, you need a thing. You say
every week, which you talk about Willis,

101
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,530
you need to hook. Everybody
needed a hook. Oh Shit. She said,

102
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,590
oh my God.
Shouts it different strokes.
