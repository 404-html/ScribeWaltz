1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
That's like

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,320
crazy. The breath. How was me seeing
a headline of them on deadline?

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,560
I know they have a new show. I know
that it's good for all of us, but like

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,310
new show and it's in the
slot that your show was in.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,000
You know what it is.

6
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,030
I literally have to unfollow girls
sometimes who I'm friends with who are in,

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,900
who are comedians, who are my peers and
who I respect and think they're funny.

8
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,900
I have to unfollow them if I
see that they're just like,

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,380
I'm working a lot right now and they're
putting out there that they're like

10
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:41,560
really busy with work and I just got
kicked off dancing with the stars.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,330
I have to unfollow them because?

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,310
Because I start to feel sad about myself
and I would rather just remove that

13
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:52,660
from my feed then and then it's a really
awkward follow when I know or they

14
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:55,270
messaged me on one of those things and
they see I'm not following them because

15
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:57,590
it's like we all know we
follow each other. Right.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,330
They know and sometimes I'll just tell
them, I'm unfollowed you because you,

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,080
you make me feel sad about my own career.
I'm not going to get over that.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,310
It's easier to just take them out of
my feed. Yeah, but that's a weird one.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,870
I am working to get over it that I am

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,820
just, just use it as infor
like his inspiration. Use
them as fuel to work harder.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,770
Yeah,
I do.

22
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,980
But I would also like to not see
their toward eight schedule all crazy.

23
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,700
It got crazy. That one go.
That's not a good one to accept.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't think. You know what? I probably,

25
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:34,180
I'm probably going to unfollow
one a all all you guys with your,

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,150
with your workouts and your calorie
counts that you've posted them a couple

27
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,110
times but I didn't even post the big one.

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,520
I didn't literally growing as
fuck to people who, who are like,

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,230
Eh, you know, hate their bodies and
stuff. Yeah. It can be very triggering.

30
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:54,850
So like girls, they're like, I just ran
a marathon. I'm like, unfollow. I can't,

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,180
I can't have you in my life
bragging about the shit. Listen,

32
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:02,710
I go to the gym too and I don't tweet
about it. I want to, Goddamn, I want to,

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,900
I just heard so many calories,

34
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,440
but I don't tweet tweet about it because
I don't want to trigger people and I

35
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:11,770
don't want to be the, I don't want
to be what I am so jealous of,

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,540
but I should brag about it.
And I also like that some people are like,

37
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,250
look at what I just did it the gym.
Fuck you.

38
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:22,000
I'd worked today and they're proud of
themselves, but I can't, I can't see.

39
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,470
I get inspired.
Okay.

40
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,750
Do you know who I go to like all the
time for inspiration? The Rock? Yeah.

41
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,070
That motherfucker never
stops. He never stops. I mean,

42
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,680
I don't want to do what he's doing.
I don't want to do these movies.

43
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,520
I don't want to do what he's doing,

44
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,180
but that I fucking admire the shit out
of that guy's work ethic. That guy,

45
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:41,580
I'll fly to Tokyo,
it will be four o'clock in the morning.

46
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:45,060
He sets up an elliptical machine, starts
going after it. That's what he does.

47
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
And that doesn't make, that doesn't put
you in a place of like, I'm, I'm never,

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,080
I can't, no, no, because you can, but
the thing is, Joe Rogan, you can do that.

49
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,200
Look at that. Look at all his food and
he gets to do that because you said,

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,430
Oh God,

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,210
he landed in London, midnight ordered
Sushi like a motherfucker. Go to his, uh,

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,140
his Instagram with all the workout
ones. This is, you are the Rock Joe.

53
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,920
You are the rock.
You do these workouts all the time.

54
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,700
That's how you get that
shirt.

55
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,510
That's what I'm saying.
Rock.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,660
I got a text today from David Goggins
and I told David Goggins I'm trying to

57
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,380
beat everyone by double. He's
like, fuck yeah, kill it.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,070
Like capital a hundred exclamation points.

59
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,320
That's what I'm saying. Look at
that dude focused. I see that.

60
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,550
I want to go work out right now.
