1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,610
When you die, what's going to happen is
you don't know. You don't know. And the,

2
00:00:04,611 --> 00:00:07,900
the reality is, look, maybe
there is an afterlife.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,900
Maybe when we stop living,

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,110
something happens and are essential.

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:19,060
Energy goes into another dimension.
It's possible, but you don't know. Look,

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,860
being alive is so titanic bizarre.
Just being a human being,

7
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:28,180
looking through eyeballs at each other
across from this wooden table that was

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,420
cut down from living organisms that turn
into hearts sir surfaces Santam and saw

9
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:38,620
him and then he put it in a building
and it's got electricity rolling through

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,520
the walls. And if you stuck a fork in
there, you die. All of it is crazy.

11
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:46,030
The fact that we're in a planet,
I mean the fact that the universe is,

12
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:50,680
at least as far as we can tell,
infinite, all that stuff is crazy.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,630
The idea that your essential energy
doesn't transfer into some other state.

14
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,250
Why not? Yeah, the whole thing is
crazy, but you don't know. That's right.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,960
Know you don't know.
And to you,

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,520
whenever you say something that
you're not sure of and you say,

17
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,760
this is what's going to happen, but you
don't really know you're a huckster.

18
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,510
That's right. Yep. Absolutely.
No one knows. No one knows.

19
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,360
And that's the conclusion of heavens on
earth. I don't know. And you don't either.

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,750
I saw a bumper sticker that said
militant agnostic. I don't know.

21
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:22,500
And you don't either. Uh,
so I mean we have to. Okay,

22
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,900
so here's my bottom line on this
yet. I don't know. You don't.

23
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,920
No one knows for sure.

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,280
I'm happy to wake up in some great
place and there's all my friends.

25
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,170
It'd be awesome.
Unless,

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,520
unless God was mad that you didn't follow
the rules of the law. That's right.

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,100
Christopher Hitchens called the
Christian Heaven Celestial North Korea.

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,391
It's like,

29
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:42,770
here's this dictator that knows
everything you do and controls everything

30
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:46,370
forever. That's hilarious.
The less you'll North Korea,

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,520
but he doesn't tell you anymore.
I told you already,

32
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,200
I told you 2000 years ago this dude
wrote it down. Pay attention to that.

33
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,600
But then it's not even that.
Right?

34
00:01:56,601 --> 00:02:00,020
It's like one guy might've
write it down a long time ago,

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,260
but then a bunch of other dudes
got together and how to revise it.

36
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,920
They had like a new draft and the
new draft, they get to decide.

37
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:09,950
People got to decide what goes
in and what doesn't go in.

38
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:13,970
And some of the stories are based on right
accounts from hundreds of years after

39
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:18,400
Jesus's death. Like the Bible is
a Wiki. It is like a Wiki. Yeah.

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,210
People contributed to over the
years and it's on Hitchins, uh,

41
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,080
at a great analogy with when he was dying,

42
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,540
he wrote a series of essays
for Vanity Fair. His column,

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,550
which you can get as a book now,

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,000
I think it's called mortality or something
like that. Anyway, one of them was, uh,

45
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,460
people think dying is like,

46
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,000
you're at a party and someone
tapped you on the shoulder and says,

47
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:43,320
you have to leave now. At
worse, the party's going to
go on without you. It's like,

48
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:47,940
oh no. He goes, okay, so let's play
this out. You're at the party, uh,

49
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:51,710
and you get tapped on the
shoulder and said, uh,

50
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,770
you can never leave. The party, you have
to stay here forever with these people.

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,490
Like when a Julie is funny lines is
the Mormon boys were telling her like,

52
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:04,390
in heaven, it's going to be great.
Um, uh, you, you, you get you,

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,380
you're made whole again,

54
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,080
like the blind shall see and the deaf
shall hear again in the crippled,

55
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,630
she'll be hold again. She said, well, um,

56
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,920
I had uterine cancer and I had my uterus
taken out. Do I get my uterus back?

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,640
And they're like, you can imagine these
18 year old guy, what's the uterus again?

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,540
And they're like, yeah, you
get your uterus back. She
goes, I don't want it back.

59
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,420
And then she said, what if he
had a nose job and you liked it?

60
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,590
Do I have to have my old nose back in
heaven? That's a good point. Yeah. So, uh,

61
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:30,820
and then they said,
uh,

62
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,110
and you get to spend the rest of eternity
with your family. And she went, oh no,

63
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,720
that would not be good in my case.
Maybe there'll be cured though.

64
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,680
They'll realize the errors of their
ways. There'll be all enlightened. Well,

65
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,840
here's the problem.
So this is called the problem of identity.

66
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,260
Who are you and you know the,
you know that Theseus the ship,

67
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,590
you know the Greek men guitar slayer
Theseus comes back and is a hero and they,

68
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,450
and they preserve his ship
and the museum forever,

69
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,200
but the wood rots and they replaced the
ship and over the centuries there's no

70
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:00,550
wood left from the original,

71
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:04,960
but it's still cherished is I call this
Schirmer's Mustang because my first car

72
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:08,760
was a 66 Ford Mustang, a classic. And I
had there for 19 years when those cars,

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,940
it's like it was a great car,

74
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,610
but I banged it up so much I
replaced this and that. And you know,

75
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,090
every pretty much by the time I sold it
as a classic and made it a nice little

76
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,290
chunk of change on it, there was
very little of the original left.

77
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,080
But it's the pattern,
not the material and accounts.

78
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,430
So this whole debate about when you're
resurrected in heaven with Jesus,

79
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,660
what's up there? Is it your physical
body? If it cause some Christian sex,

80
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,270
say yeah. It's like, okay, how
old are you when you're in heaven?

81
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,160
30 this is the year they came up with
because that's the age Jesus was when he

82
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:43,240
was crucified. Okay. But if Joe
Rogan or held for 40 something,

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,890
51 [inaudible] 51 okay. So if you're
resurrected at 30 year old Joe Rogan,

84
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:51,490
what happened to the last 21 years
of Joe Rogan's body memories?

85
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,960
I don't want to go back to that dude.
That dude was dumbing down.

86
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,830
You don't know you're happy where you
are in your life at this point. I'm sure.

87
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,260
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well that
means you a well live life.

88
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,990
So what's up there with Jesus?
Uh,

89
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:09,240
or it wouldn't matter having that body
30 year old body of like most problems.

90
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,660
I've been beaten on it for
21 years since then. Right.

91
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,660
It's like when I was 30 is when
I got hardcore into Jujitsu.

92
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,440
So that's a 20 years of getting choked.
But of course the,

93
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,770
the Christian would say,
well God makes you whole again,

94
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:27,250
you'll have no injuries but
that's not really part of you.

95
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,180
Part of you is your injuries, your
muscles. What I was going to say those,

96
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,030
but all those, the, all the
stuff that I did that hurt me,

97
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,700
I also learned from, that's
right. Maybe stronger.

98
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,710
Learned the straw. I think through
incremental struggle. Well,

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
whether it's like rigorous exercise or
learning something or I think everything

100
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,180
that I do that's difficult,
it makes me just a little bit more aware,

101
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,910
a little bit better at other things.
Just a little bit,

102
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,340
a little bit better to talk to a
little bit easier to deal with,

103
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,190
a little more friendly
and all those things.

104
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,650
I think I wouldn't give up for anything.

105
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,850
I think that's more important than
whatever injuries I've got with. I think,

106
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,130
you know,

107
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,750
I wonder if how you're going to feel
when you're 80 I wonder if you feel like

108
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,390
that, like there's gotta be a point
of diminishing returns. Like, look,

109
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,550
I'd rather be stupid and 40 then to be
enlightened and can't get out of bed very

110
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,180
well.

111
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,860
My older athletic friends tell me it's
about mid eighties when things drop off

112
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:28,730
fairly quickly. You know, they can
stay pretty fit into their seventies,

113
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,800
maybe still racing,
bike racing at 80,

114
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,950
but 85 or so things drop off pretty quick.

115
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,160
That's where he got to go to a
hormone replacement or whatever. Yeah.

116
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,050
Or the ice pledges or the, the, the
young person's blood or something.

117
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,980
Okay. So I deal with it. You know,
there's no breakthrough miracles yet. Uh,

118
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,680
but again, I'm not against any of
these things happening. You know, when,

119
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,940
when someone like Jeff Bezos puts
$100 million into an aging company,

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,840
I hope he's successful as you have
$100 million in an aging company. Uh,

121
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:01,841
he and Peter Thiel and the Google guys
through Calico and a few others have

122
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,720
invested many hundreds of
millions of dollars into cutting,

123
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,030
like Calico for example.
These are companies that are trying to,

124
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,320
their big goal is to defeat aging
through reengineering cells.

125
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,750
And, um, that,

126
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,310
that's the sort of philosophical goal
behind it is we have to defeat aging so

127
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,580
people can live for centuries
or forever to which I say,

128
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,460
let's not worry about living 500 years.
Let's,

129
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,580
let's worry about like cure prostate
cancer and breast cancer and Alzheimer's

130
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,740
and dementia and so I just,
the little incremental medical problems,

131
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,710
quality of life things were the things
that take people out young. Yeah.

132
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,600
And so that you can live a longer,
higher quality life.

133
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:46,100
Imagine Michael Shermer at 300 years old.
If you can keep this body,

134
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,380
if you can keep the body that you
have now, you're moving around great,

135
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:52,220
everything's well, you look really
healthy. How smart would you be? How much?

136
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,650
How much more enlightened or
wise maybe is the best word I,

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm not against that. I'm happy to live
as long as I possibly can. There are with,

138
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,260
there are people that go, well that's not
right. It's not natural. It's like, okay,

139
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,400
what,
what's natural?

140
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,910
There's surveys on this people and
people's answer is whatever the current

141
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,530
average lifespan is. So, well,
80 seems about right. Okay.
Fast forward to your, uh,

142
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,170
the day before your 80th birthday.
Tomorrow you're going to go,

143
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,950
you want another week? Yeah,
I'll take another week. Okay.

144
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,650
Then fast forward six days I
would you like another month.

145
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,940
I'll take another month. Thank you. And,
and that would never end. So of course,

146
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,360
if you're healthy and happy and you
don't want to off yourself or whatever,

147
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,790
cause you're super, super depressed
or something like that. Yes.

148
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,680
You're just going to want to keep going.
Nothing wrong with that.

149
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,360
If we can do that.

150
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,300
But what if you die and it's way better.
What if you die and you really do,

151
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:42,980
you leave your physical body.

152
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:47,450
There's no need for emotions and all
the entanglements of human existence and

153
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,500
you go to this beautiful place
of bliss and life and love,

154
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:56,501
and it's just pure love without
a body and an unhindered.

155
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,200
I don't know what, that'd be fun. I don't
know what's, is that what we're here for?

156
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,930
We're here for fun.
First one.

157
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,830
We're doing a shitty job to the
channel going crazy right now.

158
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,160
She'd be in a like a party
Van and the way to Vegas.

159
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,640
I had a college professor when I was in
my Christian days who asked me when I

160
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:14,960
was pitching him the Christian story.
Uh,

161
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:17,760
he says are their golf courses
and tennis courts in heaven?

162
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,250
Because I like physical challenges.
Yeah.

163
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,510
Want to get out there and push myself
like, I don't know. You know? So I mean,

164
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,390
we'd haven't been no challenges,
no working out,

165
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:32,370
no physical tensions and true,
right? Yeah. Maybe you don't need it.

166
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,620
So you'd have to remove that part
of humanity that we'd no longer want

167
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:41,370
challenges and to be pushed to better
ourselves. Do they play chess and heaven?

168
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,120
Right, right. When

169
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,940
you get to win in heaven
or is everybody a winner?

170
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,870
Everybody gets a gold medal
and a Nobel prize and whatever.
