1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,900
Man, this most yearn I've ever held. I
think. Congratulations. Yeah. Was it,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,930
how much can you hold? What kind
of car do you drive? Theo Vaughn,

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,820
I drive a BMW,
but I'm trying to get rid of it.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,210
Figure you more for a muscle
car type fellow. Really? Yeah.

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,380
I used to own a 1984 Ford escort and
somebody stole my passenger's seat.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,780
God dammit. Yeah. What are they going
to do with a passenger seat? I Dunno.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,300
Probably put, you know, put it in the
living room. I'll be guests at the time,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,110
putting in the forest and jerk off.
Take out

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,300
how much comes out in the fucking
forest, Bro. That's where the next,

10
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,940
no wonder swamp thing happened
while I was thinking this,

11
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:43,941
once they found out that in some plants
some plants contain DNA from salmon

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,070
because the salmon were used
as fertilizer by the plant.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,780
As it decomposed,

14
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:54,930
it got into the actual plant itself
and you can actually somehow or another

15
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:58,320
through some sort of scientific process
that I'm too stupid to understand.

16
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:03,030
They can actually detect salmon in
the actual plant itself. We're close.

17
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:06,750
So if you were whacking off on that
tree and that tree, it's every day.

18
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:11,040
That's your spot. You went down to that
titty tree and whacked off on the roots.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,100
And then like after a while he did an
analysis and you found your DNA in the

20
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,950
tree itself. Imagine.
Oh, it'd be great man.

21
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,620
If it maintains the information of
everything that whacked off on it.

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,240
You have a little son made out of wood.

23
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:29,241
One day they had a kid in our town one
time does he got made his son of wooden

24
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,390
shirt that I'd tell you that a wouldn't
shirt. Yeah, he made his son a shirt out.

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,130
A plywood for Christmas.
What? Yeah, we wanted the kid
to wear it. Oh yeah, he did.

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,620
And I remember I was um,
wait a minute,

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,970
is it a stiff shirt or is he make it
like little itty bitty tiny pieces of

28
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,360
plywood and weave it all together?
Oh No, I was pretty stiff.

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,610
And the dad was a, um, yeah,
like an Elvis impersonator,

30
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,444
you know.

31
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,830
But Dad was an Elvis impersonator at
a casino or did he do it at carnivals?

32
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,690
Not as locally. Oh. Um, but we
didn't even need him that no,

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,970
no money in it really.
I think he's probably an alcoholic,

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,160
but he had a,
he had four kids and one of them he made,

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,520
I was going walking home one night and I
heard him in the garage and he's making

36
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:19,140
like a son, like a sh like, uh,
for Christmas, like a wooden shirt,

37
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:24,060
like uh, you know, uh, not as nice.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,800
That one is nice. Wouldn't
shirt. Yeah. Can you get,

39
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,740
but that's a like a sculpture. Yeah.
That's nice. Can you get one more?

40
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:32,910
That's like a,

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,010
like if you go over someone's house and
they have a wooden shirt on a hanger,

42
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,750
like, and they think that's cute. Just
leave. Now people are assholes now.

43
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,980
This kid needed it cause people were
used to beat this kid up. Is that salmon?

44
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,510
Yeah,
it's a framed wouldn't shirt.

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,070
It looks like he used to beat him up
because of his wooden. Sure. Yeah.

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,550
People used to beat him up anyway
on the bus. Well the wouldn't, sure.

47
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:57,000
It would protect you from a lot of
shots and it helped and it helped.

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,980
He didn't wear that, wouldn't
sure. You better shut the fuck.

49
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,100
I swear to God he did. He's not walking
around with wood over his body like that.

50
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,330
Not Today. That'd be, that would be,
yeah. This was your pads inside of it.

51
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:12,300
It looks heavy. Fuck no dude. But he
think his dad is Estee Lauder lady.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Yeah. See there's some lady wearing
something there. Okay, but this was early.

53
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:21,700
It might've been teak.
Teeds way too much attention or posing.

54
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,660
Pretend to be aloof. Short hair by
the ocean. We're in a wooden shirt.

55
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,660
How about a big no, that's
a big no for me. Hey,

56
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:30,010
do you want to meet my friend Michelle?

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,850
She's channeling with her
fucking geometrically patterned.

58
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,740
Wouldn't shirt on what? No, I like regular
people. This kid, his name was Eddie.

59
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,900
Can you look up teak
wood is teak look like?

60
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,990
Imagine if someone was trying to set you
up with that Gal, you'd be like, well,

61
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,680
I'm torn because obviously she's very
pretty. She's sure she's not crazy.

62
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,330
Super desperate. She might have
splinters that her tits, dude,

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,190
it was one photo shoot. She doesn't wear
that except when she worships. The ocean.

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,240
I don't lie.
Now that's something,

65
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,120
a little more malleable teak or something
like that. What are the kind of wood,

66
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:08,970
did they have over print shirt?
Now we're talking that print system.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,080
So it was like that but a little
bit more but more real. And uh,

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,480
he wore this for what reason did I

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,160
look at chest plate? Like
a Roman soldier? That okay.

70
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,770
Was it like how was it a connected
on the waste on the sides rather?

71
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,170
It was just kind of like a long square.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,170
It was almost like a kind of a cereal
box kinda. Where did he put his arms?

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,680
Like rest his arms on the side and the
side. Yeah. Fuck your armpits up. Oh,

74
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:39,400
is limiting. I mean, look man, these
weren't, I mean the man that made it

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,280
not a real, you can't do online. People
would find out. They would call him out.

76
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,990
We had to, when I was younger, you could
do anything you wanted to, you know,

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,290
people, people were, I don't know, just
more fun and use your imagination more.

78
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,580
When I was young,
you have more fun.

79
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,190
How many kids you see
beaten when you were a kid.

80
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,140
People used to beat their kids probably
like at least 20 I bet. Oh yeah.

81
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,000
But people would fight in the
street. Beat their kids. Yeah. Yeah.

82
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,340
You'd see people beat people up.
Let's be way more common,

83
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,140
but I guess it's maybe we've moved out
of those areas too, but that's true.

84
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,420
People back in those areas are
like, Bro, I'm on the front line.

85
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,440
Shit's still going now from
all it did it did I? Yeah.

86
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,810
We used to see people fight,
man.

87
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,570
I saw this old man get thrown into
a fire one time in a ditch fire.

88
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,820
Their people were burning
leaves throwing right in.

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,130
This guy was in his eighties
to Mr Pollito. My God,

90
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:32,710
why did they throw him in a ditch?
He was fighting a bus driver.

91
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,910
He was fighting our bus driver and
the bus driver through in it ditch.

92
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,120
I don't know why was he swinging
on the bus driver? I don't know.

93
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,680
Whose fault was it? Both of them. Both of
them. I think. I mean, one of, you know,

94
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,570
they were both adults. I mean, look man,

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm not surprised they were doing
it. Oh, you know humans. Yeah, yeah,

96
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,790
yeah. If you saw him, you wouldn't
be shocked. They were fist fight.

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,960
What do you do with like that once
universal basic income rolls around and

98
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,930
there's some stupid people that just
ain't getting any better. Basic needs met.

99
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,140
Okay, so then after that, after you do a
couple of years universal basic income,

100
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,950
then what do you do? Wolves in
the woods. Yeah, let wolves loose.

101
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,620
You've got to thin the
herd. It's insane, man.

102
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,670
Cut some dude out there
jerking off thinking he's
pretty cute hanging out behind

103
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,610
a bush. He just turns and
sees six wolves. Look it up

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,970
and they just know what to do next as how
well you think a wolf would attack you

105
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:30,140
while you were jerking off or now, fuck
yeah, you're all pink. Everything's pink.

106
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,100
He has pink. Dick looks delicious.
When you wearing clothes, it's like,

107
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,540
can I eat that?
I guess I can eat that.

108
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,560
I got to get through all that
fucking bullshit plywood tee shirt.

109
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,660
Once I get through that,
I'll beat the fuck out of that dude.

110
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,870
But if they catch you out there
with just all pink. Oh yeah.

111
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,420
They beat the fuck out of you. Yeah. Yeah.

112
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:51,920
I hope I don't do anything bad like that.
And they in any of them see me,

113
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,551
you know,

114
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,400
I don't want to be having that kind
of ending you get into by an animal.

115
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,630
I'm going to say right now,

116
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,880
I don't think that you're going to be
jerking off in the woods and eaten by a

117
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:02,420
wolf. I might be wrong. Yeah, but I would
say that's not how you're going to go.

118
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
Thanks for anyone. I like that.
Don't see that in you bro.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,170
I see better things for you.
I like the attitude naked.

120
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,400
You're packer in your hand.

121
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,330
Imagine if like you were about to come
and the first wolf built your cat bit,

122
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:19,070
your calf and you're like, look,
they're gonna get me anyway.

123
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,890
Let me just keep going.
Shit on the edge.

124
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,610
Maybe the bite and the pain cause you're
about to come. What is your last rocket?

125
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,010
You bust like a more than
usual. Yeah. And you like, wow.

126
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,420
At least I died with my
biggest load ever. Like, Hey,

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
that's one thing I've always
been disappointed by. Right.

128
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,970
Is the sheer volume of your loads.
Well, it's not much. If you look at it.

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,830
Take Zinc and magnesium.
Yeah. Allegedly egg whites.

130
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,660
I do have zinc at the house.
Actually sank.

131
00:07:48,661 --> 00:07:51,950
Supposed to be good for raising
testosterone. Oh, I want that.

132
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,500
The neighbors,

133
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,040
the more you save it up to,
Oh yeah, we gather up more,

134
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,410
but I like to do that. Not
turn off. I want to ride.

135
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:05,330
I want that dream bus that used to get

136
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,770
super bus. Dude. I want that dream bus.

137
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:18,600
Remember we knew would bust in a dream
[inaudible] those don't happen anymore,

138
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,410
but they can if you search for
it, if you seek it out, yeah,

139
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,610
but you have to not beat
off for a long time.

140
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:27,180
To the point we bought it bodies like
this dumb mother fucker can't even jerk

141
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:30,480
off. Yeah. I'm just going to have
to jerk off for him. Unconscious.

142
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,950
Your brain fucking church. You all
honestly for, what do you think?

143
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,830
Do you think that you're learning
things while you're dreaming?

144
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:39,840
Because some people think you'd
learn things. We need treatment.

145
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,660
I think that'll be one of the next
hurdles that we get over where people are

146
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:47,370
able to, uh, be able to take in
information while they're asleep.

147
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,430
This is what I mean. Like they
say, if you have a problem,

148
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,650
something's bothering you,
you should sleep on it.

149
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,880
And when you wake up in the morning,
you'll have a clear, I believe that. Yeah,

150
00:08:56,881 --> 00:09:00,630
I think so too. I think that's
real because I've done that before.

151
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,960
That seems to actually be a good strategy.
If you can go to sleep,

152
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,300
the problem is if something's
really bothering you, like, damn,

153
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,134
I got to figure this out.

154
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,290
Like you might stay up all night and be
exhausted and then you might not be able

155
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,740
to sleep and think through it. You got to
get a higher power to help you out, man.

156
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,190
She got to get you just kind of case
where a higher power comes into place.

157
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,760
Do you think you see yourself ever going
to church again? Yeah, I would think so.

158
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,410
I think Churchill is kind of evolving over
our time and stuff like that. And, um,

159
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,090
would you go to Justin Bieber's preacher?
Carl Lentz, you know, he is. Hey,

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,080
whoa. He texted me actually.
Whoa. He's trying to groom you,

161
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,350
trying to pull you in. How's
the dark arts? How low is low?

162
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,960
Do you wear your shorts? Huh? Oh, I saw
you guys make it a kind of this room.

163
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,190
Yeah, that was a little wild. Huh?
So you know him never met him? No.

164
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:50,520
He just texted each other back and forth.
Yeah. We communicate sometimes. Yes.

165
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,070
That root Hashtag Dick Route.

166
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,850
He looks good.
Yeah.

167
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,340
They're both Kamara to shorts. Yeah. Eh,

168
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,030
Eh, but I've never met him, but
I would go just text each other.

169
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,670
He has to try to meet you and
you're like, not tonight, Bro.

170
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,120
You think he's homoerotic? No. Oh No. I
mean I, that's a weird way of putting it.

171
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,790
You're homoerotic

172
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,450
you always, every time I'm here he's
talking about jerking off the magical

173
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,820
problem. It's like you came in here
with like gay expectation, you know,

174
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,820
I got nothing, dude. I
jerked off yesterday.

175
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,100
I'm not even planning on coming
again for a couple of days.

176
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,570
Do you have a time where like if you've
jerked off and it's been like four days,

177
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:46,410
like, man, maybe I should do something.
Uh Oh, I get that feeling inside of me.

178
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,030
So it's like a vulture that wants
to flat on my fight. Oh her.

179
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,080
My brain don't want to
be too sex obsessed. No.

180
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,580
Like there's a balance, right? You
don't want to beat off every day,

181
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,490
but you don't want to not be it off
either. Cause then it'll consume you.

182
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,350
But I think I'm gonna
start hunting that dream.

183
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,130
They don't want that
fucking nocturnal bust.

184
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,040
And I certainly did want to start a group.

185
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,390
I'm hunting the L and D's Row. There's
late night busters brother's dream.

186
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,480
Dude. How funny is that
expression? I'm hunting that dream.

187
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,440
I want that nocturnal bus. That's
what I want. Hunting the dream.

188
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,200
But due to imagine you fucking,
are you Jessica?
