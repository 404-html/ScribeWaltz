1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,300
Okay. What does that, how
does that James, I don't know.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,000
It was in that period with the rabbits.
It said stoats stoked.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,550
I've never heard of it. It's Keating.
It's eating a nested bird. Yeah.

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,750
Probably another cute,

5
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:14,751
but that also I learned about
from the mediator podcast is a,

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:19,890
how many squirrels kill birds?
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,660
They kill and eat birds eye.

8
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:26,661
That's a big part of the decimation of
the population of certain bird species is

9
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:29,730
interested in the squirrels. I'm
interested in this. What did he eats?

10
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:33,450
Fucking mice. He's a murderer. It's a
little fucking bad ass. That's crazy.

11
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:37,740
That little thing. Eat a mouse. That's
about what's a rat? It's eating a rat.

12
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:41,580
That's like his size. Is this something
that's uh, own New Zealand? I think.

13
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,280
I believe so.
Some Little Zealand murderer,

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,920
I don't think I've run into that
was native to New Zealand was a Kia.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,450
It was like a parrot that flies around.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,280
Was the thylacine native to New Zealand
or just Australia? That's Australia,

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,030
right? That's the Tasmanian Tiger
was also known as your total weasel.

18
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,410
Simply look at how he's nine
ounces just America, North America.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,550
He's just had a little fuckers out here
at Merck and ugliness and stuff. Oh, okay.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,470
Got over here. Distinguished by. Oh,

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,620
he's a weasel.

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,760
It looks like a larger size and longer
tail with a prominent black tip to kind

23
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,520
of weasel, which was terrific.
Level of carnivorous.

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,340
Isn't it funny that weasels are
thought to be like a little bitches?

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,660
You little weasel, bad ass. This weasel.
There he goes, look at him. Yeah.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,860
And weasels will fuck up a cobra.
How about that? Look at him.

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,120
What is he doing that a rabbit.
That's how he's killing. Look at it.

28
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:37,020
Stoat kills rabbit 10 times its
size. It's Christ. 2 million views.

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,560
There it is. All there it is. Look how
small he is and he's chasing a rabbit.

30
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:48,420
That's insane. What a little
ruthless motherfucker don't show it,

31
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:52,750
but it seems very cute. So should we
do the play by play on lights? Doubt.

32
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,920
Oh, life. Stout kills rabbit 10
times the stoat or stout. See One,

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,820
I don't know. This is stowed
her style. I don't know.

34
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:03,630
I'd rather than in this credit or my
time outside fucker, look at him. Go.

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,430
He really is 10 times the size
that he's sharing his door.

36
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,340
I use kind of adorable though. The
way that he's doing it. Ruthless.

37
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,720
What's he gonna do? He's going to go
for the hind quarters, like a wolf.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,920
The other rabbit tried to stop him. That's
like captain, save a hoe over there.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,370
Maybe this one just, Oh, oh, that's
him pass by. I was going low.

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,180
How about the other rabbit? Just
sits there was friends. Gets Jess,

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,270
dozens of rabbits that aren't like,
let's gang up and get this stoat man.

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,710
How crazy is he? Doesn't try the wraps
it around really close to him on now.

43
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,730
He goes, where's he going? Is he going
like, so he's probably going to hit those.

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,080
We're going to hit those hind quarters.

45
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:42,040
He can get some shock and some blood loss.
This, yeah, no, he's gone. He's gone.

46
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,390
He's going to pull them down with the
leakage of blood loss and you get,

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,980
you know, he's going, aw, Joe
Rogan. He's going up. Oh my God.

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,150
This guy, deep back, look at the other
rabbit as what's going on. It's like,

49
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:56,880
this doesn't seem right. The other. I
was just going to look away you pussy.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,880
We're not friends and even help your
friend. What a little monster. Oh,

51
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,250
dad is so crazy. He's deep on it. That
is soap. So he's got his teeth for those.

52
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,390
I don't know.
I was watching,

53
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,790
but he's got his teeth like
behind the ears of this rabbit.

54
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,470
He's killing it by biting the back of
his neck and he literally is 10 times

55
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,230
smaller than it does. Is it dead
right there? The other rappers like,

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,120
thank you BBC.
Fucking dorks help your friend.

57
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,090
That's why you're going to go extinct.
You cunts

58
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,890
fucking Nate. How about you turn a bitch,
turning them a bite him in the neck.

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,780
Is it closer? I'm really stoat.
They're stout. You think s?

60
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:42,490
T. O. A. T. It seems
like it would be stout.

61
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,380
Yeah. No, but you would be
stout. Stow Stout. Stop.

62
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,790
Stalled. I think that back wounds stout
and never seen one of those before.

63
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,470
My time outside. Never. You never met her?
No, I didn't even know it was a thing.

64
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,240
They're savage.
Next thing you know they're going to be,

65
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,510
they're going to be like nipping at
your calves, trying to take you down.

66
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,950
That should be the American animal,

67
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,190
not an eagle weasels in Ireland
and here or everywhere else.

68
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,670
They're called short tailed weasels.
Oh,

69
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,960
so it's some kind of weasel weasels
are vicious little motherfuckers.

70
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,690
That's what I'm saying.
Like why are weasels like the wheat?

71
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,890
So think about like Pauly shore
and he would do the weasel.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,290
You thought of him.
We sell in.

73
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,410
You didn't think of him as being a
ruthless killer of something 10 times and

74
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:28,360
size. Those are cute. Like if Pauly shore
was taken down, giant bitches, huge,

75
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,260
25 feet tall women and just smashing them.
