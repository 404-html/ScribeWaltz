1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,370
When you retired from the
military, was this, um,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,340
did you envision yourself doing
something along these lines,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,420
like teach and tactical stuff or, oh man,
I went through some rough patches, um,

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,480
as most guys do. Right?
Yeah, man, man, it was, no,

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:15,870
I,

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,850
I morphed into who I am only in
like the past six or seven years.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,080
I retired,
no five,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,470
I got hired before even retire by
a corporation to do training stuff.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,550
And um,
I kind of fell,

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,560
I was almost falling into that
Rut of accepting mediocrity.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,470
Plus what I didn't know is
that, uh, I had depression.

12
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:47,490
I didn't know that because he no idea,
which is common,

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,450
especially in like the SPEC ops world
guys retire because you Ben there in,

14
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,570
in units with guys with
the same guys for a long,

15
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:01,710
long time and you've,

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,500
there's a level of intimacy there that
can't be replicated with another human

17
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,870
being.
And then when you retire,

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,720
you miss that comradery,
that connection. Um,

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,460
so I had working for a
corporation, um, I was,

20
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,750
uh, had a really bad relationship. I was
living in the bonus room and my garage,

21
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,751
I'd lived there for five years because
I had a ex who was on chemistry,

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,380
you know, prescription
meds go big Pharma. Um,

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,690
and so the neuro receptors were freaking
gone. I mean, delusional and, and, uh,

24
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,100
it was, it was a real bad. Uh,
and then I started at Booz and,

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,550
uh,
with depression and I,

26
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:51,700
it didn't even occur to me that dude,
you got to fucking problem.

27
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:55,050
Man didn't even occur, I guess,
which is common with a lot of guys.

28
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,410
But I had an epiphany.
A lot of things happened at one time.

29
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,010
My local cops saved my life.
They said, Bro, you need to
get the fuck out of there.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,380
Um, and a bunch of things
happened all at once.

31
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:12,110
And this was in 2013.
Um,

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,160
I didn't want to leave because I had
little kids, so I didn't want to, I was,

33
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,460
I was gonna stay there
and just wither away.

34
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,960
Um, I, and I almost
capitulated to darkness,

35
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,850
but I got up before I went
to sleep one night. Well,

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,170
my kid is sleeping with me and I'm
hammered. And it's like eight at night,

37
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,300
you know, and uh, and um, I had an
epiphany. I said, you know what, I can't,

38
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:44,130
I can't do this and I will not. I remember
saying this to myself, I will not,

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,280
I will not be defeated.
I will not be defeated.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,620
And I put my running shoes by the side
of my bed and some shorts set my alarm

41
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,100
clock, got up early next
morning and went for a run,

42
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,840
I la Forrest Gump.

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,120
And I pound the pavement for about 10 or
12 miles. And I'm not a runner, you know,

44
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,280
I like to run. I like to spirit.
And when I came back from the run,

45
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,980
worked out in my driveway
for about an hour and, uh,

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,060
my local cops came all
happening the same time. And uh,

47
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,990
they came and said, hey bro, get the
fuck out. The kids would be all right.

48
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,110
You need to do this and that. And, um,

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,390
and then I started, uh,
kind of figuring out

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,340
re, uh, reevaluating my path
in life. Oh, back up a step.

51
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,270
I also got laid off from this
corporation and you know,

52
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:43,390
with a guy in the military, you don't,
you don't ever think about job security.

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,320
And whenever tired,

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,030
I'm working for a corporation that was
mostly made up of a retired military guys.

55
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,060
So you get laid off and you're like,
what the fuck am I going to do now?

56
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,130
What does that even mean? Getting laid
off? I don't, what am I going to do? Um,

57
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,500
so all that shit happened at
the same time. It was like a,

58
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:04,501
it was like this massive spiral of
bad events and a man I was able to,

59
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,124
um,

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,930
I was able to rekindle my own,

61
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,640
my own, my own fire because I recognize,
all right bro, you still got an ember,

62
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,150
you still got this. All you need
to do is just nurture that amber,

63
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,230
turn it into a flame,

64
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,360
turn that into a flame and then just start
adding would add would add wood until

65
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:32,860
it becomes just a perpetual, uh, blaze.

66
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,180
And which led me to this thing that I
tell people now, you know, is that, uh,

67
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,350
you got to keep the blaze alive.
Um,

68
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,510
I've got that on t shirts
even because I like,

69
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
I like to kick people in the ass who are
willing to sustain their own fire once

70
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:55,210
they get that ass kicking.
If they can't,

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,600
if they can't keep their fire going,
then it's not worth,

72
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,910
it's not worth it for me, you know,
to, to keep kicking him in the ass. Um,

73
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,470
but uh,
yeah,

74
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:13,471
so ever since that point
in time and you know,

75
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:18,010
getting laid off to
depression, the booze and, uh,

76
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,700
I was able to read, discover
me and rebrand and, and um,

77
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,500
pretty much start from scratch.
I mean,

78
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,300
I had to start life all over again
when I was 48 years old. Wow.

79
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,220
You have the whole thing from scratch.

80
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,390
And I discovered like social media and
all this stuff because I've met a gal and,

81
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,500
um, I'm married to her now and
she's probably the best purse,

82
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,390
one of the best human beings I've ever
met, you know, all around human being.

83
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,560
Um, so she was able to help me with
that and said, hey, you need to do this.

84
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:55,360
You need to get this social media
platform. Or that one. And so it's,

85
00:05:55,361 --> 00:06:00,110
it's, it's detonated pretty
well considering I bet on
a short amount of time.

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,120
Um, but apparently, uh, the
messages resonating. Yeah.

87
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,343
So

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,900
it's a genuine message.
That's why I picked up on it,

89
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,280
but I'd love that you figured
you shit out. I love that.

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
That's my favorite thing
when, when, I mean, look,

91
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,900
everybody's prone to mistakes and prone
to depression and people are prone to

92
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,130
hitting rock bottom.
Yup.

93
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,690
Your life can go down a series of bad
roads and you find yourself in a bad

94
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:32,070
relationship or a bad job, a bad
situation in life. And it's very,

95
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:36,810
very difficult at that moment
to have faith and confidence
that you can readjust,

96
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,400
reconsider, and reengage.
And that's what you did.

97
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,460
That's awesome. I love that.
I love those kinds of stories.

98
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,050
I love when people get their shit together

99
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,750
and I think that

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,390
that helps me help other people
for sure. You know, cause I could,

101
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,040
I could relate and I don't,
you know,

102
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,420
I don't sit down with them and pat
them on the shoulder and say, hey bro,

103
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,380
you know, I was there too. Or anything
like that. I don't even share with them,

104
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,530
but I empathize and that's
sometimes that's all it takes.

105
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,390
He empathize and um,
and you just give them just,

106
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,730
just, just that, just a little bit of
the right advice. Just a little bit,

107
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,683
you know,
not too much.

108
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,180
Well, oftentimes people just need
momentum. They need one good. Right.

109
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,640
You need one day.
That's what I said to that one guy.

110
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:28,120
Just come to the gym one day. Yeah. If
you want one, good day, we eat clean.

111
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:31,660
You drink lots of water and you like,
you did, you got that day, you woke up,

112
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,190
you put your shoes on,
you went for a run,

113
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:35,800
you worked out your driveway if
you got a good day. Yep. Yep.

114
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,290
That's sometimes all you need to do and
decide, this is what I do from now on.

115
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,950
I have good days.
Tomorrow's going to be another good day.

116
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,690
And then I'm going to force
myself into another good day.

117
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,730
And the next thing you know,
I've got some momentum, right?

118
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,800
You've got some momentum. You
can change everything. I've,

119
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,650
I've felt many times in my life I've felt
like I could slip the wrong way and I

120
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:58,000
just, I see it. I see the dark hole and I
go, fuck that and just go the other way.

121
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,390
Go the other way. The problem is,
and people fall into that dark hole.

122
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:04,210
They think that that defines
them, but it's, it doesn't, right?

123
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,760
It doesn't define you.
It's just you right now,

124
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:08,650
you could be totally different tomorrow.

125
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,060
You are a human being who can think
you can adjust and there's so much.

126
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,750
It's one of the beautiful things
about your Instagram page and many,

127
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:20,080
many other Instagram pages
is that you can take,

128
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:24,010
if you curate your feed correctly and
you don't follow a bunch of knuckleheads,

129
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,780
you can go to your Instagram
or to whatever social
media platform you like and

130
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:31,650
you can go and check out a
lot of cool shit. Oh Man.

131
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,310
You feel you feel good about it.

132
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:35,920
You get fired up and you want
to do good with your life.
