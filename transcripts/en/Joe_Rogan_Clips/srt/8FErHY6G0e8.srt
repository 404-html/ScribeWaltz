1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,330
The joe rogan experience. Right,
and there's two on each one,

2
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:08,830
so it literally might be 200 for
fucking pumps. Well, that's crazy.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,150
Why doesn't Chuck Norris Make Jeans? Sears
too. Awesome. He used to, he didn't use,

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,040
did I still own a pair of Brown? Let's
see these. I'm not alive any. No,

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,520
not anymore, but I used to, they
used to only claim on these.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,000
The lace up in the front. They did? Yeah.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,710
The laced up in the front and let
you do sidekicks. There it is. Bam.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,710
It has a gusset.
Looks like Chris Irwin.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,060
They had a gusset in the crotch area.
I like that. The lace up at the front,

10
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:34,894
so I might be lying.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,220
That might be a little longer
in scene there for that.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,180
That cowboy boot kick back in the day,

13
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:45,490
they didn't understand
about barbell jeans.

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,490
They didn't have the time
of fabric technology.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,870
I do have a pretty good kick distance.
Have you ever seen mine?

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,760
I'm sure it's very long.
It is.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:58,330
We'll make a video at the
top of a doorway. Ooh,

18
00:00:58,331 --> 00:00:59,640
look at that and I'll dress shirts.

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,330
That gentleman right there
will always have my respect,

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,170
him and Bruce Lee or the reason why I
got into martial arts a hundred percent

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,090
today. Watch it. Chuck Norris
movies. When I was a kid,

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,420
one of my most proudest moments in my
life was in Chuck Norris. Dude, who I was,

23
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,140
I ran into him at a kickboxing event
in New Jersey like way back in the day.

24
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,390
And it gave me this big hug.
It was one of his events that he had.

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,200
He had a world combat. He gave me a
big hug and I was like, Holy Shit,

26
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,090
Chuck Norris knows who I am. Damn
right. It couldn't have been happier.

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:31,060
No wonder you're unbreakable. Soccer
was Beeman. And then we'll later,

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,200
uh, I took a picture of me and
Tate Tate again. Um, there was a,

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,270
a award show that they did for an old
school karate master and Chuck Norris was

30
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,670
there and a bunch of other, uh, old
school, American black belt karate guys,

31
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,300
and they're telling these awesome old
karate stores and asked me to be there and

32
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:53,620
speak a little bit. And
I would, uh, I mean, I do
anything for Chuck Norris. Like,

33
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:57,730
no bullshit.
Go corny as you want for watches.

34
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,880
Chuck Norris changed.
He changed my life for real.

35
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,400
If it wasn't for Chuck Norris Movies,
who knows?

36
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:06,520
I might not ever got into martial arts.
I've watched him like lone wolf,

37
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,260
McQuaid and shit. I was like, God damn,

38
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,490
that might be the coolest
guy that's ever lived.

39
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:19,510
Yeah.
