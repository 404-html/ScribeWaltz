1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,930
I just don't think you're ever going to
find anything that's going to recreate

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:06,400
the highs of like when you
knocked out your main tailor,

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,120
how the fuck could you recreate
that high? You can't, you can't.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,670
That combination when you pin them in
the corner and put them away and then you

5
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:17,880
walk away and you realize that you won.
Oh Holy Shit.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,390
And I don't even kicking us all going a
hundred miles an hour. You're up on that.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,790
I see the pictures all the time.
Pull that up.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,330
That would be with the
hands in the air and

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,280
people and you know that, that's
just, it was so fast. You know,

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:35,260
it took me
a while before I could,

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,530
I even know I walked out of my house and
I had them up, you know, on the side.

12
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:42,400
This was before I moved. I still live with
my parents at the time. And I did too.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,110
I had a pulpit at the house and I'd be
leaving to go to the gym or something and

14
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:50,390
I look over at the boats and um,
well, you know what, those are my,

15
00:00:50,391 --> 00:00:53,620
but it never really kicked in
until like a little while later.

16
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:58,310
Like those are my fucking belts.
You know, I did that, that I,

17
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,690
I'm the role champion and only I got one,
but I got three of them.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,670
When you're lying in bed that night.

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,110
Okay.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,540
You probably had to be going,
well, what am I in a fucking dream?

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,430
That's what it felt like it
is. What a fight this was.
God Damn, this was a fight.

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:17,260
This was one of my all time favorite
middleweight championship fights for sure.

23
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,230
And Jermaine Taylor, man,
he was a bad motherfucker.

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,810
He wasn't. And again, you know,

25
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:24,810
a lot of people talked about the
handful of ice before that and a tough,

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,160
you know, with smaller guys, but he
was a bronze Bellis who beat, you know,

27
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,010
Demand Bernard?
Huh?

28
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,760
There it is. Doom the combination
when you put them away too.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,620
Fucking phenomenal man. Phenomenal.
This right here when you want.

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,360
She goes all bore. I just put
my hands up. Yup. Fuck man.

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,930
I mean what that feeling,
they try to describe that.

32
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:50,030
Like what is going through
your head? Everything. Right.

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,980
Possible for him not to get back up.

34
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,800
I know it sounds funny when people will
say that, but that's the truth. You know,

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,220
my big thing was if I got somebody hurt,

36
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,490
get them out because boxing
is dangerous. Right. You know,

37
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,650
and anything could happen at,
they could get back up,

38
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,770
they have a chance that knocking
you out or beaten you. So,

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,560
but when it was over, like what does that
feel like? It's, it's hard to explain.

40
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:16,130
It really is. You're just,
you're, you're on cloud nine,

41
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:18,980
you just not negative bring you
down. You know, you're, you're, uh,

42
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,870
you went from being a pretty dope,
I mean,

43
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:25,700
is through the roof to being
a world champion to being
a huge superstar unboxing.

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,293
Yeah.

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,060
And, and it's hard to grasp at once
and it takes time. And unfortunately,

46
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,660
sometimes you get it when it's too late,
you know what I mean?

47
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,110
You really grasp it. And it's just one
of them things. It's, you know, even,

48
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,940
I was talking with a guy
last night and he brought up,

49
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:47,210
he was originally from South
Korea and he was talking about,

50
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:50,330
he goes there all the time, big
business guy and he says, uh,

51
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,400
they actually studied my fight down or
something on how you could get knocked

52
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:57,090
down. This is more of, you know,

53
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,630
in your field of up your alley how you
get knocked down a what gets a guy to get

54
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,540
back up and recover to recovery.

55
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,830
The endurance to pretty much have your
brain's rattled but be able to come back

56
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,910
that strong Brown's later and
knock somebody out. You know?

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,580
And for me to simpler answer is, you
know, of course training hard, you know,

58
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,860
making sure I'm in shape. But I guess
what he's trying to figure out is like,

59
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,480
what's, what's the brainwave
pattern? Why? I said,

60
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:27,370
what's the m drive that
gets you to do that?

61
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,390
What does the endurance of
the muscles and you know,

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,080
that's pretty deep thinking and a little
pass. I think there's a lot there.

63
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,880
There's a lot and there's no one,
first of all,

64
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,060
every combination that you get hit
with is different. You know, some,

65
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:44,330
some combinations you're just not going
to get up from, and some of them you,

66
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,930
you were on the border. Can you get up?
Can you not get up how bad you want it?

67
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:49,100
Maybe think about your daughter,

68
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:52,820
maybe you think about your mom and you
just kept this burst of adrenaline and

69
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:56,300
you're like, fuck this, I'm getting up.
Yup. And the referee gives you the count.

70
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,060
He just fight smart and keep
your hands up and keep moving.

71
00:03:59,061 --> 00:04:01,550
The next thing you know that cardio
kicks in and then you're back.
