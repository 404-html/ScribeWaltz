1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,450
Melanie griffith,
like her mom to be,

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,380
to be hindered was into lived
with live animals. Lions. Yeah.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:11,210
And I think Melanie Griffith got
a bit or scratched as a child.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,430
Yeah. In her early teens or something
like that. She had to have uh, you know,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,010
facial reconstructive
surgery? I believe so. Whoa.

6
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:21,980
I never heard there's a movie
that they shot. They shot,

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:22,880
I forget the name of the movie,

8
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,260
but they shot the movie
of them interacting with
the documentary about them

9
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,810
living with big cats. Yeah.
When you watch the video online,

10
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:31,330
it doesn't even look
real. Like, wait a minute.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,150
Wait, is that real? That's really Melanie
Griffin with lions and tigers and shit.

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,860
How many different cats that they have?

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:38,373
Right.

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,700
There was a lot. Right. I
want to say there was five.

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,890
So the kind of thing you just
asked people. How many cats?

16
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:47,740
I'm a big kits to be in the Griffith it,
yeah.

17
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,570
Looking at the article.
I think he's a wizard with that.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,170
Google pull it up so we
could see the photos. It's so
preposterous. Look at that.

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,870
That's crazy. That's crazy. It's crazy.
She's so fucking fun that looks to,

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,320
shouldn't that be the way life is?

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,000
You imagine if you're a burglar and you
broken at that fucking house. Holy Shit.

22
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,834
What a mistake.

23
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,330
And you break into a house and you
see a 600 pound African male lion just

24
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:15,320
looking at you with that
gigantic head of death. Fuck man.

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,970
The bizarre tale of Melanie Griffith
and her pet lion. Do they talk about the

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,323
attack?

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,380
Yeah,

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,150
but look at her spitting
water into the big cats.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,640
No one in the family was ever injured
by the lion. No one by that line,

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,490
by that one. Oh, Hi Neil.

31
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,280
But Neil certainly could have killed
any of them at a moments notice.

32
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,800
At one point,
he did attack Ron Oxley,

33
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:42,090
his owner during a dinner party
at his home. Fuck all of that.

34
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,390
After Neil, the family went
on to adopt numerous big cats.

35
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,980
It's resulted in a series of
serious injuries. 57 years old.

36
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:53,400
Melanie has learned from the
experience and runs a sanctuary.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,730
Okay?

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,800
She runs a sanctuary for 32 big cats. Oh
my God. Look at that thing on the desk.

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,900
That is so insane. First of all,
does that thing need exercise?

40
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:06,510
Just to keep it shit together.
Look at the size of that fucker.

41
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,150
You got to feed that guy a lot dude.

42
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:12,420
And only meet they're obligate carnivores.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,060
You know, they're not like a dog. How tall
he is in the fridge. Huge animal, man.

44
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,460
That's the point where I'm like,
I'm not working here anymore.

45
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,180
He's just laying around their house,
look at the fucking muscles on that thing.

46
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,640
And do you think they're like cats?

47
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,040
Like will they only shit where
they're supposed to? Shit.

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,740
You imagine the shit that
shit. Sorry. Once. Yeah.

49
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,680
The thing about the size of this
cat, I mean this is, it's crazy.

50
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,970
It's so big.
It's,

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,510
it must be a thrill to be around
something that could just kill you at any

52
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:42,344
moment.

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,540
And apparently lions in particular
are pretty cool with people. Yeah,

54
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,360
that's nuts. They're playing.
The lion has her by the leg.

55
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,020
She's jumping into the pool and it's
a fake biting her. Fuck all that.

56
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,690
Fuck everything about that picture. Put
that on a tee shirt with those words. Yes.

57
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,040
Look

58
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,770
at her. They were friends, dude, they
were buddies. You look at the young,

59
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:06,440
she looked, she looks, she's a kid.
She's in her teens at this point. She has

60
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,230
giant line in our yard. Um, get,

61
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,800
find the thing cooler was
there apparently than tigers.

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,870
Tigers are a little sketchier matters
a little sketchier like you'd have an

63
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:21,620
easier time owning a lion then? No.
You would have done, yeah. This is,

64
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:23,060
I'm talking way out of school,

65
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:28,150
but what I believe is the case is that
male lions are mostly there to protect

66
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,960
the pride. They're mostly there to,
they're not the hunters right there.

67
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:36,890
The bigger ones. The females do all the
hunting. What are the size of that female.

68
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,690
Oh my God. What's going on there in the
movie? It's attacking her in the movie.

69
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:44,930
Yeah, that's what I mean. That's what
the link, watch this close call below.

70
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,103
Yeah.

71
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,780
So it's biting her. It's got her mouth or
on the ribs. Is it actually hurting her?

72
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,840
She doesn't look happy. I'm
not showing it as, whoa,

73
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:01,380
this is crazy. All right, this is
fucked up. So this was in the movie.

74
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:03,510
They are freaking out to the
line was biting somebody.

75
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,310
It says the father refused to
yell. Cut. Oh my God. Yeah.

76
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,050
Oh my God. No blood was drawn in the lion,
grabbed her hair and pulled her back.

77
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,620
So the line was just fucking with her.
But he is dangerous.

78
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,000
He was once Claude to the face during
the filming that required required

79
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,680
reconnection

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,270
the GE story that I'd heard that she
was, fuck, there's so are responsible

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,860
and you know this several lines in
this house and it's not just one.

82
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,920
So the lions is their house. Yeah.
The lines are just running shit.

83
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,750
And I think they picked
him and these were,

84
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,110
there were lines that came
from like doesn't show

85
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,230
$17 million on the movie and it
brought back to bargain roar. Yeah.

86
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,670
After this podcast,
get ready for another 50 bucks.

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,510
And that's 17 how much?

88
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,170
1971 $17 million in 1971.
Yeah.

89
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,990
This is a nice way to launder cocaine
money, son. That's what's going on there.

90
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,050
What is that today? Like $80
million. Billion. Trillion.

91
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,440
Um, what I was saying was, I
think what happens is that lions,

92
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,910
the male lions don't hunt.

93
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,900
They usually just eat the kill
that the female lions Hunt Day.

94
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:12,840
They're doing all the hunting. But
with tigers, the male lions hunt,

95
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,830
like they're all hunt and they don't,
they don't operate in packs. You know,

96
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,920
they're not like independent. Yeah.
Rogue. Yeah, they're not, they don't,

97
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,430
they don't operate the same way. Lions
who don't have a pride, you know,

98
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:26,400
I'll think, I think tigers are
pretty much on their own. You know,

99
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,590
I think the females take care
of the cubs as long as they can,

100
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:33,300
but I don't think they have these big,
I could be wrong, fine off I'm wrong,

101
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,220
but I don't think tigers operate in like,
like that kind of a group.

102
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,280
Um,

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,610
in a world where like I've got a miniature
doctrine that means that somebody

104
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,430
genetically made that
dog smaller. Right. Well,

105
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:48,610
when you say genetically they're
not doing it through a laboratory,

106
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:52,600
they're doing it through selective
breeding can, it's remarkably effective.

107
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,240
And then you do that.
I just needed that to get to this point.

108
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,980
Can you do that with a tiger?
Yeah, baby tiger. Yeah. So

109
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,450
could you,
that's what happened.

110
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,600
All house cats have come from some
kind of wild cat that we turned into a

111
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:09,500
domestic cat. And there's a bunch of
different varieties of cats, right?

112
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,000
The difference between cats and dogs
is that all dogs come from wolves.

113
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,570
All of them. Every one, every
dog, every dog started as a wolf.

114
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,750
Tigers did not live in permanent groups
like lions do. For the most part,

115
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,630
they live solitary lives,
except when females are raising cubs.

116
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,610
Although rarely seen the term for
a group of tigers is a streak. Oh,

117
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,320
dope word is a streak of Tigers
and murder of crows. That's dope.

118
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,170
Um, retire when I was a kid and now I can
tell her mom, if there was another one,

119
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,130
we'd be a streak of tigers. Tigers. Fuck
things up, man. They all fuck things up.

120
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:47,270
All the males hunt and they're,
they're fast. Fuck an animal, man.

121
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,150
Oh, was this, was this,

122
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,070
got it. It's on youtube. He got
fucked up. We're also roars roar.

123
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,260
This is the whole movie. It's
on youtube if you like. Oh,

124
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,800
I just randomly click to a spot where
they happened to be attacked and the movie

125
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,730
is about how they have these big law.

126
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,350
What the fuck it seems
like I couldn't seen movie.

127
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:07,440
It's called the most dangerous movie ever
made. Oh my God, this guy's an idiot.

128
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,300
And when you say, they said, uh, father
yelled cut. That was Melanie Griffiths.

129
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,160
Dads,
let's do it.

130
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,271
This is crazy.

131
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,360
There are all these lions are fighting
for dominance and this guy is running

132
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,300
around in between them while
they're filming a shitty movie.

133
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,180
So crazy look get. It's like fuck
you bitch. Stand on my business.

134
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,103
Oh my God.

135
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,830
The blind just wanted them to know that
that little tree branch was not going to

136
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:35,750
stop him. Jesus Christ up
because it cut each other up,

137
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:40,580
man. They're biting each other fucking
each other up. It's what they do, man.

138
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,050
And this was a movie that was meant to
show how stupid the guy who has the say

139
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,920
roar is in 1981 American
adventure exploitation film
written and directed by no

140
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,160
Marshall Produced and starring

142
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,710
His real life daughter Melanie
Griffith and Marshall's real life sons,

143
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,290
John and Jerry.
Oh they were Brady bunch type family.

144
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,320
The film follows a family who are attacked
by a range of ravening jungle animals

145
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:11,740
at the secluded home of their keeper.
I always thought this was a documentary.

146
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,741
They were literally making a movie with
fucking real lions about how lions were

147
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,974
attacking people.

148
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
70 members of its cast and crew being
injured by the many predatory animals used

149
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:28,700
in the film, including its main stars,
sustaining life threatening injuries,

150
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:32,060
rating from bone fractures
to scalping and gang green.

151
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,620
Much of the footage capturing the injuries
was included in the final cut of the

152
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:39,350
film resulting in real blood on screen.

153
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,480
It has been considered the most
dangerous film shoot in history. Wow,

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,880
okay. We need to do a fight
companion. The appetizers as well.

155
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,470
Oh my God. Leopards or jaguars
where those jaguars are.

156
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:57,690
Leopards do know the difference to look
at the tag or they just look at them for

157
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,080
part of the world, but he just, he just
jumped in the boat. Yeah. Congratulations.

158
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,230
Thanks. Thing, hit him in the
fucking face while they have to.

159
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,870
I think you have to get it to think
who's boss that a panther. Oh,

160
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:08,940
of course it is.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Fuck all this feeling that the tiger
and then now the boat's sinking.

162
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,230
You fuck you. Fuck it. He fucked. This is
life of Pi. Oh my God. Look at that thing.

163
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:22,440
It's so big. All right. We're going
to do it for the companion. Oh Jesus.

164
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,510
So what we'll do is one day we'll do
a fight companion. Put that movie.

165
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,820
I'm like, save it. Yeah, we'll do it
this week. We're doing roar. Yeah,

166
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,920
we'll do roar.
He me in trouble for that.

167
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,070
Can we get in trouble for
a fight companion for roar
people that do things like

168
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:40,930
this? Yeah. No, totally. It's a, what
is it considered? It's commentary.

169
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:44,400
You're fine doing it needs to be seen.
That needs to be heard.

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm completely educated. I thought it
was documented there actually make,

171
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:50,340
they were trying to make a fix
of narrative of Pictionary.

172
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,410
I didn't even know there was
a documentary. I just do that.

173
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,620
She had lived with lions and I'd seen
it in a magazine article or something or

174
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:59,190
an online real dad. That's her
stepdad. Stepdad was fucking crazy.

175
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,870
Could you imagine your like Jamie kitchen
there with the line once you put that

176
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:07,740
evil on me, Jamie, oh my
God, what are the movie?

177
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,730
Look at all the cats in the room with her.
I don't know how many,

178
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,990
I can't fuck all that.
Fuck all that.

179
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,430
And they were crazy.

180
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,300
And I'm sure the cats are like confused
as fuck by the rolling cameras as well

181
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,770
being like, what is this all about?
Yeah, they're horrible. It's,

182
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,930
I mean those are the,
that's the cleanup crew for the world.

183
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,640
That's what cats are there out there and
taken out as as many of those fucking

184
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,650
zebras or water buffalo
or whatever they can.

185
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,870
And so that's what they
want to do all the time.

186
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,780
And if you're just feeding them
and then you just have met a yard,

187
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,770
they don't even do anything like you.

188
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:45,480
You got to exercise the fuck out of
those girls to keep them from just,

189
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,450
that kills lust that's in their body.

190
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,130
Like they evolved over millions of years
to get to this point where this through

191
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,170
this enormous hulking,

192
00:10:55,171 --> 00:11:00,150
supernaturally powerful animal that kills
things with its face and you just take

193
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,180
that away from them. It's, no, you're
going to be in the pool with us.

194
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,280
You're going to be in our movie. We are
going to start off in this boat, come on,

195
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:11,980
hop in the boat and pretend to fight. And
they're like, what? Pretend raw. This cat.

196
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,020
It's like when the fuck did the antelope
show up so I can start jacking fools.

197
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,900
Would you,
you're,

198
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,710
would you agree that since
you do more outdoors,

199
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:25,830
the activity that may I he running IEE,
you've gone hunting and stuff like that,

200
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,140
your chances of being eaten alive
are far greater than mine. Oh yeah,

201
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,810
100% it's like surfers.

202
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,700
I'm in a 0% chance and most of my
life of getting eaten by a shark.

203
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,810
But I have friends who are surfers who
surf all the time and they fucking love

204
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:45,600
it and they're willing to roll that
dice cause they like surfing that much.

205
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,780
And I'm like, you know, you can't get bit
by a shark if you don't go in the ocean.

206
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,290
And they're like, we've got the
shark thing figured out and defeated.

207
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,140
Just don't go in the ocean.
They say [inaudible]

208
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,020
worth it. I gotta tell you, man, like I,

209
00:11:57,021 --> 00:12:01,070
there's a bunch of bad ways to die,
but I always felt like the,

210
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:06,160
the most indignity I would ever feel
in death was if I was something else's

211
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,180
food.

212
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,110
It's one thing if I'm like my body goes
into the earth and fucking the worms and

213
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,250
the grass and shit like that,

214
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:17,251
but to be someone's fucking
meal is so it's a temporary,

215
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,160
a permanent solution
to a temporary problem.

216
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,190
Your life for their meal of the moment
and they're just going to shit you out in

217
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:27,940
a couple hours.

218
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:30,690
And that's why I think it's
hard for humans get their
head around being eaten by

219
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:33,220
something because they're
like, no, I'm too special.

220
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,660
And then they'll just
going to poop me out.

221
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:38,860
But that would be the indignity man is
like, fuck, they ate me to stay alive,

222
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:42,760
I guess. But then it's not
like I sustained him forever.

223
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,430
Like I sustained them for a couple of
fucking hours and they shipped me out.

224
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,453
Yeah.

225
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,560
That is how it works. Right? Yeah. Um,

226
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,400
it's very disturbing seeing images of
humans that have been eaten by animals.

227
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,450
I've never seen an
antique don't want to do,

228
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,130
you don't want to finger is
starting to move toward a
keyboard. Be like, no, no, no.

229
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,250
Classic one of a body that they found
that bears at Eaton and I was horrific.

230
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,970
It's just crazy to look at. Does
it even look human anymore? I mean,

231
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,540
you know what it is because it was still
wearing sneakers and it's still at heck

232
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,650
half of its pants on and it's
still like, you know the one, yeah,

233
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,460
you could see the thigh bone. I mean
the, the, the meat from the bone,

234
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:24,510
it'd be completely stripped off and it
was just nothing but the thigh bone and

235
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,150
it's just horrific.

236
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,830
You gotta realize like those things,
man, when they get a hold of you,

237
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,250
the amount of like the amount of
power that a bear could generate,

238
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:36,660
like especially at grizzly bear.

239
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,520
My friend John saw a grizzly
bear kill a moose by swatting it,

240
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,020
swatted it with its paw and broke.
It's back a moose.

241
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,060
I mean, second deadliest animal on
the planet big. Is it really? Yeah,

242
00:13:51,061 --> 00:13:52,800
right after the hip.
And that crazy.

243
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:55,440
Nobody thinks about it because when
you think about the Moose, you look Oh,

244
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,041
hey rookie,

245
00:13:56,041 --> 00:14:01,041
which hippo is the most dangerous animal
to man on the planet in terms of like

246
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:04,820
how many people get killed animal.
The second is the Moose. Wow.

247
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,110
Part of the deer family.
Well, that's crazy.
