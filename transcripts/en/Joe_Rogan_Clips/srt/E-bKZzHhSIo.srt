1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,870
Her low freak bitches. So, um,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,100
your podcast.
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,450
Was the big podcasts
that kind of Sunk Milo.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,130
It's kind of a combination of Mama and
yours. And I remember it was years,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,280
it was me watching him on your show that
led us to ask about that because I saw

6
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:22,800
him on your show and he
was like God at the time.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,960
Cause I remember at the time he
was on our show, uh, I told Paul,

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,520
one of my cohosts like Paul,

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,750
this guy ain't no lightweight and he's
got a huge army of sycophants right now.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,030
If you get in a debate with him,
if you lose, you're a total bitch.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,920
If you tie, you lose. If you
win by a little, you lose.

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,310
The only way you can actually beat him
with his army of sycophants at this time

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,870
is if you just demolish him. So don't
even try. You were concerned about this,

14
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,480
like this is like something
you planned out in advance. No,

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,580
I mean I wasn't really,
it wasn't really a plan.

16
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,490
I just wanted to bring it up cause I saw
him on your show saying and I'm like,

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,320
that's very strange. I kind of knew
where he was coming from. Sure.

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,510
Cause I knew that he had had experiences,

19
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,360
like sexual experiences when he
was younger and he was kind of,

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,690
I think he was trying to trivialize them
and turn them into humor. Yeah. I mean,

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,530
you know, his way of dealing with
it or whatever. Um, you know,

22
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:22,790
say like I owe me and it was
mutual between me and the priest.

23
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,280
I was molested by a priest, but I was
into it. So it was cool. He was like,

24
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:31,200
I was the predator. Yeah. Like he
said, Deuce the priest, you know? Yeah.

25
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,040
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine a 13 year old boy,

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,430
no matter how flamboyantly gay
or sexually aggressive, uh,

27
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,580
you know, jumping the priest
bones or something, you know.

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,670
Well I think it,

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,670
it sort of gives you a better
understanding of how this guy came to be,

30
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:56,181
who he is today and why he's so relishes
this role of being the contrarian and

31
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,170
being this,
uh,

32
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:03,171
this sort of very difficult to pigeonhole
gay man who's very conservative but

33
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:07,950
yet believes in man. Boy Love. This is a,

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,640
if you go back and you read old articles
that he wrote for publications that he

35
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,490
worked for in the past,
um,

36
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,270
there was a lot of stuff like we're going
to take on bullying on Twitter and you

37
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,210
know, we need to make a safe
space for people online.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,010
This is Milo and now, yeah,
he's like the biggest troll.

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,870
Right? Uh, I mean we talked
about Milo last time.

40
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,560
Uh, I was on your show and you told me
you kind of put the seed in my brain,

41
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:42,180
like [inaudible] kind, Kinda like
fake. And the more I've looked into it,

42
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:44,850
the more I have to question whether
or not that shit with the priest even

43
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,910
happens to begin with. Yeah.
Because I just don't, I don't know.

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,420
I don't really trust the shit that comes
out of his mouth in terms of like face

45
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,710
value. Right. And I think a lot of
times when Milo tries to make a point,

46
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,610
um, he doesn't necessarily
make it by directly saying it.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,060
He tries to make it through uh,
like performance art.

48
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,300
Like when he went on Bill Maher and um,

49
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,820
and you know, he, he's,

50
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,300
he's doing this whole flamboyant gay
conservative thing because he wants the,

51
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:17,980
the Liberal Bill Maher audience to
be like boom, boom. Cause it's like,

52
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,560
oh look what hypocrites.
They say they accept gays,

53
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,210
but the second you don't tow their line,

54
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,370
what they obviously like is people who
told their line, not gay people. Uh,

55
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,920
I think that was the point he was trying
to make. I thought it was funny too,

56
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:34,921
how Bill Maher the next day after my low
scandal broke was like I took him down.

57
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,840
It was me. It was his hand.
Yeah. It's like I took, I took
them down. It's like, dude,

58
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:43,360
you compare it. You said he was the
next Hitchens when he was on your shit.

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,760
He really said he told him to. I said,
I took him down. No, I took him down.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,420
He's a fool. That's such a foolish
thing to think. I don't, I,

61
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:57,010
you know what I think is what Milo does,
a lot of it is performance art. Yeah.

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,900
It's a lot of trolling and it's a lot of
very calculated stuff designed to sort

63
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,670
of rile people up and get people active
and get people to talk about him. I mean,

64
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:11,220
that's the reason why he does this
tour on colleges. I mean, why wilds?

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,070
Why not do it in the lion's den if
you want to get the roars? I mean,

66
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,700
he's doing it like where he feels
like this problem is the greatest. Oh,

67
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:22,090
he wants to stir that pot too because he
knows if he just does it and some club

68
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,210
downtown, there's not going to be any
protest and we're going to give a shit.

69
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,480
It's still protest, I'm sure, but
not like bringing it to their camp.

70
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,020
It won't be like what happened
at Berkeley? Yes. Yeah.
What happened at Berkeley?

71
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,150
It was just fucking insane.
It's really insane. Is that,

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,540
was it the mayor of San Francisco? That
was applauding the protests like, hey,

73
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,200
fuck face. There was $100,000 worth of
property damage. People throwing chairs.

74
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,330
There's Starbucks windows and light
and cop cars on fire like this.

75
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,770
This ain't good. There's been
articles on like the Huffington,

76
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,710
I almost made a video about this
article on the Huffington post actually,

77
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,230
that was basically like,
um,

78
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,410
violence is as valid or reaction to
Trump as anything. And it's like,

79
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,150
wow, you're literally just
advocating for violence. Uh,

80
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:08,710
and you think you're so enlightened.
Yeah. It's completely foolish. It's like,

81
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,450
it goes in once things
aren't going their way.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,930
It goes against everything they've stood
before. Before. What about kindness?

83
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:17,680
What about compassion? What about treating
people with love? What about facts?

84
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,660
Well, that's okay. When
they're in power. Exactly.

85
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:20,860
That's okay when they're in power,

86
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,640
but when someone else empowered that
they don't like it all kind of goes up.

87
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,840
Look, kind of goes both ways though,
doesn't it? Oh yeah, definitely.

88
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,670
[inaudible].
