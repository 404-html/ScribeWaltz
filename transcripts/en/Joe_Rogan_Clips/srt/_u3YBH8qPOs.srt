1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,420
That's silly. And what would you do
without the tourist? Yeah, you should. Uh,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,010
I think Roseanne's going to
actually fucking make money
off a macadamia nut farm.

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,930
I think she's going to be out
selling fucking nuts somewhere. Oh,

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,590
she never, she never, I think I told you,

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,010
she called me again and goes,
I am, I'm ready to do Rogan.

6
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,340
We've been going back and forth.
Right.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,070
Well now she says she's gonna do her
own podcast. We're going to do it.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,730
It's just going to take time. You know, I
told, this is what I told her. She said,

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,330
she contacted me the day says I'm ready
to do it whenever you are. I said,

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,610
you just tell me when and we'll do it.
And then we're trying to figure out,

11
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,630
I'm in Salt Lake City and I'm on,
I understand house.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,060
There was a little bit of that and then,
you know,

13
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:47,130
she's just trying to figure
out when's the right time.

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,980
But she said she wants to do her
own youtube channel and she's,

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,630
she's upset at everybody and,
and I felt like, you know,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,660
she's, there's a lot of merit
and what she's saying, you know,

17
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,540
I really do think she got
fucked over. I think, uh,

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,040
I really do think she made a joke about
a woman that she didn't know it was

19
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:09,540
black and a woman who's, I think
she's only one eighth black, right?

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,160
Is that what she did? I saw the picture
and I like, Oh, I get it now. She goes,

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,900
not talked to her on the
phone afterwards or she goes,

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,460
she was asking me for advice and
she said I, I really fucked up.

23
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,090
And I honestly didn't think she was black.
And then she goes,

24
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,700
did you ever deal ambien?
I go,

25
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,480
that's exactly why I stopped doing ambien.
And

26
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,230
I'm sure that's why she tweeted that.

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,400
Where I like to just talk about this
on Rogan Cause Rogan spends time,

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,570
you can explain stuff. Stop fucking
tweeting. Tweet where she goes,

29
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:48,000
hell I did take an ambien. Yeah,
you drink on Ambien and your fuck.

30
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,740
I can tell you a million stories
of normal people like fucking,

31
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,810
you know Judy Brown,
her husband,

32
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:59,811
Steve Marmel almost had a plane
grounded cause he on a flight,

33
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:04,650
he took an Ambien and had a couple of
bourbons and then just started going

34
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,620
fucking batch.

35
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:10,590
It has no recollection of it and I've
done stuff that was like minor where I

36
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:15,480
just had a very lucid
business conversation with
Hannigan after I'd taken an

37
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:18,500
Ambien on my,
like a light night of drinking for me,

38
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,340
which six or seven beers and I went to
bed and then I get get up 15 minutes

39
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:28,260
later and went out and had this very
lucid business conversation that I don't

40
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,930
remember it all and I brought
it up to him the next day.

41
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,820
Something we were going to talk about.
He goes,

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,040
we've talked about this last night.
He's like, yes, you came out.

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,140
I go, no, I went to bed.

44
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,650
But what you came out shortly after you
seem to vary like completely normal.

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Wow. Kevin James, uh, uh, he made dinner.

46
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,960
He, uh, went downstairs, made
his own dinner, cooked it,

47
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,010
ate it, went back to bed, got up in the
morning and was like, who the fuck cooked?

48
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,160
Yeah. And then they're there like you did.
He's like, no, I didn't. He goes like, no.

49
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,280
Yeah, you did look, hey, you throw
this away like you, you cook this.

50
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:10,150
Like what the fuck are you talking to
his brother? You remember my ax Renee,

51
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,960
her brother and his
buddy took some ambience,

52
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,750
had a minor amounts of cocktails,

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,850
woke up on a lawn in a neighborhood they
didn't know where they were geniuses

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,020
and that's where it was that one lucid
business conversation where you go,

55
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,370
that could have been me driving my car
into someone's front fucking porch.

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,310
So yeah,
I s I s I swore it off.

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,340
My Mom said that she took it and uh,
no booze,

58
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:43,960
just took the Ambien and wound
up drawing on a, a bathroom,

59
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,570
a carpet, you know, in
the little bathroom rugs,

60
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,880
just drawing on it with like lipstick and,

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,270
and nail Polish doesn't have
any recollection of doing it.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,150
Just drawing on it like a
little kid would, would they
pull out the nail Polish?

63
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:59,830
Just start. That's a weird
thing. It's called a hypnotic,

64
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:03,250
that's what they, they call
that, that category of drugs.

65
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,420
The other thing with Roseanne is like she,

66
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,040
well she got serious mental illness
and she's on a bunch of different

67
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,550
medications. Well she's got legit
multiple personality disorder.

68
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:18,520
She's talked about it and I don't
think they call it multiple personality

69
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:22,710
disorder anymore. I think they have a
new name for it, but it's just a noise.

70
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,500
Rebranding fucking mental
illnesses like come on man.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,220
It's like this is what it is.
It is multiple personality disorder.

72
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:33,250
She has a bunch of different
people and you know,

73
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,190
if you talked to people that had been
around her and see or switch from

74
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,170
personality to personality,
you realize like,

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,710
Oh and you know a lot of this
also came from head trauma.

76
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,010
She's one of several comedians that
became a different person because of head

77
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:51,100
trauma. I think she was hit by a car
as well. Sam Kennison, same thing.

78
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:54,030
Hit by a car and also she was
in a car accident. I don't,

79
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,770
I don't know if it was
child molestation or

80
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,050
rape and disassociative identity disorder.
That's what they're calling it now.

81
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,740
And she also can't fucking
tell the difference between
Twitter and a green room

82
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,060
because if every single
comic like was recorded,

83
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,030
the dark shit that we say in green rooms,

84
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,240
because we're comics and we
say the worst possible thing,

85
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,590
especially to make each other laugh
cause you go to the darkest areas and you

86
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:28,591
say all the wrong words and you say the
most racist thing to your black comic

87
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:35,341
friend and he says the fucking worst
thing to you about your fucking ugly

88
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:40,120
fucking teeth or you're fat
or you're fucking stupid.

89
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,180
And if she walked into the green
room and said that about that lady,

90
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,040
we would be laughing, right?
We'd be laughing. Especially
if we know who she was.

91
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,720
I didn't know actually saying something
racist. You'd look at the picture and go,

92
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't get it. I had no
understanding of who that woman was.

93
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:59,390
I never had heard of it until
Roseanne got fired. And I was like,

94
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,680
who is this lady? And she's saying
she's the Muslim Brotherhood.

95
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,730
And then Roseanne said, did she thought
she was Jewish? I was like, okay,

96
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,790
if you think she was black,
I thought she was Jewish.

97
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:15,530
And then I wa I looked at the picture.
I go, all right, well yeah, the fucking,

98
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,630
that's a,
that's not a cut and dry one.

99
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,320
If you read two years
of Roseanne's tweets,

100
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,340
that would not be the one that stood
out as if she just says fucking insane

101
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:31,790
stuff. That makes no sense all the
time. Did she say that Susan Rice,

102
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,350
she said she was a, a great big, uh, uh,

103
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,380
big ape with no a man.
Oh,

104
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:42,560
she's a man with giant
swinging eight balls.

105
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,970
This was like five years ago and then
five years later they give her that said

106
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,620
common can't believe she's acting crazy.

107
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,630
That's I completely fault ABC
seen a fucking cash cow that nope,

108
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,300
they,
they thought they could handle or hey,

109
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,110
we can make a lot of money
by giving a toddler a pistol.

110
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,130
We know what else she said. She felt
like she has promised not to. What?

111
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,490
She's selfish. She felt like she was being
removed from the creative process too.

112
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,120
Like there was a bunch of things going
on even before this and that this was

113
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,610
like one of the final steps,
but that they were,

114
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,640
she was having a hard time with the whole
process and she was definitely having

115
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,050
a hard time with being overworked.

116
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:28,640
She's like [inaudible] out about
the Illuminati and Zion is,

117
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,330
maybe we should get you out of
the writer's room. Would not,

118
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:36,680
wouldn't be a bad idea to do an episode
about her thinking that everything is

119
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,190
the Illuminati mean that's fucking gold
comedy there. There's so much there.

120
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,710
I had explained to her chem trails like,

121
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,430
but the thing is different than anybody
that I've ever talked to about these

122
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,710
kind of wacky conspiracy theories.
When I explained to her what, what,

123
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,640
how those clouds are made, she
went, oh, okay. She just let it go.

124
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,550
Like most of them don't fucking let
it go. If you tell them that, well,

125
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,810
you see those planes, they're spraying
overhead and you go, no, no, no.

126
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,530
It's the heat of the engine,
the condensation and the atmosphere.

127
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,420
It's actually creating a cloud.

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,530
It's just the water vapor and mixes
with the heat. Of this engine.

129
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,710
It makes clouds. It's all it
is. Roseanne discos. Okay.

130
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,160
Like just let it go like everybody
else, like bullshit, man.

131
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,730
There's fucking documents. There's
papers. The CIA's admitted it.

132
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,150
It's one of the hardest things in the
world when you get a stupid conspiracy

133
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:26,940
theory in your head. It's
one of the hardest things
the world is to just go, oh,

134
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,160
that might people shit.
