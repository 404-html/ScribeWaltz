1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,420
The joe rogan experience.
Colon colon cancer. Okay,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,090
so that makes sense. With the animas.
It's no joke. Fuck man. So he beat it.

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:13,440
That's beautiful. God it's, he's young
d at 50 you should all have like,

4
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:15,970
I had the gate, my fucking colon
leadership up your butthole.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,280
I got to clean but ho they stick
a tube up there. I had a candle.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,170
Did you like wrap your
legs around in your arms?

7
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:26,020
Like this year there was a private, what's
proud to come there? It's a private,

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,580
it's a private question.
Did you let get up?

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,110
He smelled like how long he's right
now showing you my doctor smells like

10
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,800
Cologne and he was a really nice
guy and he didn't wear gloves. Yeah,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,620
you're showing us how it's done Joe.
Like check this out.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,160
That's how you do it bro. And his
breath smells like pineapple. Yeah,

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,103
that's all I'm going to say.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,880
I was talking to a guy the other day
that had meant breath over shit breath so

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,400
confused. Told him that his
breath smelled like shit.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,350
And so he was eating mince but it wasn't
good enough. So it was like I was,

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,000
it was, you know what it was like,
man. It was like, it was confusing.

18
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,220
It was like there's two signals
that were clashing with each other.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,360
What's awful for the folks listening
at home that aren't broadcasters,

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,770
I'm not naming names,

21
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,840
we're not going to name any names to
broadcasts with somebody who's breasts

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,370
because they turned to you and you'd
have to stay close to him to stay in the

23
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,610
two shot. That's a problem. You
can't go, you can't react to it all.

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,831
And it is,

25
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:30,210
I brush my teeth like religiously when
I'm doing camera stuff because I'm in

26
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,600
someone's face talking to them and I've
been on the receiving end of that and

27
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:37,710
been like this,
you can't do it after shows.

28
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,020
When you take pictures guys,
that's got to be girls. And guys,

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,650
sometimes you're just like, God
dammit, I don't know what's going on.

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,300
They say when people don't eat a lot,
like if you, uh, yeah. Is that real?

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,830
Like if you, a few things I
know with a chronic halitosis,

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,180
apparently it's the sulfates on your
tongue. Whoa. There's a, there's a so,

33
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:01,170
so typically I guess the,
so the chemicals,

34
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,860
I guess the sulfur that everybody has
different compounds in their mouth and for

35
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:08,280
whatever reason, I don't
know. But they're there.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,750
They essentially what you're smelling
is sulfur is a derivative of sulfur,

37
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,643
some kind of assault.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,430
And it's because there's
a chemical problem in your
mouth and they can actually

39
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:21,710
address it with yeah. And I
was like, tell him to tell us,

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,400
this can also be from bad from liver
disease. So if you have a liver disease,

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,970
you don't shut liver disease,

42
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,360
diabetes, liver disease, stuff like about
the breath. Wow. Wow. That's interesting.

43
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,810
Yeah. That's one of the
ways they check. Yeah. Whoa.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
And then of course it can be
uh, an abscess behind your
tooth and all that. Yeah,

45
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:47,820
that's a big one, man. That's
what everyone's [inaudible]
and diabetes diabetics.

46
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,600
Dude, I had a cracked filling and
they took the filling out. Oh.

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,170
And the fucking smell that came
out of my mouth, I was like,

48
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,780
Holy Shit.
Cause the,

49
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,790
the filling had cracked
and there was an infection.

50
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,680
I had a wound up getting a root canal.

51
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,160
And so as I'm getting this
list thing like opened up,

52
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,150
they break through this pocket.
We're all this puss and rot is, yeah.

53
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,200
Oh Dude, it was so nasty. Sounds awful.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,760
It like you could hear it like pop
through and then just this fucking shit

55
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,930
breath. They can't fires. My
father is fine. He was sleeping.

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,010
His wife said,
you have to go to the dentist said,

57
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,290
why does your breath is so out of control?

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,680
And they'd been married for 25 years.
So he goes, Jesus. All right, so, so,

59
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,893
so check this out.

60
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,220
This is so apparently he had an abscess,

61
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:44,140
a sack of bacteria in the back of his
mouth. Well, when they, when they,

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,550
I guess took the tooth out of the
filling out and they popped by accident,

63
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:52,890
the sac,
the nurse threw up

64
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,950
fucking dentist. The dentist
walked into the room at that moment

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,430
and through to fuck up as well.

66
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,350
[inaudible]

67
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,770
was a double vomit fest.

68
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,060
She didn't be better if
she just puked when boom

69
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,600
in the desk walk in. And when
he had his mask on, he went,

70
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,960
he got to got messed up. Just
barely diamond. I like that.

71
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,460
Oh my God,
that's so cool.

72
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,040
I never had the balls to tell
someone that breath stay with them.

73
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:41,580
You have, if you work with
them, you have to help friends.

74
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,230
I would want them to tell
me like your breath stinks.

75
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,570
I'm going to tell you and I
would want you to tell me.

76
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,560
It's one cool thing about black
people. They'll tell you they will

77
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,730
lay it on the, I have no block
or some shit. Fucking pussy.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,520
I once got head from a
girl. They would, she was,

79
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,580
she would come over and give me a massage.
She wasn't very good looking,

80
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,620
but she was down and give them a song.
By the time you're done with the massage,

81
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:07,570
she knows she's going to get to,

82
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,820
she wanted to give me oral pleasure
long time ago, but she used her teeth.

83
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,870
Oh boy. I didn't have the fucking
courage to tell her that. I'm like,

84
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,760
I was enjoying it, but I was like, ah.

85
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,230
She's looking at me.

86
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,250
[inaudible] every time
she came over right.

87
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:33,284
Here we go.

88
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,310
[inaudible]

89
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,620
a girl's pussy can reek and
I'm not going to tell him.

90
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm not telling me, I don't know.
I gotta be a gentleman, but okay.

91
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:59,300
But if you're a girl and you, you have
a problem, you have a yeast infection,

92
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:02,320
and if someone doesn't let you know,
you're not going to get treated.

93
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,390
Like there's a problem. It's true.
It's delicate. It's a delicate surgery.

94
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,910
What's happening is you're not always
going to get a rational reaction.

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,180
Thank you.
Medically I feel much better.

96
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,230
That's not going to be the action
mad at you. Isn't that weird?

97
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,720
They'll get mad at you if they're
pussies. Well, there was a girl that,

98
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:19,160
I was in New York.

99
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,180
I was a young man and
she was very sexy and uh,

100
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,570
I feel like the incredible hulk,
how music should be playing right now.

101
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,360
She met me with a hat on. I remember
this weird thing. She me with a hat on.

102
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,810
I picked her up and she goes, good. Thank
God. I thought you were going to be bald.

103
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:36,560
I was like, it was like 20. Thanks.
Thanks. All right, whatever. To ballgames.

104
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,670
And she and I,

105
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,440
we got to business and then she began
to give me oral pleasure after she was,

106
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,190
I had gotten her kind of
naked and she and Harry,

107
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:49,010
but she had a hairy back.
Like you know,

108
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,640
some people can be super dark
hair and it was far as that.

109
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,080
It was fine for buying firms.
Very girl it was girl for,

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,170
but it's still a problem bro,
because they, the hair fanned out.

111
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,160
It started with the back end.

112
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:05,690
It was on the old rumper still skins and
that was very hard for me to keep it.

113
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I couldn't, I had to avert
my eyes. The only black girl.

114
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,430
What was the instinct to laugh more? To
be like she, here's what the instinct was.

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,530
No, she had a big Dick
not getting, but I'm,

116
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,860
no, no, it wasn't. I just kind of, there's
no way I was going to, what do I say?

117
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,320
There's no good way area on your back and
your rump. I mean, you know, I, I just, I,

118
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,690
I just dealt with it. I didn't pull
out a medical book on one girl though.

119
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,660
I liked her. Lots I'd add is
we'll end up being my girlfriend.

120
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,800
I showed her that she had a
B vitamin deficiency. Wow.

121
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,590
And that's why it was a really, that
was problems down there. Oh Wow.

122
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,980
She got all into vitamins. She was
a vitamin freak from that point on.

123
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:47,010
And you know what? She did her a
favor. I went on a date with a girl,

124
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:49,460
has the worst breath in the world
and I can't, and she was from,

125
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,100
I knew her in college and I
said to her friend, I said,

126
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,910
what happened with her uncle? You
want me to be honest? So I said,

127
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:57,680
our breath was so bad I could smell it
when we're standing at the elevator.

128
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,250
And she screamed. She went, oh
my God. We always felt that way.

129
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:05,270
And they were friends there and I said,
none of you told her her life is,

130
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,080
she'll never find somebody if you don't
tell her. I couldn't tell her. Right.

131
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:11,630
Guys will tell you quick like a
group of guys and I'd be like, Joe,

132
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:14,250
you got to take care of this now.
Yeah, yeah. I'm a guy friends.

133
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,940
But you couldn't say it to the
girl cause I just felt, you know,

134
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,900
I would thank you.
I think it's important you,

135
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:22,560
Paige vanzant loves that jump switch.
Kick that jumping roundhouse.

136
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,790
Kick to the fighting by the way, his
word. Yeah. Yeah. And Paige vanzant.

137
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:30,590
And who is [inaudible] Clark? What is
her first name? Ooh, nice leg kick.

138
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,430
Jessica Clark. Is that it?
You just make that up? No,

139
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,250
let's go to what you said.
It was like,

140
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,820
it was a chancellor tend to have a
