1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,500
The joe rogan experience.
They don't really get their news.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,200
They read the headline and then they act
like they're getting their fucking news.

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:09,750
They're not putting in the
time that aren't reading
the books and actually going

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:13,020
and reading a real newspaper
reading, you know, um,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,500
you know that gentlemen Piss it.
What pisses me off about politics?

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:19,980
I feel like it's the only thing where like
if you don't like, so if you don't, uh,

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,270
if Lewis doesn't watch basketball at
all and Jay watches every single sixers

8
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:24,640
game,

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,750
but then there's like a thing coming up
where like something about a basketball

10
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:30,000
game, Louis won't just like
start arguing with you.

11
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,800
Like not on how they need
to play this defense.

12
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,650
They need to go into a zone
cause you're like, yeah, I just,

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,450
I don't really know about that.
But for some reason with politics,

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,630
no matter how much anybody's not read
anything, they don't know anything.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,790
They have no problem. Just having
a hardcore strong opinion. Like,

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,710
because also you know about it,
right?

17
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,040
So when someone's like super
argumentative about it, like, oh, you're,

18
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,960
you're not even well-informed,

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,530
which is most of the case with people
that are really super aggressive about it.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,180
It seems like, I mean, do what they were,

21
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,560
they had this thing where they
were interviewing people at uh,

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,200
the fucking march for life.

23
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,590
I think they called it the anti
like gun control march. Well, no,

24
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,580
they were like all over, it's in a bunch
of different cities and how we saw it,

25
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,080
but it happened in a
bunch of different cities.

26
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,690
I think the big ones were in like DC
and I think there was one out here,

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,160
but there was this guy just interviewing
people and he'd go around and ask them

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,030
if they, uh, if they are foreign assault
weapons band and they'd be like, yes.

29
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,530
And then he'd go,
what's an assault weapon?

30
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,040
And it's amazing how many people
just didn't know. I'm not even,

31
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,650
whatever your take on an assault
weapon ban is, it's like,

32
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:33,651
how could you be for banning something
that you can't even define as just seems

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,070
benign have. Hold on a second.
Yeah, exactly. You're like,

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,910
they know that this is what it does.
They know,

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,070
they know it's a rifle that shoots people.
It's like a semiautomatic,

36
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,090
it's not a hunting gun.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,660
So rifle is designed to shoot
people like in a military situation.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,790
That's what it looks like.
So they're raw.

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,630
I mean like they don't know what an ar 15
versus an or whatever versus like what,

40
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,540
what's legal, what's semiautomatic,
what's, they don't know all the details,

41
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,560
but they do know that these are guns
that you kill people with. Okay, sure.

42
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,020
Fair enough. But I feel like there's like
a thing where there'll be like, well,

43
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,330
while I'm for a ban on semiautomatic
weapons, and they like,

44
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,730
so you want to ban handguns soon? They're
like, no, we don't want to ban handguns.

45
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,570
But that's the kind of guns
or semiautomatic weapons.

46
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:15,270
It's just like if you're going to protest,
read a book on it.

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,080
It's not just having a passive opinion.
You're like out marching, want to,

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,240
you know, they want to move
the ball down the field though.

49
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,380
And the more people that come out,
they have kids that are like, you know,

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,470
kids are in the fifth grade
walking out of their classrooms.

51
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:28,230
They don't fucking know what they're
talking about or what they're doing there

52
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,200
as a man. Sometimes there was a girl
with armpit hair. You want to fuck.

53
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,063
You know what I mean?

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,280
How many these political opinions
you don't mean that's true or dirty.

55
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,770
Harry feed those girls to the
Harry tone. Um, but I mean,

56
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:43,680
but how many of these kids,
this is a big one.

57
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,490
How many kids are against putting
kids on psychotropic drugs,

58
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,690
putting kids on unnecessary
psychiatric medications.

59
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:53,760
Parents dope their kids up all the time,

60
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,740
cause they don't want to deal
with some hyperactive kid.

61
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,990
Some kid has got some fucking power,

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,080
some energy bounce off the walls.
And I was in,

63
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,890
we were embraced the other
day, right before the show
we did. And there was a kid,

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,490
I mean the kid must have had autism or
or something or some extreme case of it.

65
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,060
Uh, but he was like, you know, he was
having some sort of violent episode,

66
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:16,750
I'm assuming,
but it was just a dad like commas day,

67
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,130
just sitting on a corner with his kid,

68
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,250
with a kid face down as the kids like
screaming and shaking and kicking his arms

69
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:25,230
and legs. And then I was just holding
the kid down and it was so hard to like,

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,100
I almost wanted to say something like,
I didn't know.

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,010
I know they don't ever really
like tell you what to do,

72
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,410
like what's going on in that situation.

73
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,500
And I kind of watch it for a minute cause
it looked like he was abusing the kid

74
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,960
for a second. But then you
kind of realize after like, oh,

75
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,530
this kid's gonna like hurt himself or
whatever it was. But that's like a,

76
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,630
that's like a really, really
hard thing. Yeah, I can,

77
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,370
I can accept more in the real extreme
cases where kids are like severe, severe,

78
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,360
severe problems,

79
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,390
but it seems like they're just happy
to like anyone's like hyperactive,

80
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:56,020
just this kind of loose things that are
Adderall. It's not a one or a zero. Right.

81
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,711
It's like there's,

82
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:00,940
there's varying stages of issues that
kids are going to have and some kids are

83
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,330
gonna need some kind of medication,
but they're definitely over prescribing.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,470
Definitely. I knew my, my neighbor had a
kid. There was nothing wrong with them.

85
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,140
It's just a fucking kid. And
they, they put him on Ritalin.

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,750
Adderall is a drug man. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's, it's not, yeah. I give it up.

87
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:22,180
My five year old, we snorted together. If,

88
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,560
if people don't get enough attention or
they don't have an outlet and they don't

89
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,660
know what to do with themselves,
they get wacky.

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,480
It doesn't mean you need to
give him drugs. Yeah. Some,

91
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,320
some of these people have
legitimate issues and they
probably do need medication

92
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,740
and some of these people just need to
find something that's interesting in life.

93
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,560
Yeah. Well, I think what you
were saying before about like,

94
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:44,320
why don't these kids look into that stuff?
I think a lot of times it's just like,

95
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,870
people want the simple thing and
you don't, you've got to actually,

96
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,300
this is a really difficult
question to get into this stuff.

97
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,730
Whereas if you're just like, oh,
I'm against guns, that's easy.

98
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,830
I think it's the same thing as
when people are just offended.

99
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,130
It's like you don't really have to like
read a lot. You don't have to know a lot.

100
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,000
You just easy to be right, and
you've got the answer. It's laziness.

101
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,160
People can just pick a side
very easily and go, cool.

102
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,280
Everyone's already defined what's on that
side. So yeah, I'm on that side. Look,

103
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,130
I did my work right.
Yeah.

104
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,160
Okay.
Okay.
