1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,800
Oh,
I have a unique perspective.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,530
My perspective is less and
less inclined to pursue it in,

3
00:00:05,531 --> 00:00:10,531
in the idea that it's a fight and more
to be able to pursue reason and to have

4
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:12,240
everybody communicate with each other.

5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:16,040
Because I think part of what the fuck
is wrong with all of us today is that

6
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,880
people are so willing to take sides,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,600
so willing to join teams and so willing
to fight about shit that they really

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,220
don't have

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,710
fight about trying to beat me. I
wanted to say this. I'm a sad cause.

10
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:26,544
It's just so powerful.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,080
I don't dislike Donald Trump and I
think he's done some good things.

12
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,390
I'm trying to do piece and trying
to get jobs back to America,

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,310
but I hate Donald Trump
because I got behind him was,

14
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:42,330
I knew Hillary was bad and then he
became my identity. He is not a bad guy,

15
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:47,331
but the truth is I hate him more than
Hillary Clinton because he's who I am now

16
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:52,431
and whatever he does is who I am from
North America and freedom and everything

17
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,770
else.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,500
And I'm not throwing him under the bus
to get George Soros on my back though.

19
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:58,140
They're already asked me for the,
for the reasons I'm not with them.

20
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,450
I'm not against even Trump,

21
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,170
but I get in a fight like this that's so
dumbed down that then no matter what I

22
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:09,600
do, they take my radical illness,
my weirdness to hurt Trump.

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,440
But then all it does is like
radioactively attack me. I don't,

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,030
I don't know how to describe it,
but it's like I,

25
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,530
it's like Trump is breaking my legs every
day and it's not like I'm not willing

26
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:23,190
to go through the pain except a lot of
what he says I don't agree with and he's

27
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,170
not my identity.
Shani hooks not mine.

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,520
Your own personal perspective, and I
appreciate that, that he's not your dad.

29
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:33,520
I don't know how many people actually
think he said he's your identity,

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,430
but I think that what we're getting
at that's important is that we don't,

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,690
no, when they're shooting at me,
they're going to Trump. I'm sure.

32
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:43,150
I'm sure there's a lot at all.
Mine's the shooting at Joe.

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,340
It's that I'm not Donald Trump.

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,710
I understand that from you,

35
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,830
but what I'm talking about is
just the human race in general.

36
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,360
If we could just do one thing,
be reasonable,

37
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,340
just be reasonable and understand that
emotions cloud judgment and that when

38
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:02,790
people start screaming and yelling at
each other and you take one side and

39
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,310
you're the left and this guy takes
another side and he's the right and you're

40
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:07,340
going back and forth to mindless,

41
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,980
it's nonsense and you don't ever get
anything solved and you never get to

42
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:14,310
understand how that other person thinks
and feels and we're constantly trying to

43
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,144
mock people.

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,030
And what you were talking about about
the bill Maher thing about him cracking a

45
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,520
joke and I dismissed it as a
joke because it was a joke.

46
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,980
He's talking about how the red states
wish they were the blue states and all

47
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,490
that shit. That's that's exactly the
type of thing we're talking about though,

48
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,211
that that,

49
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:32,040
that that US versus them that me versus
like you're generalizing for entire

50
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,660
swaths of the country is if there was,

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,680
I feel bad every time I
say California is lost.

52
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,930
This is a beautiful state
and a lot of great people.
