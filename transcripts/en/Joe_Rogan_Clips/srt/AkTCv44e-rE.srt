1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,750
The joe rogan experience,
you know,

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:08,751
the styles of behavior and methods of
expression are being criticized and

3
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:13,380
critiqued. It this really radical
way and I think it's good.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,230
I ultimately, I think there's a lot of
batch, I'd say it's good, but the, the,

5
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:20,220
the sentiment is good.
You know,

6
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:24,870
I think the reaction and some
of the overreaction, like
there's a spectrum, right?

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,570
There's, there's always gonna
be like, did you see the,

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,571
there was something that came
out yesterday from Portland
State University where

9
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,880
Peter Buck goes in and James Damore,

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,540
the Google memo guy and a Heather hiring.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,620
She was a professor at Evergreen state
and I remember with the Jordan Peterson

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,430
gas, and she was actually on my
podcast last week with her husband,

13
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:50,340
Bret Weinstein.
Weinstein can't stay Weinstein.

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,660
I'm not thinking of the same person.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,840
I was thinking of the person who got
fired because of, she did not get, fuck,

16
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:57,630
she ain't get fired, but she criticized
her for playing a Jordan Peterson thing.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,540
Is that the same person?
No, no, no. That's Lindsey
Lindsey something. Yeah, sure.

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,030
She was in a different
university. Okay. Laurie.

19
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:10,740
Yay Canada. And in Canada,
another university in Canada, um,

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,030
this is important.
Anyway,

21
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:16,590
so they're in the middle of this
conversation and Heather, who is a,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,210
she's a biologist and she starts going
over the biology of the differences

23
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,510
between males and females
that are just undeniable.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,740
And these kids get up
and they started yelling,

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,240
this is bullshit and fuck you and power
to the people, all this crazy shit.

26
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:38,241
And then they tip over the sound
system and they're the most hilarious,

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,660
classical, liberal, progressive
lefties, green hair.

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,100
The guy has like this poofy Afro and he's
like, you know, we don't tolerate Nazis,

29
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,730
man. Like this is a fucking Nazis
or biologist. He's a shit, you know,

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,673
that's,

31
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,540
that stuff is the kind of stuff that
I think turns people off to the left.

32
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:57,960
Yes.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,610
And almost provides a gateway to the
right where all of a sudden people can buy

34
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,500
into and even broader,
right wing ideology.

35
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:08,190
Because if you look at the left and
that's your perception of the left is it's

36
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,550
the people with the pink hair or the blue
hair and they're just going around and

37
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,290
their whole point is to Ddi platform.
People are sensor,

38
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,160
people are screaming about Ben
Shapiro or whatever the case is.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,850
Like my whole thing is put,
if you're on the left,

40
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:24,450
and I think most lefties do this to be
fair, put the identity politics aside.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,770
Okay.

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,210
And let's talk about the things that we
actually already have a majority of the

43
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:33,390
American people with us on. So you
know, like a classic leftwing idea.

44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Let's have a living wage.

45
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,590
The minimum wage is not a living wage
right now and you could work full time and

46
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,150
not make enough money to survive.
Well,

47
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,240
if you're on the left and you go out
there and you talk about we need to fight

48
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,670
to try to get a living wage and
make our government work for us,

49
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,500
well then you get everybody
to agree with you.

50
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,350
Even most Republicans agree with
you and you can go down the list,

51
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:52,530
whether it's legalizing marijuana is 60%
of the American people are not with us

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,850
ending the wars.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,170
There was a poll that came out
in 2013 so it's old admittedly,

54
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,720
but only 17% of the American
people still want it to be in the,

55
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,810
in the war in Afghanistan. And we're still
there today. I'd imagine if anything,

56
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,730
that number probably dropped even
further and everybody's like,

57
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,130
what are we doing in
Afghanistan? Right. But it isn't.

58
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,770
The problem with polls is
when you ask people about it,

59
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:14,550
you're not asking them if they're
informed. You're just asking me.

60
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:15,820
You're just asking their opinion on it.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,560
It what I was saying is about the left
versus the right is that the real problem

62
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,420
is anybody can be on either,

63
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,570
so you're going to get these people
that are going to disrupt this Heather

64
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,740
hiring,
you know,

65
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,590
lecture on biology from an informed
scientific perspective and like fuck,

66
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:35,260
this man is a patriarchy.
You're going to get that,

67
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,360
but you're also going to
get people like yourself.

68
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,390
You're also gonna get people that are
aware of the issues and educated and are

69
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,600
debating this in a very public way and
trying to figure out what's the best

70
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,200
possible solution to these things.
The problem is anytime you have a group,

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,670
whether it's pick the group gun owners,

72
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,840
vegans, what are anybody can fucking join
match and as soon as anybody can join,

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,200
you can't look at like
the worst case scenarios.

74
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,730
The green hair dork that kicks over the
microphone because they don't like the

75
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:11,470
idea that Heather is speaking
logically about biology. Like you know,

76
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:16,120
you have to look at like the the whole
thing. Sure. And we don't like to do that.

77
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:18,880
We'd like to point at the green
hair dork and say, hey liberals,

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,640
there's your left share.
Exactly. And you know,

79
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,910
the breakdown to me is when
you look at somebody like that,

80
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,080
they're in the category of what I would
call authoritarian left because they

81
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:30,670
want to control other people's actions.

82
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,220
They want to shut down that speech
and say, your ideas are so dangerous.

83
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,100
I don't even want to hear it. There's
a whole nother contingent of the left,

84
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,440
which again I would argue is
probably the majority of the left,

85
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,940
which is the libertarian left, which is
people like me and many others who say,

86
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:45,340
listen live and let live on social issues.
I'm never,

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,610
even though I don't agree with Steve,
Steven Crowder bench Shapiro on anything,

88
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,710
I'm never going to,
you know,

89
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,010
try to protest to get them to not speak
their mind at a school is foolish and it

90
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,970
makes it look like you don't
have an argument when you say,

91
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,700
I can't let that guy talk.
And then they get to go around and say,

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm so persecuted because
I'm right. Right, right. You
know, meanwhile I say, okay,

93
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,420
you want to have somebody like that
go speak to college. Sure. Fine.

94
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,660
Let them speak. Let me get the
speech after. Well, it's good enough.

95
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,370
I mean I think open conversations
are critical and I also, uh,

96
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,500
I mean this is going to
probably be unpopular.

97
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,990
I don't think the way to do it is
in front of a large group of people.

98
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,110
I think you open yourself up
to a lot of grandstanding,

99
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,170
a lot of sang things just
for applause breaks a lot of,

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,640
there's a lot of bullshit.
It just,

101
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,610
it changes the nature of the
conversation because it becomes theater.

102
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,870
You're doing this thing in front of all
these people and you can hear a lot of

103
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,600
these times people say things like,
I'm a comic.

104
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:45,130
So I know when someone's saying things
for reaction, there's a way you do it.

105
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,690
Will you say it like this? And that's what
we want. And everybody goes, yeah, yeah,

106
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,441
you do not.

107
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,950
You do not talk like that when it's
just you and a person was just you and a

108
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,920
person.
You are just alone with your ideas.

109
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,720
And I think that is the way a guy
like Ben Shapiro and you know,

110
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,380
put whoever you want on the
left should have a discussion.

111
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,280
Yeah.
Um,

112
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,550
there's something about that,
that soft history, you know, like,

113
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,530
so you're not creating the best argument.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,520
You're just trying to sound like you
have the best argument. And you know,

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,490
Bill Maher, for example, does this where
he's very good at the punchy one liners.

116
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:19,920
Sure.

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,020
Like he's in a conversation with his
panel on his show and he'll be like blah

118
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:27,990
blah blah blah. And there was, that's his
style. I mean he's a comic. Say anything,

119
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:31,290
you just can't, it was like a quick
partisan hacky point you made.

120
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,930
But since people already agree with
you in the audience, they clap.

121
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,020
So it's hard to flesh out the ideas.
And really that's why, listen,

122
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:41,700
I've always said,
I'm not the biggest fan of debate because,

123
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,150
so I've done a few debates and
people online like when I do debates,

124
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:48,900
but I'm not the biggest fan of debates
because I think it's like the WWE of

125
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:53,520
intellectual pursuits where you go in
this person's whole point is to defend

126
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,260
this side of it. My job is to defend the
other side of it and it's like, okay,

127
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,940
clash. But it's like, okay,

128
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:04,941
well then when we come across an issue
like the fucking 64 genders on Facebook

129
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:05,910
or whatever it is,

130
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,570
and I actually might agree and my now put
in a position where I'm supposed to be

131
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:09,961
like,
no,

132
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,570
I'm going to disagree because that's the
format of the thing that we're doing.

133
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,460
Right.
It's just weird and it's not normal.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,060
I think that's actually very
important for both sides to do.

135
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,790
Like when there's something on
your side that you disagree with,

136
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:24,000
you should be honest about it.
And I even saying that,

137
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:28,140
that there's a side that there's sides
that there's our side versus their side.

138
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,910
We're, I think we're so inherently tribal
that we should resist any temptation

139
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,480
whatsoever to form teams,
especially about critical issues like it.

140
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,660
Really important social issues,
really important economic issues,

141
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:41,970
really important.
Civil rights issues.

142
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,360
These are just things that we should just
talk about without looking at them in

143
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:49,290
terms of, oh, the left wants this, so
I oppose it or the right ones this.

144
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,270
So I have to figure out ways to mock it.

145
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,820
Yeah.
Um,

146
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,920
yeah. I don't even know what to
say in response to that. I agree.

147
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,320
Would you say it's just,
you know,

148
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:03,380
it was when we were talking about this
before the podcast that like what I try

149
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,860
to do is have conversations with everyone.

150
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,550
I tried to have conversations
with nutty people like Alex Jones.

151
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,970
I tried to have conversations
with rational people like
Sam Harris. I like to,

152
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,570
I tried to have conversations with
all kinds of people, but without fail,

153
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,090
every time I have a left wing person on,
I'm some cock left wing.

154
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,970
You know what's going to happen anytime
I have a right wing person on, um,

155
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,700
some outright Nazi apologist.

156
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:32,701
It's like this weird inclination we have
to try to label and categorize people

157
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,710
and I try to resist those labels
as much as humanly possible. Well,

158
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,200
I feel like what you're really good at
is you can have on people who disagree

159
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,430
completely on stuff,

160
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,730
but you'll kind of find a nugget of
agreement in the conversation with that

161
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:53,120
person and then you can expand on that
and you can end up having a very nice

162
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:54,200
conversation and you're not,

163
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,530
you never really anybody on to try to
like brow beat them and tell them that

164
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,840
they're wrong on this issue or that issue.
You know what I mean?

165
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,470
So I have no desire to do that. I
don't know. I mean, look, I've had,

166
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,650
I've had a lot of arguments in
my life and I don't like them.

167
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,680
I don't think they're beneficial.
I mean, I think debate is good,

168
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,710
but every time I've ever been
in an argument with someone,

169
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,960
like a real argument always come
out of it feeling gross. Yeah.

170
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,050
There are times in life or
arguments are necessary.

171
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:23,550
There's times in life where you're just
faced with aggression or conflict and

172
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,530
you have to do something about it.
You have to meet it head on.

173
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,430
There are times and likely that,
but whenever you can avoid that do,

174
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,130
and I think a lot of what arguments are,

175
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:35,850
and I failed at this in my life many
times, but a lot of what arguments are,

176
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:38,790
is the way you've reacted to the,

177
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,580
the thoughts and the expression
that another person has.

178
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,260
And if you just reacted a different way
or approached in a different manner or

179
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,900
took it into consideration a little
bit more before you responded,

180
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,660
I think the conversation
could have gone another way.

181
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,410
And I think I'm learning how to do that
more and more as they get better at

182
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,660
podcasting it better at conversations,

183
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,810
learning how to just settle someone down
and learning how to genuinely be a nice

184
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,660
person. So I don't, I don't
want to like insult anybody.

185
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:11,040
I don't want to be in a disagreement
with someone. I want to discuss ideas.

186
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:12,880
Okay.
