1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,910
Okay.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,620
I certainly really surprised me learning
about the history of all this stuff.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,420
At the birth of the drug war, it
was intensely resisted, right?

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,030
I think about here in La,
right? In Los Angeles,

5
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:14,570
there was a doctor called Henry
Smith Williams. When heroin was band,

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,810
there was a deliberate loophole
in the law that said, okay,

7
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:18,840
you can't sell her him,

8
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:21,230
but doctors can prescribe it to
people with addiction problems.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,080
Just like what happened in
Switzerland, right? So here in La,

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,190
big heroin clinic prescribed Anslinger.
It drives him crazy.

11
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,240
He wants to shut it down.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,200
So the mayor of Los Angeles stands in
front of this heroin prescription clinic

13
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,900
and says, you will not shut this
down. This does a good job for us.

14
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:39,110
But Anslinger shuts it down.
When the doctors say to the,

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,660
there's the biggest crackdown
on doctors in American history,

16
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:45,060
over 12,000 doctors are
arrested and rounded up. Um,

17
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,740
when they come to the one in
Portland, Oregon, the doctors say,

18
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:51,590
but what are we meant to do with all
these vulnerable, addictive people?

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,600
And one of the agents that go
and throw them in the lake,

20
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,850
they'll make good fish food,
right? That was the attitude. Um,

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,620
so this is resisted intensely
at the birth of the drug war.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,610
So you had a society really recently
that had a much more mature,

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,300
exactly what you're asking about a much
more mature attitude to drug use than we

24
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,750
have now, right? It's not that
people thought all drug use is good.

25
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,570
We should celebrate every instance of
drug use. No one thinks that. Right?

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,740
There were problems and there were, there
is some joy associated with drug use.

27
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:19,670
That's actually the norm.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,690
There is some pain and terrible
things associated with drug use,

29
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,790
which are mostly driven
by underlying harm.

30
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,320
But there are real harms that
come from some drugs as well. Um,

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,190
and most societies until very recently
had a mature appreciation of this. Right?

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,790
Really,

33
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,790
we are the outlier that most societies
have had licensed intoxicants.

34
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,600
Um, now of course in different
societies at different times it was,

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,040
I was the czar of Russia who
wanted to ban tobacco. Right.

36
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,220
And did terrible things to anyone
who was found with tobacco.

37
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,250
Different societies have had
different panics at different times,

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,513
but

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,340
we are the historical
outliers, right? I mean,

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,780
to give you a sense of just the United
States in prisons, 2 million people,

41
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:06,890
that has never been a society that
imprisons this many of its citizens,

42
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,040
this higher proportion of
its citizens anywhere ever.

43
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:14,030
It's overwhelmingly driven by the drug
war, right? I mean, the u s in prison,

44
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,930
so many people and the conditions in
those prisons are so terrible that the

45
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:21,830
United States is almost certainly the
first society ever were more men have been

46
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:26,540
raped. The women pass how
extreme this, this war is, right?

47
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,400
And what we do to people in it,
what this, what this, the, the,

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,570
the conditions this war creates it's,
um,

49
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,200
and he's a total historical outlier.
We are in a freak experiment, right?

50
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,780
And the one thing you can say
in defense of the drug war,

51
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:47,310
and I would give one bit of credit for
this, is we gave it a fair shot, right?

52
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,410
The United States has done
it for a hundred years. Uh,

53
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,440
this country has spent $1 trillion on it.
Uh,

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,640
we've imprisoned millions
of our own citizens. We've,

55
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,040
because we killed hundreds of thousands
of people that are conservative estimate.

56
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,260
We've destroyed whole countries.
Like Colombia

57
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,960
isn't the problem now that there's a
gigantic business behind it all from

58
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:10,190
private prisons to prison guard unions
to the pharmaceutical industry that would

59
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,190
benefit from keeping most
of these drugs illegal.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,540
So their profits continue to
rise to law enforcement. I mean,

61
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:22,430
down the line it's,
you'd be disrupting like an evil industry,

62
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,660
but an industry, I think that's a real
factor, but I don't want to overstate it.

63
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,380
Lots of policies have best in the factor.
What's the main factor?

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,760
The main factor is most people asked,

65
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:38,000
do you think the drug war has
failed? So yes. And most people ask,

66
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:40,950
do you want to legalize any drug other
than cannabis? Say No. Very strong.

67
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:43,160
So education,
I think it's about,

68
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,610
I won't use the word education can give
you an example of a [inaudible] person

69
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:49,400
who I think showed away to do this.
Um,

70
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,520
so in the year 2000 in Vancouver,

71
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:55,100
there was a homeless street
addict called bottles, boom. And,

72
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,240
and he lived in a notorious
part of Vancouver called
the downtown east side. It,

73
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,760
um, people in Vancouver had
been to one knew it. No,

74
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,540
it's a place particular
at that time that had, um,

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,940
really high like nightmarish
open drug scene, Rogers again,

76
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:09,980
people need like in Switzerland,
people injecting in the streets,

77
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:10,814
that kind of thing.

78
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,680
And Bob w was living homeless and he was
watching his friends die all around him

79
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,870
at that time. Um, there was a
really big police crackdown. Um,

80
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,510
and so people would go and like hide and
dumpsters or in alleyways to shoot up.

81
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:29,450
But obviously if you're hiding and you
overdose, no one sees it, you just die.

82
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,680
Right. And one day bud, um,
Hitler's at one of his friends,

83
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,500
Judith had had died and he's like,

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,550
I can't just sit here and wait for my
friends to die and then for me to die.

85
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,460
But as bud would have put it, then he
also thought, I'm a homeless junkie.

86
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:47,090
What the fuck am I going to do?
Right. But had a really simple idea.

87
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,500
He gathered together a group of the other
homeless street addicts and he said,

88
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,640
um, when we're not using, which is most
of the time, even people on the streets,

89
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,530
what we should do is just drop a timetable
and go and look in the places where

90
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,840
we know people, where we she up. Right.

91
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,480
And if we see someone overdosing will
bring an ambulance. Now officials,

92
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:06,111
nothing like that.

93
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:10,010
Just us and loads of people had descended
on the downtown east side to come up

94
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,420
with problems to solve everything.

95
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,350
And people were very skeptical but
they liked bud. Ah, okay, we'll do it.

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,570
So they start going and searching and um,
over the next three months,

97
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,350
the downtown that the death toll on
the downtown east side like had a

98
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,350
significant fall.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,350
And obviously that meant people
who would have died were living,

100
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,960
which is a great thing. But it
also meant the addicts thought, oh,

101
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,720
maybe we're not the pieces of shit.
Everyone says we are right.

102
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,510
Maybe we can do something. Then
we're like, what else can we do?

103
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:38,930
Bud went to the library. He
learned in Frankfurt. In Germany,

104
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,820
they had open safe injection rooms,

105
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,760
but like what happened in
California until they shut it down,

106
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,190
Anslinger shut it down where people could
go and use their drugs and be watched

107
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:49,160
by doctors and nurses and that this had
massively reduced deaths in Frankfurt.

108
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,550
Nothing like this had happened in the
United States since Anslinger shut it all

109
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,600
down, but bird's like, okay,
we'll persuade our map.

110
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,950
They set up a group called
Van, do the Vancouver Area
Network of drug users. Okay.

111
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,930
The Mare was a conservative right wing
guy called Phillip Iom who would be an

112
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,690
American comparison.
It's not Trump like Mitt Romney,

113
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,140
rich guy from privileged family didn't
get, didn't know anything about addicts.

114
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,621
He'd,

115
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,280
he'd run for office saying all the local
drug addicts should be located to be

116
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:20,450
taken and detained to the local military
base in Chilliwack and never let out if

117
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:21,620
she sends to where he's coming from.
Right.

118
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,630
People are not optimistic about
persuading him. Van Do bud,

119
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,710
his friends,
they decide everywhere Philipo and goes,

120
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,210
they're going to follow him with a
coffin and the coffin had written on it.

121
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,230
He will die next Philipo in before
you open a safe injection site.

122
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:42,380
Every time Phillip own spoken public,

123
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,640
one of the homeless people with addiction
problems with stand up and say he will

124
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:50,400
die next power him before you
open a safe injection site. Um,

125
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,960
one day Dean Wilson, one of the main
people in Vandy stood up and said,

126
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,080
do you remember Julia who asked
you recently? He would die next.

127
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,720
It turned out to be hurt because
you haven't done it right.

128
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,200
This goes on for a long time.
They do loads of public actions.

129
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,520
They filled Oppenheimer Park,

130
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:10,070
which big park in Vancouver with a cross
more than a thousand crosses each one

131
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,740
representing someone who had died of an
overdose and they wrote the names of the

132
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:17,150
people on the crosses and one day
after it's been going on for years,

133
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,170
it totally tastes credit. Philipo Ian
just said, who the fuck are these people?

134
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,580
What is this? And he went to meet
loads of the addicts. He sat with them.

135
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,840
It blew his mind.
He thought people with addiction problems,

136
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,340
people who partied too hard indulge
themselves. He was completely shocked.

137
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
He came here, uh, to the Untied
States to meet, uh, Milton Friedman,

138
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,470
the Nobel prize winning economist who
grown up under alcohol prohibition and

139
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:42,680
Milton Friedman Explains Drug
Prohibition to Phillip over it,

140
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,220
but it probably comes back to Vancouver
and he holds a press conference and had

141
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,180
the chief of police, the coroner,
and a representative of the addicts.

142
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,110
And he says something like,

143
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,650
I'm not going to speak again without
having the addicts here with me about

144
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,660
addiction because they
understand it better than me.

145
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,560
We're going to open the first safe
injection site in North America.

146
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,710
We're going to have the most compassionate
drug policies in North America.

147
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,180
Things are gonna change around here,
right? The open, safe injection site,

148
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,360
Philipo ins, right wing party is so
horrified. They de-select him as is,

149
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,690
as the candidate and his
whole political career ends.

150
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,360
But a more liberal guy wins
the election in the room,

151
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,270
stays open in the 10 years that followed,

152
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,550
overdose deaths on the downtown east
side fell by 80% eight 0% right?

153
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,850
Average life expectancy in that
neighborhood rose by 10 years.

154
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,010
You just don't get figures
like that very often.

155
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,440
And I remember the reason I say in
relation to change, it's, you know,

156
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,540
a big part of what I argue in
chasing the scream anymore that,

157
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,970
but lost connections is, you know,
we, you don't write people off, right?

158
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,330
But I realized I would
have written off Philipo in

159
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,430
right wing guy runs for saying we should
lock them all up in the military base.

160
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,910
Right?
You don't write off anyone.

161
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,440
You don't know who can be persuaded
by message of love and compassion.

162
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,030
And the most unlikely,

163
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,450
one of the biggest champions of my book
is a conservative Evangelical Christian

164
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,470
in Mississippi called Christina Dennis,
who's doing incredible work with this,

165
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:04,650
right?

166
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,440
And I thought a lot about Filippone when
I went to go and see Phillip Ahmed on

167
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,900
the downtown east side,
and he said to me,

168
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:14,250
he would sacrifice his entire political
career all over again given the chance

169
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:15,330
for this course.
He said,

170
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:19,290
how often do you get to save thousands
of lives at the most vulnerable people?

171
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,210
And after I got to know Bud Osborne,
the guy who started this movement, um,

172
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,190
he died. He, he, uh, I remember, uh, you
know, he's only in his early sixties,

173
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,920
but he'd been a homeless
addict during a drug war.

174
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:36,540
It takes a toll on you and they sealed
off the streets of the downtown east side

175
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,660
where bought had lived as a homeless
person and they had this incredible

176
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,650
memorial ceremony and there were loads
of people at that ceremony who knew that

177
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,600
they were alive because
of what buttered started.

178
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,210
And because so many other people have
joined them and so many people who didn't

179
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:50,460
have addiction problems had
opened their hearts. Right.

180
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,520
And I remember thinking that day, you
know, when you get disheartened about,

181
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,820
they said it's easy to get disheartened,
right?

182
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,720
This is a hundred year long drug war.
Um,

183
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,370
we're up against very powerful forces.

184
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,270
Everyone watching your show,

185
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,210
listening to your show is more
powerful than bud was that day, right?

186
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:12,210
The day he started that, right? It just,

187
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,760
by virtue of the fact they have a device
on which to listen to this, right,

188
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,050
but didn't sit there thinking
someone else is going to handle this.

189
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,280
He didn't sit there thinking,

190
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,820
oh well this is doubled up against
these forces that can't be defeated.

191
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,560
He started where he stood.

192
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,430
He appealed to the people around him and
it started this circle of change that,

193
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:29,611
you know,

194
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:33,240
the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that
because the right wing government of

195
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,160
Stephen Harper tried to shut
down this injection site. Um,

196
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,240
and the Canadian Supreme Court ruled
that people with addiction promise have a

197
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,880
right to light, to live, and
that includes a safe place.

198
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,420
You said it looks like will never be
taken away now, right? That static is one,

199
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:50,160
but you know, when you have
nothing else, you have a voice.

200
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,170
You have a human voice that you can use
to persuade other people with love and

201
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,870
compassion.
You can tell them stories.

202
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,950
You can build people's love and compassion
in the middle of this catastrophe

203
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:04,950
that we're seeing in this country with
the addiction crisis. Right? I mean,

204
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,820
more people died last year and the opioid
crisis than all the soldiers who died

205
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:13,230
in the Vietnam war combined
in the middle of this catastrophe.

206
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,670
We can carry on doing what we've been
doing. Okay. We can carry on doing that,

207
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,640
then we will continue to get the
horrific results we are now getting.

208
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,240
We can continue to copy the
places that have failed, right?

209
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,480
At the end of a hundred year long
drug war, those cost $1 trillion.

210
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,640
We can't even keep drugs out of our
prisons where we have a wall perimeter and

211
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,380
we pay people to walk
around at the whole time.

212
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,820
So good luck keeping them out
of a 3000 mile border. Right?

213
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:41,550
That will never happen.
That is a ludicrous fantasy.

214
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,730
He might as well take all the money that
will be spent on trying to keep drugs

215
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:47,670
out. That way I'm burning it
in a pile. Right, is absurd.

216
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,300
There's never been such a society.
Um,

217
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,450
all we can start to copy the places
that have, right Portugal, Switzerland,

218
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,220
Urgh why Canada?

219
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,710
There are plenty of places that have
tried the alternatives and people who were

220
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,521
quite skeptical.

221
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:07,240
It's one thing that was most striking
to me in all those places is that people

222
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:09,040
who were initially skeptical

223
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,840
and initially thought it was crazy,
very often change their minds.

224
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:17,680
This is the consistent pattern
before it happens.

225
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,290
People think it's the work of bunch
of fucking Wackos. They think,

226
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,700
why people who want to,
you know,

227
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,700
get everyone to use drugs and get children
to use drugs and think it's madness.

228
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,090
And then they see that that's not at all
what motivates people who want reform.

229
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:32,050
And that's not, that's not what
happens in practice when you,

230
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,370
when you adopt these policies,

231
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,170
and it's not a magic bullet
and they still have problems,

232
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,050
but there's been such a significant
improvement in all those places.
