1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
Versus right now. Okay, but let,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,300
let's tell me how the connection
between aliens and the Nazis took place.

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:10,860
When did all this start? Let me, let
me begin. Cause this just really,

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,890
I'm telling you, Joe, there's just a real
deal. I believe you. This is you ask,

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:18,000
who are they?
It's people who are psychically,

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:23,001
genetically available to interface in
this incredibly diverse universe with all

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,560
these dimensions above and below and
all around us with consciousnesses.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,040
And the truth is no energies ever
destroyed. It all continues on.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,680
The truth is our bodies.

10
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:38,681
This is a fact or a communal hive organism
of all of our ancestors and all of

11
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,090
their race memories,

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,530
but not in just some compressed
epigenetic system. It's beyond that.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,490
It's an electro chemical antenna.
They've proven this,

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,010
that connects to higher
and lower dimensions.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,460
Show our body shoot czar
cause our, our, our,

16
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:59,730
our predessessors would put us in a
position without giving us a bodysuit.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,970
That is them. Our families are
loving us. They're holding us,

18
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,330
they're wrapped all around
us. Their strength or we'll,
they're bad. They're good,

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,050
their sins, the good things they did, the
battles, they won, the battles they lost.

20
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:14,340
The woman they love, the the man they
love. It's all in us. All these people.

21
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,160
It's while we're able to look into so
many things and have so many different

22
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:20,910
experiences, and so all the
showman, all the ancient religions,

23
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:24,450
everybody says there are the good ones
and there are the bad ones and the,

24
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,850
and people are interfacing. So
you say, where does it begin?

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,350
From the Tibetans to the Mezzo Americans,
the Egyptians to the drudge,

26
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,290
to every ancient society
describes the same thing.

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,890
There are bad things that look like els
that have horns when they show you who

28
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,080
they really are and there are good things,

29
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,950
but they don't contact you unless
you contact them and then they,

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,840
they're almost not even
concerned with what you're doing.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,240
I never bought into this look to do it,

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,060
but then I began to think about what I
hear when I was a kid. What did I see?

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,950
What was coming on?
Government documents,

34
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,760
what was being admitted when I read all
these books about World War II and the

35
00:01:55,761 --> 00:02:00,030
Nazis and Hitler obsessed with the Dalai
Lama and the Tibetans and what they

36
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:04,110
were able to do without drugs to interface
with this and all the rituals they

37
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:06,780
would do and how they were
believed that beyond the ether,

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,670
like at skull and bones,
it's a German death coat.

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,330
They do rituals and take drugs
to talk to the goddesses. Well,

40
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,580
there's just appearing as you
know, sexy, beautiful women.

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,880
It's whatever you want as the spirit
guides because lower entities will come in

42
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,490
and violate your freewill
God and his angels,

43
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,720
which are below him will not get
involved in your everyday life.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,230
They will not manipulate your
freewill unless you asked them in.

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,800
But then the devil masquerades as an
angel of light. So we're on this planet.

46
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:37,230
The third dimension,
which is a launch pad,

47
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:39,570
all the other dimensions below
and above the third dimension,

48
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:40,930
all the bathetic shows is,

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,840
is the primal see of where all this
happens in the earth, like an egg.

50
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,400
And we've got all this potentiality and
God will send out a transmission for a

51
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:53,940
larger plan, but evil is willing to come
in and what does it say? Demoralize,

52
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,340
get rid of children, don't
have kids. Humans are bad.

53
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,170
You will be will be better
once you're all gone.

54
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,830
And it's because it's their operational
mission for whatever reason that will

55
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,220
understand later what's going on. So
the Nazis, we get the deep literature,

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,560
they believed, they were basically
say on seeing and, and, and,

57
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,260
and being possessed by entities that,

58
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,030
I mean it was before the
Nazis for whatever reason,

59
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,220
it was the Germans that this happened to.
And the Swiss,

60
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,940
like they didn't discover
Lsd in the thirties these,

61
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:24,100
these people were running
the psychology departments.

62
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:26,260
They were interfacing with the occult.

63
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,610
They were involved in all this crazy
stuff and it was all about their power and

64
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,030
how great they were going to be in
the Germans were seduced and they were

65
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,250
seduced because they had high iqs.
But more than that,

66
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,540
they were psychically connected to
each other and would work like robots.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,640
The this Chinese and the EU want robots
replaces cause they'll follow orders and

68
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,760
the Chinese are very conscious
when they're conscious.
They're also very robotic.

69
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,280
But the Germans are just as robotics.

70
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:56,260
So this entity system pick Germans
as its attempt even in World War One,

71
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,094
World War II.

72
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,520
And it was been to putting the bricks
as well and offering them technologies,

73
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,540
but two different paths.

74
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,630
One was social control and also
their stuff with the Brits.

75
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,070
The other was high tech weapons, uh,
systems interdimensional with the Germans.

76
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,900
And so whoever these players are, and you
can dial into it, it's very dangerous.

77
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:17,020
They're manipulating the British
arm versus the German arm.

78
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,160
And then they've got the
Chinese arm that's almost
seem to like their robot army.

79
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,680
And, and, and, and so when you study it,

80
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:28,681
the globalist go to these events and they
take bigger and bigger doses of drugs,

81
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,510
they do electroshock.
Uh,

82
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,420
if you go about the owners of time life
books didn't work just in the twenties

83
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,750
and thirties and LSD and other
hallucinogens and apothecary,

84
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:40,210
they were dealing electro
shock. They were, they were,

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,300
they were having people turn their heart
off to like try to communicate with

86
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,060
these things,
to try to be dominant and get that.

87
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:50,590
So you go back thousands of years, Merlin,
you know, the archetypal or, or, or,

88
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,210
or these magicians or these,

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,360
these wizards are taking drugs in these
temples and interfacing with these

90
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,250
Palentier is these crystal balls,
which aren't really crystal balls.

91
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,460
It's their psychic focus
of an interdimensional
connection while they're on

92
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:08,410
drugs, looking into glass to then be able
to see the future and understand what's

93
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,170
happening to give them temporal
power over this planet.

94
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,600
But like the Bible tells
you any pharmacare,

95
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,200
any of that always leads to destruction
because only evil is going to come

96
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,680
through that way. So we're
basically have these light sockets.

97
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,640
We can't Jack into the higher lets
us our free will and that takes time.

98
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,720
We Jack in to the evil so
you can Jackie into evil.

99
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,870
You can't Jack into good right
away. So it's quicker, it's easier.

100
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,810
Like Yoda says about Darth Vader,
quicker, easier, more seductive.

101
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,280
And so then I remember being a kid and,
and and my parents,

102
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,470
they don't really get mad about this.

103
00:05:40,471 --> 00:05:42,070
It's whatever they even know what
they were hearing at the time.

104
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,070
But they had friends that they knew
at ut that we're involved in research

105
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:46,600
projects and then,

106
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:50,020
and then they were nine times out of 10
are worried about research projects in

107
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:54,970
San Francisco. Ut has some, MIT
has a lot and me anytime you want,

108
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,360
but this was in like the 60s they had
virtual reality gloves where you'd put

109
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:05,420
them on and put goggles on and you'd go
into stuff that looked like the Holodeck

110
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,910
from Star Trek 20 years forward existed
and they were doing surgeries and all

111
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,350
this and they would do empathy
loads where they'd say,

112
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,130
we need the public because we're so
weak because the west is so strong.

113
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,650
People haven't had trauma, so
they sold them low level. Oh,

114
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,780
we're going to create trauma.
Like when you go to Mars,

115
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,120
you're not getting any gravity. So your
hearts don't get when you get there.

116
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,790
Who's organizing all this? Well,
they don't tell you. They go, oh,

117
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,640
it's a special class. You've
been. Gotcha. So in the 60s,

118
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:32,930
they had closed a special class of
people that are organizing all this shit.

119
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,500
It's the highest scores, but is
it's for, for, for what purpose?

120
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,150
No financial gain.
Social Jack Parsons, uh,

121
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,690
was the jet propulsion laboratory.
Alistair Crowley. Devil worship. Exactly.

122
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,050
So you're still in chat alley
over a hundred years ago,

123
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,690
the aliens given the guy, the
founder of JP Arrow, Jack Parsons.

124
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,190
Have you heard this before?
No.

125
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,800
I just can't believe I didn't
want to have Alex on the Pi,

126
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,540
but did not let me finish. Just let
me say this. Not trying to take over,

127
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,210
but who just got here, but I'm
not bullshitting you. Okay.

128
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:09,830
I'm telling you this stuff.
I don't believe in this.
Okay, here it is right there.

129
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,500
This is patented in 1957
CVR machine. Exactly. No,

130
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:19,370
exactly crazy show.
I've told the people not just family,

131
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,930
Holy Shit and gives you wind
vibration, aromas, stereo sound power,

132
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:28,070
motion wide vision and three d three
dimensional. But let me tell you,

133
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,550
they wore a mask in the sixties and
seventies that was already like you.

134
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,260
She like paper, thin TV screens and
it was all ready. I talk to her.

135
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,970
They said there's no way
this was human technology.

136
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,840
So you've seen these
foldable phones? Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,750
I think the aliens have already
taken over Samsung and Huawei. Yeah.

138
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,200
Do you think the aliens
are taking over Samsung?

139
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,300
Do you have any something
to do with Samsung will?

140
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,850
Obviously that's what
I'm telling you is the,

141
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,860
the Pentagon isn't worried about it
as long as Jamie says the patent. Wow.

142
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,530
I notice that's the reach
of the sixties I believe.

143
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,490
1957 so notice that's
exactly what you're buying.

144
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,600
That's what my dad told me. That's
what our HTC vive looks like. The day

145
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,590
my dad didn't tell me this chill,
he shot end game and he said,

146
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,401
no son.

147
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:24,401
We had virtual reality goggles and we
had shooty rom and we had things and then

148
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,070
something else happened,
and I'm not at liberty to get into it,

149
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:33,071
but I was shown three years ago what
the University of Washington was doing

150
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:37,310
under Bill Gates, and this is
in the 90s what were they doing?

151
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,550
What do you do? They, they don't
even know what they're being given.

152
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,510
It's intervening ish.

153
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,190
So you think it's some sort of alien
intervention type shit, dude, they, they,

154
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,530
okay.

155
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,090
They to get even deeper,

156
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,930
they turn your heart off for five
minutes and they pump oxygen into your,

157
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,030
and you're in the meetings.
I've talked to people that are involved,

158
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:03,480
I mean top scientist and you're in
the meetings with fricken aliens.

159
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,990
Elves is the main group, but they're
like, oh, by shutting your heart off,

160
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,650
it makes you have that
psychedelic experience by
keeping blood in your oxygen.

161
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,380
It's keeps you alive. But we'll,
we'll, we'll, let's explain. Okay.

162
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,690
The heart goes out, the body thinks it's
dead. Right? So you can stay in longer.

163
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,200
I don't know all the science behind it.
I understand. But let's explain this.

164
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,160
Lucky DMT or Iowasca 200 times.

165
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,560
But mostly like most of our astronauts
to test pilots are flying planes.

166
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,280
Those are robots. Cow. It's all
mind war shall these dudes are like,

167
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,980
it stops working once you've
taken in hundreds of times.

168
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,720
So then they start taking their most
psychic people who are able to do this and

169
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,780
they turn their heart off and
then they put them into these,

170
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,110
these events and it's like the
things the aliens tell them,

171
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:49,800
they come out and they tell scientists
and it works show like we're going to

172
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:53,640
shit. They didn't let me tell you
get killed for this stuff Joe.

173
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:55,200
This is not the only thing
they want me off the,

174
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,380
because when I finally figured this out,
cause I never touch aliens,

175
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,420
I kind of knew the whole thing already.
Here's what I'm talking about.

176
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,960
When I was a kid, wait nine,
whatever it was, this woman,

177
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,340
this lady would come
over that had known my,

178
00:10:06,341 --> 00:10:09,330
my parents had UTI and was
involved and she talked about,

179
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,510
yeah we call it the psychedelic
research should or whether the name was,

180
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,030
but it's really a CIA deal.
And you know,

181
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,160
we just can't find people
that can handle it.

182
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,200
They're going in the hills want this,
and he yells,

183
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:24,270
want us to basically reduce population
and agree to these certain plans and it's

184
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:28,170
all about humanization. And they call the,
it's clockwork hills and they're like,

185
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:31,180
yeah, this is my parents. You're
like seven, eight years old.

186
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:33,000
Like they don't think you're
listening talking about,

187
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,580
well this is what the elves want and
this is what they're going to do.

188
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,440
And the thing is, he's not,
parents aren't that special.

189
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,210
You go out to San Francisco

190
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,240
that it's all there is dude. It's
a cult man. You all these guys,

191
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,550
you know from San Francisco,
dude, you look at,

192
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,960
look at the head of Google or youtube
or fricking apple. He's on TV.

193
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
Tim Cook in his eyes are
this big under lights, man.

194
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,450
These guys are on stuff
that like nobody even knows.

195
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,510
What do you think they're on
stuff they've been given. I mean,

196
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,540
I know people at ut,
they won't tell me specifically,

197
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,360
but I was telling you to do two owns
youtube. Who's that guy? What's his name?

198
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,470
Girl. You sexist pig. Alphabet.

199
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,510
Alphabet is the parent company who
this is their take take, take patellar,

200
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,930
any dude. There's not like a Jack Dorsey
of youtube take, take, take, take.

201
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:23,730
Sundar Pichai sorry. He goes in Congress.
I'm there. He's the CEO of Youtube.

202
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,800
He's a CEO of Google. Google, sorry.

203
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,990
And he's literally on TV going,
we never fixed the result.

204
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,940
We don't spound anybody.

205
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,650
There is no surveillance and you've got
all these old white men and I want to

206
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:38,760
say it,
I'm white men to be trendy.

207
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:42,160
It's all a bunch of old dumb ass white
men and a couple of dumb ass old Mexican

208
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,940
and black ladies. They're
all dumb. Normally call,

209
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,960
they are going show you
don't spout it or control it.

210
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,830
Meanwhile their own perspectives to their
shareholders and how they control it

211
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:56,440
all, now they're going to deliver
maximum profit. And Sundar is like,

212
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,900
yes it is true. We have never controlled
the search result and it's just,

213
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:04,330
I'm just listening to pure lies.
Meanwhile,

214
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,100
this guy's only the front guy of Eric
Schmidt and God knows what they're into.

215
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,730
They're, I mean, it hasn't been
proven that Google does something to,

216
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,710
to alter search results.

217
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,713
Uh,

218
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,900
I'm asking cause I don't know. I'm
not asking to fuck with you. Uh, yeah,

219
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,000
no know what did they do?
Who will itself is about if you pay them,

220
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,910
they put your results at the
top. Just like Facebook. Okay,

221
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,880
well that's definitely altering search
results. So what he said was not true.

222
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,030
If they, if you can pay, it's like
saying water, watery, wet Joe.

223
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,550
I know you know all this
stuff. No, no, no, no. I don't
know that. I don't know that.

224
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,930
Now listen, I'm honest about what
I don't know. I know some things,

225
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,920
but I, there's a lot of fucking holes in
my knowledge base. That's a fact. Well,

226
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:54,780
you know that they tried to block my
name and direct it toward negative stuff.

227
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,440
I'm sure they do.
They manipulate.

228
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,960
All they do is all they do is the
negative. You attack me. It's,

229
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,640
it's digital currency.
You go to the top and they pay you money.

230
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,210
Some of your body, a little tip
watching a tapped me lie about me.

231
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,500
You go to the top.
But you'll lose your soul.
