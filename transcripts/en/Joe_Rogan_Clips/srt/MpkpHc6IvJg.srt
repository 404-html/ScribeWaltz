1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,970
I see, I see. Jeff is like beyond
unique. Like there's nobody like him.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:08,320
And what he does and what he is
able to do is really, it's really,

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,710
it's not only fun to watch,
but it's really like, you
know, you're a self starter.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,580
He's a self starter.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,780
Like it's great to see self starters
who find success because it really is

6
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:21,130
difficult to like take something and
like make it not only financially

7
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:24,880
successful but also like something that,
that we all respect and love. You know?

8
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:25,870
And that's,
you know,

9
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:30,190
I'd say the roasting thing
that Jeff really pretty much
has rebranded into like,

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,050
you know, every, every,

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,400
every possible way you can do it is always
good because he's behind it, you know,

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,220
when it's not, when it's not really
with him then and you're like,

13
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm not so sure. There's other
people who are really good at it too.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,290
But I'm just saying that like,
you know, that is when, you know,

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,020
we're on the road and people will scream
out the car door. It's the roast master.

16
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,980
I mean like,
you know,

17
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:55,690
I had my insomniac time but he like
2030 times that in terms of like

18
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,460
recognition,
I mean it's just amazing.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,580
It is. Where the year you're
synonymous with roasts. Yeah. You know,

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,450
I mean like people say roasts,
they think Jeff Ross,

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,630
I earned it because wouldn't
people laughed at me and thought,

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,130
oh that's a dead art. It's
a lost art. It's antiquated.
It's Corny. It's old guys.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,230
I stuck by it and said, no,
it's alternative comedy. No
one's doing it. I get to,

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,790
I get to hang with legends like Buddy
Hackett and Milton Berle, you know,

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,170
and I stuck to it because, and
there was a watch, there was a,

26
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,540
there was a time where I was
like embarrassed. Like, Oh,

27
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,840
I'm going to be pigeonholed as the roast
guy. Were you embarrassed? Not Him.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,020
I don't know if embarrassed is the
right word, but comfortable. Yeah.

29
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,480
Cause you're like, well I want
to be more than that. You know,

30
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,490
when was this around? This is probably
10 years ago and I was in Vegas,

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,020
Chappelle. Again, words of wisdom.
He's like, dude, that's your lane.

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,950
Make that a five lane highway and ride it.

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,770
And that's kind of what we started,
what I started doing,

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,750
sort of really owning it and loving it
and to the credit of the world as we

35
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,820
became more pussies in the world,

36
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,930
like roasting became more and
more potent and important. Yeah.

37
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,330
And the world needs to develop thick skin,
and I think roasting honors people,

38
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:14,080
and it's done with love, but it also
kind of toughens us up a little bit.
