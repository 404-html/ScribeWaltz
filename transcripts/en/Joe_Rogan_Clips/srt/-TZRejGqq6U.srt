1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,520
The joe rogan experience.
If you're around the kid enough,

2
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,050
it changes who you are and
if you're not around the kid,

3
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,650
that changes who you are because then
you realize you're not around the kid and

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,490
that's going to take a piece out of who
you think you are. But you know what?

5
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:15,090
If if you,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,660
if you and we have friends who aren't
great dads or whatever and you could see

7
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,550
it in their kids, I can I, and I'm,

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:23,550
I'm not slowing up psychologist
or I'm some expert in parenting,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,010
but if I go to a person's house and I see
the way the kids treat the pants, I go,

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,610
you're not around enough,
man. I promise you.

11
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:32,220
I can tell my son doesn't act like that.
Yeah,

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,440
because one thing that you can call me
whatever you want, whenever you want.

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,920
One thing I am is a beast of a dad. I
know that. I don't know if I'm good comic.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,830
I don't know if I was a good fighter.
I don't want from good podcasts are,

15
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:44,700
that's all up for debate. One thing I
know is I'm a fucking good dad, man.

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,090
Good for you, man. That's
a, it's a very, very, very,

17
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:52,500
very important quality and that quality,
when your kid becomes an adult,

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,090
that's going to be, which is a major
factor in how you get along. I give you,

19
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,080
I mean even parents,

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,550
I know friends who had
had bad relationships with
their parents when they live

21
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:03,900
with them and then once they got out,

22
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,420
their parents were nice to them with
the parents was shitty to them when they

23
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,830
were kids and they always
hold it against always.

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,770
They always have that shit in
the back of their head. Like,

25
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,280
why were you a dick when I was 12 you
know that that shit is always in their

26
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,970
head. It's like that Avatar
horse when you're young, you,

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,010
you mixed together and if you don't
make scale of when you're young,

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,370
and I was talking to someone,
a therapist, they were saying,

29
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,830
I think it's from like til they're three.
If you don't make that connection. Yeah.

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,790
When when you're like, oh,
when they're for like, oh,

31
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:33,150
I'll do it now it's almost
too late because they already
developed these, this,

32
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:34,920
these brain pathways were like,
Nope,

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,810
my dad's an ass and there's really
nothing you can do to fix it. Yeah man.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,720
I went to the movies yesterday
with my kid, my movie.

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,880
We went to see the GNOMEO and Juliet.
Oh yeah. What is it? A Sherlock gnomes?

36
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, the sure like, no, I'm so
cute little movie, but you know,

37
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,850
we went to that synopsis place
when you know you lean back,

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,330
you know those things. Seats, lean
back, good food and you take the, uh,

39
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:59,520
the seat rests down and she just,

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,930
my seven year old just
snuggles with me Macbeth,

41
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,620
they're snuggling watching a movie.
I'm like, I couldn't be happier.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,350
I don't want to see this stupid
fucking movie. No, but I don't care.

43
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,490
She wants to so I couldn't be happier.
I sat there and watched us.

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,540
Silly knows shit moving.
She just a little snuggle bunny.

45
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,050
I've watched her last baby nine
times by time. Not a bad mood.

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,660
And like a week though, that's pretty
funny movie. The boss, baby's great.

47
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:25,680
Alcohol is the voice I watched like nine
times, but with my son, whenever watch,

48
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:28,170
he snuggled up when? When? Usually
this is why I want a daughter.

49
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:31,140
That's why I'm jealous you have daughters
because daughters loved their dads.

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,790
My son. I'm like, you
little traitor mommy,

51
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,530
mommy like dude, it's me every morning.
Your car for your mom cross like that too.

52
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,550
And a lot of ways it's,

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,900
you got to accept the fact that the mom
is not just the soft sweet woman in the

54
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,161
house,

55
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:54,600
but she's also the person who made them
in the her body and there's chemical

56
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:59,470
connection of her body. Man is
like, I had to deal with my wife.

57
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,410
Like I'm not naming any kids.
I go, I got veto power. I go,

58
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,180
but you do way more work. Like it's
way harder to make the person I go.

59
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,910
As long as you tried to call the kid
applesauce or something. Fucking stupid.

60
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:13,410
Yeah. You know, I just
don't feel like it's,

61
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,640
it's not even proposition. Oh, I did
this fucker, we're going to do anyways,

62
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,940
but now we own it with this seed.
You know what, you've got a bonus.

63
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,620
Get a bonus overtime for you.
It is kind of crazy though,

64
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:31,360
that sex is how you make people I know
and everybody wants just wants to fuck

65
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,150
all the time and you want
to fuck a bunch of people.

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,590
A lot of people don't
like kids. No. Hell No.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,150
You know who opened my eyes like in a
big way in a podcast recently that's

68
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:44,470
really been making me think a lot
about this is Bret Weinstein. He's the,

69
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,430
the professor that gotten that.
Do you know the,

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,650
you know we is controversy with the
Evergreen University and all that and they

71
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,060
were taking the day, it wasn't a pronoun
thing, it was the day of absence.

72
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,880
They wanted it all the white people to
stay home and he's like, that's racist.

73
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,340
Yeah. Anyway, he was on,

74
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,190
you said there's two different
things that men are attracted to.

75
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,490
They're attracted to a woman that they
think would be a great companion and a

76
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,650
great mother and like someone who,

77
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,920
he said there's a difference between
hot and beautiful. Correct. Like,

78
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,250
some women are beautiful and like they're
loving you want to be around them.

79
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,301
I goes,

80
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:24,301
but then there's other women who are
just hot and in males that very receptive

81
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:30,490
woman who doesn't require any commitment
was an opportunity for men to spread

82
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:34,570
their seed with someone who they didn't
have to be around for. Wow. Yeah,

83
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,990
so there's literally like a
programming in a man's mind.

84
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,400
So you see a girl with big giant tits
and a little waist and a fat ass hanging

85
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,940
out of her shorts and she's got sloppy
makeup on and she looks at you and you're

86
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,600
like, oh, okay, let's do
this. But that's what that is.

87
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,360
It's not like you let,
you're not saying,

88
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,040
I would like to start a relationship
with you. It's like, no,

89
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,540
I want to shoot my load in to you,

90
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,080
and then you raise my kid when I'm nowhere
near you because it's an opportunity

91
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:03,700
for my DNA to propagate. Wow. So
much sense. It makes so much sense.

92
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,180
I literally never considered it until
he brought it up on the podcast. I went,

93
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,010
oh Duh. Me Neither. I just thought
she's hot. Whatever. She's just hot,

94
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,970
dirty in a dirty way. Why she's
attracted to that. Why is she so dirty?

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,410
I told my girl, Joe, I told my girl,
Joe, probably four weeks into it,

96
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:24,160
five weeks we were getting serious and
she got this job offer to go to Miami and

97
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,920
she's talking about career and stuff like
that. And I went, no, that's all cool.

98
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,040
It's all and no one's career first
more than me. However, uh, you know,

99
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,690
you're put on the search to be a mom,
right?

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,840
Like you're can be such a beast of a mom.
I guarantee you,

101
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:38,650
because I saw her interact with
Callan's kids. I can guarantee you,

102
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,170
you might be the greatest
host in the world,

103
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,560
but you're going to be the best mom I've
ever seen. And then she's like, really?

104
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,070
I'm like, I guarantee you
fucking Bam Bam. Well,

105
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,930
that's just those
qualities that you can see.

106
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:53,260
It's something and when someone's not,
when someone's a bad mom,

107
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,170
it's such a depressed man.
Nothing worse.

108
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,590
So depressing to be around woman is like
really short with her kids and shitty

109
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,300
with them and like,
oh well even as a kid,

110
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,440
if I had friends who like talk back to
their pants are mean to their pants. Like,

111
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,270
Oh God, what's wrong with you? If I was
dating a girl, she'd like bad mouth,

112
00:06:09,271 --> 00:06:12,500
their mom. Like what's wrong with you
girl know the hard thing is that pattern.

113
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:14,330
It's hard to break.
It's hard to break.

114
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,170
Those kids may very well have that same
kind of behavior towards their kids.

115
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,100
Like when they become adults,
it's a hard pattern to break.

116
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:23,870
Sometimes you need the
right person in your life.

117
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,020
It's like a good person in
your life that you, you know,

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,630
a wife or husband or whoever it is.
You know when you,

119
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,960
you match up at that person,
like it changes who you are too.

120
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,960
That's what I always say that one of
the most important things about, um,

121
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,870
community, like your community of
friends is when you have good friends,

122
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,230
those people change you.
Like you react.

123
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,180
Like everyone is your tribe.
You react like everyone's your friends.

124
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,450
So you want good for them. You
love them, you care about them.

125
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,460
They change who you are. They change
and they inspire you or they eat.

126
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,310
Whether they inspire you with being smart
or their kindness or their ambition,

127
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:04,730
whatever it is that we're are,
we're not individuals.

128
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,600
We're a piece of a community
always and that community,

129
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,580
even if it's a small community
that you call a family,

130
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,520
that piece is dependent upon
who you do that piece with. A,

131
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,550
you might be an amazing dad with the
right woman, but with the wrong woman,

132
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,920
you might be so frustrated
with the relationship that
you're not as good at data

133
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,450
right now. There might be
chaos going on all the time.

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,630
You might be situations you put the kid
in when you're yelling and screaming at

135
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:30,520
each other,
the kitchen,

136
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,420
see all these different factors that are
dependent upon your relationship with

137
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,510
this other person and they
changed you and you change them.

138
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,220
Like you might be the
wrong person for them.

139
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,160
They might be super cool
and calm with someone else,

140
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,050
but with you it's just not a Mitch.
It doesn't hit buttons.

141
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,930
It's like a woman saying to you, uh,
you know, you don't want an equal like,

142
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,420
well I don't want this. I don't
want this. No, I don't want this.

143
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:56,090
You might be right. But I know for sure
I don't want them. You're threatened.

144
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,180
You threatened by a strong woman. No,
I'm talking about you. You're just,

145
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,740
you're aggressive for no reason.

146
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,960
Who the fuck has ever said that
you threatened by strong man.

147
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,840
It's run by a strong
man. Like what? Shut up.

148
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,930
Cause he was he calling yourself a
strong man. Get the fuck out of here.

149
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:13,580
Any guy who calls himself a strong man
like that job most likely's up pitch.

150
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,850
Most likely.
It's just trying to prop himself.

151
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,520
And I feel the same way about women who
say that women who were like, you know,

152
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:24,040
you're scared of a strong woman. Like
okay, am I really or are you a con? Yup.

153
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,260
Just raging cause it's this con talk.

154
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,910
This sounds like this guy sounds all
to them. Again, super uncomfortable.

155
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,300
I don't know what got us to this position,
but whatever I did please,

156
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,940
I'll apologize. But I
also feel like in, in,

157
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,380
in this community of friends that were
talking about if you are a shit father,

158
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,650
it would show elsewhere in your life
around us or if we're at the comedy store

159
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,750
or a restaurant or in your,
in your social media,

160
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,870
it's going to come out one way or
another. You know, when you know,

161
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,130
that would be tough to be in that group.
You know the expression,

162
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,370
how you do one thing is how you
do everything. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,990
I think there's something to that.

164
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,780
I mean obviously there's people that
are really good at one thing and suck at

165
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:07,530
other things. So it's not a, it's
not always a hundred percent correct.

166
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:12,000
But you know, if you're a shitty dad,
you're going to be a shitty friend. Agree.

167
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,010
And if you're a shitty friend, you're
probably going to be shitty. Dad,

168
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,770
and I say this too,
with like with due to our shitty debt,

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,840
dad's, it's like right. If you're
willing to do that to, you're literally,

170
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,750
you're connected this person chemically,
they're, they're made of your DNA.

171
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,380
If you want to treat him like that
when the going gets rough for me,

172
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,970
where the fuck are you going
to be? There's no way I
want you my foxhole. Yeah.

173
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,870
Yeah. That's big man. And then people
that don't, they don't understand that.

174
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:40,760
They don't understand what they're doing
wrong. That's rough too. The bummer.

175
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:44,040
The people that can't see it and you
try to explain it to them and they can't

176
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:48,420
see it. The one thing people will put up
with those, and I would never do this,

177
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,420
but if you give someone parenting
advice, it just doesn't, there's just,

178
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,700
there's certain things you can't
talk about. Usually politics,

179
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,960
religion and parenting.

180
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,110
The only way I think parenting advice
works ever is if you talk about one great

181
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:04,700
thing that you found that you do with
your kid without criticizing another yes,

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,510
you could.

183
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,660
You could give them advice but not give
them advice by like you can relay your

184
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:14,370
personal positive experiences and
either they take it or they don't.

185
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,690
But as soon as you start saying,
hey man,

186
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,520
I see how you talked to
your son and you're like,

187
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,900
what the fuck did you say people
get your son is a, you know,

188
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,900
he's an individual man. He treated
her autism. An object like fuck,

189
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:29,150
I don't fucking treat my son. Like Austin
came over, he's not even listening.

190
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,930
What you said you're all ramping up.

191
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,340
My son was one and a half at the
time and I was taken to this,

192
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,320
this play area and he,
you know,

193
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,830
he did not express himself and everyone
was older and you tick kids and he's a

194
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:44,550
big kid.
He's 99% tile for size and all that stuff.

195
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,310
And he would hit kids and the,

196
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,720
the place where I was taking him in
Brentwood knew I was a former fighter.

197
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,910
One of the guys who works
front desk as a fan.

198
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,500
I've talked with MMA with them and they
took me to the side and said, you know,

199
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:02,820
we, we got a bit of a problem cause tiger
is a hitting kids and we think it's in

200
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,370
direct correlation of you let
them watch fights. And from,

201
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,560
I just started laughing. You
guys are silly as fuck. I'm a,

202
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:13,830
I'm never bring him back.
B, he's one and a half.

203
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,740
Everyone else in their s three I mean,
yeah,

204
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,080
he cold cock that kid with a
left hook and I'm proud of them.

205
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,150
I could took his toy. However, it's
just, this is what kids do. They hit man,

206
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:27,260
it's nothing. And we, and I tell him,
no, I'm staying on top of my helicopter.

207
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:30,720
The pennant, the fuck out him when he's
in there. But these, these one and a half,

208
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,650
there was kids who are older and
I've trust me, he's not watching UFC.

209
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,940
It's not has nothing to do it.
They think this lady was like that.

210
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:43,020
You have F C or whatever you're getting
into. And I was like, oh my God,

211
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,340
this is some Brent. Which
shit lady. There's a lot of
some which shit right now.

212
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,640
All right, yellow, yellow, meet dirt. If
they hit each other, they hate each other.

213
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,100
We're concerned that you are
constantly reaffirming his

214
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,250
gender without him choosing.
We're concerned.

215
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:08,890
Okay.
