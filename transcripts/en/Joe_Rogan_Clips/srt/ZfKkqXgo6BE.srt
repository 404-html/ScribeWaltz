Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,480
You're on a podcast called
the legion of skanks.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,560
Could that be introduced in a presidential
debate? And then I have to go, yes.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,600
That was my show.
Yes,

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,130
but you would do it just like that
and everybody would start laughing.

6
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,040
We're realizing that this just do
it like a politician or I'd be like,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,590
I repudiated that show years ago.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,730
I no longer associate with
big Jay Oakerson dude.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,870
Speaking of which they put
wiener in the pokey today,

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,240
21 months in jail for sexting,
I believe as a 15 year old.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,130
Well,
look,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,440
I I that guy single handed
late probably changed America.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,260
Yeah. I mean I really like, yeah,
I don't think she really did buy,

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,850
he changed it through Dick Pics,
which,

15
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:48,720
how else were you going to change
America in 2017 Anthony Wiener?

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,110
It gets hard time. Is that the
flows? That post is hilarious.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,770
Whoever writes for the post, Damn.
They have some fucking great headlines.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,610
Anthony Wiener gets hard time.
Oh, you know, it's horrible.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,390
Is before all this happened,
he was fantastic.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,170
That guy could have been the president.
He was, he had that politician. He thing,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,000
I mean, he was he and he was like for
a young politician on the fast track,

22
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,720
but he, I mean, I really
do think Hilary Clinton,

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,110
I mean I just think it was such a close
race that any little thing probably

24
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,230
could have made the difference.
So you could blame any number of factors.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,970
But I mean the FBI coming
out and reopening an
investigation on you like less

26
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:30,900
than two weeks before an election, that's
pretty tough to get over politically.

27
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:35,070
Like in any normal year, any candidate
would be buried. But after all that,

28
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:38,760
lock her up, lock her up. There's
no way you can survive that.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,080
The FBI's looking into it,

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,110
all the people that don't want to look
into it any further than the surface,

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,660
they immediately go, oh, we fucking
God, it's over. And I'm, you know,

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,660
like I think there's also just in terms
of the politics and the way people work,

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,630
there was something about
Anthony Wiener wear, so it just,

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,820
it made the American public
think about him again.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,050
And shrimp was bringing the women who
are accusing Bill Clinton of rape to the

36
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:04,640
debates. And I think the average person
just kind of went like, wait a minute. So,

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,400
so your husband is a sexual
Predator and your best friend,

38
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,290
her husband is also a sexual predator.
Like who the fuck are these people?

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,660
Who the fuck is that the story for?
Yeah.

40
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:23,661
Well that's one of the things that got
me about Fox News because Fox News has

41
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:27,990
always been the voice of conservative
America on television, right?

42
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,220
These staunch verse, The star staunch
Voice of conservative America,

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,920
but yet all this sex stuff comes out
like the bill O'Reilly tapes where he was

44
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:42,450
calling up is whoever the girl was and
saying crazy shit with a loofah sponge.

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,330
Remember all that? Yeah, I
read about it. It was crazy.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,990
But they had recordings of it
and then it was, you know, the,

47
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,800
all the women that accused him of sexual
harassment and the sexual harassment

48
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,250
with other people and then other people
are sending Dick pics and like, Whoa,

49
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,670
you guys are freaks. And you know, it
was really crazy about it. Was that. Um,

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,620
so Roger Ailes,
who was the head of the network,

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:08,130
he went down first for sexual harassment
and then as soon as he was down like a

52
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,620
whole bunch of other people started
going down and then you really started

53
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,360
wondering like,
Oh shit.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,930
Like was it just like a new guy isn't
letting us sexually harass anymore?

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,070
What's going on with this shark
off? Okay. Well I think it was just,

56
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,150
there was a culture that they could get
away with before the Internet where they

57
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,660
were the bosses and the women were the
underlings and they all felt, you know,

58
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,410
I'm sure there's probably a lot
of dynamics plan there, right?

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,270
There's a power situation. The man, the,
the guy who's the boss is in position.

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,270
And then there's also women that
are attracted to power figures.

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,350
And then there's also this conservative,
like really repressed environment,

62
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:48,150
which always leads to freak
shit. It always does. Yeah.

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,160
And have like people buttoned down.
They always lead to freak show.

64
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,730
They have to find a way out that
pressure's got to go. Yeah, you're right.

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,120
I mean, I really, I always
say to people, if you're in a,

66
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,590
if you're in New York City, if you go
to a bar in the financial district,

67
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,800
like right after work,
it's a really crazy seen,

68
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,290
something interesting like the
exact dynamic you're talking about.

69
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,590
Whereas these people who are all day
working in this crazy like this and then

70
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,460
like the ties are loosened and it's this
like drinking and they take their shoes

71
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,460
off at the bar. You're like, whoa.
People are getting slapped on the ass.

72
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:21,220
Like crazy shit is going on.
But you wouldn't think you're a banker.

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,820
You know the guy, the guy who runs your
retirement. Uh, okay. On, you know why?

74
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:27,610
Because like we were talking about before
with like before the podcast or it was

75
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,050
like these ancient reward systems.

76
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:33,280
There's an ancient reward system for
plundering. I really believe that.

77
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,490
I think that these guys feel like their
goddamn pirates, like their plundering.

78
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,170
Yeah. They're part of the financial
market and then they're doing shots.

79
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,430
We're going to fucking Jegan.
Yeah, yeah. Fucking take them down.

80
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,260
They grab each other.
We're going to fucking take them down.

81
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,000
We're going to fucking take him down.
And if you think about it,

82
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,040
I mean if you think about um,

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,100
the acquisition of property of goods
or anything like that throughout human

84
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:55,930
history, I mean the, the idea of like a,

85
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,020
just a theory of just acquisition
of property. His leg. Yeah.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,340
Pretty relatively new.

87
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,970
And the way everything was acquired
for all of human history was through

88
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,820
conquest. Just through, you know, you
take it, you take other people's shit.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,530
And Uganda think that like a hostile
takeover must feel incredibly like sacking

90
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,970
the city again. These guys, oh, that's
from Wall Street from uh, what's his name?

91
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,010
It wasn't Wall Street. What the fuck was
this called? A wall. A full Wall Street.

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,420
Yeah. Yeah. That was a great
scene. But people resonate.

93
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:27,370
That scene resonated with
people. I'm going to fucking
go. I'm not fucking going.

94
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,350
And everybody said it's like being
above the system kind of ease.

95
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,260
But this is tapping in just same
way football taps in [inaudible].

96
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,560
It's tapping into this ancient
reward system for plundering. Yeah.

97
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,870
When men get together and they fuck
up other men and take all their shit.

98
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,580
And then we kick ass.

99
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,570
Yeah.
