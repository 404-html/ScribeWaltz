1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,040
The joe rogan experience.
What does the Scientology network,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,870
what curious. I just started everything.
Get the fuck out of here. Yeah,

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:12,660
and there are, there are advertising
it on paramount hold serious.

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,210
Desperate is paramount. Well they
might be paid. They got whose money?

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:22,650
So yeah. Do you ever drive by Scientology
building? I drove by last night. Oh,

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,050
I got the test and I want it in there.
I got the test.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,990
I went to one of those things that
you did. I held the cans. Yeah,

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,170
I was a film and a TV show for CBS and
we were outside in San Diego and a while

9
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,590
we had some downtime.

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,430
They had this thing set up like a stress
test and you go and you hold onto these

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:42,900
cans. They asked you questions I think I
want to say Brian did stand up in there.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,490
So we go up there and do,

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,600
I either did standup or like a Ted talk
or some shit in Scientology building.

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,170
Really? And he did something weird
to talk. Well, he was taking,

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,440
he was taking acting lessons with a guy
who was a rabid scientologist and then I

16
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:03,381
went to see Brian's acting
teachers sing songs from musicals,

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,940
not even a musical,
just the songs from the musical like,

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,720
oh, it was amazing. It was great.

19
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:16,320
Me and Brian were high as
Jesus on the space shuttle.

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,460
I mean we were gone. We were hugging
each other. Why it was going on.

21
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,760
We couldn't believe how
ridiculous it was. Like, oh,

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,830
he either did like a motivational talk
or stand up there though. Well, he was,

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,770
you know,
which is a thing about acting classes.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,900
A lot of my ex girlfriend,

25
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,710
one of her acting classes when I first
moved to La and I started dating,

26
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,730
this chick was an actress.

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,290
Her acting class was assigned tology
based act in class and apparently it's

28
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,710
really common. There's a lot,
or at least it was at the time.

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,500
They get kind of up with
everything coming out with that.

30
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,630
Leah Ramy or whatever her
name is. Leah Remini. Yeah,

31
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:53,530
it should be the gigs up now there's,

32
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,590
there's the Internet podcasts when
I'm full of Shit. It is, you know,

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,470
some people are just dying to get took.
They're just dying.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,450
So it was like, Yo, bro, you can be
the next fucking expendable seven.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,480
You just got to jump into the Scientology.
I'd probably check it out.

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,980
What happens with girls with girls?
Apparently they come to them,

37
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,160
then they'll arrange like boyfriend
situations and weddings here.

38
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:21,000
That's what happened with Tommy Cruz.
Right. Allegedly Katie Holmes, allegedly.

39
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:25,730
She said, fuck that noise. Now she's
with Jamie Foxx. I worked for ea

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,390
to do, do, do, do, do, do shit.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,930
Fucks linic down and
know shit. Fucking, yeah.

42
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,250
Tom Cruise's uh,
laying low right now.

43
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,790
He apparently did some crazy ass stunt
for mission impossible where they had a

44
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:52,020
film at like a hundred times. Did
you see it now? I heard Jamie hit it.

45
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,101
You didn't see it.

46
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:56,850
He jumped from a bit from building to
building that he does all his own stunts.

47
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,160
He's, he is a bad ass. He's
crazy. He does all stats it,

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,080
even when he's flying out
of the helicopter, he's the,

49
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,220
he doesn't let anyone else do it.

50
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:13,810
Okay.
