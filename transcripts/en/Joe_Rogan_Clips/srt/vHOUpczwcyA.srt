1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,080
Brian Richards, your friend,
a wildlife biologist and um,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,700
well we're going to talk
about a bunch of things,

3
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:10,410
but one of the things that I wanted to
talk about is this scary disease that uh,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,320
well when Ted Nugent was on the podcast,

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,600
he downplayed the consequences and
effects of something called CWD or chronic

6
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,090
wasting disease,

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,310
which has made it onto your farm and
you live in Wisconsin and you have this

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,910
beautiful place that we visited when we
did the immediate or television show.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,500
And, um, this is a new thing that this
chronic wasting disease was just, it just,

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,980
it decimates the deer's
health and kills them.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,400
And the suspicion is that some of this
at least comes from these high fence

12
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:50,490
operations where people grow
dear, um, and treat them like,

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,960
instead of like a wild animal,

14
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:55,860
they treat them like a domesticated animal
and have them all feeding off of the

15
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,420
same pile of food and
they share this disease.

16
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:02,460
Is this all correct and accurate?
Brian?

17
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,540
Boy, you just started out about
an hour's worth of congress.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,190
Um, so yeah, just a little bit. I'm a,

19
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:12,980
I'm allowed to let biologist with
the national wildlife health center,

20
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:16,840
US geological survey up in
Madison, Wisconsin. And so, uh,

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,690
one of the things that I spend a lot
of time on is chronic wasting disease.

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,300
I wouldn't say that makes
me necessarily an expert,

23
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:27,650
but I've gotten to know a lot of people
that I would call experts over the years.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,910
So I've gained a little bit of outage.
So I don't even mean your,

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,790
your statement there. We could
start a number of different places

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,590
this disease.
Um,

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,980
essentially just describe what it does
do these animals and why it's such a

28
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:46,700
major concern. It hasn't jumped
to humans yet that we're aware of,

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,330
that we're aware of, but it is a
possibility, a very real possibility.

30
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,080
We can't rule it out at this
point in time. Science is
unable to rule it out. So,

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,520
okay,
that's a great place to start.

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,270
Why would we care about this thing
called chronic wasting disease?

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,460
And I would argue in,

34
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,310
in some other scientists have
argued there's two major reasons.

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,810
Number one is the impacts of this
disease on members of the deer family

36
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,644
themselves.

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,190
And the other is that we cannot rule out
the possibility that CWT could become a

38
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:19,030
human health issue at some
point down the road. Guys,

39
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,050
you kind of nailed those two with regard
to deer or members of the deer family,

40
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:29,090
whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, Moose,
and most recently it's picked up in,

41
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:32,340
in reindeer,
in Norway of all places.

42
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,370
We could articulate some reasons,

43
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:39,270
some rationale why this disease might
be thought of as being important.

44
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,340
First we'd look at it would be
geographic spread. So you know,

45
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:49,341
CWD 20 years ago was thought to be this
really novel thing in a very restricted

46
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:54,630
geographic range and south eastern
Wyoming, adjacent North Eastern Colorado,

47
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:58,440
and maybe a little spill over and
in Nebraska, a wildlife biologist,

48
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,320
wildlife specialist, and looked at
this disease. It was interesting. Uh,

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,080
we didn't know much about
it at that point in time,

50
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,770
but it seemed to be very isolated there.
What does it do to the deer?

51
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,130
A kilter, right? But how
does it kill him? Alright,

52
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,220
so this is a member of a family of
diseases called transmissible spongiform

53
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:21,780
encephalopathy.
These are [inaudible] so big long words.

54
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,080
Transmissible means it
can go from animal aid.

55
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,130
Animal be spongiform means looks like a
sponge and encephalopathy means disease

56
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,130
of the brain,
she put it together.

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,250
And so this disease results in holes
in the brain resulting in progressive

58
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,640
neurological degeneration
followed by death. Okay. It's a,

59
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,170
it's a death sentence and there's no

60
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,580
war for it. It's all you can capture the
deer and give them some sort of metal

61
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,670
cation,
no cure for these diseases.

62
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,430
The sweeter diseases co you know,
there's a,

63
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,330
there's a members of the TSC
group of diseases in humans.

64
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,020
Most familiar is,
is one called [inaudible] disease.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,530
So it's very similar to mad cow
disease in the same family. So,

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,680
well I'd take [inaudible] you could say
price, honestly, I would just read it. Um,

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,710
that's an interesting,
you know, there's, uh, uh,

68
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,800
goes back and forth on
whether it's pre honor,

69
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,860
prion stand poisoner to receive the
Nobel laureate for his work on these

70
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,150
diseases.
Coined the term to prion.

71
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,720
And in his first publication
describing these diseases,

72
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:32,710
he did a phonetic spelling and it's prion.
So other researchers,

73
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:37,120
it's a especially, you know, um,
some from across the pond. Um,

74
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,360
say it's gotta be prion. And
the main reason that, you know,

75
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:44,050
some of them I've talked to about that
is that an ERC stand poizner when he

76
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,440
hears it called Prion.
Oh, so we'll say Priyanka.

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,730
Yeah.
So I'll say [inaudible] from now on.

78
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,060
Now this disease which people
know as mad cow disease, um,

79
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,670
obviously, uh, is transmissible
to humans. And, um,

80
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,410
that's one of the reasons why people are
very scared that this could potentially

81
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:05,610
jump from deer into humans.
And correct me if I'm wrong,

82
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:10,260
but it also is making its way into the
actual plants that these animals eat.

83
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,280
You, you're correct on both accounts
show with BSE, mad cow disease,

84
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,050
that was an interesting disease
where it resulted from, in essence,

85
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,310
turning cows into cannibals. We were,
which all cyclists in New Guinea,

86
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,130
right with KCC, Kirksville
with, with crew,

87
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,800
which is a human disease.

88
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,080
A TSC likely started when,
um,

89
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,420
one individual developed Roitfeld
Jacobes disease. That individual died.

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,520
And as, as a practice was the practice
in the, for a tribe in Papa New Guinea,

91
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,060
uh,

92
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,010
they practice ritualized cannibalism to
honor the dead and to help release the

93
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,370
spirits from, you know,
deceased family members.

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,720
So they would feed upon upon
the corpse and Pour, you know,

95
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,350
the bodies of their deceased.

96
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,910
So when one individual died of probably
have some variant of Coatesville Jakob's

97
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,720
disease, then the causative
agent, the prion protein,

98
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:10,280
which is concentrated in the central
nervous system and lymphatic systems of,

99
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,020
you know,
of disease patients.

100
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,250
This was fed back to other members of
the family and the extended family.

101
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,680
And so when they got sick and died
veteran again, so we saw that with Kourou,

102
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,050
um, in, uh, in the 19 [inaudible]
1960 [inaudible] around there,

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,740
um,

104
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,690
it was realized that this cannibalistic
behavior was likely the result,

105
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,780
you know, or the [inaudible] of
the cause of disease transmission.

106
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,800
Cannibalism was outlawed.
And at that point in time,

107
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:43,100
you broke completely the d
disease transmission cycle.

108
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,070
So no more new cases of Kourou,

109
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,410
but they had lingering cases with an
extended incubation period up to 40 years

110
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,190
later before Kourou.
Finally burned out of that population.

111
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,600
So now with,
with BSC or mad cow disease,

112
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,650
we were doing exactly in essence the
same thing, not exactly the same thing,

113
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:04,484
but in essence.

114
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,700
So in an effort to maximize production
and reduce the amount of waste when they

115
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:15,780
butchered cattle, we would take
all the awful Oh FFA l you know,

116
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:17,510
the high,
the bones,

117
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:20,870
the parts that are inedible
and we would had rendered them,

118
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,790
Cook them at high temperature
and typically, you know,
high pressure as well.

119
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,150
And it turns into a slurry
high protein slurry.

120
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,530
You skim the fat off the top of that
and then dehydrate the rest of it.

121
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,730
And you have, you know, kind of a meat
and bone meal, a high protein supplement,

122
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,630
realizing that cattle grow faster
and produce better when they're,

123
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,910
when on a hyper higher protein diet,

124
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,440
it seemed reasonable to use waste
material from cows to feed back to cows.

125
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,750
So at some point, turning, turning,
turning thousand, the candles.

126
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,940
So at some point in time
a cow developed a TSC,

127
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,130
a prion disease,
whether it came from scrapey,

128
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:04,790
the TSC of sheep or arose
on its own is unknown,

129
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,380
but that cow died.

130
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,360
It was rendered into meat and bone meal
and there's high protein feed was then

131
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:15,650
fed out to hundreds to thousands. And
correct me if I'm wrong, for these prions,

132
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,720
they can survive up to more than a
thousand degree temperature. Yeah.

133
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:25,130
Surviving is kind of a, a strange
term, Joe in the, they're not alive.

134
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,400
Start with, it's a protein
a, they can persist,

135
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,140
they cannot be inactivated. So
yeah, it to, he's pretty Harley.

136
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,580
These premiums are not
necessarily a living thing
like a disease or a virus or a

137
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,790
bacteria.
Well there a disease causing agent,

138
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,040
but they are incredibly unique.

139
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,810
They're sitting there and eating Hologic
agent like a virus or bacteria or a

140
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,000
parasite could be causing disease.

141
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,960
But all these other things have
genetic material. They're alive,

142
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,990
which allows them to change
rapidly to evolve over time.

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,380
So the whole concept
that you have a protein,

144
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,620
a protein that all mammals produce in
a normal form can be converted after

145
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:13,881
production into a disease associated
form that has these radically different

146
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,760
characteristics. One that you mentioned
was, you know, resistance to heat,

147
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,610
heat treatment,
a normal prion protein,

148
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,720
and we have billions of them
circulating in our bodies right now. Um,

149
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:27,270
have a specific purposes,
cellular purpose,

150
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,540
we don't know exactly what it is when
it's likely involved in some sort of

151
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,190
intracellular communication.

152
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,120
It's a string of around 250 amino acids,

153
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,440
so relatively short protein.
It does whatever it's does,

154
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,300
and then the body recycles,

155
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:47,301
breaks that chain of amino acids down
into its component parts and recycles it.

156
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,450
It turns out that normal cellular
premium protein likely has a half life of

157
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:55,860
maybe four to six hours. Okay, so you're
producing them relatively constantly.

158
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,610
Then there's the disease associated form
in all diseases associated prions start

159
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,840
as the normal cellular Priya.
So they're converted from one,

160
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:10,680
three dimensional form to
a different form. Okay.

161
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,520
And this different form has these
radically different characteristics.

162
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,810
One is heat resistance and other
is UV light resistance. Um,

163
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,830
I mentioned that the normal cell prion
protein has a half life of maybe four to

164
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:23,664
six hours.

165
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,600
The disease associated ones can persist
in the environment for years and

166
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:30,330
potentially up to decades. Okay.
And when you say persistent,

167
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,961
the environment,

168
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:35,961
you mean in like on the
ground on leaves on like how,

169
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:36,760
how would they be

170
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,900
persistence? Yeah, all of those
things jump through. So if a deer,

171
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,320
we'll share [inaudible] infectious agent,
this prion protein.

172
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,400
And so from the time of deer is infected,

173
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,860
it's probably around two
years before it develops.

174
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,890
Clinical signs of disease goes down,
he'll lose as it's fear,

175
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:58,880
a human's dramatic weight
loss. Um, all of those things,

176
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,890
that incubation period,

177
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,190
it's probably shedding infectious agent
for the vast majority of that time

178
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:10,520
period. So it looks healthy, but
it's able of transmitting disease.

179
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,160
We'd call that Ala typhoid
Mary Syndrome Syndrome.

180
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,010
The two deer that we,
uh,

181
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,070
that were positive on our farm to box
two and a half year old bucks were we had

182
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:24,100
them tested. As you know, we're, for the
last several years we've been getting, uh,

183
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,360
initially we got our,
uh,

184
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,610
only bucks tested and then the last
three or four years we've gotten all the

185
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:34,410
deer tested. They were a two and a
half year old bucks, perfectly look,

186
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,260
perfectly healthy.

187
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,740
And these are the first ones that you've
tested that tested positive and we

188
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,720
tested
in excess of 35 deer over the last,

189
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:46,990
well more than that, but it would be more
like 50 during the incubation period.

190
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:50,950
Would they still test positive at
some point? They will at some point.

191
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:54,130
So that could be spreading
infectious agents testing positive.

192
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,450
Yes. Oh, that's fun.

193
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,270
So it's say it's probably between three
and six months out when we can test an

194
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,800
animal test positive,

195
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,960
but it's likely shedding infectious agent
at least at lower quantities prior to

196
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,230
that point in time.
And so then,

197
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,090
so it's shedding infectious agent.

198
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:18,070
It's capable of transmitting disease
and cave long before it looks clinically

199
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,070
ill. That's, that's one of the
real challenges with this disease.

200
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:24,550
From a management standpoint.
They look perfectly healthy,

201
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,140
they act perfectly healthy,

202
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
but they're starting to have
that progressive neurological
degeneration that we

203
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:36,550
can only see very near the end of
disease. So, correct me if I'm wrong,

204
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:41,551
but this seems like we could potentially
be facing a ticking time bomb of many,

205
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:46,720
many, many deer that are wandering around
out there right now that look totally

206
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,180
normal, that are spreading this
stuff all over the place and they're,

207
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:51,250
they're acting normally
look perfectly healthy.

208
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,600
And then obviously with this
multi year incubation period,

209
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,580
this kid just cascade. And I think
we've seen evidence of that now.

210
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,140
Um, started at, you know, he talked
about being isolated disease.

211
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:09,820
It was picked up in Wisconsin at
the end of 2001. Um, as of today,

212
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,720
CWD has been,

213
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:15,721
now Penn picked up in 25 states in
captive and or free ranging populations in

214
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:20,500
whitetail deer, mule deer, elk
or Moose, two Canadian provinces,

215
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,400
uh, in addition to two is
picked up in South Korea.

216
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,500
And that was real interesting.

217
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:31,470
It was in captive elk and those elk
still had Canadian ear tags in them.

218
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,480
So we pretty much know how CWD those
Elkton swim across the Pacific pond.

219
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,930
Most recently it was picked up,
uh,

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,410
two years ago in free
ranging reindeer in Norway.

221
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,130
And subsequent to that,
it was picked up in a small handful,

222
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:53,131
like three or four moose and a red deer
in Norway in a single moose in Finland.

223
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,300
It's a real concern over in Norway,
um,

224
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,920
with reindeer. Okay. So reindeer
are very gregarious. Yeah.

225
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,090
Whitetail deer, Caribou,
Caribou, reindeer.

226
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,460
So not unusual to see him in herds
of hundreds of animals. So very,

227
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:17,170
very different than what we see
with whitetail deer, mule deer, elk,

228
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:21,130
or Moose. We don't see those huge hurts.
But with elk, you can in the wintertime.

229
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,211
But anyway,

230
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:27,160
it's thought that this gregarious behavior
might really facilitate transmission

231
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:32,080
and reindeer. Right? So when it was
picked up in reindeer, Norway said,

232
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,880
you know, we maybe should do something.
It's an interesting story. And then, um,

233
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,470
you know, Norway has got experience
with scrapey and sheep, uh,

234
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,820
and so they'd have a long history.

235
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,490
What does scrimping scrapey
is the same as well.

236
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,410
It's the same family diseases in sheep.

237
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,890
It's actually the first one that was
described scrapey we've known since the

238
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,820
early 17 hundreds a disease,
a domestic sheep,

239
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,210
and it's called scrapey because
of the behavior these animals,

240
00:14:59,211 --> 00:15:03,260
once they enter the clinical
phase of disease display and they,

241
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,510
they seem like they itch bat.

242
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,440
And so they'll go up to fence post and
other objects and they literally rub

243
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,620
their hide off of their body.
So that's the name scraping.

244
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,520
And it's the same progressive
neurological disorder followed by death.

245
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,690
And I think about it.

246
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:22,370
So as this disease creates
vacuums in the brain,

247
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,870
it's killing off neurons.
And so without those neurons firing,

248
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:29,420
you fall into that
progressive degeneration.

249
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,510
And yet at some point your
body can no longer survive.

250
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:36,170
And that's what's really spooky about
how this thing kills. So anyway,

251
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:39,770
go back to Norway when they detected CWT.

252
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,980
Trying to keep this a little bit closer
to you. You're very soft spoken. Oh,

253
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:47,540
no worries. I can hear myself. Plenty of
the problem is the recording. Sorry. Okay,

254
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,410
no worries.

255
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,410
So when they picked up CWD and reindeer
in Norway and the researchers over there

256
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,570
had witnessed what we are lack of
success on this side of the pond over the

257
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:04,040
course of the last 20 years. And they
took it very, very seriously. Um,

258
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,010
so they took kind of some harsh medicine.
Uh,

259
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:11,090
they announced their plans that they
were going to eliminate a herd unit.

260
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:15,950
They were going to kill every rain
deer in an entire herd unit in Norway.

261
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,090
The idea is to eliminate
the host population.

262
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:22,670
It's called stamping out
and it works in a pen.

263
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,260
This is the first time had
been done realistically in
a free ranging population.

264
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,010
Oh, ideas. We don't have effective
tools for management. It's disease.

265
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,090
They were very fearful of what would
happen if this spread throughout that

266
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:39,470
reindeer population and throughout
other reindeer herds. And like Alaska,

267
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:44,280
they have multiple herds.
Like last year I hunted Caribou with,

268
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,690
with Steve up in the 40 mile river
area. But there were, you know,

269
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,160
and so they're very localized.
This is probably not,

270
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:54,760
but at least they have a range
that they move through. So,

271
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,600
and in Norway they have two or three
different herds, many more than that.

272
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,700
So I don't know exactly how many heard
points you could isolate one of the herd.

273
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,120
So the idea is before they get to be
any worse before it gets any farther,

274
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,960
let's take it out.
So they had a hunting season.

275
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,870
They allowed a hunter's to
take as many as they could,

276
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,940
which was a little over
a thousand reindeer.

277
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,950
And then they came in
with government agents.

278
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,980
But it's sharp concern that the hunters
could eat something with CWD and then

279
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:28,040
catch it. Well, that's always a concern.
But what we can talk about human,

280
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,110
let me finish this one up though,
with Norway in it, they took,

281
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,520
literally took the bull by the horns. They
decided to do what was very unpopular.

282
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,000
What we have not been able
to do in North America, they,

283
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,560
and so after the hunting season,

284
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,580
government agent sharpshooters took an
additional 1400 reindeer as they killed

285
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,860
every reindeer in this herd unit.
And they're going to, it fallow,

286
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,310
allow no reindeer in there
for a minimum of five years.

287
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,890
So it says every bit of promise of
being the first large scale success with

288
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,970
dealing with this disease in a free
ranging heard pretty different than what

289
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,160
we've been able to accomplish over here.
