1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,650
Search net gear for it's there.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,280
Dump it. It doesn't keep rolling.
There's no hills. Bitch was snow hill.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,080
Fucking worst. Indiana is the
worst state in its own country.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,970
But even in Indiana they found gold
and it became like Qatar or some shit.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,220
They just, you know, they found oil.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,550
They felt like some crazy new patch or
oil and all of a sudden they started

7
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,570
building the world's tallest building
there and all the same kind of shit they

8
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,510
do in Dubai. We do buy
apparently is insane. Now.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,350
They have indoor surfing things in
Dubai in the middle of the day you get a

10
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,770
surfboard and your indoor surfing,
he could ski indoors.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,430
They've indoor skiing and Dubai.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,950
And you're going to have that here in the
compound. Do you have a name for this?

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,480
Uh, new, uh, I can't go to pounds
and it's kind of born. Yeah.

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,140
And plus I think Anthony [inaudible],
Anthony [inaudible],

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,510
who I have to give his props too.

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,080
He's probably the reason why I started
a podcast. It was, first of all,

17
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,490
because he was a part of opiate Anthony,

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,380
which was the first time
I ever thought like,

19
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:05,130
I really liked doing radio or the way
opie and Anthony did it. It was great.

20
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,320
We would come in you, you
have done it too, right? Yeah,

21
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:11,130
but I remember first doing it
going, wow, am I the shitty episode?

22
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:15,940
Because no one really talked a lot. We
just had fun. I know. I took me a minute.

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,830
Oh, they just decided to do what
they wanted to do with radio.

24
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,730
I just thought I was boring because
there's no bells and whistles and fake

25
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:27,060
laughs and to this day I don't think
opie and Anthony got the credit that it

26
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:31,180
deserved because I think that they
let us, they let us, they're like,

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,860
they're the best show. They were the
best show ever that don't exist anymore,

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,723
unfortunately.

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,590
But they were the best show ever to
go on as it exist in their own world.

30
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:40,980
They do.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,790
I know Anthony does and he still has
his therapy brief was recently fired.

32
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,060
I don't, I don't know what, I didn't
know if he started his own thing.

33
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:51,240
I don't know if he can't have,
Norton is still doing his thing with Sam.

34
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,600
Norton is still doing his thing with
Sam and Norton does a thing with the UFC

35
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,390
too. He does UFC on sensor with
Matt Serra, which is hilarious.

36
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,330
And Norton also does the
chip chip person podcasts.

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,720
He does all that on his own now. Yeah.
I've never listened to it, but I've,

38
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,160
I've been tweeted about it enough to know
that it's a character. It's hilarious.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,660
It's so uncomfortable. It's so good. It's
one of my favorite things that he does.

40
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:16,370
It's fucking amazing. You want to
see a video of it? Go coat. Now

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,900
we're in a a live broadcast. No,
but I'll pull it up sometimes.

42
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:26,580
I hated making people listen to 30
seconds of Cha Cha Cha. There was good.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,340
I liked it. Good. Let people
know. A lot of people don't know.

44
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,090
There's a lot of shit people don't know.
You know,

45
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,170
there's only one way to find out.
Someone has to tell you.

46
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,420
I find out from commercials
that a little help.
