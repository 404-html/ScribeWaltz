1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,650
Right. Right. But, uh, but
let's talk about clicks.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,230
One of the things we talked about the
other day, his traffic assignment,

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,170
so I know you asked me this,
they're fighting for their lives.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,951
It's a serious issue,

5
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:11,610
but I just like to point out their
lives never existed in the media space.

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,830
Please explain that because
that was one of the more,

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,910
most illuminating aspects of our
conversation on the phone. Yeah. Um, it's,

8
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:19,830
it's publicly known,

9
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:22,260
but not talked about a whole lot
that these media organizations,

10
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,340
mostly these digital news startups
don't actually get a lot of use.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,310
So what they do is,
it's called a traffic assignment.

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,060
There's a company called
comscore that tracks the, the,

13
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,950
the viewership that unique
views these sites have.

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,060
If you're trying to attract investment
and you say we get 20 million views per

15
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,020
month, they're going to say, that's cool,
but this site gets 60. What do they do?

16
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,040
Well, there are some sites,
this is according to variety,
modern farmer.com. What?

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,280
What does that, I have, I have
no idea. I've never heard of it.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,150
But there are many sites which you've
probably seen where it's like the top 25

19
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,970
celebrities who you know,
mess up their makeup. Yes.

20
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,150
You click the page and I'll show you a
photo. In order to see the next photo,

21
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,740
you got to click the next page.

22
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,890
That's that way they turn you one
person at 25 unique views are 25 years.

23
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:11,490
I don't want to say unique then
accompany like vice for instance,

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,960
we'll buy the assignment of your
traffic and attributed to themselves.

25
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,160
So when the comscore numbers come out it
will say all of those views from those

26
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,400
clickbait sites are actually
vice. Right. That's fucking crazy.

27
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,170
And so there was a controversy a
bit, again, I'm quoting variety here,

28
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:28,861
I don't want to get sued,

29
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:33,861
but variety said that their traffic
went down 17% because someone they were

30
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:37,890
buying traffic assignment from was like
going through turmoil and shake and

31
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,650
being checked, shaken up. And
another one of their traffic,

32
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,410
Simon partners switched
to, I think like, you know,

33
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,970
it got sold to NBC or something. So. So
what ends up happening? Well, I can say,

34
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,100
um, a little bit. There was
a company that, uh, was a
prominent digital news outlet.

35
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,530
I knew someone there who was,
um,

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,480
decently high up who told me our company
is contemplating whether or not we

37
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,900
should engage in traffic assignments
to inflate our numbers. And I said,

38
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,140
don't do it. Like, that's wrong. And
they said, but we need investment.

39
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,030
So I wonder if is that fraud?
Yes.

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,430
But if comscore is,

41
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,780
is just lumping the numbers
together and I go to you and say,

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,100
according to comscore, our network
brings in 60 million. I didn't lie.

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,150
That's all true. Yes, that's
true. So here's what happens.

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,920
These companies get massive investment.

45
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,650
They don't actually generate
enough clicks or enough money.

46
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,810
Then once the investment runs out,
those jobs never existed. Those were,

47
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:40,980
those were padded by investors.
So God, that squirrely,

48
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,310
everything collapses. It seems like
fraud. I mean it does to me. Yeah.

49
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,240
That seems like if that was, if
you were doing that with, uh,

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,160
some tech stock. Yup. Yeah. Right? Yep.

51
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,920
Yeah. Musically or something
like that. You know, uh,

52
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,760
I was told by another individual was
headed one of these digital companies that

53
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:05,610
he felt like what we were seeing was
akin to the securities, uh, problem.

54
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,540
The expense that a mortgage back
securities from designate it.

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,000
If that's a better analogy. That's what
he said. He said, I'm thinking about this.

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,010
You've had all of these big companies,
these big investment,

57
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,000
hundreds of millions of dollars,

58
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,090
$200 million investment into these digital
media outlets because they're seeing

59
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:23,080
these numbers. But underneath there's
nothing there. And it's crazy.

60
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,960
So if you're investing money, so
if you've got some, some cash,

61
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,680
you've worked your ass off and you've
generated a lot of money and you're like,

62
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,270
look,
we're going to get into the digital space.

63
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,110
We have a website that has 90 million
clicks and we're going to take that.

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,320
And then you find out you just
got fucking host. How has that,

65
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,070
not fraud because buyer beware?
Well,

66
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,330
because there's laws that legalized
fraud. You know, here's, here's the thing,

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,290
right? I use a lot. Is it a law? But
it, look, it's, it's, it's, it's,

68
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,320
it's an interesting loophole. It's not
fraud. Because they didn't lie to you,

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,333
they didn't deceive you.

70
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,950
You had every opportunity to look at those
numbers and see where they came from,

71
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,280
to understand what their network
was. Okay, well that may be the case,

72
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,930
but the act of doing it,

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,760
the act of the fact that you can do it
and really you're getting monitored.

74
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,620
It's fucking crazy shady. But I'll
tell you, I'll tell you what else.

75
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,240
Something else too. And I, and I say
this with the utmost respect for,

76
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:15,550
for Shane Smith who, um, you know, I
worked at vice, we've gone out for drinks.

77
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,640
They flew me out. I love Shane. He's
a cool dude, but he's brilliant.

78
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,650
Absolutely brilliant. He
is, he is a master of, uh,

79
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,420
I don't know what you disco w we would
call it, but it's a form, uh, you know,

80
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:27,880
so I grew up with a bunch of hacker
buddies and it in a small little hacker

81
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,830
community and social engineering. It's
something that I've been, you know,

82
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,170
relatively well versed in. And Shane,
whether he knows it or not really,

83
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,990
really understands how people think
and how to get them to do things.

84
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,140
So I'll give you a fat,
fat. A fascinating example.

85
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,380
I left device in 2014 and after I left,

86
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,320
some of the people I had had brought on
through recommendation were still there.

87
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,120
This buddy of mine says, dude,
good news. I'm going to be running.

88
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm going to be helping produce the
news program for the cable channel.

89
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,550
I was like, wow, congratulations.
Does that mean you're
moving to Toronto? He goes,

90
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:04,000
why would I move to Toronto and I was
like to work on the cable channel.

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,140
This is back in 2014 he goes, we talking
about we're getting a cable channel.

92
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm going to work on the new show, and
I was like, dude, it was a Rogers deal.

93
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,080
The cable channels in Canada.
It wasn't a couple of years later.

94
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,220
So they got the u s based channel.

95
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,930
But what happened was a bunch of my
friends who worked at vice didn't know the

96
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,580
cable channel they got
was based in Canada,

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,960
but they believed they were going to be
working on a cable channel in the u s

98
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,890
that's important because you need people
to really want to work there and be

99
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:30,724
passionate.

100
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,940
And Shane was a master of giving you
just enough information so that you

101
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:37,510
believed in what you were doing without
realizing it's actually not that great.

102
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,850
And I've got, I'm not trying to be
Dick, I think Shane's fantastic.

103
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,320
I don't blame him for this,
but it's clever.

104
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,680
You get a bunch of employees who believe
they're going to be on this big new

105
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:48,100
American cable channel. Well, she never
said American. He just had cable channel.

106
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,830
It's your fault for assuming
it was going to be an America,

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,310
but that meant a lot to those employees.
So you're able to boost the morale,

108
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,590
get everybody really excited
until they find out was in Canada.

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,620
And then they were like, wait,
what? What? Eventually they did.

110
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,040
They did get their US channel. But
that's, you know, Shane's, he's brilliant.

111
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,460
He really is. He's a, he's, you ever
play civilization? The video game? No,

112
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,880
it's fantastic. I love this game.
I'm playing civ six right now and,

113
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,230
and you can get, they're called great
people. They're called great people, uh,

114
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,200
that if you earn enough points,
you'll get, you'll get like Galileo,

115
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,610
he'll appear in your civilization museum.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,570
I firmly believe that in a hundred
years. The next, you know, sisalation 50,

117
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,070
you'll be able to earn a great merchant
to Shane Smith because of how, like I,

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,230
you know,
he was able to build this empire.

119
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:34,460
He did it through very clever ways of
getting investment. And I admittedly,

120
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,120
I really liked the stuff they used to do
back in the day. I think the guys, wow,

121
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,200
he,
he knows how to do it.

122
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,980
And the reason I bring him up is because
the big story about traffic assignment

123
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,030
was vice losing like 17% because
of that practice they were doing.

124
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,540
So he really knew how to do the
smoke and mirrors. You know what,

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,790
when you look at the other, uh,
when you look at how it pays out,

126
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,530
plant pans out to all the other news
outlets and then having gets laid off,

127
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,750
you have to, one, you don't,

128
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,360
you don't have to wonder why a thousand
jobs just got lost in the past week.

129
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,020
It was just investment money.
And once they reached their threshold,

130
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,090
it all came crashing down. The,
the, the modern farmer example,

131
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,750
like the modern farmer, what does
it, I think it's just the clicks.

132
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:19,751
Just the fact that that you can actually
buy those clicks and attribute them to

133
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:24,610
something different. And then you can tell
people in the oil company views I got,

134
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,510
yeah, do that and send it over
to Joe rogan.com Yo. Yeah.

135
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,360
And there's other really
clever things to like, um,

136
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,490
I don't think this one is on par,

137
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:38,460
but make you have one youtube channel
with a thousand subs, make 10 more.

138
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:41,960
Ask all your subs to subscribe.
Now you've got 10,000 subs, get it.

139
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,610
Same thousand people 10 times. And
you've got, you go around telling people,

140
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,460
I've got 10,000 subscribers when in
reality it's just a thousand people on 10

141
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:54,020
channels. So it was really clever ways
to inflate your numbers and this attracts

142
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:56,480
investment. It'll it also,
but more importantly,

143
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,690
it allows leverage in dealing with
ad with ad buyers and ad networks.

144
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,950
What are people doing when they're
boosting up their Instagram numbers? Uh,

145
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,710
I don't know a lot about Instagram trying
to pull it up. I can't show you. Right.

146
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:11,120
And I just went to a website by you,
two views.com for $2,800.

147
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:15,760
You can have a million views that's there.
There's, there's, there's, there's um,

148
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,400
there's, there's good reasons to do
it. Not if you want to be a youtuber.

149
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,080
If you want to be successful on youtube,

150
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,830
buying views ensures you will never
make it. But look at it this way.

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,810
No one do this. No one, I
am not advocating for one.

152
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm about to explain film 10 videos,
a full season of a,

153
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:39,701
the Joe Rogan travel adventure
by a million views on
each to be padded out over

154
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:43,310
a month. Go to a and,
e, look at this show,

155
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:47,300
we launched million views per
episode. You want to buy it? Wow.

156
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,810
It's got a bunch of fans, a million people
watch you see the episodes. Fantastic.

157
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,890
You seen it. You see what I mean? Yes.
Well if you're full of shit, but hey,

158
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,660
there are people who,
who it's snake oil is people who do this.

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,900
But here's the thing, you get
access to a network with real views,

160
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,380
you'll get traffic, right. You know, if
you can trick your way into getting on TV,

161
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:09,090
fake it till you make it, it's dirty. It's
a, it's illegal. Right. And that's fraud.

162
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,200
Well actually I don't know if that, I
don't think it is fraud if while I am the,

163
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,430
the clicks like that, I think,
I think New York, there was,

164
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,090
someone sent me an article that uh,

165
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,540
the attorney general of ones
that may have been New York said,

166
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,860
misrepresenting yourself online through
fake views, clicks and likes is illegal.

167
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,660
I think what they were saying is that
using other people's images to create fake

168
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,910
accounts is like invasion
of privacy or something.

169
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,040
But we're getting to that point. But you
know, there's people who play that game,

170
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,980
I guess you, you, you can really,
you can really pull it off.

171
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,030
I've met a lot of people who,
there's a bunch of tricks, man.
