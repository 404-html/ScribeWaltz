00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,020
Hello Freak bitches where you saw a lot
of the hypocrites was in the first few

2
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,880
days of this Harvey
Weinstein, please. Yeah,

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,450
and you know what, men at the end of
the week, they were all fucked him.

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:19,260
Discuss those cause they all fucking
knew about it. How they all knew.

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,290
They all knew about it for years and
none of they all want to raise their

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,650
fucking head. You know what bro?
When hobbies was given them movies,

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,700
nobody was complaining. Yeah. Well
I've, I've heard nobody was complaining.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,200
Nobody was going to
play in it from a girl.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,770
She was saying that a Harvey Weinstein
gave them all careers. I was like, wow,

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:36,930
that's a crazy, crazy argument. The one,

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,300
two of the chicks tank them in the
ask us now you're going to acute.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,610
Listen to leave me the fuck alone.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,810
The ones that really need the smack at
the mouth of the guys that came out and

14
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:46,051
said,

15
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:50,850
I got molested once I got got
touched on a party one time.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,500
We live for that shit. We live for
somebody to touch a fucking Dick.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,560
You know what I'm saying? We're not going
to go to therapy. We don't say nothing.

18
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,910
Somebody grabs you dick. He just
fucking smoked gay guy and whatever.

19
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,570
Everybody needs a break from time to
time you'd have a lot of gay guys suck a

20
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,330
Dick with ice cubes and then mum, it's
a party. You know what I'm saying?

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,770
I don't know.
I don't know.

22
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:15,120
But I had a friend one time that he let
anybody suck his dick. Anybody, anybody,

23
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:17,960
anybody who wants to suck his dick did
suck is yummy. I'm sticking really.

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
And one day he was telling me about
fucking get his dick sucked by a gay guy

25
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,840
with ice cubes in his mouth. I nearly
fucking died. He just let the guy do it.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,060
Yeah. If he goes fuck it.
What was the conversation?

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,450
He was telling me how his mouth was cold
and all this shit and that was fucking

28
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,920
dying.
I couldn't believe it.

29
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,960
They couldn't get the guy
while he's sucking his dick,

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,900
I don't want to know about that.
She would want to know.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,900
But you wanted to know about the guy
getting his dick sucked by a dude with ice

32
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,380
cubes in his mouth. I mean, why not? What
he told me is watching it. First of all,

33
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,470
when he told me this story, I was young.
I had never heard that story before.

34
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,990
I was like 18 he goes out of
the fucking guy. Suck my Dick.

35
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:51,210
Wouldn't time with ice cube one time,
but if it was so good,

36
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,550
why don't I keep going?
Yeah.

37
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,420
It's tough to find somebody who was
suck a dick with ice cubes in them math,

38
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:58,440
unless you give them the small 50 I
think once you put it out there you could

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,660
put that flag up if he can't come.

40
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,020
That was the funniest thing when
that crazy bitch from Superman,

41
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,270
cause she popped up like eight days later.

42
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,470
Harvey took his dick out one time and I
told him put that back in your pants and

43
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,530
crazy chick from superman. Which
one? What's that chick? That's crazy.

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,350
All the one that was hiding in
the bushes when they found her.

45
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,530
She had no teeth at one. What the Hell
is her name? What's her name? Superman.

46
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,910
Christopher Reeve, right? No, the other
one wasn't superman. Christopher Reeve.

47
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,510
Early Superman, right? Yeah.

48
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,330
It was the one with Dean Cain who was the
crazy and Kane who was the one in that.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,460
Margot kidder is crazy, right?
Yeah, so this was the other one.

50
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,294
Then the other one month,

51
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,610
you're talking about the one who was in
superman with Dean Cain to TV show. Yeah,

52
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:42,570
maybe. It wasn't really pretty girls
name. Terri [inaudible] her name.

53
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,480
She got to talk in the mic butter.
She was on a TV show.

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,820
She was in desperate housewives
too, right? Yeah. No, it wasn't her.

55
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,240
I had an ex girlfriend of mine get so
mad when I was talking about how pretty

56
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,650
she was. Let me see. Superman actress
found frightened in the bushes. Yeah,

57
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:02,380
that was in six Margo kid or yeah,
she went crazy.

58
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,340
47 year old Canadian born actress. Best
known. You know what? That's the thing.

59
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,700
Once you hit like late forties and you
one of those actresses and they stopped

60
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,880
calling and you are already
crazy and the pressure builds up,

61
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,850
she'd cut off her own hair with a
razor blade and attempt to alter her

62
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,790
appearance.
A Glendale Police Sargent Rick Young said,

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,660
Oh boy,

64
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,550
she's taken to Olive View Medical Center
for a 72 hour psychiatric evaluation.

65
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,260
They a spared 71 hours and 50
minutes by just bringing her to me

66
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,480
all the way. Yeah, that bitch
is crazy. What happened to you?

67
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,160
Have you had that with Corey
Feldman though? I don't know.

68
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,250
He apparently got arrest, all that
thing. I made a joke and people get met.

69
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,770
We did. They got mad, but it wasn't them
getting mad as me getting mad at myself.

70
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,240
What was the Joe?
Uh,

71
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,270
he was wearing a really small jacket
while he's doing this performance at minor

72
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:01,840
league baseball game and he was doing
like this Michael Jackson thing,

73
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,940
but the jacket was so small it goes,

74
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,360
is that a jacket he was wearing when he
was getting diddled when he was a little

75
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:09,460
kid? And I was like, why
did I joke around that?

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,620
It was just trying to make Greg laugh
and I just, I said something that I was,

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,400
and then afterwards when I saw it,
especially out of context,

78
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,720
I was very disappointed in myself.

79
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,600
He wants 10 million to
fucking suppose pedophile.

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
He saw that he's out of his mind, I
think. Um, I don't think he, first of all,

81
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,830
he never said that Michael Jackson
did anything to him. He was,

82
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:28,240
he said Michael Jackson didn't,

83
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,180
but he said that there's
a lot of pedophilia in
Hollywood and he wants to make

84
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:32,290
some sort of a movie on it,

85
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,770
which I'm sure there's a lot
of pedophilia in Hollywood,

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,530
but like this idea that
people trying to kill him.

87
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,010
You were saying that people are
trying to run him over and said, well,

88
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,230
isn't that what we're saying? I watched
the video full. I have a hard time.

89
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,400
I felt bad. If they wanted to kill,
hold up. If they wanted to kill him,

90
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:52,060
he'd be dead. Yeah. Tried
to hit him. That's not real.

91
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,420
See this is like weird paranoia shit.
Let me tell you something.

92
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,740
If they want to kill you,

93
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,730
you're dead and it's not going to
be trucks trying to run you over.

94
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,560
It's going to be a guy out of nowhere,

95
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,580
shoots you in the head and gets in his
car and no one's going to know who he is

96
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,580
and no one's going to catch him because
they're going to hire a professional,

97
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,570
like this idea that someone's gonna like
miss him with a car and then they're

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,560
chasing them or running them down. I find
that very hard. I mean, it's possible,

99
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,090
but I find it very hard to believe.

100
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,390
I always think that like if someone
is a very powerful man, like,

101
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,830
like I don't know if the Clintons
ever whacked anybody, but if they did,

102
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:30,260
they whacked those fucking people.
Like that one guy. That was the big,

103
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,340
the big conspiracy theory about the guy
who released all this stuff to wikileaks,

104
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,760
the denim DNC guy. Seth rich. Yeah.
They killed that motherfucker.

105
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,750
Whoever did it,

106
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,020
whether he was killed because some
random person decided to shoot him in the

107
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:48,010
back in the middle of the night and
not steal his watch or his phone or his

108
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,650
wallet.
Whether it's that or whether it's,

109
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:54,700
what Julian Assange from wikileaks said
is that there's consequences to leaking

110
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,710
information to wikileaks because that's
what they were saying and people were

111
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,430
saying, look, this is another one in the
Clinton body count people and then this,

112
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,860
you know,

113
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,980
giant conspiracy theories about how many
people the Clinton's have had killed.

114
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,220
I don't know if that's true or not.
I have zero information,

115
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,180
but I do know when people want you
dead, you're dead. You're dead.

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,290
When they're real people like that,
that are real killers and evil fucks.

117
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,200
There's a lot of people that
have been killed like Putin.

118
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,670
If Putin wants you dead,

119
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,960
you get shot on TV in front of
everybody and nothing happens.

120
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,050
No one goes to jail. No one
gets caught. You're just dead.

121
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,300
That's the type of people we're talking
about. So this, you know, I just,

122
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,220
I have a hard time believing that.

123
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,940
Like someone's getting like barely missed
by a car. That's like some movie shit.

124
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,320
Like they were coming after me,

125
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,680
but I drive to the bushes at the last
minute and now I'm hiding in a motel

126
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:44,960
somewhere and I can't tell you where.
But if you give me $10 million,

127
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,080
I want to make a movie.
You don't want,

128
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,640
I feel bad for Corey from when you see
that. When you see that performance.

129
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,740
I mean that,
but he's a nice kid and stuff.

130
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,230
You could see Holly was
just fucking made a mockery.

131
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:57,620
Like they just beat him up though. Well
he grew up on TV in the movie. Yeah.

132
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,970
They beat him up. Roll up in the movies.
You, you know you don't have a childhood.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,220
Who the fuck do you know who I named?

134
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:08,000
One that made it through that
meat grinder of growing up famous.

135
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,980
That's not completely fucking crazy.

136
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,660
Name one name one look,

137
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,570
Miley Cyrus might've gotten out of it
better than any of them. She's like,

138
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:21,410
her new album's really good. I loose,
he's fucking town. She's great, Bro.

139
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,430
Don't have gives you those ones that
she's up on the hill and Tennessee with a

140
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:29,460
little band and this thing of outside
in the mountains near cover of Jolene,

141
