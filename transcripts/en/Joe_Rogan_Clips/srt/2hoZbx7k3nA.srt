1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,970
Like this is, okay, this is
the tonight show your Carson,
but we figured out a way,

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,330
Carson. Now, do you know that?
Right? That's the difference.

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:13,770
That's the shift. That's why Netflix
can't even compete. Netflix has done,

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,910
they're not done done. What
are you talking about? You
see Charlie Wilson's war,

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,250
no movie about Tom Hanks movie about
America getting an evolved with the Afghan

6
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:26,550
conflict and Afghanistan board doesn't
really matter, but the idea is this.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,630
They're fighting the Russians,
the Afghanis, right? So the
Americans go, okay, boom,

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,880
give them a $5,000 rocket launcher and
they're going to shoot down a $5 million

9
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:39,150
helicopter and eventually Russia
just won't be able to compete, right?

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,420
Netflix pays $100 million to Aaron
Sorkin or whoever to make a TV show,

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,230
right? Right. That distracts
you for two hours, right?

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,580
Youtube pays zero million dollars to Joe
Rogan and Jamie to make a podcast that

13
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,870
distracts you for two hours every day.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,310
Netflix cannot compete, but it's a
different animal. You got to realize,

15
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,920
first of all,
they have way more people than just me.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,790
They also are putting together something
that requires a lot of money to create.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,010
Sure. You enjoy films or if you
enjoy a show like Ozar, sure.

18
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,400
Stranger things long for narrative.

19
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:18,060
It takes a lot of money to make
those things are special effects.

20
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:20,430
There's camera people and
makeup people in here.

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,460
There's a lot of lock on our writers and
directors and producers and actors and

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,180
he'd say giant fucking tense filled
with people. People aren't watching it.

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,600
You know what they're watching?
People are watching them.

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,320
They're watching friends. No,
no, no, no. Not 10 free. Dude.

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,360
There's a reason they
paid us terrible bro.

26
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:40,570
It doesn't matter if it's terrible as
Jamie two most viewed shows on Netflix

27
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,400
right now. Netflix doesn't own, okay.

28
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,410
Netflix isn't even trying to make money
anymore. They're getting bought out.

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,850
It's Facebook. Uh, Amazon. Do they want
it? That's the goal of the strategy. Now,

30
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,530
the 10 billion in debt,
there's no way they can make money.

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,700
There's 10 billion billion Billy and,

32
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,880
but they make hundreds of
millions dollars a month.

33
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:01,160
Like how many people do they have
on board? How many subscribers?

34
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:04,780
So they have that are
paying $9 as far as I know,

35
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:08,020
they don't share that information. They're
killing it in terms of subscribers,

36
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,020
but they're 10 billion in debt. They
just talk on another 2 billion. Right.

37
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,110
When I say Netflix has done, I'm speaking
when anytime I make declarations,

38
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,610
I'm speaking in the future. Right. I'm
like, we prepare now for the future. Well,

39
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,990
how will they hear it goes?

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,290
Netflix will keep friends through
next year and $100 million payment,

41
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,140
$100 million, right? For one year
of friends. And then the office too.

42
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,730
That is though, that's like
nostalgia style jet, right.

43
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,700
So all viewing right now is nostalgia
even? Well, not all viewing, no.

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,500
If you look at TV, right? What did great
this, this, this past years in TV, right?

45
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,360
The OJ trial and FX. What
does that, I remember I was,
when the Oj thing came out,

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,460
did that do that, killed it, won all the
awards, everything. Uh, the Versace story,

47
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,060
which is another thing like what? That
out of the loop. I'm just 39 million,

48
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,850
339 million subscribers paying
$10 a month. Is that what it is?

49
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,350
How much does the cross like that?
Maybe even more.

50
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,170
Maybe 11 how much does it cost? Uh, at,
they just bumped it up to 12 I think.

51
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:06,610
12 bucks a month. Sure. That ladies and
gentlemen is a fuck load of income. Sure.

52
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,630
So they got a lot coming in,

53
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,550
but they're spending a lot
too because they're trying to,

54
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,350
they're trying to overtake all the others
and then they got Jeff Bezos, you know,

55
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,700
captain moneybags up there,
a scrooge McDuck. Right.

56
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,980
He's trying to do the same
thing. Facebook should, which,

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,620
where I saw you right on sneaky
Pete. Yeah. I was like, yeah, true.

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,530
But that's the basis can lose money on
this shit because he's making tons of

59
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:27,460
money on paper towels.

60
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,090
I wonder how much he is losing because
he's got a lot of fucking series at,

61
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,920
ain't nobody watching them
that put it out there,

62
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,070
but he's doing something that's even more
weird because there's no one watching

63
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,460
those shows.
Yeah.

64
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,490
There's a ton of fucking shows on
Amazon that fucking no one's watching.

65
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:48,580
Yeah, I would like to see their numbers
because I bet they have some shows.

66
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,360
They might, they might have
spent $1 million to make
and have like four viewers.

67
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,170
It's fucking, no one watched these
shows. They were just going after awards.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,330
They're thing was,
we're going to make the artsy shit,

69
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,270
oh it's going to give us a grammy or
something like that and then we'll like

70
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,000
qualify our platform.
It's a smart approach.

71
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,580
Like youtube approach was the
exact opposite, right. We're like,

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,970
we're just going to create this stuff
that we think people want to watch. Well,

73
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,630
Youtube doesn't create much. They did a
little and they took down the paywall.

74
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,890
Like my thing I, my guests with
youtube is there waiting for Netflix.

75
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,550
You know that scene in the movie where
like that's somebody's caught in like an

76
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,960
enclosed space and water starts coming
in and the water gets right up to like

77
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,700
his lips. You know, he's like,

78
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,790
he's trying to breathe a little bit more
and I think youtube just is going to be

79
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,270
the one to pour the last drop of water.
I think it's such a different thing.

80
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,820
I think you're talking about two totally
different things because Netflix has

81
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:41,740
never aimed to be a user created content
streaming site. Right? Right. They're not,

82
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,530
but at the end of the day
it's just distraction I think.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,330
I think that's what we've got to start
looking at content as, right. It's, it's,

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,360
it's just raw distraction and Netflix
occupies a space for distraction did

85
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:57,850
smaller than youtube, so I can watch
a two hour thing on youtube at home,

86
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:58,684
on my TV.

87
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,980
I can watch a two minute thing on the
bus as I'm going to work on youtube,

88
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,220
you know, I can watch
a 15 minute, you know,

89
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,300
peace like Vlog or something like that.
I can watch all the whole spectrum.

90
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,510
Netflix, I'm really just watching
at home or like a foam on a trip,

91
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,350
you know what I mean? It's really, I'm not
watching a two minute thing on Netflix,

92
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,890
you know what I mean? It's, it is
the shit for now. Don't get me wrong.

93
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,360
It absolutely the shit for
now. Right, but if I was being,

94
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,210
if I'm putting my money on it,

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,240
I would say if I'm Facebook I buy it and
then imagine having your Facebook feed.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,470
You just watched a show and then you
get to share it immediately on your

97
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:38,921
Facebook.

98
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,700
If I was Facebook I'd be super careful
about buying anything because I think the

99
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:46,270
government's been thinking about breaking
them up for a while and Elizabeth

100
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,820
Warren is already talking about that.
That's one of the parts of their,

101
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,230
her platform and running for
president is breaking up apple,

102
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,060
breaking up Facebook,
breaking up.

103
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,760
Twitter just wants to break up all
these things. She are monopolies.

104
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,550
What's your feeling on that?
Get the fuck Outta here with that first.

105
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,890
She is goofy. He's Goofy
as fuck. What's up?

106
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,080
Disney takeover of 21st century
Fox takes place I think next week.

107
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,040
The 20th to Bega. They are going to
put out their own stream. Everything.

108
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,381
They've just,

109
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:16,400
they bought like everything except for
Fox News and Fox sports took over all of

110
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,230
their production movie facilities,

111
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,530
like 5,000 people might be
losing their job because

112
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,320
it's coming off a Netflix.

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,050
Marvel shows all that shit is
going to come over to them.

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,790
So now they're going to
have a nice [inaudible].

115
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,630
That's why they've been canceling
all these marvel shows on the flower.

116
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,420
I keep investing in something,
right. You're going to take off,

117
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:38,930
like I'm going to build up a brand
and then remove it, right. You own it.

118
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,370
They've got so they got all the
kids movies. You're a bear at that,

119
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,290
you know what I mean? Dude, I go to
Disneyland twice a year at least.

120
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,480
Which you're gonna not have
the streaming Disney program,

121
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:52,481
will they all apples also starting their
streaming service soon tomorrow or some

122
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:56,300
show and knows when, but there's
tons of rumors are coming out today.

123
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,020
You know what it's like, you know the
perestroika, like what happened in Russia,

124
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,440
like where the overnight, you know, it
fell and they sold off the state assets,

125
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,440
like a few people and everybody
came. Billionaires. Right.

126
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,810
That's what's happening right now in
entertainment. Dude, don't realize it,

127
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,270
but like,
it's fucking done.

128
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,450
Like the days of the days of like
fame being about distance are done.

129
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,150
Distance, distance. Like I'm Johnny Depp.

130
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:24,260
I'm going to go to way to my little home
somewhere in the Alps and you will see

131
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:28,040
me twice a year. You're not, I'm weird
on Marlon Brando. I'm, I'm out here.

132
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,050
I'm weird. I'm different. You know, it's
like now it's proximity as reasonable.

133
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:36,080
No value in being weird anymore. Well,
Marlon Brando, Tyler Perry has an island.
