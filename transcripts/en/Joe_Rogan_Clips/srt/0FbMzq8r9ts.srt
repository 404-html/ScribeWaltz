1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,240
Boom, and we're live. My man.
What's up baby? First of all,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,700
how the fuck do you punched so hard?

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,130
I've seen hard punches, man. I've been
watching boxing since I was a little kid.

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:18,870
You've got some freakish power, man.
Weird. You've got weird power. Oh,

5
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,300
most definitely. Oh, we always
said I'm a freak of nature.

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,140
I definitely got some
type of freakish powwow.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,330
I always tell the story that my
grandmother said I was anointed by God.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,410
She was always like, if I got suspended
for school and stuff, she was always like,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,910
God is trying to use you. You're
the one you're chosen. You know?

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,350
She was very big and you know,
she was big in the spirit,

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,710
spirituality and Christianity,
you know,

12
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:47,850
so she's always be a teacher. You
know? She wasn't really a discipline,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,640
disciplinary type of woman.
She was a teacher.

14
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,760
She wanted to teach or tell you certain
things. She used to always say, oh,

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,390
I was annoying. She won't
even let my parents with me.
Well, not in front of her.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,040
That's how serious you were. She like,
she like, don't you been not with him.

17
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,690
He's going to be the
one that bring you up.

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,380
He didn't want to be the one to bring
you guys up. Don't whoop him. You know,

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,910
somebody tells you something like that at
a young age, you might believe it. Well,

20
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:15,240
I didn't even realize that really, you
know, just being so young, you know,

21
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,010
just being, you know, we, we
would, we, we did as children do,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,053
you know,

23
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,870
I didn't really think too much about it
because I didn't understand what she was

24
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,890
saying.
You know,

25
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,490
I ain't start understanding until you
start putting away child his ways and you

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,600
become a grown man.

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:35,310
You start a out in life and experience
in life on your own and started seeing

28
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:40,140
certain things. And then even, even when
I got out of my own, you know, I really,

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,131
it's a lot of things,

30
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:45,210
I didn't start understanding it until I
was 30 you know what I'm saying? Just to,

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,450
you know, cause certain things, different
things, what happened in my life,

32
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,560
you know, and that you, you know,
sometimes you just get you to you,

33
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,890
you deal with it and you handle
it the best way you can handle.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,710
But there's certain things that
starts to happen. He was like,

35
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:03,120
my grandma said something about this
or, you know, just, you know, and um,

36
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,380
that's how my life been.

37
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:09,410
But it's amazing how I can come
in at two oh nine and finally,

38
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,410
God is that coming in the two system
and able to drop him like I did. Like,

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,600
it's crazy, but we are, I've always been
stronger than mine than what I've looked.

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,840
It's interesting that the cruiserweight
division doesn't get any love. I mean,

41
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,660
the last time I got lovers with
Evander Holyfield was fine. Yeah.

42
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,330
That was really the last time people
cared about the cruiserweight division.

43
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,130
Now it's a forgotten division.
Kinda almost. Yeah. Yeah,
that's true. You know, um,

44
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,620
you know, my brother is just
starting in the, in the,

45
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,940
in the cruiserweight division. Hopefully
he can bring some excitement, you know,

46
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,890
to it because you, you're
so right. You know,

47
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:43,010
it's almost like they
don't even talk about it.

48
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,720
It doesn't make any sense because the
light heavyweight division gets a lot of

49
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,110
love, love watching light. Heavyweight
sense always gets lots of attention,

50
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,390
but the cruiserweight division is
always like, people look at it like,

51
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:55,890
why are you here? Yeah. Find some
weight. Go Up. Yup. Yup. It's true.

52
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,330
It's true because the heavyweights
always overshadow those guys.
