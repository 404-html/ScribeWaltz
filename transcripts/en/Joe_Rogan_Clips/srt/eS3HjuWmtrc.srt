1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,260
Okay.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,640
Oh God. That's another thing.
Not to talk about calling.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,530
Oh, my books were banned
so many places and uh,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,250
and sometimes I think that maybe
that's a good thing because they don't,

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,400
aren't reaching the psychos. My books
are abandoned prison systems. Why?

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,190
Because they are enormously popular.
These prison librarians tell me,

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,310
but the books are considered
way too stimulating. So wow.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,040
People in prison cannot read
my books. Oh, Holy Shit.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,390
All prisons,
I don't know if it's all,

10
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:41,310
but it's Texas and a number of
other really big states. So I dunno,

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,030
that's kind of a badge of honor.
Yeah.

12
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:49,720
But it doesn't equate to the like the uh,
the immortality of being banned.

13
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:54,610
Like a how or a tropic of
cancer or Salman Rushdie. Yeah,

14
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:58,810
exactly. Yeah. Oh God.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,940
That fucking struggle.
Men,

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:05,290
this struggle of wanting
to express yourself as,

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,700
as freely as possible,
but being limited even by your own peers.

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,900
That is, um, that's unexpected to
someone as in the outside of literature.

19
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,040
Someone who just reads it
because it's not in the comedy world,

20
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,690
what is in the comedy world, but
not amongst good comedians. Well,

21
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,980
another aspect of that is that so often
people aren't censoring it because it

22
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,940
offends them. They're censoring it because
they're afraid it will offend someone.

23
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,560
They know they're doing it.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,210
They're kind of white knighting on behalf
of someone else. David Sedaris, uh,

25
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,080
told me this story about,
uh, telling a joke, uh,

26
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,510
or something very funny about a girl in
a wheelchair and how he looked out in

27
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,460
the audience and no one was laughing.

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,210
They were all looking at
a girl in a wheelchair.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,430
And the moment she started to laugh,
the entire audience started to laugh.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,600
Oh yeah. And so, so often
people in the workshop,

31
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,870
they might not personally
feel offended by the word,

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,120
but they're thinking how that word
might hurt people. They know. But yeah,

33
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,450
that's a fact. Yeah, that's a, that's
a giant issue in comedy. If you,

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,630
if someone's telling you a
joke of someone's on stage
talking about someone is

35
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,580
fat and there's a fat person in the front
row, that joke will bomb. Yeah. It just,

36
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,620
yeah, but that's because people are
good people overall. You know, they,

37
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,780
they recognize that they
don't want to cause pain.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,770
Another really odd comic David [inaudible]
story is that he always told me,

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,320
uh, when you're on the road,
don't read from your current book.

40
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:44,250
Always read from the next book pieces
it's way of road testing the stories and

41
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:47,520
finding out which ones work and
should go into the next book.

42
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,490
And in doing so, he was telling the story
about being in this, uh, this forensic,

43
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,350
uh,
uh,

44
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,420
laboratory isn't an as an autopsy was
taking place and this autopsy table was

45
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:05,251
adjacent to dis this huge indoor window
that separated the autopsy suite from

46
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:10,000
this lunch room and in the lunch
room where the rest of the, uh,

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,280
the forensic staff and they're
all eating their lunches.

48
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,290
They all had tuna sandwiches and, and
cans of coke and barbecue potato chips.

49
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,770
And they were watching through the
window as this absolutely perfect.

50
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,370
12 year old boy was being autopsied
and just hours before at this kid,

51
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:34,600
like two hours before this kid had been
riding his bicycle, he'd fallen over,

52
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,720
he'd hit his head on the curb and now
two hours later he was dead and dead

53
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:44,980
without almost a scratch on him.
Just this perfect naked,

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,050
dead 12 year old boy on the autopsy table.
And as he,

55
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,100
the, the technicians eating their
lunch, watching it through a window,

56
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,440
they watch as the, uh, as the, uh,

57
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,230
pathologist in sizes around the top
of the kid's face at the top of the

58
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:08,140
forehead, the hairline, and
then peels the face down,

59
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,290
like peeling an orange peels the entire
face off of the skull of this little boy

60
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,820
and leaves the face around the neck
like a mask, like a rubber mask.

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,300
And this exposes this liver colored
dark red musculature of the child's

62
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,230
underlying face.

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,270
And this one guy watching it
with a mouthful of tuna sandwich,

64
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,930
he points this out and he
says, see that? That there,

65
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,450
that's the color of red that I want
to paint our rec room. Holy Shit.

66
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,520
And when's the Darice told that
story in front of 600 people?

67
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,570
It was dead silent.
And you could hear people weeping.

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,220
People were crying and they were hating
David Sedaris in that moment and so on.

69
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,430
I had to laugh.
I laughed really loud like a donkey.

70
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,340
And it was amazing how that hatred in
that auditorium swung from hating David

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,400
who they did not want to hate to hating
this jackass over here who was actually

72
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:18,711
laughing and so I threw myself on the
sword for David and that story never went

73
00:05:19,261 --> 00:05:23,070
in any book.
Wow.

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
Did the story not go in any book just
because of the reaction by the audience or

75
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,690
just an uncomfortable moment?
He just decided he would
speak to him about it. No,

76
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:34,590
I didn't. I'm not afterwards. It was
just such an awkward, painful thing.

77
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,550
I would never come to throw it back
in his face. Right. To my knowledge,

78
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,870
that was the only time the story was told
to have those like scattered about are

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,713
there,
there's,

80
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,520
are there scenes what you wrote and you
just sat and looked at him and went, no,

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,250
I just got to put that one somewhere else.
Oh,

82
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:55,251
there are set that aside jokes that I
told where I got hist by 800 people and

83
00:05:55,891 --> 00:06:00,290
you know as you can live to those
model and then you realize you can live

84
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,124
through a lot.

85
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,100
If you can be hated by 1100 people at
a Barnes and noble on Union Square.

86
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,970
Oh yeah. You can be hated
by your mother. It's okay.

87
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,470
I know when those people come to see you,

88
00:06:13,471 --> 00:06:16,140
how many of those people
are fans of literature and
how many of those people are

89
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,230
specifically fans of your work? Like
there's, there would be a difference.

90
00:06:19,231 --> 00:06:24,231
Like the people were fans of your work
would at least expect some uncomfortable

91
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,284
moments.

92
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,600
And for the most part they tend to be,
uh, more or less just fans of my work.

93
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,190
And still it's still his.
Oh yeah.

94
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,570
But again,

95
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,460
they're hissing on behalf of someone
than I hissing for themselves.

96
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,810
You know, I made this horrible, cheap
shot and they always know a cheap shot.

97
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,260
People always know a cheap shot. I, uh,

98
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,440
I was commenting about how
in breakfast at Tiffany's,

99
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:56,441
Truman Capote had made this observation
that Americans don't like true beauty,

100
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,720
true classical natural beauty.

101
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,120
They want to see a very plain person
who has been so groomed. So exercise,

102
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:10,121
so made up so style stylized that
she can kind of pass as this,

103
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,020
this amazing,
strange beauty.

104
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,680
That's what Americans want because
natural classic beauty is not egalitarian.

105
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,060
You're either born with it or you're not.

106
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,290
They want to see a plain person
who has been transformed.

107
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,660
And to make my point at the end of the
story, I made a cheap shot. I said,

108
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,390
and that's why we have
Sarah Jessica Parker

109
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,820
and I said this in New York
and in New York,

110
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:48,821
Sarah Jessica Parker is worshipped like
a god and that whole crowd hissed and

111
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,440
booed and did everything
but throw excrement at me.

112
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,960
Wow. But then later in line, half
of them came up and whispered.

113
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,490
That was really funny.

114
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,050
Yeah, that's, well that's one of
the things about dark comedy clubs.

115
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,930
You want them dark? No, you don't
want everyone illuminated like the,

116
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,820
when the,
the crowd is like the one that,

117
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,950
this is one of the real issues with
doing a comedy special is that uh,

118
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,680
especially the old way
they used to do them,

119
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,340
they still like to light up the audience,

120
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,470
which completely changes the dynamic of
the room changes what you'll laugh and

121
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,450
what you won't laugh at.
You know,

122
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:32,460
in a scene like this could Sarah Jessica
Parker choke. It's perfect example.

123
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:36,190
If you don't want to be caught dead
being the one person that throws her head

124
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,420
back.
And how's it that,

125
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,530
you know, cheap shots or just to stay
away from them. But that's another,

126
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,900
I'll ask you, ask you
a question. You know,

127
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:49,901
with so many colleges becoming these
kinds of strident safe places to demand

128
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:54,830
their own aesthetic, what is
it like doing comedy? Well,

129
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,130
it hasn't

130
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,900
changed that much.

131
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,060
People getting a little got a little
bit more sensitive because they're aware

132
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,380
that other people are more sensitive
without the audiences that come to

133
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:12,210
nightclubs, which is primarily where
I perform with, I do a theater.

134
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,450
Those people were there to see me.
So that's there.

135
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,160
They're usually pretty loose, pretty
fun, but if you're in a nightclub,

136
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,990
they're there to see,
especially the comedy store.

137
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:23,340
I'm one of the good things
about the comedy store's.

138
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,920
There's literally two
dozen people in the lineup.

139
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,170
They're not necessarily just here to cu
did there to see Anthony Chesil neck and

140
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,960
Chris Delea and all these other
comedians that are also there as well,

141
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,400
so you get a a really a much
broader comedy audience,

142
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,480
but their nightclub audiences,
they have a few drinks in them.

143
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,420
Maybe this smoked a little
pot before they got there.

144
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,470
Those people are there to have a good
time. Colleges are a nightmare now. Hmm.

145
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,520
It's a nightmare because
it's recreational outrage.

146
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,850
It's it's kids who have been under the
control of their parents for most of

147
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:02,220
their life and haven't had their own
sovereignty and identity and now they're

148
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:07,221
free and they are very
quick to be outraged.

149
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,490
They want a porn out there.
Moral superiority.

150
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:15,090
There wasn't virtue signal
and every opportunity they
want to shut down anything

151
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,640
to think is air quotes problematic.

152
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,090
They don't want things to go on a bad
when they think for some reason that

153
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,690
comedy should be uplifting
and it should only punch up.

154
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,620
Like I had this conversation once with
a professor who wrote a book on a comedy

155
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,270
and he said all great comedy punches
up. And I said, that's bullshit. I said,

156
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:36,420
one of the greatest bits of all time
as Sam Kennison spit about starving

157
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:41,100
children in Africa about watching those
commercials were starving kids in Africa

158
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,260
and you know,
couldn't you please help?

159
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,830
And he goes in kinnisons like he
just want to grab the guy, hey,

160
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,940
why don't you help them? You're right
fucking there or send someone like me.

161
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,700
He goes, sends, send something like me.
It's going to take these people go, hey,

162
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,260
we just drove here 5,000 miles with
your food and it occurred to us do you

163
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,610
wouldn't be world hunger,
have you?

164
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:03,360
People would live with a fucking vote
as he goes. Can I hear you say that?

165
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,100
That Sam, we got sand in America too.
We just don't live in it, asshole.

166
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,480
And he's,

167
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,480
he goes and one of the greatest bits
of all time is literally about starving

168
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,280
babies in Africa.
It's one of the greatest

169
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,190
bits of all time and he
didn't have anything to say.

170
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,870
You didn't know where to go
with it. I'm like, don't,

171
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,370
don't say comedy is only about
punching up. That's crazy talk.

172
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,010
That's what you're doing
is you're, you're, there's,

173
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,030
there's this moral thing that they're
trying to achieve that it literally is

174
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:38,920
completely independent of humor.

175
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,120
It's not what's funny. It's
like there, they want to,

176
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,960
they want it to be a multipurpose tool.

177
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,680
They want it to be funny as well as
morally uplifting and great for people who

178
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,780
discriminated against and amazing for
folks who are marginalized and uplifting

179
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:01,810
for those who are disenfranchised.
Well that's not what comedy is.

180
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,310
Comedy is funny.

181
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,830
Those things are wonderful in and if you
want to do a spoken word show or poetry

182
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,270
or writing or you know,
a one person play those,

183
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,620
those are great, but that's
not funny. Comedy is funny,

184
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,960
so it's either funny or it's not funny
and some things are funny that are fucked

185
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,460
up.
You know?

186
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:29,461
Kennison had a bit about
homosexual necrophilia acts
or paying money to spend a

187
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,410
few hours undisturbed with the
freshest male corpses. And He,

188
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:36,250
so he would lie down on his stomach
and he goes, you imagine these people,

189
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,570
they're on the slabs are like well,

190
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,300
went through life and had a good time
and everything and now I guess I'm going

191
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:45,790
to go and be with Jesus and Hey,
what the hell is this?

192
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,160
And he's rocking back and forth.

193
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,610
It feels like some guy's
got his dick in my ass.

194
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,120
He made live keeps fuck you in the ass
even after you're dead. It never ends.

195
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,410
It never ends.

196
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,790
Oh he would close on it cause it was the,
he couldn't follow it.

197
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,630
Who was such a powerful bit. It was about
a dead guy getting fucked in the ass.

198
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:08,870
There is no further down that you could
punch other than starving babies in

199
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:09,834
Africa.

200
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,220
You know, and I'm not sure
about it, this is punching down,

201
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:18,221
but do you remember the s the routine
that kind of put Whoopi Goldberg on the

202
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,570
map a million years ago about being a
black surfer chick? No. Oh, you know,

203
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:24,950
she did it on television.

204
00:13:24,951 --> 00:13:28,160
I must've seen it on cable
when I was like 19 years old,

205
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,410
but she talks in valley speak.
Nobody's seen this will be person before.

206
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,810
She's brand new.
Nobody's ever seen her on television.

207
00:13:35,811 --> 00:13:39,800
She's got this funny name and she's doing
this valve speak about being the only

208
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,870
black surfer chick on the beach.

209
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:45,200
And she loves surfing and she
loves this one white surfer guy.

210
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:49,220
And she finally hooks up with them and
then she realized that she's pregnant and

211
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,200
it's all very funny.
The whole front end,

212
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:56,201
you're just roaring with laughter and
then she's pregnant and she doesn't know

213
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:57,134
what to do.

214
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,470
So she gets a rusty wire coat hanger and
she goes into a public bathroom on the

215
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:08,531
beach and she gives herself a coat hanger
abortion and it spills out there on

216
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:10,520
the concrete floor

217
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,600
and everything's okay.

218
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:18,100
And now I'm back on the beach
and I'm just doing fine.

219
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,750
And why don't you come on down
and see me here on the beach?

220
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:24,450
It's great down here.
It's great. Holy Shit.

221
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,270
It's a fantastic piece.

222
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,810
And she did it on television and she
did it on TV and it started so light,

223
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,610
like an IRA, 11 novel, and then I
went to such a dark, horrible place,

224
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,270
and then it came up with
just this kind of token.

225
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,250
Everything is okay ending every,
I'm going to be all right.

226
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,750
Don't worry.
This is just something that happened.

227
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,080
Yeah, dude, dude

228
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,380
just leaves you shaken.

229
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,860
And that's the kind of comedy I love.

230
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,090
It goes to the that dark or
that sentimental place and
it breaks your heart and

231
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,100
then it kind of comes
out of it a little bit.

232
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,770
But I were 11 did that so well.
Nora Ephron in her books,

233
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,280
she was so good at doing that.
Heartburn,

234
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,290
heartburn is fantastically funny,
but by the end you're just weeping.

235
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,400
The book is so sad.
