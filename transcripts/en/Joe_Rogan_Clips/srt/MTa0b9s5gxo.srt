1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
It's calling someone outright today.
It's so strange how, you know,

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:04,261
I don't know if you know,

3
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:09,261
but all in the world to stand up
comedy used to be progressive liberal,

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,040
like, like weird coffee shop
type rooms. It was all comedy.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,370
They don't even use that term
anymore, right? Because it's so toxic.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,920
And I try to avoid saying, I'll try. When
you say alternative media all the time,

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,650
and this has happened over the course of
just a couple of years. I mean, the, the,

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,200
the thing is shifted and it's moving
and evolving and morphing so quickly.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,240
You want to know what's
really crazy. For years, I,

10
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:34,040
my Wikipedia page at claimed
that I invented a Zeppelin,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,840
Zeppelin like a blimp. Yes.
Yeah. It's funny, right? Well,

12
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:44,070
Wikipedia said I was Brian
Callan's brother for a decade
here. Here's the thing.

13
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,960
When I went to Sweden, I specifically
stated, uh, let me, let me, let me,

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,350
let me back up. Paul Joseph Watson
of infowars put out a call saying,

15
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:55,740
I challenge any journalists to spend
a weekend in Malmo and I'll cover your

16
00:00:55,741 --> 00:01:00,120
costs. Everybody's bombarding
him saying, Oh, pay me, pay me.

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,060
And he's kind of just ignoring it.
People are threatening to sue him.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,500
You better pay.
You promised.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,980
I had already set up a go fund
me for the project before,

20
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,060
I believe it was before he announced.

21
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,190
I made a video about it saying
Donald Trump said x, Y, and Z.

22
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,830
We're going to go to the story.
When I saw he made this call,

23
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:17,400
I think it was actually Emily who
noticed it, I said, hey, I'll do it.

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,250
And he was like to be on,
I think it had something like,

25
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:22,470
I was just taking the Piss, but
yeah, sure, I'll send you a donation.

26
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:24,090
And I laughed and I was like,
hey man, I'll take, you know,

27
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,850
if he wants to throw money at
my go fund me. Here's what,

28
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,900
what ends up happening is
people then claim I was uh,

29
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,010
I went to there because Paul Joseph Watson
Challenge challenged me. Not True. Um,

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,390
he donated about 9% of our total fund
that we raised and I was already planning

31
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:43,180
on going there. Wikipedia. Uh,
there was a challenge on the,

32
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:46,140
on my Wikipedia page where they,
someone said,

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,560
you wrote Tim Pool went there because
it Paul just Watson challenged him to,

34
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:51,600
that's not true.
What's your proof?

35
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,860
This youtube video from Tim Pool where
he says, we've already arranged this.

36
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,650
We're not going here because of
politics of Watson. That response,

37
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,670
that's not a reliable source.
Someone came back with a reliable source.

38
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:06,330
You know it, it was a Huffington post
article that quoted my youtube video.

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,950
How's that? I don't understand. Why
couldn't you just take my word for it?

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,410
Why did you have to get
Huffington post to just quote me?

41
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,150
That was apparently so that's enough.
I guess.

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,870
So the reason I bring this up is
because what happens then if you're a

43
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:29,250
conservative and a bunch of friends who
work for various news organizations all

44
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:32,940
at the same time write 10 articles
saying Joe Rogan is all right now on

45
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,760
Wikipedia at 10 articles pop up
immediately saying this is a fact.

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,200
10 different organizations have written
it and there it is in your, in your page.

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,440
And the crazy thing is the UK
does this all the time, you know,

48
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:46,830
they call various personalities.
All right? They call
Sargon, they call Dank Ula.

49
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,920
Yeah. Just go to Wikipedia and look up
the phrase, it means white nationalists,

50
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,740
neo confederate. It's like
literally about a white ethno state.

51
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,530
These people have denounced this and
that. And you know, it's like with,

52
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:55,981
with Sargon,

53
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:00,910
avocado was a really
fascinating phenomenon on
patrion where all of a sudden

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,920
these left wing outlets, sad Sargon was
banned for, uh, going after the alt right.

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,060
And I'm like, well, hold on.
You've written in the past
that he was all right. Well,

56
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:14,170
you, when you say you like the media is
not these, these various organizations,

57
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,590
same organizations, but different authors.
Well, I don't want to, I don't want to.

58
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,270
Okay. But not the same journalists.
Um, I, I will lean towards, I believe.

59
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,230
Yes. Because it's, it's,
it's so, so whenever it's
convenient, they just throw it,

60
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,910
throw that there are some people
who write. The problem is if I May,

61
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,620
if I named these people,
they're going to,

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,470
they're going to point their pens in my
direction and then all of these things

63
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:37,870
are going to swing at me. And the
other thing too is I don't want to,

64
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,700
I don't want to brigade them.
It's not important anyway.

65
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,540
What's really important is the actual
reality of how it was done. There are,

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,320
I really want to name this organization,
it's, it's one of the prominent,

67
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,650
well known, but they repeatedly write
stories that are just so over the top.

68
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,970
I roll my eyes and I'm like.
