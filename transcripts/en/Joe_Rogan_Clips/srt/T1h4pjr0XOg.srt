1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,930
Cause we're going to get through
this next and I respect you.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,430
I what's you guys to yell at each
other for three minutes while I go pee?

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,210
I gotta pee too. Okay. As you
don't talk to yourself, just hold,

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,840
we'll do it and shit. Well
Shit, I go first. Okay. Anyways,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,740
no one else saying you're bad
questioning. I get it. No, you do get it.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,180
You know why? Because you know, horses
joke for you. Of course. Of course.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,530
Of course. Of course. Alex, you, uh,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
you are someone that I could talk to
about the flat earth conspiracy and you

9
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:36,510
believe in so many crazy things about
the government. You don't, you don't, uh,

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,710
you don't believe in flat earth,

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,360
but you can kind of understand
where I'm coming from, right? Yeah.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,370
GPS real.

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,590
I know airline pilots that
fly from California to uh,

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,420
you know,

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,060
places like Australia and then you've
got another wing over to Hong Kong and

16
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,970
then they go to mosque and you can fly
anywhere in the world if it was flat.

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,803
If it's flat,
it has,

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,230
you could go from east to west
just like you could on a ball.

19
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:04,720
You just don't understand what,
uh, uh, like, uh, like a pizza is,

20
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:05,740
you could just go anywhere.
Like if,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,690
if you're on a flatter is what
I'm doing a flat travel anywhere.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,890
Gimme two cities, he pointed to
cities, we go back to so much.

23
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,920
I get what you cost you nothing to do
with the patch. I'm not that. No, no, no.

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,170
You have the money.
I'm not trying to convince you.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm not trying to convince you Alex. My
point is my point. It takes, you got to,

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,980
you've got to find it on your fucking own.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,440
There's no way you're
going to be convinced. No,

28
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,090
no one has ever been convinced to.

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,750
They have to really find it within
themselves and, and do some deep,

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,120
deep what I'm telling you, this soul
searching, if I finance a research ship,

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,630
large ship and make a documentary,
I can't go away for three months.

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,850
I will pay for you three
months. I'm not bs, you know,

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,800
cause to me having money's
not a big deal. He said, well,

34
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,880
you can do cool things with it.
One of them. What's one of the,

35
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:55,410
can you raise that I to go to the
south? Well, we're gonna need,

36
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,340
we're gonna need a,
you guys go into the food or in orbit.

37
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,390
You go on a cruise ship. This is what I'm
going to do. What I'm going to do, okay?

38
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:07,740
You raised the money for a trip,
okay?

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,470
You do this the deal.
Go Pee.

40
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:15,430
Go Pee, man. You're going to go see

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,330
the plan. What are the high
school? He's the ambassador.

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,610
He's the ambassador.

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,970
Man will pick ice fields.
That guy's going to be,

44
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,640
and this is what this one
we're going to do, Alex. Alex,

45

give me 27 entire crew

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,830

Totally, but it's not going to be me.

47
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,540
I'm going to, I'm going to
designate somebody, not just scared.

48
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,540
We're going to do this. We're going
to do this by Joe Rogan. No, no.

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,370
We're going to do this job
and to the and be awesome.

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,830
You're going to find the
edge of the world caps caps.

51
00:02:55,831 --> 00:03:00,730
They're knocking things off the drop off
with my iPhone. Yes. Yes. Go pee man.

52
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:04,030
EOP Don't you have to go? We're
going to send someone else. Alex.

53
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,900
You know what?
We're gonna do this.

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,570
They're going to go on it to be
the one that goes here in a minute.

55
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,110
I came here and I pleased they're
keeping babies alive at Taylor, Oregon.

56
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,250
How did you prove that
Jamie pulled some shit.

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,030
They admitted them formalizing
it. No, the fuck the governor.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,910
You really think.

59
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,920
Do you really think there's people
out there campaigning for late term

60
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,750
abortions? You think that Shit's
real. [inaudible] six rounded Monday.

61
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,330
Who would campaign for that date?
Look

62
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,100
man,
they're fucking Kelly already.

63
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,110
Marquette's so you're telling me it
isn't real when I had a fucking Goddamn

64
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,900
fucking shattered.
That's a conspiracy theory.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,470
You're fucking top of your about to get it
already born babies.

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,930
Stop fucking lying. God fucking damn. I'm
getting pissed now. Don't get pissed. No,

67
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,450
I you saw the dude. It's fucking

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,170
kill babies.
Let me,

69
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,600
I'm your fucking bars claim
with the course. I believe that

70
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,610
horse. I believe. Eddie,

71
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,240
let me explain to you when,
let me explain to you.

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,650
We went into a long conversation. I
heard it. I heard it. Okay. You heard it.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,080
I heard the whole podcast off
years chasing, playing with it.

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,210
Come on and in my psychosis.

75
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,100
Allity is so crazy that I always thought
I was so tough because I have to pay

76
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,520
anymore. It'll piss a little
bit out. Point is the point is,

77
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:53,380
is that the point is, is that dude,
I'm not the reality. So crazy.

78
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,140
Why are we debating whether the
earth is flat? Dude, they're keeping,

79
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,380
they have human animal hybrids.
There's, there's a fricking,

80
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:03,880
I have been there when people that work
for the Pentagon say that we go the

81
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,190
laboratory and we meet
with the ambassador,

82
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,380
we have to take higher and
higher doses to meet with them.

83
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:12,100
They're giving us technology
and the technology work.
I've been, this is going on,

84
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,630
dude. You want to know
this? Listen, relax.

85
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,010
Think about how this isn't real man.
The aliens.

86
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,290
Alex think about what I said I said to
do you think there's actually people out

87
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:31,291
there did believe that our
campaigning telescopes this into what?

88
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,780
I sucks.
He's fun to hear what I said.

89
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,650
Do you think there's actually people
out there that are campaigning for late

90
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,180
term abortions?
Of course there are,

91
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,070
but I'm making it seem like I don't
believe they are. Get it down here.

92
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm being the ultimate skeptic.

93
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,890
Ultimate skeptic words does
that all the time. He says,

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,290
[inaudible] right there. I'm threatened.
I'm about Mr. Goody two shoes. Buy them,

95
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,720
keeping babies alive and killing them
and then nobody cares. I fundamentally,

96
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,160
that's what I'm sitting and I'm being
honest here is I'm not like certified with

97
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,510
crazy,
but I deal with this all day long.

98
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:11,230
I get what joke tries to shy away
and people go crazy. [inaudible]

99
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,780
I never saw that clip of that guy saying
that they would resuscitate the babies.

100
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,240
Then they would make a decision.
You heard about that New York,

101
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,570
a bill that they're trying
to have some big shit.

102
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,060
It's like it's like a
city,

103
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,450
but we're still golf tees.

104
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,010
They're giving a bunch of God damn
fucking organ harvesting doctors control

105
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:31,880
outside of law.

106
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,940
You heard that piece of Shit fucking KKK
guy fucking governor say we're going to

107
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,890
keep alive after they're fucking bored.
He's like,

108
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:44,390
cause they want to fucking take their
organs. It's incredible. He's a KKK guy.

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,210
That's a quote above cold fudge.
It's so incredible.

110
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,810
Then I did a picture with a guy,
the KKK outfit in blackface.

111
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,490
They elected him because he's black males.

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,000
They had that shit and when he messed
up and said we keep them alive to get

113
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,370
their fucking organs.
They used that to deactivate him.

114
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,760
Why do you think fraternities have you
screw sheep and all this and you know

115
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,890
give guys blowjobs that's why
I never joined them because
they want to come back.

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,640
Go back, go back. Ah Fraternity.

117
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,530
I'm so happy with this. I
do this podcast. So happy.

118
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:19,880
I turned down this fucking amazing.
It's fucking amazing.

119
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,090
It was good.
We got to Paris who fucking world order.

120
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,340
Oh my God. Eddie. I got you.
Did you got so pissed off?

121
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm so glad I fucked it too,
cause we got some to do my life.

122
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:39,310
How many jre clips they're going to
make it that do. They're going to,

123
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,660
they're going to put you to music.

124
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,470
They said you pulled up MIT saying
they've got an animal, human pigs.

125
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:49,640
So yeah, we did. Let's just not forget. We
did listen. Go take a leak. I'm with you.

126
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,190
Listen man, he just kind of freaked
me out about several subjects. No, no,

127
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,120

He freaked me out about several subjects.
