1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
It's good that you think like this because
clearly you're a very confident guy

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,390
and you're obviously successful
and your mixed martial arts career.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,950
But to have just a little bit
of that insecurity is fuel.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,060
It's just like it keeps you sharp.
It keeps you aware. You know,

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:19,030
like to be confident is good. To
be delusional is terrible. Yeah.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,130
100% of terrible.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,000
Everybody knows that one guy that thinks
he can beat a guy that he's not ever

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,600
going to fucking be able to be.
You know?

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,500
I mean there's a lot of people
like give me that fight you,

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,930
hey wait, that's why
you don't see, you know,

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,230
you never see me say some outlandish shit.

12
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,880
Like oh I can't never be beat know or oh
I can go out there and you know our bar

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,170
Cain Velasquez or something like that.
I mean not meaning to pick on Rhonda,

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,350
but I know he was saying, yeah but
you know. But I think you know,

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,140
the Rhonda thing, it was, there was a
lot going on there man. Coaching wise,

16
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,610
there's a lot going on there.
What?

17
00:00:56,611 --> 00:01:01,611
She just came along at a time when there
was no one like her when she was a real

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,200
Olympic caliber athlete and her
judo was at such a high level.

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,270
No one could fuck with him throwing people
around until someone could fuck with

20
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,460
her until she ran into
someone like Holly Holm.

21
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:18,990
And then then we really saw the holes
in the preparation, the distractions,

22
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:22,780
the fact that she had, you
know, movie deals going on.

23
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,600
They wanted her to do road house and
she's scripts and this and agent meetings

24
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,760
and all the bullshit man.
It's like a fucking Hollywood.

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,130
It was like a Hollywood script.

26
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,390
Like this is what happens to you and
this is how rocky when rocky went soft,

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,720
I mean this is literally what happens
and then all of a sudden you've got this

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,500
bad ass Holly Holm sitting there ready
to fucking head kick you into another

29
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,280
dimension. And that's what happened.
And like you said, I think,

30
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:49,980
I think most of it is just trying to
stay aware and I get the delusional about

31
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:50,460
it cause it's,

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,510
it is very easy to kind of slip into
that and fall into that and you know,

33
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,570
sometimes she will hit you.
And that's what happened in my,

34
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:02,250
in my second fight that I lost,
uh, to, to Leonardo Santos and,

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,750
and, and each fight I can
always see myself losing,

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,460
you know,
and people ask me that and they were like,

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
you talk about all this
visualization that you do.

38
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,760
Like sometimes I visualize myself
getting hurt too and fights.

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,120
Do you do that to see how you
recover? How do you, what do you do?

40
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,920
So it's not a new experience.

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,820
I Went Barboza fucking spinning heel kicks
me in the head like his, it's not, uh,

42
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,480
it's not,
it's always the punch that don't hurt you.

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,220
We were texted texting before that fight
and we were setting up this podcast.

44
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,420
You. I just listen. I just got to
concentrate on making sure I do.

45
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,080
Don't kick me in the head and
then after the fight like, Damn,

46
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,190
you fucking kicked me in the head.

47
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,360
You are definitely, definitely
preparing yourself for the possibility.
