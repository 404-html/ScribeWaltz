1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,900
And, uh, is, say what you want about
Giuliani who now is bat shit crazy. Uh,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,820
what happened with him? I don't know.
I think there's some blew a fuse.

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,160
He's not respectable anymore.
It's like some kind of, well,

4
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:15,540
he aligned himself a Trump, so that
immediately gets you put into a category.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,690
But he's also a little,
I think he's got some dementia going on.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,620
Like he just doesn't seem
right, but it is. Hm.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,690
Losses comb over that he had a comb
over for, what is that like, uh,

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,440
what's his name with the comb over and he
realized, Oh my God, I'm fucking crazy.

9
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:35,970
Samson's hair. It's like that.
He, he lost the last wisps,

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,160
those last wisps of comb-over that
he'd had during nine 11 going on. Yeah.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,830
He was at one point, you know, after
nine 11, they call it nine, 10, 2001,

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,420
he was a piece of shit. No one
liked Giuliani. He ruined New York.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,220
He ruined it by commercializing it,
cleaning up all the porn theaters, uh, uh,

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,320
getting rid of the tunnel bunnies and the
squeegee guys. Like he went on a tear,

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,940
just gave the police department carte
blanche to start racking head and taking

16
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,190
care of business.
He cleaned up New York Times Square,

17
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,690
turned into a Disney type atmosphere
instead of that drug addled fucking mess

18
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,940
that it was.
And,

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,510
and people hated him for kind of ruining
that Gritty New York that we saw in

20
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,320
taxi driver and shit.
And then nine 11,

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,520
he was America's mayor. That's what
they called him, America's mayor.

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,050
He's going out of Yankee Games and to
ovations and people he's standing with the

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,190
comb over. He looked so crazy
person on the right. Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,660
She is totally shaved his
head. I said, listen bro,

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,780
there's a lot of power in just
shaving your head, motherfucker. Yeah.

26
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:46,470
You feel good. You feel like a guy who
has like hair on the side of his head.

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,560
Unless you do a lot of drugs like
hunter s Thompson, it's hard, right?

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,900
You can't pull that off, I think. Yeah.
Uh, who does it offer? Right hand side.

29
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,920
That's a, that's a comb
over in the beginning. They
are above that. Above that.

30
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,130
Above that to the right to the
right with a suit. Oh yeah.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,020
That's where it's first started. That's
the full clover. Oh my God, look at that.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,260
Oh, it's working the back. What did he do?

33
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:14,040
Did he try to get plugs or something
in the front? I don't think so.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,450
I don't know what that is.
It's just,

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,250
it was rocking that full strong
comb over that is, uh, he, uh,

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,500
he had a lot to do with the, the, the um,

37
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,690
getting rid of organized crime
in New York City, like the mafia,

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,830
the five families,

39
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:33,831
all that shit was still running pretty
rampant throughout the seventies and

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,500
eighties. Uh, as a kid, me and my
brother used to laugh our asses off.

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,100
We'd open the newspaper and there
was like Johnny the horse boldly.

42
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:46,680
Yachty was found dead and we be
laugh our asses off at the names,

43
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,640
just those, those mob
names. It's, it's hilarious.

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,460
And that scene in Goodfellas at the
beginning when they're just going through

45
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:53,911
and you know,

46
00:02:53,911 --> 00:02:58,650
the nose and killer and this guy and they
all have those fucking names that are

47
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:01,510
hilarious. And a, yeah.
Giuliani was a big part of that.

48
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,130
I'm surprised they didn't kill him.

49
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,640
Like he was absolutely responsible.

50
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,990
He kept going after them and kept putting
them away. Uh, with the, you know,

51
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,760
the new Rico statutes that they had
and a locked up a lot of mobsters,

52
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,110
man. So, well, you know, another problem
with the mom says they started writing,

53
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:22,270
I mean other, yeah, yeah, yeah. As soon as
you start ratting on each other all year,

54
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,540
mystique is gone.
Your whole legend has gone.

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,830
Just the whole thing is that you guys
have Omerta you keep your fucking mouth

56
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:32,040
shut. You do your time like a man, right.

57
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,020
You get out and you're a hero and
that this whole thing keeps going.

58
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:39,910
This thing of ours was, but those fucking
pussies didn't want to go to jail.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,350
Isn't that something like the old
school guys would be offered, you know,

60
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:48,010
you could walk. Yep. Or You could get
a really easy sentence, just talk,

61
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,790
Oh fuck your mother. And, and then, yeah,

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,930
they reached a point where it's like,
yeah, I, I'm not built for prison.

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,700
When they would put them in prison
though, it was like in Goodfellas. Right.

64
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:02,360
They would be able to cook and they
paid the guards off at a sweet set up.

65
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,740
The internet ruined all that
too. Yeah. Yeah. You wanna well,

66
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,510
it was probably all dead before
the Internet, but, but you know,

67
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:15,220
like Sammy the bull Gravano he was free.
He did his time,

68
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,400
did the minimal amount of time.
He killed at least 10 people.

69
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,080
They mean pa, he, he confessed to them,

70
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,350
you know, talked about the,
that he did and how he did them.

71
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,370
He wanted it got so bad. They
want to, God, he's so bad. I mean,

72
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,350
Sammy the bull Gravano was a fucking
straight up psychopath. Yeah.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,290
That's total serial killer.

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,370
And they let him walk and then he got
arrested eventually for selling ecstasy in

75
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:43,770
Phoenix. He moved to Phoenix after
that. Yeah. Yeah. And then he, uh,

76
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,170
was running shit down there.
And how did he just not get whacked out?

77
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,230
Like was the mob was gone. They all
were gone. There's no one cared.

78
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:56,140
Hated it at all. It all crumbled at
that something. Yeah, just like a,

79
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,370
yeah. Poof. Went away.
The thing that like, God,

80
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:02,960
he was the first one that was like
real flashy and public about it.

81
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,640
They didn't like that Vincent the Chin
always used to walk around like a crazy

82
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,430
person in the bathroom.
It was nuts. But he would,

83
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,100
he would give people directions
while he was doing that,

84
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:13,930
but he felt like everything
was being bugged.

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,010
So they would do is they bug
cars along his walking route.

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,350
They could record him. Oh, that is
hilarious. What he was doing. Jesus.

87
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,190
There's always a way. Yeah. There's
always a way to get you. Yeah.

88
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,790
The mystique was gone though.
Yeah.

89
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,250
It wasn't really like the Russians still
have the mystique Russian mobsters.

90
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,690
They are brutal. Tells Gary Ones like
they are the scary ones. There's,

91
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:41,890
there's everyone's now worst smile
because regardless of what it turned into,

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,330
there was a time where the
Italian mob did have a line.

93
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,340
Like you didn't cross family, things
like that. Uh, but the Russians,

94
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,930
all my God, will they fuck
up an entire family? The dog.

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,990
Everything gets in the worst
way. Yeah. They're scary.

96
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,160
Scary mother fuckers. I had
a, an experience, I'm out.

97
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,930
It was a Broadway, I guess. Uh,

98
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:09,800
and they have those peddle cabs that go
around and they were all Russian dudes,

99
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,590
big kind of legs on him.

100
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:15,140
And they peddle around and I was
looking for a cab or real cab to take me

101
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:19,640
downtown. I wasn't gonna
ride 15 blocks in a tricycle,

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,770
uh, with a Uri peddling in front of me.
So, uh, this guy pass by once and said,

103
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:28,130
you need the cab. I was like, Nah,
I'm good. Thanks. Comes around again.

104
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,490
I'm still waiting for a cab. And
he goes, cab. And I was like,

105
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,170
I'm not going to have you pedal
me 15 fucking blocks. No move.

106
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,040
And, and you could yell at
a cab driver in New York.

107
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,520
They'll yell out your window and stuff.
They'd rarely, we'll get out of their car.

108
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,740
They know, you know, you've
got the medallion right there.

109
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:50,210
You could just call the number and say
you were being harassed by a cab driver.

110
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,240
So they won't do anything.
This guy gets off his fucking bike,

111
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,440
you'll have a fucking problem,
you have fucking problem.

112
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,240
And I was just like, oh shit.
It's going down black eye.

113
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,050
This guy means business. And of course
I'm like, no, no, all good. All good.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,880
Thank you. I don't need a a cab.
You'll write the mother fuck.

115
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,570
And that was it. But you
don't fuck with Russia? No,

116
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,460
they're not regular white
people. No, they're not.
