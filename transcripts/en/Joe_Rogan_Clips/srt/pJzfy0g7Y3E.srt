1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,980
And even know Noam Chomsky said
something about Sam Harrison,

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,600
Jordan Peterson, that,
uh, free speech does not,

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,860
it does not apply to hate speech.
Like why?

4
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:17,070
It's like, yes it does. Yes, it does.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,960
That's crazy that someone who's really
smart can say it doesn't. Yeah. Okay.

6
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:24,270
So it's available on Youtube.
Um,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,290
he say he puts some posts saying
that he was blocked from something.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,340
It doesn't matter.
The point is,

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,950
one thing that's been shown is that
they're trying to silence more.

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,980
They're trying to stop the spread of
conservative ideology and spread liberal

11
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,040
ideology.
Like they're actively trying to do that.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,370
I feel like there's a real worry
that when you have a platform,

13
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,500
whether it's youtube or something like
that, that you could get infected,

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,890
but like say shit posters if
ship posters just, they're more,

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,040
they're more prolific right there.
Like if you look,

16
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,630
just look at the comments on Youtube,

17
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,380
like in a lot of like really popular
things that comments are horrific,

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,420
like way disproportionate to how
they would be in the real world.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,650
Like the comments and the p, the anger
that you find in a lot of youtube videos,

20
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:23,220
especially if you look at like the
comments of podcasts. Holy Shit Dude.

21
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,820
People are opinionated, right? They
got some crazy wild fucking opinion.

22
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,080
Now if you were youtube,
you'd be like,

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,060
we have to figure out a way to stop
people from saying Faggot or we have to

24
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,720
figure out a way to stop people from
doing this or stop people from uh,

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,430
from being homophobic.

26
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,010
We have to figure out a way to
stop people from supporting Trump.

27
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,460
We have to figure out a way to stop
people from talking about the wall.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,850
You have to figure out a way and as soon
as you start doing that kind of stuff,

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,230
you run into a real slippery when
you're deciding what people shouldn't,

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,450
shouldn't be able to say,
even if it's legal.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,050
That gets real weird because then you
don't have a free speech platform.

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,010
You have a left wing platform like your,
your platform has now left wing.

33
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:04,630
And I'm not saying you're wrong,
but I'm saying it,

34
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,730
it strengthens the position of the people
that you oppose because they are being

35
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:13,320
suppressed. Like you could see there
being suppressed. Even if they're wrong,

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,220
you put a guy in jail because his dog
says [inaudible] pop when he says see high

37
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,930
like boy you,

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,960
you just looked real fucking stupid to
most people and now the fight is on and

39
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:28,860
now it's going to be this swarm of
controversy where people are freaking,

40
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,240
I just found out about it yesterday.

41
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,830
I just found out about it last
night I think might not even,

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,660
it might've been this morning when
I woke up. Youtube is reported.

43
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,700
Oh, did you hear about your kids? Because
what this famous conspiracy theorists,

44
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,420
uh, his videos have been coming
up in the youtube kids app, uh,

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,650
teaching like flat earth type Shit and
like we didn't go to the planet where

46
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,050
moon good stuff. Yeah. What a good
motive is getting into a lot of,

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,610
you know, where they can,
whoa, there's too much.

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,040
Here's the thing about youtube
now is in defense of them,

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,570
because I'd talked though I had dinner
with some big wigs at Youtube and there

50
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:08,560
was some of the stuff they said was very
annoying and not calling things hate

51
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,200
speech that just weren't like,

52
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:13,450
I'm talking about someone
who got a community guideline
stripe because they put

53
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:13,780
a cup,

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,780
put a conversation up in their
playlist between Sam Harris and um,

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,770
Douglas Murray to intellectuals and they,

56
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:25,240
they said that it was because it
was hate speech and I was like,

57
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:28,180
that is the fact that they could just say,
that just drove me nuts.

58
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,830
But they're dealing with who knows
how many videos every day. I mean,

59
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:37,120
it's insane. How could they, how could
they possibly even know the videos? Okay.

60
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:40,870
The total number of people use Youtube is,
what is that number?

61
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,120
Oh my God.
301 billion.

62
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:51,010
300 million,
300 hours of video uploaded to youtube.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,580
Every minute,

64
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,380
almost 5 billion videos are watched on
youtube every single day in an average

65
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,990
month, eight out of 10, 18 to
49 year olds. Watch youtube.

66
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,300
One of the things this woman said to
me that I, I agree with her on and on.

67
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,730
I mean, I believer because this
is not about about opinion,

68
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,700
is about how the way youtube works.
She said,

69
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:13,990
right now we have very crude tools to
find offensive speech, hate speech.

70
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,670
They're very crude tools and sometimes
the Mr Mark and sometimes when you're

71
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,080
dealing with like subtlety, like
humor, like I could say, hey you fuck.

72
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,580
And you know, people go, oh, he was angry.
Like obviously not, you hear the tone,

73
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,211
you know,

74
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,730
like someone saying that they're saying
it to friends and they're joking around,

75
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:35,590
they're being silly and everybody's
laughing. Youtube misses that. They don't,

76
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,750
they don't know what's
humor and what's not.

77
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,530
So are you saying that you can
never make a joke about, you know,

78
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,370
a guy's Dick or you can never make a joke
about a girl's vagina or you never beg

79
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,300
of joke about heterosexual sex, can
you? No. No, you can do that. Okay.

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,280
Can I make a joke about gay sex?
No. No, you can't. Oh, I see.

81
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,910
Because I'm not gay. Okay. Can I
make a joke about why people, yes.

82
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,740
Can you make a joke about black people?
No. Oh, okay. What do we do in here?

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,340
What are we doing? You're deciding
what people can and can't say.

84
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,070
And then they're also demonetizing things.

85
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,610
And we've had some demonetize
ones that were just like, okay,

86
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:15,520
there's gotta be some sort of an algorithm
going on here where there's a word we

87
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:20,140
say and that word triggers some sort of
a response and then they say that it's

88
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:23,350
up for, we, we, we have it up
for manual review sometimes.

89
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,940
The are Douglas Murray one where we
talked about youtube demonetizing videos.

90
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,570
That one got demonetized
says, so it's like, okay,

91
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:35,230
are they doing that to fuck with us or
are they doing that because he Douglas

92
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,380
talked about, um, radical
fundamentalist Islam.

93
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,160
Like what is it in their defense,
it's just their platform.

94
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,410
They should be able to do whatever
they want. Should they though,

95
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,430
because what are they then? If
it's, who is they? Who is they?

96
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,730
The people they hired [inaudible]
doesn't that shift? Like the,

97
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,300
the assumption is that everybody
who works in management,

98
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:59,780
everybody who works behind the scenes
all shares a mindset. That's crazy.

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,010
That doesn't even make any sense.

100
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:05,200
That's not even the society like group
think tanks like that. Like if, if,

101
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:06,530
if they all agree,

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,530
and this was one of the things that
James Damore pointed out about Google,

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,890
it's like they don't leave any
room whatsoever for conservatives.

104
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:16,820
Like they absolutely discriminated against
conservatives. I'm not conservative,

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,480
but if I was and I worked at
a company like Google, yeah.

106
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,140
Imagine how fucking on the
outside you would feel like,

107
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,850
is it illegal to be conservative?

108
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,960
Like isn't there a responsible ethical
form of conservatism that's not racist?

109
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:31,220
Not Homophobic,
but,

110
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,990
but presumes that a conservative
person in power would be more fiscally

111
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:36,920
responsible,

112
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,850
will have economic policies that they
agree with interventional his policies

113
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,870
they agree with.
I don't,

114
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,320
I don't think that that's outside the
realm of possibility that a reasonable

115
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,120
person could be conservative.

116
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,270
But if you work for any big tech
company that's not in the menu,

117
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,030
you don't get to be that.
Like you don't get to promote that.

118
00:06:56,031 --> 00:07:00,680
You don't get to agree with that. It's
weird. It's not good because it's not,

119
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,750
it's not open speech. You're supposed
to be able to talk shit through. I'm a,

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,780
I like to listen to someone who has a
very strong opinion about something and

121
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:12,500
see if it resonates with me. Now, if
you stop the stop, that'll stifle that.

122
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,510
I was just going to demonetizing a
video though, isn't a censoring someone.

123
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,460
It's encouraging censorship.
This is why,

124
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:23,000
because you don't want to be demonetized
if you have a video and that video can

125
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:25,790
make you $500. If it's, um,

126
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,920
if it's up and it gets ads or it
can make you $0 million, but that's,

127
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,560
that's a $500 incentive for you to not
talk about whatever the fuck got it.

128
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:36,830
Demonetized right, but that's in the
debt then makes your argument, I'm like,

129
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,990
what were you making the
content for in the first place?

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,870
Or you just know it doesn't to me. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's,

131
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:45,260
it's a motivation for you
to censor your speech,

132
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,800
whatever you're making it for in
the first place. You pursued that.

133
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,480
Someone was just making it to make it,

134
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,410
but there's an absolute monetary
value if they put ads on it.

135
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,720
So if they take away the monetary value
and they do it specifically because you

136
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,960
chose a certain subject that is in
fact a form of censorship there,

137
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:07,100
what they're doing is encouraging you to
self censor in order to make more money.

138
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,450
They could say, hey, you can do
whatever the fuck you want. Well,

139
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,040
we're going to decide that if
you talk about fill in the blank,

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,900
that subject no money,
so don't talk about that subject anymore.

141
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,550
They're not going to give
you money because they're
sharing that money with you

142
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:23,120
though that you could still share
that video on your Twitter channel.

143
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:26,360
You could still share it on your blog
and still make money if you can find her

144
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:29,030
on advertisers. It's just they see what
you're doing. I see what you're doing,

145
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,460
but it's not a good argument.
The reason why it's not a good argument.

146
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,050
It's because they made
a concerted decision.

147
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:37,340
They made a very clear decision to take
away the ads on videos where they don't

148
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:38,180
like what you're saying.

149
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,270
That just could be because they don't
have advertisers that are willing to pay

150
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,750
them. That's all. That's the way
I would look at it. The advertise,

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,050
the w didn't want to pay them because of
like Douglas Murray and Sam Harris Talk.

152
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,570
They just couldn't, maybe they couldn't
find the money for it and we're like, Hey,

153
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,230
guess what? This week, this is not
monetize because you don't know.

154
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,350
There's this weird to me,

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,100
I'm making a guess because you're doing
this to try to reinforce your original

156
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:02,430
opinion. I don't. I don't think it is
censorship. It's a form of censorship.

157
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,450
I think that the monetizing is not
a good thing because of other ways,

158
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,800
other reasons that it happens.

159
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,610
I'm on youtube because they didn't have
an incentive to share monetize videos

160
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,190
because they're making money on them.
I get that,

161
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,810
but it's just because it's the understand
that youtube who has a youtube has an

162
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:21,690
incentive to share monetize videos
because they're sharing in the profit of

163
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:26,580
every single video monetize video doesn't
a creators it get 100% of the money.

164
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,200
They get half of the money. Right?
Youtube gets the other half. So if a,

165
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,290
if a video is monetized there, they've
been a fitness sharing them. Right, right,

166
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,160
right. So that even reinforces more
the idea that they're censoring. Yeah,

167
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,900
that's what I'm saying. But
like the third, they're not,

168
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,030
they're censoring the
ability for it to share it,

169
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:46,200
to be shared in the youtube platform, not
on the Internet. That's true as a whole,

170
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,820
but they're not censoring.

171
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,030
What they're doing is promoting self
censorship by giving you a fiscal reward

172
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,460
for following their line. Again, that's
just where I'm saying like as a creator,

173
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,490
if you're making content to
just make money on youtube,

174
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,140
then you have to play by
their rules. Yeah, I do. I
understand what you're saying,

175
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,450
but what my point about all this is,

176
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,940
is what they're doing is they're there,
they're making their own.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,860
They're making these decisions and who
is making these decisions that that also

178
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:23,220
could be definitely set. They should
say these are the rules, right?

179
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,970
I'm the person responsible for making
that statement. What are the rules?

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,270
Here's what they don't say. They don't
say, this is what's weird about it.

181
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,190
It's totally arbitrary. There's no like
written law that you have to follow.

182
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,500
There's no like,
oh you can't say cut.

183
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,310
Cause if you say con Playtex doesn't
want to advertise in your fucking video

184
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,780
anymore, right? No, there's
not that. It's weird. Yeah.

185
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,760
They don't tell you what to do.
Monetize video is like, when we get one,

186
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,550
they don't say it's because you
guys talked about about youtube. No,

187
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,550
they don't say shit.
It's fucking weird, man.

188
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:58,530
It was never fuck with me in eight years.
Youtube fucks with me every day. Right.

189
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:02,700
But the thing about Vimeo is the
difference in the numbers is so radical.

190
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,370
Like if we have a video that
gets a million hits on Youtube,

191
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,080
it will get 20,000 on Vimeo.
