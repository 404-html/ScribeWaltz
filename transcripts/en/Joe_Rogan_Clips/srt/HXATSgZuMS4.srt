1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,400
The joe rogan experience,
you,

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,000
you bring up some really
fascinating subjects. And, um,

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,920
we were talking right before the podcast
about social media and how weird it is

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,040
that you got lumped in with the alt right
for a comment saying something along

5
00:00:17,681 --> 00:00:19,230
the lines of,
uh,

6
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,620
that you find what was the exact quote
is something along the highly intelligent

7
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,640
people seem to,
which is not saying they're good people.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,221
No,
that's right.

9
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:33,221
And I think a lot of people who are
ignorant to the outright equate them with

10
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:37,580
the, uh, the, the skinheads and the
Neo Nazis carrying the Tiki torches.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,650
But when I was referring strictly to the
alt right from its origin in internet

12
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,380
discussion groups and I, you
know, I know some of them,

13
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:49,430
someone going to former students and
some of them are highly intelligent and

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,860
highly read. So, uh, but,

15
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,500
but that's not what people often think
of when they think of the alt right.

16
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,870
And that's what I was referring
to. I, there are people in tech,

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,650
there's some people in universities
to stay under cover. And, uh, I was,

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:05,000
I made some remarks on how to starve
that movement. And I had to feed it.

19
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,690
But yeah,

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,590
so many people jumped on it as if
you were endorsing the alt right.

21
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,310
And what was the exact quote you were
just basically saying something along the

22
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:15,770
lines of there's a lot of
intelligent people that are involved.

23
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,370
Well, it wasn't so much that it was also
the fact that because of the, uh, uh,

24
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:23,910
the various taboos in mainstream
intellectual culture, the,

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,890
the cause of political correctness,

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,500
there's certain things that are
just kind of not discussable.

27
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,600
But then when people in the
alt right discover them,

28
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:31,980
they feel tremendously empowered.

29
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:36,030
Like we are now privy to the truth
that the establishment can't handle.

30
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:40,500
You can't handle the truth. And since
it was never discussed in the open,

31
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,160
there are no counter arguments to some
of the most toxic interpretations.

32
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:46,550
And so the alt right
can run with the never,

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,670
never having been in a forum where these
things are debated and criticized and

34
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,600
put into context,

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,230
they take like one fact and then they
draw the most extreme conclusions.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,330
If these things were
debated in the first place,

37
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:01,170
then you'd realize that those
conclusions, uh, are not warranted. Oh,

38
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:05,040
it's from an example is there are average
differences between men and women and

39
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,640
a lot of psychological
traits now, uh, if that's,

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,530
and that's often quite taboo and
intellectual circles for I think bizarre

41
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,250
reasons.

42
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,610
There are people who think that somehow
women's rights depend on men and women

43
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:22,200
being a indistinguishable, right? I think
it's a bad equation in the first place,

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
but as soon as you come across the
fact that men and women on average are,

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,581
are different,

46
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,760
you also come across the fact that men
and women overlap in a lot of these

47
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:37,380
traits that whatever trait you name that
men on average are better at that women

48
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,214
or vice versa.

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,160
There are a lot of women who are
better than a lot of men or vice versa.

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,410
And so you can't really
judge an individual from the
average of, uh, their, their,

51
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,180
their sex.
Also,

52
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,330
even though there are some traits where
men score a little better than women,

53
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,090
there are some traits where women score
a little better than men and that that's

54
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,050
the complete picture.

55
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,110
But the thing is that if the
entire subject is out of bounds,

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,070
you never get to present complete picture.

57
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,950
And some people run away with all men
and women are totally different. What,

58
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,550
what are your thoughts on how the
subject got out of bounds? Because it's,

59
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,970
it's very confusing to
me that certain subjects,

60
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:14,971
like the differences between genders
are so taboo when they seem so obvious.

61
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:16,661
I mean,

62
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:21,040
you just could go to a mall and just look
at the way the men dress and the women

63
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,930
dress and you go, well, there's
some obvious distinctions here.

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,960
There's a history to it,
right? Because there were,

65
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,580
there were a lot of cockamamie theories
and the 19th century in a lot of the

66
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:35,080
20th century that, uh, that, that men
were intellectual and women were not.

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,360
And women were governed by
their emotions and their,

68
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,920
if we've been thought too much,

69
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,070
it would take blood away
from their ovaries and their
womb and they wouldn't be

70
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,430
fertile and then they'd be all miserable.
I mean, really like crazy stuff.

71
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,910
And as a reaction to that in the 70s,

72
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,370
when the second wave of
feminism became prominent,

73
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,690
it became almost an article of faith that
there were no differences between men

74
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,770
and women. Uh, and so if you
say that there are differences
between men and women,

75
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,350
you're sending women back to the,
to the kitchen in the nursery.

76
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
So this is a total non sequitur because
fairness is not the same as sameness.

77
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,690
So obviously women should
have equal rights to men,

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,520
whether or not they're exact copies of
men or have a distinctive profile as men

79
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,150
have a distinct profile. So I
think it was just a mistake to, uh,

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,830
to conflate the issue of women's rights
with men and women being identical.

81
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,290
Uh,
but that's the way it kind of shook out.

82
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,790
And it became kind of an article
of faith in, uh, in a lot of,

83
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,050
in some feminist,

84
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,500
some kind of left liberal circles that
men and women have to be identical.

85
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,950
And if they aren't, that means you're
a trader to a women's equality.

86
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,800
And articles of faith are always
dangerous, always dangerous,

87
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:46,030
especially in that regard. It's articles.
A fairness are always important. I mean,

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,260
fair being fair to each other
and but being fair is also
recognizing differences.

89
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,990
That's right. And not assuming that any
differences or deficiency, right. I mean,

90
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,210
if you're really doing an
honest comparison of the
differences between men and

91
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:02,590
women, men wouldn't come out looking
so good. Right. You know? Yeah.

92
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,510
I have a whole bit about that in my act
when we're looking at the reaction to

93
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,230
this though,

94
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,580
what was strange to me was how many
people seemed like they wanted to jump on

95
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,800
board and criticize you.

96
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,060
And I think a lot of it is almost like
to take away some of the potential

97
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,200
criticism of themselves.

98
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:24,250
Like it's instant claiming of the
moral high ground virtue signaling.

99
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,150
And it's just very disappointing when
you see this from intellectuals and

100
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,900
college professors and it is, it
should know better. I mean, to be fair,

101
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,890
I did not get into much
trouble from, from, you know,

102
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,380
my peers and among up professors
and Grad students and so on.

103
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,130
There are a couple of trolls who, uh,
who, who ran with it. But by and large,

104
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:45,250
the mainstream reaction was that
this was almost a sign of a,

105
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:48,290
as a New York Times put it.
The social media is making a stupid yeah.

106
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,660
That was the article.
The cover,

107
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,830
the name of the title of the article in
The Times. Yeah. So it was by and large,

108
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,690
uh, you know, I came out of it. Okay.

109
00:05:55,691 --> 00:06:00,691
But it wasn't real indication of how these
mobs of outrage can corrupt Andy kind

110
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:04,580
of intelligent discourse.
Yeah. We'll subtle discussions.

111
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,610
The discussions that involve nuance
like complicated issues that are there.

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,731
They're complex.

113
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:15,731
They require a long sort of
description of the issue and I'll,

114
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,130
I'll, I'll, uh, very

115
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:20,540
okay.

116
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,540
Complex sort of take on these various
differences between men and women and the

117
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,850
alt right and the left and
political. Correct. These are,

118
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:30,530
these are long discussions.
I mean,

119
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:34,850
these aren't some thing that you can
smash into a very short soundbite and

120
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:39,230
completely cover your take on things hold
the more reason that they shouldn't be

121
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,270
taboo,
because if you can't discuss them,

122
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,180
then the only interpretation you're
going to have as the simplistic one,

123
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,560
if you could bring them out in the open,

124
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,480
then you can start to
have that discussion.

125
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:57,690
Okay.
