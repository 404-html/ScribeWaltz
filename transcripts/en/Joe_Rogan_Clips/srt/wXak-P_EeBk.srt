1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,640
Based on what some,
based on what we voted on,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,150
like if people really knew the
information involved in like the safety of

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:08,160
marijuana. It does it freak you
out, you? Of course it does.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,110
Does it make you paranoid? Yeah, 100%
but does alcohol make you an asshole?

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,620
Fuck yes it does. Oh yeah, but do I think
that everybody should have all of it?

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,230
CBS reject Superbowl that based on the
benefits of medical marijuana? Well,

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,600
in their defense there's probably a bunch
of people or stockholders and there's

8
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,180
a lot of decisions that are
made that are made by lawyers.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,830
I just want it just before people get
angry about something that CBS decided to

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:35,340
do.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
You have to understand is CBS is
responsible for the employment of untold

12
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,690
thousands of human beings.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,790
They're going to have bud
light ads right next to this.

14
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,940
They will or whatever and they will.
They will, but bud [inaudible],

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,750
Bud light ads are not going to affect
anyone's bottom line. I don't agree.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,093
I don't agree,

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,000
but I just want people to understand
that part of the problem is that the

18
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,970
business aspect of this has
not been fully established.

19
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:01,290
Once it's fully established,

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,070
CBS and all these people are going to
realize it isn't any different than bud

21
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,540
light.
It's not any different than anything.

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,500
You can get fucked up on bud light
if you just drink 20 of them,

23
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,310
you can't fucked up. You can walk
into trees. We do it on, you know,

24
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,610
cough medicine or what
else? Anything. I mean,

25
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,340
how many pharmaceutical drugs
can you get fucked up on?

26
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,660
And do we deny that some people who have
like serious injuries benefit greatly

27
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:28,560
from pain pills? No, they definitely
do. The thing about it all,

28
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:31,950
all is you gotta be honest and let
people form their own opinions.

29
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,080
And part of being honest about it,

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,200
about these things is tell
them the pros and the cons.

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,180
Everything has a pro and a con,

32
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,110
including a whole people banging
it out and nursing homes.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,020
Exactly. Getting Committee, uh,
you know, it's not good. The, the,

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,450
the pro and the con is my dad's a pro
banging old ladies in nursing homes,

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,110
but the con is he's probably got some
stuff on his little wiener down there.

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,070
He's probably passing
to biological footballs,

37
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,020
but he's not getting pregnant.
