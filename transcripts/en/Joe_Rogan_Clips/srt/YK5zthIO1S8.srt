1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,740
The joe rogan experience. Well,
a little knives in the end.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,670
It's a cat's Dick,
so he's just scooping it out of there.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,170
Is this a woman or a man? I don't
know. It's someone who's not that fat.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,480
Oh,
whoever the fuck this is.

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,870
If they just got on a carb free
diet for like a couple of weeks,

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,580
it's not even like, oh, not
that long of weight to lose.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,610
I know a lady who didn't need it and got
it done. She literally didn't need it.

8
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,680
I don't know. I don't know her that well,
but I remember her friends saying, oh,

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,090
how much extreme discomfort she was
in because she had a where essentially

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,980
electess these tights.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,090
Super tight compression pants everywhere
to keep all your ass fat together.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,410
Isn't it amazing? It's so debt.
That's what I was laughing.

13
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:50,220
My ass fat loosened.
I had a hair transplant.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,420
That was the dumbest thing I've ever
done. Feldman. That's what he did.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,980
I was giant scar in the back of my head.
It looks like a smile.

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,760
I wonder if that's his piece of meat. My
Joe. You get like a scar from it. Yeah.

17
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,840
My joke was that it's like taking people
from a town where everybody's healthy

18
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:05,820
and moving them into a town
where everybody's dying.

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,730
The only ones that were left
for like the new recruits,

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,810
like the hair that was supposed
to be up there pulling out.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,570
So where do you get it from? Like other
party it from the back of your head.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,810
They take a strip off about now the way
they do it and a lot of places they do

23
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,570
it differently and do one
individual follicle at a time.

24
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,860
I just was scared that I was going
ball. It was like, what can you do?

25
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,680
And they tell you they can fix it. They're
like, oh great, I'll just get it fixed.

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,480
But it doesn't really fix it now.
Well how come that was me,

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,720
Joel Mchale, cause I remember him
from those Burger King commercials.

28
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,430
We had less hair than I do. I know it
all now he's got dragonball z here. Wow.

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,820
Real thick. It's almost like
more thick than they start with.

30
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,100
Sometimes you have a killer
transplant or is that just the guy?

31
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,460
Great head of hair man.
You didn't you remember the
Burger King Commercial, right?

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,060
I do. I do not. Nobody does. It was
when the office was getting popular,

33
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,310
not to put the American one and Burger
King at these commercials that were kind

34
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:01,280
of like the office and he was like,
the wise I can picture one vertical,

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,360
have thicker hair,
works better.

36
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:06,780
Every bald guys fucking
him as he sees more hair.

37
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:10,980
I remember people with a thick hair
follicles can get away with it.

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,650
Like my hair would have looked way better,
but I have thin hair.

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,340
The hair's themselves are thin. So if
someone has thick hair, they could,

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,290
they could have some pretty dramatic
results if it's the right kind of things.

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,480
Did you do it dirty? No, not even 30.
Yeah. What do you tell him to 30 when you,

42
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,730
yeah,
I think I was 28.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,960
I just started acting on TV and I was
panicking because my hair was like

44
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,250
seriously falling out and I was like, this
shit, it's going quick. And I was like,

45
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:40,020
well, where's it going to go? And um,
she's just get thicker. Pubes. Well,

46
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,510
I was like,

47
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,090
how was I knew that part of the reason
why I was making money was the way I

48
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,570
looked.
I mean I,

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
I was doing stand up and I was acting
in these shows but I wasn't an ugly dude

50
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,130
and it helped,

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,960
you know like it was getting certain
kinds of roles like boyfriend roles.

52
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,500
CIC has to go through it. Yeah, you
can be panicked because you're like,

53
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:02,200
well this is how I'm making money
and I never made any money before.

54
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,370
So all of a sudden,
wow.

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,300
I went from being completely broke
and being a super struggling comic.

56
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,390
Like if I got lucky I was to make it 300
a week. Three 50 a week was a big one.

57
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,240
Why is that bad? Is that bad for a week?
Perfect. If you're a 25 year old guy,

58
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,310
which is what I was trying
to make it as a comic,

59
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,240
then it went from that to making fucking
shit piles of TV money and you're like,

60
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:24,980
how do I not my bag,
I'm not getting rid of this.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,150
I to figure out a way to
keep this rolling. But if I
should just shaved my end,

62
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:33,050
I just didn't, you know, the freedom
freedom I have now, even if I hit,

63
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,490
grew like a thick head of hair,
I guarantee you I'd still shaved my head.

64
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,820
I don't want to go to a barber. I had a
really nice lady used to cut my hair too.

65
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,280
I loved her. She's fun, fun conversations.

66
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,710
But I'd have to go to war fucking
place and she'd have to like,

67
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,990
I wake up every four days. I go,
why? Where's your mommy of, um,

68
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,460
can you talk about that?
I that chilling pursuit,

69
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,670
but I was on some odd JB Smoove you
said this like dinner show where it'd be

70
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,820
like a couple of athletes and like a
couple of comics. Oh yeah. And I, I don't,

71
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,100
because I'm a one of the follow sports,

72
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,540
but these guys were just say he's a
hockey player and some football players,

73
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,590
how fucking which minority?

74
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:09,970
And they're talking about
all these treatments that
would get, you know, and um,

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,830
most of them,
sort of his beauty treatments for,

76
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:16,390
for rich fucking Hollywood women real.
And then they trickle down to athletes.

77
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,320
Wow. Cryo, that's where, I'm sorry,

78
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,910
I swear to God they were
talking about Cryo that way.

79
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,610
Like it was for fucking hot checks
cause they're kind of like a hot chicks.

80
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:30,520
The kind of athlete, right.
I can go like, oh yeah.

81
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,490
Then you throw your arm out. Dean
Turner, like Blue Bluer face out from

82
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,750
uh, steroids for arthritis.
No Way. She didn't want to be,

83
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,330
she wanted people to know about some
illness. You still should get less work.

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,280
So she just was not all the jokes
about how she looked like a man.

85
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,560
She just took all the jokes to work and
then finally came chemo, which I go like,

86
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,420
yeah, good for you man. If he got workout
it, cause you know, people are terrified.

87
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:52,810
Uh,

88
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,580
well especially me being going
from being an insanely hot woman,

89
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,570
I didn't know gross.
That is a change of everything.

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,190
That's a change of character.

91
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,390
It's a character builder guy
who was in all his money.

92
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,910
You find out who really liked you
the whole time, you know? Yeah.

93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,090
It changes how you interface with
the world. Like a beautiful woman.

94
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:17,540
Interfaces with the world. Like the
most popular celebrity possible. Yeah.

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,750
Beautiful woman is like Tom
Cruise everywhere. She goes,

96
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:29,930
okay.
