1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,380
May I took came and the kids, we
traveled around Australia or in, uh,

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,420
it must've been the end of 2007 early
last year and we camped out on the tunnel

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,451
me desert,

4
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:13,810
which is like one of the last places
to really be discovered and explored in

5
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:17,590
Australia. Like there's, there's no
artificial lights out there at all,

6
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:22,090
like whatsoever.
And we camped out on the desert.

7
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,700
90 thing that was around us
was like dingoes and camels.

8
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:27,550
Like you'd hear them moving for
the night. Camels. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:32,440
But we sat there at camp. I just
had the, my, my truck, my ute,

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,990
you know,
with the camper on the back,

11
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:37,110
like real lightweight
set up and we sat there,

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,280
no lights on in the camper or anything.

13
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:44,281
So you're sitting in the pitch black
moonless night and the media's dude like,

14
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:48,730
I reckon we counted 40,
50 media's over like half hour or an hour,

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,800
just the naked.
I seen him,

16
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,310
perfect dude sitting there with
the family and I'm like, this is,

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,180
this is the best. Like this is, it
was so amazing just to sit there,

18
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,890
especially with the kids.
And Kim as well.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,980
Nerving when you find out how many times
they enter the atmosphere? Oh yeah,

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,580
there's a, I think good Jaimee
could probably look this up,

21
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:12,581
but I think a hundred tons of media
hits the Earth every single day.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,890
100 tons, dude. But most of it enters
in dust form because it breaks up.

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,090
But uh, so last year, um,

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,620
I was up at my cabin just chilling
out by myself. Woke up in the morning,

25
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:27,381
they to do a pierce,

26
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:32,381
walked out and I'm looking up and this
media come through and it was so bright

27
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:34,430
that it actually lit up the ground dude,

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,980
like the most incredible
media that I've seen.

29
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,280
I had a time lapse photo going
in the opposite direction.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,870
I quickly turned that around and you
see that the media's dust for like,

31
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,410
it lasts for 25 minutes, half
an hour in the, in the camera,

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,280
and it's just drift and change and
shape in the atmosphere. It was insane.

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,790
So it's just like every now and
then there's like a real good one.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,310
So then I started looking it
up and I seen one that Rick,

35
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,760
a whole village like in
Germany or something like that.

36
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,530
This asteroid comes through rec
and shit that it didn't even touch,

37
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,300
but that comes so close to it.

38
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:11,030
It blows the walls and the windows
out and everything, and I'm like,

39
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,590
this is fucking scary.

40
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:17,240
We live on a little speck that's
turning in one of many galaxy. You know,

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,500
my friend Randall Carlson put it best.
He said,

42
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,760
we live in the middle of a
shooting gallery, isn't it?
In signs, just the time.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,210
The perspective of, you know,
hundreds of millions of years.

44
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,100
It doesn't seem,

45
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,380
it doesn't register to us because we're
only around for a hundred years. Yeah.

46
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,320
So when we look up and we see the moon,

47
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,530
I mean the moon looks like a fucking
stop sign in the most Janky is redneck

48
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:46,290
town. When people shoot at signs, yes, the
wound looks like it's just fucking shot.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,460
It's just getting nailed all the time,
especially with no atmosphere.

50
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,440
All those things make
it all the way through.

51
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,470
Nothing gets slowed down by the
air or burns up in the atmosphere.

52
00:02:55,471 --> 00:03:00,010
Isn't that crazy? Everything just slams
into it. Boom, boom. Magic being up there.

53
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,850
It must be all day long. I must be
slamming things. Oh, it was only a,

54
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,370
I think it was like 10,000 years
ago. There was like a big bang, like,

55
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,130
like a big media hit
hit the earth. And, uh,

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,940
I started looking into that and then I
started really looking into aborigines in

57
00:03:16,941 --> 00:03:19,880
Australia, indigenous, how long they'd
been around for and stuff like that.

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,230
And there's now evidence to say that
they'd been around for 70,000 years.

59
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,490
They live through like three of those
big media is hitting the earth. You know,

60
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:32,720
like, it's crazy to think about like why,
I wish we had video cameras back then,

61
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,790
you know, and I could have recorded
that. We could look at it now.

62
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,720
Like imagine that. Well, Randall Carlson,
the guy that I talked about earlier,

63
00:03:38,721 --> 00:03:43,721
he is a proponent of this theory
that this is what ended the ice age.

64
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,720
Yeah.

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,190
And he's got some pretty compelling
evidence to back it up in terms of,

66
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:51,650
um,
like massive,

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,990
massive fields field with a dead woolly
mammoths and died almost instantly.

68
00:03:56,991 --> 00:04:01,040
Some of them with their legs broken from
the force of the impact on real. Yeah.

69
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:05,180
He's, you know, it's really
interesting because he's a guy who, uh,

70
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't think he has a
degree in this stuff,

71
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:12,020
but he's so well read in it that he has
these debates and conversations with

72
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:15,710
people that do have these degrees in it
and he can tell them things about it.

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,400
And it's hard in those fields to be taken
seriously if you don't have a phd in

74
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:24,590
whatever discipline it
is. But man, his, uh,

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,060
his work on these things is so compelling
and the podcast that I did with them

76
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,130
are just mind blowing.
But in,

77
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:36,050
in terms of like the evidence that points
to some event that ended the ice age

78
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,110
very rapidly and caused the
disintegration of the poet, of the, um,

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,760
the ice that was over North
America, you know, North America,

80
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:47,750
it's something like a mile high
plus she device over the most of it.

81
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,210
Just 10,000 years ago. Yeah.
Yeah. 12,000 years old,

82
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,900
I think I was driving through Wyoming
and they've got all these signs up in

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
Wyoming that are really interesting.
And it was desert rock formation.

84
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:02,010
It'll tell you how all of that rock
formation is, how it formed. You know,

85
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,430
cause like, you know, rock usually
in beds, in layers like this,

86
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:08,760
it's formed in layers like this. And then
you'll see a rock like that, you know,

87
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:10,080
all the lines of like this,

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,760
there's some of them there that are like
hundreds of million years old, you know,

89
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:16,740
and there's a sign there Sean.
And it's just,

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,560
it's incredible to think
how much the irfs changed.

91
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:23,700
And you just said it were around for a
hundred years at a time Max. You know?

92
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:26,780
And it's just like we're
dropping the freaking ocean.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,480
Like even the whole human ratios that
is a drop in the ocean compared to like

94
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,380
how old the earth is.
And it's just crazy to think of like,

95
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:36,720
it's hard to comprehend that there
was that much high. So over here,

96
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:41,370
cause there's none now, you know, but
it's been that long, you know, and that's,

97
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,770
yeah,
it's mind boggling to think of.

98
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,070
Well they say they find shells in Montana.

99
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,690
I found some on top of friggin some
big Macer out in the desert. Dude,

100
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,560
there's no water for miles
and there's shells. There's,

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,570
there was like staff fish fossilized
the rocks and it's all like coral bed,

102
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,090
you know. And that was like, that
was like the bottom of the ocean.

103
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,800
That was a reef bed as the
Great Western inland sea. Yeah.

104
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:11,510
They had sharks out there.
I'd say. I think they had
megla dawns and Montana Shit.

105
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,590
They find dinosaurs there all the
time. Want to Dudley's friends? Well,

106
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:20,591
Dudley knows a guy who has a ranch out
there in Montana and he found a bone in

107
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,580
his, uh, in his ranch. Just maybe
something protruding from the ground.

108
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,880
Um, and he wanted someone to get a look
at it. So he got ahold of some, uh,

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,790
I guess, what would you have
paleontologist? They went and they said,

110
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,680
you got to fucking t rex here, Bro. I'll
Lee t rex on your property. Unbelievable.

111
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,470
They, I think they gave him $1
million for it. Really? Yeah.

112
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:47,390
Cause this is like a fully intact
or close to intact t-rex. Far Out.

113
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:47,671
Yeah.

114
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:52,550
They apparently monetary please Colorado
would you got then megalodon was found

115
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:56,660
supposedly in Texas. Jesus
Christ. What the fuck?

116
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,430
That's a fucking great. What? Shock boy.
That's a stupid movie. The Meg. The Meg.

117
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,020
Yeah. I'll watch that shit. I
watched it the other day. I was like,

118
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,710
what am I sit in through here?
So stupid.

119
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,060
There wasn't just one.

120
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:16,061
There was a bunch of them did get or
can you find out how much a media,

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,390
yeah, I have. I was
struggling to find that.

122
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:24,950
And then I think I found what you found.
So it says, here's from NASA's website,

123
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,810
there's a hundred tons of dust
and sand size particle every day.

124
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,030
Hit Earth every day. But
that's every day, doesn't it?

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,540
It seems like it would put the balance
of the earth off, you know, like,

126
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,020
you know what I mean? Like, are we
sending shit back out and displays that?

127
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,650
We sent in a hundred tons of [inaudible]
out in the spice every day to off load

128
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,270
this.
Look at this 2000 years or so,

129
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:50,271
a Meteora meteoroid the size of a
football field hits earth and causes

130
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,270
significant damage to the area.
That's fine.

131
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,350
Once every faculty in the next 10 minutes
and object large enough to threaten or

132
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,170
a civilization comes along, not
just that bigger than that, uh,

133
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:02,550
impact craters on earth,
the moon,

134
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:06,420
another planetary planetary bodies or
evidence of these occurrences. Yeah.

135
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:09,780
They don't even know. You know,
that's the most spooky thing.

136
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Like Neil degrasse Tyson said that we
are decades away from being able to do

137
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,930
anything about one of those
things coming our way. And I said,

138
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,930
so all these periods of think that like
they could stop it when it's happening.

139
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:24,630
He's like, not happening. He goes,
there's nothing you could do.

140
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,960
What about Armageddon, Bro?
The mercy Bruce Willis. Yeah.

141
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:31,800
We've got a solar swells up there. He'll
figure it out. Sort it out. Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:32,400
There's a,

143
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
people have like a real distorted idea
of the technological capabilities in

144
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:40,350
terms of like, first of all,
NASA, so under budgeted,

145
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,100
they barely have enough money
to put satellites in orbit.

146
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,730
They don't have enough money
to stop coming in. I mean,

147
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,590
the amount of money you would
need is so fucking massive.

148
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:53,910
They would take a cooperative joint effort
of every major country in the world.

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,520
And it's such a of nature and you know,

150
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,050
a force of nature usually can't be
fucked with scary. Well, they're all,

151
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:05,100
they can do all they think they
could do in the, and not even now,

152
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,570
but in the future is move it
off target slightly. Yeah. Yeah.

153
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,260
Somehow or another give it a bump,

154
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,280
send it into Mars or something at a
certain distance and it completely misses.

155
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:18,150
Yeah. Cracks and Nunes dare
darkness a lot for forever.

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,730
Yeah.

157
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,560
It's scary spaces scary and you don't
really see space unless you're out there

158
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:26,670
with no light pollution.

159
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,100
I don't think people that don't
camp or that you don't go, you know,

160
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,830
you look up at night like last night,
uh,

161
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,350
well not last night but a couple of
nights ago when it wasn't raining.

162
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,520
It was a clear night and I saw quite a
few stars because it was no moon and I

163
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,440
was like wow, it's so pretty, but it
ain't shit. But you know what I'm saying.

164
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:47,910
The volume over. Yeah. It was photos
that you have. Yeah. Add at my farm.

165
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,330
You can just sit there with a knife at
all and you can look right into those.

166
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,350
There's so many stars and it looks like
a dark spot of the Milky Way cause you

167
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,820
can see so much of it.
You know,

168
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,940
you see a color in it and everything
gets an amazing spot. Yeah.

169
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:04,050
The color's weird. Right. What is the
color? What is that on the, I was,

170
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,070
I looked at some photos of it. Oh, not
my own photo. Someone else's photos.

171
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,610
And that will show on the,

172
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,940
the like the roller images and the color
that was coming out of these raw images.

173
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,280
They look like absolute pillars, like
painted pillars dude. Yeah. You know,

174
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:23,610
and it's, I dunno, I dunno if it's a depth
finish it. If it's something like that.

175
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:27,750
Jamie put go to Adam's a
that the first man. Yup.

176
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,880
Instagram again like these,
this is like the ones of um

177
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,820
oh look at that one from BC. Go
Down one strip that, that one there.

178
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,090
That's with the northern
lights in it. Wow. But yeah,

179
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:44,580
that's sudden no light
pollution out there.

180
00:10:44,581 --> 00:10:47,220
Obviously you saw the northern
lights and Casey, I don't know.

181
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:48,560
You could see him in BC.
Yup.

182
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,210
That's how you had to be in like
Icelander so I'm sure that was cool.

183
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,330
I've seen him when I was
in northwest territories,

184
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:57,960
I lining up the ground like and Ryan,
front of your eyes.

185
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,450
I would just like dance and constantly
right in front of your eyes.

186
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:05,280
That was awesome. In the
Northwest Territories of
Australia? No, in Canada. Oh,

187
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:08,340
okay. Yeah. Northern
territories of Australia.
Right. That's what they call it.

188
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,760
The last is, yeah. Okay. So
where's it at the best though?

189
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,650
Is it the best place to see it in like
Iceland or some shit or Norway? I Dunno.

190
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,330
I Dunno.
I've seen it.

191
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,600
So I've seen it in northwest
territories is I've seen it in BC.

192
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,870
I don't think we didn't say it in
Alberta when we're there. No, no,

193
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,380
but I think we had shitty
wherever wall will. Yeah,

194
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,960
it's gotta be a crazy thing to see though,
Hon. It's like green smoke in the sky.

195
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,250
Yeah.
If you go down a couple more Jamie please.

196
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,723
Okay.

197
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,420
Silent. There's the, there's
the farm go up one. Yeah,

198
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,310
hit that one in the middle there.
Wow. Look at the car. That one. God,

199
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,920
that's amazing.
And is that what kind of,

200
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,540
you have to do something with
the aperture. Wolf of Stata is,

201
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,330
it's open for longer, so it's Gavin in
more light. You know, like the human eye.

202
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,810
You have to actually lie there and the
dock for a fe wall and just like stare

203
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,270
into that sort of to
get a good look at it.

204
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,070
How long has it opened to get that image?
That's like a 13 or 15 seconds.

205
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,090
Oh Wow.
Yup.

206
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,410
You can leave it in for 30 seconds or
you can put it on like a actual jammed

207
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,910
open for a long time,

208
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:23,410
but it's way too much light for what
the farm has and you can start getting a

209
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,760
lot of distortion as well.

210
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,620
That's such a cool picture
with the cabin as well.

211
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,040
The light coming out of the cabin.

212
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,940
Isn't that crazy that there
could be infinity irfs out there?

213
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,380
Yeah, that's what's crazy is that
each one of those is a son. Yeah.

214
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,470
And most of them are bigger.
I mean,

215
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,430
apparently our son is a little
bitch ass bitch ass son.

216
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,660
Thank God for that. I was,
there will be fraud. Oh, we
just have to be further away,

217
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,210
but the big ones don't last that long.
Apparently Our signs a good one. It's a,

218
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,170
it's like a,

219
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,610
it's like a Toyota Tercel spot
that gave shade Ohio locks.

220
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:02,760
You may fucking last cruiser.
