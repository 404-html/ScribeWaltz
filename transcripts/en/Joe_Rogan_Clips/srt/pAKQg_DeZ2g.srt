1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,630
Locked in a, essentially it's
ego, but it's, it's a, it's, it's,

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:07,710
it's not an international
conversation. It's a, it's,
it's a game of, you know, who,

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:08,131
who is,

4
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:12,150
who is basically checking the right boxes
in their own little confirmation bias

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:16,710
to their own audience. And that doesn't
interest me, but it's frustrating.

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:17,231
You're all sorts of,

7
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,250
but you're also the best person on the
other side of that conversation now.

8
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:23,820
So there's a series of videos on Youtube,
I think it's called Merry Christmas,

9
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:28,210
Mr [inaudible]. Yeah, that's right. And
so on youtube you can watch for him,

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,630
pit it against people who are
playing this game. You know,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,460
Islamists and jihadists are
various boards and that he,

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,610
Majid is meeting them on your interview
show is mostly in the UK where they're

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:44,880
pretending to be more benign than they
are. And that, and Majid, as you know,

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,560
finding the question that sort of pulls
back the mask on the theocrat and it's,

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,090
it's hilarious. It's very funny that
one video that you publish on your blog.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,010
I've sent to dozens of my friends that
one video where there's this guy and he's

17
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,490
addressing this enormous group of people
and he's talking about is this radical

18
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:07,200
Islam or is this Islam that that was I
think a conference in Norway that was

19
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,034
just,
I mean,

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,420
these dots straight up in his limits
and jihad is addressing a crowd of

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,980
seemingly mainstream Muslims in Norway.
But he just by show of hands, you know,

22
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,310
is it, are we extremist if we think
a stage should be killed? It's,

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,410
it's pretty, it's stunning. It's
an amazing documentary. Yeah.

24
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:29,010
And respect to the way they want to
treat homosexuals, pos dates. I mean,

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,851
the whole thing is,

26
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:34,530
is this Islam or is this radical
Islam talking of ideology blinkering

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
statistical data on the
subject of homosexuality.

28
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:42,270
So in the United Kingdom,
a poll was done last year asking,

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,520
so there've been two poles gauging
public Muslim attitudes towards guys. Uh,

30
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,900
the first asked how many Muslims in
the UK find homosexuality is morally

31
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:55,770
acceptable and 0%.
This is by the way,

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,540
by professional polling company.

33
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,330
It's not just some student
that's devised a poll on Twitter.

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,580
A professional polling company found
that 0% of British Muslims responded to a

35
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:08,550
poll saying that they found
homosexuality morally acceptable.

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,380
And then a year later, which
now last year, another poll,
uh, was, uh, was conducted.

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,750
And uh, that was uh, an ICM poll
asking, uh, where the British Melissa,

38
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:23,370
how many British Muslims believe that
homosexuality should be criminalized or

39
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:28,320
remain legal. And uh, I think
it was roughly 52%, 52%,

40
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,520
if my memory serves me correctly,

41
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:33,300
said of British Muslims said that they
would wish for homosexuality to be

42
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,800
criminalized.
And of course,

43
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:39,210
what does criminalization of homosexuality
mean under Sharia and traditional

44
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,320
Islamic jurisprudence?
We know that it's punished by death.

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,540
So these are these, this is scientific
data from gauging, you know,

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,750
attitudes. British wasn't an
attitude towards homosexuality,

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,280
but the ideological blinkers will,
will kick in and refuse to see that truth.

48
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,440
And these aren't, Islam is unfortunately
my dialogue with Sam. We talk this,

49
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:01,300
that there are the Islamists who want to,

50
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,480
who actively wants to take over a country
and enforce their version of Islam.

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,380
Then there's underneath that there's a,
a softer landing of very,

52
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:12,880
very conservative stroke fundamentalist
attitudes that unfortunately have become

53
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,160
widespread.
And here is an example of it that is,

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,750
that is being gauged by scientific polling
methodology that tells us there's a

55
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,460
problem. And unfortunately if one
were to speak in this way, um,

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,840
especially in, in Europe, uh,

57
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,890
one is received by my own political
tribe and that's liberals center left and

58
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,304
further.

59
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,730
One is met with denial and called a
bigot simply for re relaying these facts.

60
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,260
A quarter of British Muslims when asked
about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo

61
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:49,261
offices in Paris a quarter said
that those attacks are justifiable.

62
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,860
They sympathize with the attackers as
opposed to the victims who were the staff

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,180
at the Charlie Hebdo offices.

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,210
So this is what led you to be
put on the southern poverty law,

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,240
speaking in these terms. And
unfortunately it's reporting polling data.

66
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,800
And what it does for me is to say,

67
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,960
this is why it's so important
to address these issues,

68
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,310
to have these conversations,

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,540
to try and empower those Muslim voices
that are seeking to challenge this sort

70
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:18,430
of, these sorts of attitudes and, and
carve out a space. And if, you know,

71
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,264
if,

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,050
if one can do that with Catholicism in
Europe and go through a reformation and

73
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,870
end up with an enlightenment and
ended up with secularism in the West,

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,010
what I often say is American
liberals are very happy,

75
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,320
challenging their own Bible belt.
And yet we have a core,

76
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,110
an belt within our communities.

77
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,910
And if I'm attempting to replicate the
equivalent of challenging the Bible belt

78
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:42,370
within Muslim communities,
it means addressing these issues.

79
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,840
And yet they grant to themselves the
right to challenge the Bible belt within

80
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,660
America. And yet, if we were
to challenge what I call the,

81
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,890
an belt in Europe were suddenly
called bigots. Um, you know,

82
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,630
and Islamophobes is this,

83
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,400
is this static has been moving,
has it been adjusting and changing?

84
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:05,140
Is there any sort of a recognition that
there's an issue with this? So you know,

85
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:09,360
the emergence of Isis really did bring
it to the fore and it really did quiet

86
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,750
and some of the voices,

87
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:15,250
it also did increase the hysteria from
the far left because they began panicking

88
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:17,050
thinking,
actually we're going to lose this debate.

89
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,960
And that's where I noticed their
labeling became even stronger.

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,030
But the emergence of Isis did
wake up a lot of people to,

91
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,910
to the challenges we're facing here
because so many European born and raised

92
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,970
Muslims went over to join isis. And of
course think about it in this sense,

93
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:35,971
the most infamous and notorious execution
sell that I think were erroneously

94
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:40,510
called the jihadi beetles in the
press because actually it really does.

95
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,280
It's an insult to the Beatles,

96
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:45,040
but it was a diminishes the true
horror of these guys. You know,

97
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,300
they call him Jihadi John and,

98
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,540
but the isis execution is basically that
entire cell of the media face of Isis

99
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:54,340
execution cell.
We're all British Muslims.

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,440
And that should tell you something that
we've got the worst terrorist group

101
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,430
educator. I mean, the thing
is a university graduate
like every variable that the,

102
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:05,990
that the far left wants to marshal to
explain this phenomenon like lack of

103
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,920
educational opportunity, lack of economic
opportunity, lack of social integration,

104
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,080
mental illness. Uh, you, you can,

105
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,980
you can find people who had
massive opportunity. I missed that.

106
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,560
You weren't getting, you weren't a
jihadist, but you are an Islamist.

107
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,090
But let me Europe person who,

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,870
that's where I can basically play
in a game he wanted to me, you're,

109
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:26,300
you're like a, he's, he's,
he's, he's somebody who back
to the superman. He can run,

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,720
he can run for political office. He
hasn't been elected yet, but he, you know,

111
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:34,430
he should be, I mean this is the
quarterback of the football team.

112
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,380
Ian. This context is a
candidate for recruitment. Well,

113
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,730
thesis, think of, think of it this way.

114
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,630
We've got the worst terrorist group in
our lifetime. It one can reasonably say,

115
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,270
is Isis, right? The worst terrorist
group, at least in living memory,

116
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,700
is isis and the worst cell,
you know,

117
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,930
it's the execution cell came from a
fully developed for once of a better own

118
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,490
fuss, wild country. And that was
Britain and Mohammed. I'm Waze.

119
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,890
The leader of that execution
sell, graduated from the
University of Westminster,

120
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,050
was given as a young child,

121
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,260
was given political asylum by Britain
because his family were Kuwaiti and they

122
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,380
fled the invasion of
Kuwait by Saddam Hussein,

123
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,120
the country that the west liberated.
And he turned against that country.

124
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,270
So he had every reason to like Britain.
Britain gave my home,

125
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,090
gave him or actually physically
bricks and mortar house,

126
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,190
gave his family on social costs that gave
him social housing. They educated him.

127
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,230
He graduated from university and they
liberated his father's country from an

128
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,010
aggressor.

129
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,450
And this man turned against this country
that helped him and his family and his

130
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:40,070
nation. Was he captured or did he do,
he's dead. One of them has been captured,

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
but uh, he's currently being
held in Turkey. I would,

132
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,780
it would be fascinating to listen to.

133
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,620
His rationale is it was not so that
the other one, I forgot his name,

134
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,350
but he was just interviewing
you don't get a lot out of him.

135
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,310
He was interviewed by female Arab
journalist. You Watch that? No,

136
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,280
that was ever happened there. And so on
and dismissive character. Yeah. Yeah. He,

137
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,600
he, he refused to talk about
much. He said, uh, you know,

138
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,510
these are accurate accusations and
allegations that you're making,

139
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,100
and I will wait to trial. Uh, in the
end, he kind of cut the interview short.

140
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,270
He seemed a little put out that she
was a woman. As I'm looking at you now,

141
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,750
imagine she's the interviewer and,
and,

142
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,120
and she's asking me questions and
I'm looking in this direction in your

143
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,270
direction. He'll literally never
