1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,820
Think about it as those are the people
are taking something away from you.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,000
Think about it as they're giving you an
opportunity to look at what's possible.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,570
If you really dedicate yourself and you
should choose that as a valuable life

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,710
lesson, like, wow,

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,310
look at that guy doing so well or look
at this girl like kicking ass and doing

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,980
all this. How does she accomplish
that? I should write all those things.

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,360
How does she make all these movies?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,840
How did she do all these things like
fuck that. People don't do that.

9
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:25,470
The natural instinct is to look
at someone who's like some crazy,

10
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:30,020
like super competitive person,
like the rock or something like that.

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,820
Like you see the raw, he's in
everything. He's in everything.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,510
You want to shit on him, but
he's such a nice guy. You can't.

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,060
It's a real problem like he could do.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,580
That guy could do terrible
movie after terrible movie.

15
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:45,660
No one cares because he's such a good guy.
He could,

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,800
he could do whatever he wants. He seemed
like a nice guy. He's a very nice guy.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,610
He's and he's the real deal.
That's really what he does. I mean,

18
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:56,580
that guy really does show up in a
fucking hotel room at four o'clock in the

19
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,600
morning, flies across the world and
immediately starts working out. Wow.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,140
He's an animal like a let go.
You want to be inspired.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,600
That guy's worth more money than everyone.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,020
He makes more money than anybody
that's ever made any money in movies.

23
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,570
He's a fucking junk or not.
He's so out of control.

24
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:15,030
Every movie does is a blockbuster.
Meanwhile,

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,060
he still shows up at a place
they got to fucking dig out.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,610
One of them elliptical machines waiting
for him. The guts, weight, weights,

27
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,510
weight and form.

28
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,580
He goes to town to do like 45 minutes
cardio when he fucking lands flying across

29
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:33,690
the world. Lift weights for an hour, like
he just keeps going. He just keeps going.

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,640
He finds a way to not complain, stay
positive and just keep going. I read it.

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,090
I read half of his book and I'm very like,

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,820
that's a lot for you and I remember that
when you have p he was third string and

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,090
playing football in Canada.
He was living up.

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,090
It will share the mattress with the,
with the last guy who,

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,770
who got kicked out of a team, Jesus
fog to be now a superstar. I mean,

36
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:00,690
I don't even know how many
millions he makes a movie,

37
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:04,410
but everybody sees his movies.
He's such a good guy,

38
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:09,411
but he hears be really clear that kind
of genetics like what that guy is that is

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,310
just like we were talking about
with Iceland. That's the same shit.

40
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,690
That's the same shit with the Pacific
islands, man. That's some warrior DNA son.

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,900
That's a giant man.
That's a huge,

42
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,160
super powerful man who
fucking is so driven.

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,680
Like we are lucky.
We are lucky.

44
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,290
That dude is not on the biggest fucking
horse he can find with the biggest

45
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:37,290
battle. Battleaxe. I mean that's
what these people come from, man.

46
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,780
You don't get to be that big if
you don't have like some sort of a,

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,060
a great lineage of warriors behind you.

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,430
You mean this debt so much bigger than
most people because it's Schwarzenegger.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,010
He so big.
But all those guys,

50
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,410
like that guy that plays the
mountain on game of Thrones.

51
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:59,770
Like what in the holy fuck,
that guy's so big.

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,660
You know that that dude came
out of some war, your bloodline,

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,530
some crazy viking blood
line because before guns,

54
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,180
that was what was most important.

55
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,480
So when you see a guy like the rock
or you see it, God, you're like, wow,

56
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:15,160
that guy looks like a conqueror.
Yeah,

57
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:19,690
because that's what he comes from 100%
like he's the lorry warrior that due to

58
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:24,460
place door. What's that dude's name? Chris
Hemsworth isn't worth that. That dude.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,353
Listen

60
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,550
that he's a goddamn specimen or aqua man.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,420
What is this Jamie body comparison
of the rock to the mountain.

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,310
Who is the mountain mountains behind
him? 150 pounds on him. Oh my God. Oh,

63
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:44,140
the mountain from game of Thrones.
Oh, sorry. Holy Shit. Put that again.

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,150
Look how much bigger he is.
That's like,

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,870
that's significant in a
good like six seven inches.

66
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,380
He's so big it guy so big.
I'll tell you the six,

67
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,440
nine or some shit. Six nine.
Dude, that is so crazy.

68
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,940
I weigh more than both of them.
That's not true. Oh Wow. No.

69
00:04:04,941 --> 00:04:09,941
The mountain weighs like 390380603 86
he's six foot nine he weighs 386 pounds.
