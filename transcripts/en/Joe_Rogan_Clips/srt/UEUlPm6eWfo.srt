1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,150
In this politically fire.
Hold on one second. What does,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,990
what are we going after me? Two
people for, for me taking in the back,

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:07,820
grabbing attention,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,280
grabbing your purse or your for you
sucking my Dick for a movie role or for

5
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:14,940
something like that. All those things
really don't exist in my life. Right?

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,620
I have a wife and I have a child.
They don't exist them. Right.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,010
If you want to come at me for sucking
my Dick and night in 2002 we were dope.

8
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:27,180
Both doing blow guide be my guest,
be my guest,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,620
but I want to see footage. I can't be,
I'mZ , I'm Zari and take it and just,

10
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,480
you know what I'm saying?
There's a lot of people out there.

11
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:36,630
They're going to get me to look at this
other guy for years he was known as a

12
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:37,464
heroin addict,

13
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,530
never got a clue of of sexual misconduct
and some chick said she molested when

14
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,150
he was 11 years old and now he's like,
you need that,

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,150
you need that and the chicks on drugs.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,110
She's doing the press conference while
she's on drugs. What's his name? Brother?

17
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,570
The one,
the guy that was in heat that the narrow,

18
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,680
put them in the Rehab himself and then
he married Heidi Fleiss for awhile.

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,070
Who was with Heidi Fleiss from Tom.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,090
That guy's been a junkie for 2000 years.
All of a sudden,

21
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,260
why can't I remember his last more size?

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,200
All of a sudden some girl comes
up when she had 26 kitchen. Yeah,

23
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,890
he molested me on a movie set when
I was 11 that's great and Dandy dog,

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,510
but you can't ruin some of these life now,
but what do you think is happening?

25
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,040
This is my question like why are,
why are people accepting these,

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,130
these situations like the Chris Hardwick
situation or why is everybody instantly

27
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,630
thinking that the guy's guilty? No one
giving him a chimp benefit of doubt.

28
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,010
No court, no justice court. There's
no nothing and in some some cases,

29
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:43,080
like the worst case was garrison Keillor.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,060
Garrison Keillor is the host of the lake.

31
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:49,030
Woebegone chronicles like this
radio show on PBS, I think it is.

32
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:49,864
Is that what it is?

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,630
He apparently hugged the woman and
his hand went down her back. This is,

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,550
this is the depiction.

35
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,450
And he apologized to her and he
sent her an email and she said,

36
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:04,290
don't worry about it. It's no big deal.
It was nothing. And then they continued,

37
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,190
I believe, to correspond and we're
friends again. And then this,

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,970
all the stuff started
happening with out Franken.

39
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:16,320
And then he had this complaint
brought up by this woman.

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,960
She reintroduced it and
said that a long time ago.

41
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:22,920
He put his hand on my back
and they canceled the show
and they took his name off

42
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,520
of it and they did it like really quickly.

43
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,670
And it's one of those things
where you just go, okay, really,

44
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,380
like the guy in one moment in
time touches someone's back.

45
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:38,880
I don't know if it was creepy or not.
Let's assume it was a terrible error.

46
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:43,440
And it was creepy. I don't think it was,
I don't know. I'm not saying I know,

47
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,040
but that's it.
Just touching someone's back.

48
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,880
And that is a hysterical reaction.
That is hysteria.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
That's almost the definition of hysteria.

50
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,830
You're not talking about an evil person
talking about a person who touched

51
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:56,401
someone's back.

52
00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:01,401
Like we gotta be real careful what you
destroy a person's whole life with.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,320
So on the one side you have
the worst case scenario,

54
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,490
which is like a bill Cosby who's
drugging people and raping people.

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,520
So worst case scenario for these powerful
elite type people that are getting

56
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,740
these women into their web and
Proton, we want to help him, right?

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,560
He's another one which
day we're all in on it.

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,380
And everybody knew about it
for you as they knew about,

59
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,790
written into his contract,

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,200
it was a sexual harassment clauses were
in his contract, right? It wasn't that.

61
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,480
It was known for years. They sure
we're correct. We really hot under.

62
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:38,450
That bothers me about Harvey [inaudible],
Harvey, what we got and died every body,

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,080
there's a lot of people that have to be
indicted and this is one of the things

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,490
that mark feeling right now. This
should be, this should be a Rico act.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Wow. This is a Rico act. Agents, managers,

66
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,440
Oprah, Eddie. Cause
everybody knew every body.

67
00:03:55,441 --> 00:04:00,100
But here's the question. How much did
they know? Everybody knew in 2005 right?

68
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,990
Everybody knew Joe Diaz was a cold feet.
That's a different thing though, man.

69
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,860
Stay. Let's pretend, but the
same thing. Okay, but let's
go. Joe Diaz is a coke feet.

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,670
It's 2007 Joe Diaz comes to a party house.

71
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,320
There's two cell phones missing.

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,233
Okay.

73
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,390
Okay. Let me, let me say this though.

74
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,820
Do you think that it's possible that his
behavior was shielded from some of the

75
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:28,821
people that he interacted
with like Hillary Clinton
or Oprah or Bill Clinton or

76
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,960
whoever that was, that they, some high
profile people that he interacted with.

77
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,280
Is it possible that they didn't know?

78
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,530
Is it possible that they just
thought he was a pussy hound? No.

79
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:42,150
Or do you think they all knew he was a
pussy hound and they heard little chitter

80
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:45,840
chatter, but it's okay. It's okay.

81
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,760
They would just let him show
me. That's number one. That's
crazy. Number two, Jamie,

82
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:55,740
you're ready for this? Oh Jesus.
Okay. I see Joe a whatever. Not now,

83
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,720
probably five years ago.

84
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,090
Yeah,

85
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,080
I see Joan and the first thing I
had to go with Joe before you leave,

86
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:06,470
don't forget, I got to tell you the
story. What was that story would be about?

87
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:11,471
About Benson Henderson is choke about
a joke that somebody said the store,

88
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:15,680
no,
I want a place I went to

89
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,920
and some chick took me in the back of
suck my dick on the car and then she stuck

90
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,770
a finger up my ass.
And that's what we talked about.

91
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,720
So if that's what we talked about,

92
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,190
you're going to look me in the fucking
face like a man that you are in,

93
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:35,191
the men that you've been around and
telling me Harvey Weinstein turned to Brad

94
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,980
or his other bodies and listen,

95
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,700
remind me to tell you a story
about that dirty fucking battle

96
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,410
for sure. Okay. That for sure.
But that was that. That's
that, that's been admitted.

97
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,950
I think they've had conversations.
Oh my God. If you don't pick the wig,

98
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,770
Ben Affleck and the other guy,
and I'm not offended though,

99
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,000
but I'm just talking about
boys were boys, right? Yes.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,690
What you won't say to Jamie, you'll say
to me, you go and you watch blind date.

101
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,520
No,
I'm never watches a movie.

102
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,340
Blind blind crackers going off.

103
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,770
And there's a movie named blind date with
Bruce Willis. Oh, I remember that movie.

104
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:17,600
And Kim Bassinger, how Larry
is. Kim Bassinger steals
the show when she walks in,

105
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,100
the Japanese lady, she was like, you know,

106
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:23,450
you're entitled to 50% of your
husband's assets in California.

107
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,100
And the Chinese woman kept saying me,
no, speak English. They'll speak English.

108
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:28,480
And I was like,

109
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,480
you didn't even tell him 50% and she
opens up the the 50% 50% that movie is a

110
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,980
great word, but this is seen
in the opening of that movie.

111
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,600
Both of those actors are around where
the guy comes up to him and he goes,

112
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,440
you're not going to believe what happened
last night. And Bruce Willis goes, hey,

113
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,610
we go one of these fucking sex
stories again. I think it was,

114
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,770
saw him at spa and go,
I was like ham for dinner.

115
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,670
I walk out and some lady pulls
up with a limo and I say,

116
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,800
I've never been in a little
moment. She goes, we'll get in.

117
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:02,801
And we were riding down sunset hard times
in the summer and next thing you know,

118
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,220
she's sucking my Dick.

119
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,110
She's got leotards on eating her ass and
he's telling the story in Bruce Willis

120
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,160
or something. He goes, no, no. Why
does this always happen to you?

121
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,590
This is some other bullshit. He goes,
[inaudible] and it goes in his pocket.

122
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,250
He starts whipping out Polaroids.

123
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,430
That I've always known one of
those guys in my life. Of course,

124
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,620
we've all known one guy in my life.

125
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,280
That was the difference between that guy
and what Harvey, why don't know. Yeah,

126
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,163
I know that.

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,320
But I also believed that Harvey Weinstein
was telling people he probably was,

128
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,580
because listen for everybody who told him.

129
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,470
Was he telling him that he
was holding people down?

130
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,890
What are they usually tell him? What
was he telling? He was raping pieces.

131
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,200
A piece of ass. No, not at all.
Do you think that he did well,

132
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,140
you got anybody to use a piece of ass.
She's a piece of ass.

133
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,830
You've got to see her suck a dick.
She'll do anything. She's an animal.

134
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,410
Well that's what we do as men.
We're braggadocio.

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,560
So do you think it was like a community
of that were actors and actresses?

136
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,550
I think he had four or five guys
that knew what he was doing.

137
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,590
I want you to remember being 27

138
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,260
and having for your boys that would
come back every Monday with a different

139
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,280
story to karate school.
Yeah. I hate harass.

140
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:23,900
I fucked her on fire. Whatever the fuck
it is that you do. He told somebody,

141
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:25,700
somebody knew about all these stories.

142
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,410
So my agents knew somebody because for,

143
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,250
for the hundred of them that said no
and whatever that had to be 25 he was

144
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:38,650
playing the percentages, Joe. Well
after they, in fact they said yes.

145
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,340
They blame that one girl.

146
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:46,750
That one girl that did rounders,
they accused her. Yeah, I heard that.

147
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,460
That played Matt Damon's girlfriend.
She was,

148
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,850
she went from being an
extra and fucking uh,

149
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,430
Donnie Brasco to being a
guest opposite fucking, yeah.

150
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,320
If you want to Donnie Brasco, she's,
what's his name? Sonny black's girlfriend.

151
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,700
You know what I mean? Line.
She hasn't met movie zero,

152
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,190
zero smart move.

153
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,600
And then a year later she's
a fucking guests opposite.

154
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,830
So there's a bunch of them that said yes,

155
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,140
but you fault the girl for doing that
over girl decides to chocolate Harvey

156
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,210
Weinstein on her own freewill
when we come here with a dream.

157
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,480
And there's two ways
to enhance that dream.

158
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,670
Because I always knew that I wasn't good
looking man. I always knew I was fat.

159
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:37,671
Now I was knew I was r rated hard to
listen to what I always knew that I was

160
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:39,660
funny.
So I always worked on being funny.

161
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,330
I didn't think somebody was gonna let me
suck their dick or eat that pussy to be

162
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,380
a star. So that was never in my
mind. But think about people who,

163
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,400
how many people have you met with
sell that. So when this town,

164
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,260
how many people have come
and gone in front of you?

165
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,200
The reason why our friendship is still
intact it because you know I'm a hard

166
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:02,820
worker. You know our, he's a hard
worker. You respect hard work.

167
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,100
How many times have you
pulled me aside and said,

168
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,780
look at this fucking clown and
you're not trying to be judgemental.

169
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,400
You just know that he's pulling
the wool over some of these eyes.

170
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,180
We know who's talking to the talk
and we know who's walking the walk.

171
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,710
We see it on stage, we hear about it.
You don't need Twitter of Facebook.

172
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:23,060
We hear about it. We get to that
club, the club on the rotate.

173
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,390
Joe and Joey was here two weeks ago. He
was falling asleep on stage. You know,

174
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,750
you're his shit, right?
So it's the same day.
