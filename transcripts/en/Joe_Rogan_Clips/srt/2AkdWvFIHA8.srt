1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,160
Like he was in a maximum
security penitentiary.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,710
It's like they're never
getting out of there every day.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,270
Every day you're just dealing
with horrible people in
terrible circumstances and

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:12,030
they know that you get to leave.
They know you get to leave,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,530
but you're living with them most of the
day. He goes, yeah, I'm not a prisoner.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,401
He goes,

7
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:22,401
but my environment is surrounded
by these people is like,

8
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:25,380
that affects you. It's like, I
never thought about it that way.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,400
I always thought the guards have it. Okay.
It's just a job. Whereas the inmates,

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,550
you know well those poor bastards are
stuck in there while you're in there with

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,690
them for eight hours a day.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,260
Most of the time you're not
controlling them most of the time.

13
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,220
You just coexisting.
Okay.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,630
Yeah. Who's behind the bars?
Which, which way is behind? Right?

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,970
Right there in a cell with a
hallway filled with bars. People,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,410
one person on the other side of each bar.
So are they the same exact thing?

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,340
Yeah. And then they're wearing
body armor and fucking,

18
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:57,250
they have clubs and they're
always terrified that a
riot is going to break out.

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,890
You saw Whitey Bulger got killed? He
did. Yeah. When? Yesterday in prison.

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,760
Thanks for them. And like first
day, first day hold that guy.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,720
A guy that hates rats,
killed him.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,730
An Italian guy or like a
gangster guy. Really? Yup.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,050
That guide I read, the guy, uh,

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
is obsessed with hating rats and hating
people that beat women and I guess

25
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:26,170
Whitey killed women. Wow. This
guy, the first chance he got

26
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,960
Whitey Bulger met a violent end
after a lifetime of brutality.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,130
They, they, they tried to pull
his eyes out of his skull. Whoa.

28
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,460
I don't know if they were
successful or not. The thing I read

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,290
didn't make it larger so I could
read that doesn't really say,

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,440
what does it say in a three foot
grave near river, not far from Boston.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,790
Pat McGonigal's body laid,
decaying,

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,490
undisturbed until his remains are found
20 years later. Part of his pelvic bone,

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,720
fractured skull and a decomposed
brain matter or bringing, oh, okay.

34
00:01:55,721 --> 00:02:00,240
This is all the different things
that he's done. Yeah, yeah. No,

35
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,990
he was a horrible fucking killer. What
Virginia dafter it transferred, you know,

36
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:09,390
I used to train a guy that
was one of his fucking mob.

37
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:13,090
Henchman hmm. Guy said to me once, he
goes, if you're going to kill somebody,

38
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,470
how would you kill him? I was like,
with my bare hands. He goes, yeah, I go,

39
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,710
I probably hit him in the
neck. It's like, yeah.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,660
Wow. I was like, okay.
That was the end. See,

41
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,950
it's not scary until you find that
that's the end of the conversation.

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,550
I was um, I was 19 at the time
and I was teaching taekwondo.

43
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,100
Wow. And I was teaching this guy who, um,

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,400
he was friends with a friend of mine who
absolutely worked for Whitey Bulger who

45
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,860
wound up going to jail.

46
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,360
And they told me that this guy used
to whack people. I was like, Oh,

47
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:53,120
Jesus Christ.
And I was teaching him taekwondo.

48
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,500
He was very serious,
like a WHO's very intense.

49
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,220
Um, I was very aware that there
was something different about him.

50
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,130
I goes very aware,
like cute.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,850
He wasn't just a guy that was
learning for exercise or self defense.

52
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,860
Want to take a little class is
learn a little martial arts.

53
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,050
He was going to use it like he was a guy
that was in case he needed to use it.

54
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,910
You know what I'm saying?
Like there's,

55
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:22,570
there's a mindset of someone who just
wants to get better at a martial art and

56
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,510
there's a mindset of someone
who's thinking about, okay,
it's going to come down.

57
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm gonna Fuck Dude,
I'm right there. Okay.

58
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:31,450
And I'm going to get to that guy was
like, when he would practice, there was a,

59
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,150
there was a certain amount of focus and
intensity that he had that was palpable.

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,730
Yeah. Mobsters need to get better at,
uh, at that type of stuff. You ever see,

61
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,620
remember deniros kicks in, Goodfellas,
those just sloppy. That's straight down.

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,300
Just mut. What's this Whitey
Bulger's fate or predict that did it.

63
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,710
He was unrecognizable.
That's it. Go did it. Bam.

64
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,150
Mr Bulges eyes appeared to have
been dislodged from his head,

65
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,750
although it was unclear whether his
attackers gouge them out or they were

66
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:07,630
knocked out because he was
beaten so severely in the attack.

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,970
This information was relayed by senior
law enforcement official who oversees

68
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:16,360
organized crime cases of,
that's what it was.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,970
It was a padlock stuffed inside a sock.
Oh, that's what they beat him with. Yup.

70
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,610
And they also pulled his
eyes out of his head,

71
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,090
at least in part with a padlock
that was stuffed inside of a sock.

72
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,160
At least two inmates were quickly sent
to solitary confinement after Mr Bolger

73
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:37,060
was found according to three employees
of the Federal Bureau of prisons.

74
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,250
Wow. Damn. Yeah. Well,
couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

75
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,340
Whitey Bulger. Do you know he won
the lottery twice? Really? Yup.

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,390
Not really. Yeah. Scam. I mean,
that was, that was how he,

77
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,880
um,
he would show his income,

78
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,870
so someone else would win the lottery
and they would come to him and he would

79
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:04,510
like give them the money and they would
give them a lottery ticket and he'd be

80
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:08,110
like, look, I won the
lottery. That's how I'm rich.

81
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,190
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's dark.

82
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,790
Like they probably would find the
person who won the lottery. You know,

83
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:20,200
they chase Dana white out of town.
Do you know that? No. Yeah. Yeah.

84
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:23,650
They wanted money.
They want payment from Dan White and uh,

85
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,820
Dana White got beaten up
by them so severely that he
had like tonight as in his

86
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:32,650
ears. Fuck yeah. He had a fucking, he
had a jet out of town. He moved to Vegas.

87
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,930
Wow. Yeah. Cause they want her to cut
of the UFC. No, it wasn't the UFC,

88
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,560
it was no UFC back then. He
was like a boxing trainer. Oh,

89
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,140
I forget what he was doing,
whether he's running a gym,

90
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,090
but he had to leave town because of
the mom. That's why he left Boston.

91
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,820
Yeah. It was real, man. I mean
this was all when I was a kid.

92
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,690
I mean I seriously into taekwondo in 1982,

93
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,010
that's when it became like 81 82 that's
when it really became like my whole

94
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:11,030
life. And that's right around the
time where all that shit was going on.

95
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,150
And then when in 1988,

96
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,420
I became friends with a comedian who
was his brother went to jail for being a

97
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:26,990
part of why he bolgers mob. Yeah. Crazy.

98
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,561
Yeah.

99
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:32,180
It was like everybody knew somebody who
was in some way connected to the mob in

100
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:35,960
some way. You know, I just, one
dude, you want to hear a crazy story?

101
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,450
There's one guy, he's dead now I can
talk about them. His name is Richie,

102
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,960
and he went to jail. Um, while I knew him,

103
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:49,850
he was arrested for a murder that
I don't think they ever got him on,

104
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,170
but this person who was
killed wasn't just killed.

105
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,620
They broke every bone in his body with
a hammer and kept injecting him with

106
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:04,820
cocaine to keep him awake.
Yeah.

107
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,980
So he would black out from the pain and
they would inject him with cocaine to

108
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,680
wake them back up again.
And then they would break another bone.

109
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,550
They breaking all of his bones with
a hammer. They cut his hands off,

110
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:21,170
cut his head off, they cut everything
off. And then when they found, you know,

111
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,990
is broken heap of a body,

112
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,140
he was somehow connected to this guy that
I knew sold coke and this guy had gone

113
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,830
to jail. And uh, I knew
him before he went to jail.

114
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,580
He was another guy from taekwondo.
I knew him before he went to jail.

115
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,410
He was one person. He was a young guy.
I was, I think when he went to jail,

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,780
I was 16,
and I think he was 20.

117
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,190
And then when he got out of jail it was,

118
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,590
I was 20 and he was 24.

119
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,930
And he had scars all over his
body where he tried to, uh,

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,690
like s sand off his,
his tattoos.

121
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:04,250
He had tattoos all over his arms and
I don't know what the tattoos were,

122
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:07,160
whether they were racist or whether
he just didn't want him anymore,

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,540
but he had like either acid burns or
scars, like whatever. How were the fuck?

124
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,700
He tried to get the tattoos
off all over his arms.

125
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:19,160
Arms are covered in scars and um,
he wasn't good.

126
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,790
He wasn't like a,
a talented martial artist,

127
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,590
but he was insanely tough,
like insanely aggressive,

128
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,180
insanely tough. And when you sparred
him, you are fighting for your life,

129
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,410
for your life.

130
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,880
He would come at me and
try to fucking kill me.

131
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,620
I mean fucking kill you.

132
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,840
Throwing looping punches with
every fucking ounce of his being.

133
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,960
And I'm moving around and I'm like,
oh, we're fighting to the death here.

134
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,960
We're fighting. This is
not, this is not sparring.

135
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,710
We only sparked a couple of times before
this, but one time he had cornered,

136
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:00,810
he trapped me in a corner and hit me with
a fucking bomb on the top of my head.

137
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,140
Just boom, like as hard as he could.
[inaudible] he was a strong guy.

138
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:07,860
He was quite a bit bigger than me to
Irish guy. I think he was Italian.

139
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,710
Um, and uh, I kicked him in the
head so hard. It broke his cheek,

140
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,940
like his cheek shifted
over. Ah, his, his face.

141
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,990
I wheel kicked him.

142
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,310
So I hit him with my heel and
his face and he dropped down.

143
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,360
He collapsed, went down to is like, Ooh,

144
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:31,860
like went down like face first,
got up on his all fours,

145
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,970
got back up again, wanted to keep
going. I said, oh Yo Richie, I go,

146
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:39,210
you got to look in the mirror. I go,
come look in the mirror. And he's like,

147
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,380
oh fuck. I go, yeah, you can't spar
anymore, dude. He wanted to kill me.

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,460
He wanted to keep going.

149
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,080
He wanted to keep going after I
basically kicked his face in half. Jesus,

150
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,160
I hit him so hard. It wasn't
a sparring session. It was
an, I'm trying to kill you.

151
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:54,420
You're trying to kill me session.

152
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,080
And I remember setting them upset
and I'm upset and I'm up. Boom.

153
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,390
And I hit him with that
thing and he face planted.

154
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,140
Most people would've just went out,
but he was so angry and so mean.

155
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,020
He was trying to get up.
It's fucking scary. That was,

156
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,360
I was the last time I sparred with them,
I'm like, we're not sparring anymore,

157
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,194
dude.
I'm not.

158
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,170
Now I'm fighting to the death with
some guy who I'm kind of friendly with.

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,620
I was friendly with him. Other than that,
like what was you would never guess.

160
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,660
I remember one time we went out,

161
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,890
it was me and him and these two girls
and they were like real weird. Right.

162
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,420
And uh, you know, this one girl was
like, uh, you know, like Richie,

163
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,250
when are we going to get,
get to get that stuff? I go,

164
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:32,130
what stuff you're going to get?
And he's like, uh, and she's like,

165
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,130
he's going to get us some coke or you
don't want any coke. She goes, fuck you.

166
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,010
I was trying to tell her she
doesn't want coke. She's like,

167
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,860
that's why I'm here. That's why I'm
hanging out with this guy. Stupid.

168
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,620
That's so funny.
You know,

169
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,020
it was one of the rare times I've
hung out with them outside of the gym.

170
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,940
He told me the story about how he had a
fight off these guys with a broomstick

171
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,080
in jail and how he's beaten these
guys to death with a broomstick,

172
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,120
which is this horrible story about him
being forced to mop up something in a

173
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:09,930
bathroom and these guys cornered him and
he's just fucking attacking them with

174
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:13,140
this broomstick and about how
you got extra time for that.

175
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,170
I forget what he went to jail for,
I assume was probably drug related.

176
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't remember what it was,

177
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:25,881
but I remember just being so nervous
about being connected to people like that.

178
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:29,880
Like knowing people like that from the
gym because there was people like that.

179
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:34,080
There were always there was wanted to
learn how to fight. So because you knew,

180
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,170
you know, you're teaching martial arts,
you training, there's always those,

181
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:41,230
those guys would always come in
whenever it was kind of spar. Oh,

182
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,430
scary times. There was no pulling
back. There was no like, if it were,

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,030
if you were sparring with some friends,

184
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,830
like I was sparring with like
my friend Lee Roy Rodriguez,

185
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:53,620
who a good friend of mine who was so
fast as lightning is Puerto Rican guys,

186
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,240
bad motherfucker. But we,
he would not hurt me and we
would spar. We would go hard,

187
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,180
but he would hold back from hurting you.
You know,

188
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,510
like you could trust certain
people while you were sparring.

189
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,290
You knew that was just sparring. There
was other people. It was to the death.

190
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,590
It's terrible. Crazy. No, he didn't.

191
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,140
We did it over a fucking thin, uh,
office carpet on top of concrete.

192
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,630
It was just office carpet on top of
concrete. So when people would fall,

193
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,550
head would bounce off the
concrete. Ah, fuck. Yeah.

194
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,470
It was horrible. Good Lord. As the
eighties, Bro, she was different.

195
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,040
No good. Terrible. So
Darryl Baghdad dead man.
