1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,010
Five four, three, two, one. Boom.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,950
It's over. Boys here. We did.
Here's cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,220
Cheers his now. No, remember
November. Here we go.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,430
I remember November. I
like that. First of all,

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,230
who's fucking stupid idea was to do this.
God Damn Fitness Challenge Tommy Buns

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,380
last year we did a nice calm 15 hot yogas.
Yeah,

7
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,570
it was so awful. Not even close.
Not even close to this. No.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,290
This was so much more difficult
and I didn't expect this,
but I like it. I liked,

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,010
I think it's fun to be
competitive with your friends.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,260
It's a fun thing to not fuck around, but
like, like isolating something like this.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,260
Oh, it's a year. You get to see different
sides of people you didn't know existed.

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,850
Oh yeah. Jesus Christ. You
worked out too. You have no idea.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,170
I don't think anyone,

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,730
anyone gets the real perspective
when Joe is focused on something.

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,150
I've never seen anything
like that in my fucking life.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,540
Well I know the funniest because like
everybody's competitive and this brings it

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,070
out. But like the funny thing was like
Bert being like, whatever Joe does,

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,300
I'll do double. Definitely.
He was like, fuck that

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,800
and that and the other
thing I didn't expect ever.

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,980
I thought Ari would just be like,
whatever,

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,380
I'm just going to walk in the East
village. I was worried about him the most.

22
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:27,870
I didn't think you were going to do shit
about him the most from the beginning

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,220
as I know are his brain. Yeah, I'd
be like, Nah, I'm out. Fuck this.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,310
That's what you were saying that though
three days in and you were texting like

25
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,690
this is dumb. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. He says
that this is what he's saying.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,570
He's saying that and he means it
while he says it, but he's also,

27
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm going to fucking kill these guys and
then he gets really serious and I got

28
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:49,800
serious but I was looking for loopholes
in order to trick you guys did not work

29
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:49,980
out.

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,060
So I thought if I get like a bunch of
points like all to join in like seven or

31
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,870
eight days in and then you can be done.
No, that I'd be like, I'd be like,

32
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,730
what the fuck? Like, yeah,
I've been secretly working out,

33
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:03,440
but now I'm too far away so don't try
to catch up. Oh, right, right, right.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,300
Like some psychological
snickery he was doing,

35
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,820
he was saying he should just do your
regular workout and see what your scores

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,830
like a than to control.

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,160
That was a big fan of that one to your
regular fucking weight cause you were

38
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,600
entertaining that for a second. You're
like this in the beginning I was like,

39
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:23,310
this is so stupid. This is junk. But then
I was like, I can't lose. And then uh,

40
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,880
then I thought about it and the other
thing I was thinking was this is what I

41
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,320
was,
this is what my plan was.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,440
My plan was to keep up with you guys for
two weeks and then after two weeks to

43
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:38,630
set aside a lot of time and
about and then lap us. Yeah.

44
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,270
Well now just go psycho. I was
like, I'm just going to go psycho.

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,020
I'm going to put up pace that I don't
think anybody else can keep up with for

46
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,460
like the last two weeks,

47
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,980
the last two weeks I just said I'm
going to put in some 600.5 days.

48
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,980
I put in 1000 point day.
That's that's, that's when I,

49
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,380
that's when I stopped looking at you
for context. I was looking at the,

50
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,680
when we started this month
and I put in my 700 point day,

51
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,200
everyone was a little bit
like, wow, Bert. I, by the way,

52
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,140
I ran almost a marathon that day.
Have no fucking clue.

53
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,440
I was just looking at my goddamn phone
the whole time. Just checking the points.

54
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,440
Always cheap so people don't know
what the points are. It looks plain.

55
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,920
If you get 70% of your max heart rate,
that's three points a minute.

56
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,260
If you get 80% of your max heart rate
or above, that's four points in minutes.

57
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,060
So we all tried to stay in the 80 range
because that's where you get your money,

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,490
right? That's where the work out for
an hour in that range. But you know,

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,530
a hundred a heavy workout.
It gives you 240 points maxed out.

60
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:38,460
We're maxed out. Yeah. That's just gives
you context of what a 600 which was not,

61
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,410
I did a 930 feet and it worked out.
It was over after that topic.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,870
I was in New York. He'd
call him. He's like, dude,

63
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,560
he's just fucking going dragging elk
around. He has it all the whole time.

64
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:54,450
He's dragging us around. That wasn't even
that one. That was, that was the elk.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,490
The hog hunting day was
mostly hiking mountains day.

66
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,930
That was like a 600 point
day. Oh No. That's when, when,

67
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:03,970
when you were there and you were actually
working out in the mountains as well.

68
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,760
Yeah. We thought it was like, I was
like, what the fuck? You're like,

69
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:08,620
if I would've been like, guys,
I'm Mel cutting. This is,

70
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,570
I made the mistake of jokingly
saying, oh, I got him.

71
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:17,110
Joe's on an elk hunting vacation,
and the hunters were like, dude,

72
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:22,060
it's not a fucking vacation. It's
work. And I was like, easy guys. Well,

73
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,910
you've got a backpack on and you could
walk as money as the most I've ever

74
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:28,990
walked. It's 12 miles in a day and
you walking up and down in elevation,

75
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,030
you're going up and down.
Like I,

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,600
I saved it one day because it was so
ridiculous because I had gone up and down.

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,950
I forget it like 130 flights of stairs,
some something fucking crazy.

78
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,790
But you ended up getting your,
what'd you shoot on this hunt?

79
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,640
A thousand pound elk. That was big elk
like relatively quickly, right? Yeah,

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,810
the first day. Thank
God. So then I came back,

81
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,360
I came back,
but the 935 point day,

82
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,830
that was my big deal was a thousand points
because I did 935 in the day and then

83
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:04,831
I did a podcast and then I did a hundred
later on in the day just to stably see

84
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,100
you guys anymore. Yeah, that's what
I was wondering. Like there was like,

85
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,980
I didn't have, I, there was a, it was a
part of, it was time management. I was,

86
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,070
I suffered socially.

87
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,890
The huge part was like who had the
most time to spend in the gym? Yeah,

88
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,870
I was here two Mondays ago,
last Monday and it was,

89
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,720
it was popping out at the comedy store
is going to hang out with everybody,

90
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,300
you know. And then it was like, Nah,

91
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,720
it's 10 o'clock I gotta get a couple
of hours in and then all your walls,

92
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,080
your workouts were so late so fuck you.
I got say that.

93
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,130
Fuck you with you post in your goddamn
workouts in the middle of the night.

94
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,460
It was so deflating.
Go to bed.

95
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,800
I've got a 200 point lead
and the wake up and go,

96
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:47,440
how am I 600 points by
I tried to break spirit.

97
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:50,170
It was fun cause that's the other thing
already went through when he got this

98
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:53,260
tracker and he found out
all the work work arounds.

99
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,380
So he would build up work points in his
tracker and then he Bluetooth it in the

100
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,860
middle of the fucking night.
Oh I also do the workout.

101
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,720
The workout is doing workouts.
I come home from the seller,

102
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:07,310
1:30 AM and then I'd be like lemme change.
And go out there two in the morning.

103
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,470
Oh, you're going active? Yeah.

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,310
I thought you were uploading in
the middle of the night. No. Oh,

105
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,890
you can see the time. The time that
he was actually doing it. Yeah,

106
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,710
it's the freaks we're out.
It was a sweet,

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,290
calm and I thought that because
already was so out of shape.

108
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,240
His heart rate was just skyrocketing.

109
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:28,241
Like Ralphie walking upstairs and then
Ori and I went on a walk on a hike and I

110
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,450
was in the yellow the whole time and Ari
was barely in green and I was like, oh,

111
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,160
he's in you.
He's in really good shape.

112
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,450
And then you did that day with generally
bought that theory really hard.

113
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,830
That hit that hit that
it was just that made,

114
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,770
it was out of shape and
he was saying in a lot,

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,590
I was like barely walking,

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,660
but because he was selling it
so hard and I called him, I go,

117
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,400
how to go on the hike. He's definitely a
better shape to them immediately. Well,

118
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,810
it's a psychological thing.

119
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,140
You don't want to think that a guy who
hasn't been working out at all is in good

120
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:04,190
shape, but I think you pushed yourself
through the first week or two.

121
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,730
Then you got in good shape and then
I kept going. Okay. First of all,

122
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,990
I had fought by plants. Okay.
What was the plan? Okay,

123
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,860
Michelle Wolf offered to give.
Let me just have her wear the thing.

124
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,480
Wow.
From day one.

125
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:20,870
That was definitely the fallback that
was going to happen regardless. Oh yeah.

126
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:24,110
She ran 10 miles a day every day and
when I asked her, I was like, hey,

127
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,110
would you wear this thing for
me if I needed to do? She goes,

128
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,650
I know what you're talking about.
Absolutely. I'll wear it for you.

129
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,310
I will stay in the right zone.
I'll tell no one.

130
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,010
She feels left out because
she thinks she would laugh.

131
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,780
She's what's east probably
none of this is what we do.

132
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,270
Like two long cardio sessions.

133
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,750
I did five and a half hours on an
elliptical after running for an hour.

134
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:54,230
What it, hey, get one of
those crazy days, 935 points.

135
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,690
I ran for an hour and then I stayed in
the elliptical for five and a half hours.

136
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,220
See it go and you check it, but
fucking broken. Got 300 points.

137
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,470
I need to talk and he checked back in.
30 minutes later you're like, oh no.

138
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:07,630
It's still going. It's still
going. Yeah. I just fuck, well,

139
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,570
I wanted to see how far I could go. The
thought was like, when you're tired,

140
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:16,040
how tired are you? Can you take
another step? Okay. Can you take two?

141
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,270
Okay. Can you take three? Can you just
keep going? I bet you can keep going.

142
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,650
Let's see how long I can keep going.

143
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,730
And then you get to this point where
you just just think about breathing.

144
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,460
Just think about greed.
That's why I was thinking about,

145
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,690
I was just thinking about in and out,

146
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,520
so just trying to stay almost
like a meditative state.

147
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:35,630
Trying to stay in the zone and I was
pouring sweat. I set off the fire alarm.

148
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,890
That's what it was. So much
steam. It's set off the fire.

149
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,290
That was like four hours in.

150
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,930
I feel like that's a story most people
don't get to tell about themselves.

151
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:48,680
You know, and it was madness.
This is not how I work out.

152
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,240
I work out for like maybe an hour at most.
I hit the bag,

153
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,170
we'll do some rounds,
I lift a little weights.

154
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,690
I'm not trying to kill
myself like this was,

155
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,900
this was very interesting cause I didn't,
I didn't know what,

156
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,930
how my body would respond to like
a month of psychotic exercise.

157
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
Did you do the thing you got to
do the things where you would,

158
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,160
you'd be like the voice would
say you've got to quit, quit,

159
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,870
take a walk for a little bit,
then go back and do it.

160
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,750
And then if you just go like,
oh I'm at 4.8 miles,

161
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,460
let me just go until five oh yeah.
Or like,

162
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,920
or like I'm almost that
halfway through this hour.

163
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,020
So let me just get to 30
minutes and it'll be downhill.

164
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:25,790
I can stop there if fucked with my
obsessive compulsiveness really bad. Yeah.

165
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,670
Cause I get to the place where I go, all
right, I just want to get to 200 points.

166
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,220
And then I'd be like, Oh shit,
I'm only at 950 calories.

167
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,400
I want to get to a thousand
it's like, Oh, I'm right,

168
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,940
I'm right by two 20 I want to get to do
20 and then it gets to a point where you

169
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,580
get, I believe it's like it's,
you get in the zone when you go,

170
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,220
I'm just going to keep going.
I'm going to, everyone's asleep,

171
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:46,860
I'm going to keep walking.
And Dude,

172
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,240
it got back with me to the point where I,
I mean we'll talk,

173
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,160
we should talk about physical
breakdowns and a little bit,

174
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:55,410
cause I know all of us dealt with
some sort of physical breakdown,

175
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,100
but I was having nightmares that
you guys had fucked with my tracker.

176
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,940
I'm putting it in that I was younger
and lighter so I wasn't earning the,

177
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,100
I'm not even joking.
Oh No.

178
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,640
The night in a panic and
checked my fucking stats.

179
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,530
Somebody got into your Shit and hacked
it and I was like, these migraines goes,

180
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,020
no,
I wouldn't put it past them that yeah,

181
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:18,900
you get that parent or it can I
tell you my other cheat? Uh, okay.

182
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:23,330
I figured out pretty quickly that the
way they do your Max heart rate is um,

183
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,340
your age minus a certain number of
minus your age and then you get it from

184
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,990
there. Then when you actually run
it, it'll move up or down from there.

185
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,770
But right away I was like, oh, okay.

186
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,920
So I entered my age and before I started
I wrote to the Maya Zone people and

187
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:42,780
said, my idiot wife wrote my
age and wrong. I'm actually 74,

188
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,330
uh, morning 44, not 7,444 the other
way. And they're like, all right,

189
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:52,920
we'll change it for you sir. So you put
together at seven year old man profile.

190
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,750
Yeah. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

191
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:00,750
The whole month you are working on is
that a four year old man had done that?

192
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,420
The problem is,
I had already said it as the other thing,

193
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,950
and so it'll say you have to,
then you have to have a brand new thing.

194
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:11,730
It didn't work. Oh, so you stuck in
the front yard. It wouldn't be great.

195
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:15,210
It would have been great to be able just
to walk around casually earning yellow

196
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,360
the whole time, which I could have
gotten. That would have been insane.

197
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,200
That was definitely a good cheat in my
mind that that went wrong. I was like,

198
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:26,550
fuck. I feel like that one would have
disqualified you. Oh, for sure. I can

199
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,530
still do that. I'm still on the fence
with these fucking five hour hikes.

200
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,220
He was taking.
