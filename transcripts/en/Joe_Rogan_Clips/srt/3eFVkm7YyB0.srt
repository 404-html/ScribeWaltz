1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,750
Oh, pigs are the weirdest one because
pigs, like my friend Whitney Cummings,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,590
she adopted a pig. That what?
What did she get that pig?

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,840
I think it was from the fire, right? Yeah.

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,730
And she actually wound up driving it to
Texas. She drove in her car 24 hours.

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,550
She's a fucking maniac
when it comes to animals.

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:23,500
I think her and her fiance drove to Texas
with this fucking pig to drop it off

7
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:27,520
at this pig shelter and damn dude,
when you, she's with that pig.

8
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:32,080
That thing is like a dog.
Might as well be my dog.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,430
Like hanging out

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,180
intelligent animal. Yeah. But

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,610
when they get loose and they're out in
the wild boy, they fucking breathe three,

12
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,810
four times a year.

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,680
They'll have big piles of piglets
and those piglets will destroy,

14
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:50,710
they eat everything in sight there.
Omnivorous devastate. You guys see,

15
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:54,690
so for everything, they're devastating
to plants and ground nesting birds,

16
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:58,200
animals, everything. They eat everything
in front of them. They're pigs.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,840
Yeah. And I hide them. No, I
kind of hide them. I'll pigs.

18
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,100
I think they're an unreasonable,

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,740
but the bigger picture is
I need to be controlled.

20
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:09,610
They can't go out there and just ruin
the, you know, how ecosystem like that.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,670
Well, there's, you're seeing in Texas,

22
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,780
Texas is probably in the United States
is the biggest example of what happens

23
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,380
when,

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,460
or the best example of what happens in
these feral hogs are just completely out

25
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:25,080
of control. They just devastate
these agricultural farms.

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,660
They have these farms and
they're just getting destroyed.

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,621
Yeah.
I mean,

28
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,540
and I told the wog life of a wildlife as
well because I eat frogs and I'll lean

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,330
Lee's it now. Anything that's
on the ground that's edible
though. Eight. Uh, yeah.

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,370
Um, I wrote an article
years ago, it was cold,

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,480
a killer at the pass.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,940
It was a place in Australia and the,

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,390
the property owners like the
ranch has called me up and I said,

34
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:50,280
you need to come out and
shoot some of the foxes.

35
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:53,700
Like they're devastating
our lambs. And, uh,

36
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,060
I end up going out there and when I was
driving in with the forward drive at

37
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,290
night,
if the high beams on,

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,490
I seen this massive big black and white
ball walking between the flock of sheep

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,900
with a lamb in its mouth.

40
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,560
There was this pig and it had got a taste
for meat and it happens all the time.

41
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,940
Like so a big bore,

42
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,810
especially in mature animal will get a
taste for meat in harsh conditions and

43
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,690
they'll just stick to meet after that.
And uh,

44
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:18,690
I ended up catching up with these pig
the next morning and shot it with the bow

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,160
and it actually attacked me.

46
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,580
The first shot wasn't perfect and it
charged me and I ended up like stabbing it

47
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,414
to death.

48
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,110
I was on a slope like this on the mountain
and it was really a battle like that.

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,390
He ended up hooking the bow out of
my hand because when he charged me,

50
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:37,650
I put an Arrow on and shot and just went
down one side and like hit one lung and

51
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:41,370
it just in fear I did this
ball and he was on me. And, um,

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,430
when I was fending them
off with the bow is tasked,

53
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,890
went into the bottom limb or the bow or
the cam or something like that and rip

54
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:51,190
the boat and my hand and I ended up
getting me knife off me and I end up like

55
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,620
stabbing his pig was like trying to
run me over. Oh Shit. How big was it?

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
It was a big boy is like big meeting.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,980
It made eight and ball like this and
like how many pounds? Oh, I fucking big.

58
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,950
That's how many pounds.

59
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,560
Probably not 300 down mountain
boys just get real solid. Yeah,

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,030
probably 200 or something
like that. And uh, anyway,

61
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:16,870
I ended up stabbing this thing to death
and when I end up cutting it open,

62
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,100
it's whole insides. Like
it's whole stomach was like
lambs hawks, like the feet,

63
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,180
the bottom of the feet where they can't
swallow and skulls and just like little

64
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,670
bits of a woolen stuff like that.

65
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,600
He'd just been going around and just
picking these lambs off and killing them.

66
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,930
Yeah. And it's a really known
occurrence in Australia. And how that,

67
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,510
if things get harsh, I would just
go, they'll just, cause they,

68
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,920
they just absolutely ruthless.

69
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:42,640
I would just walk right between the sheep
and just fucking grab a lamb walk off

70
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,980
of it.
It up and Nigga buy anyway.

71
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,240
First thing that morning that I found
was a pig spew and it was like this

72
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:54,100
fucking spew like this and it was the
same as lamb's hawks speaks vomit.

73
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,450
Oh you don't say Spew America?
Yeah.

74
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,980
Do. But I wasn't a thought. It
meant something else to you.

75
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,510
Yeah. Fucking spewing mate.
Yeah, spew, spew it out.

76
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,690
That's what happened at Disney yesterday.
Fucking Walt Disney spewed all over me.

77
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,150
So they just threw up bones just for our
bones and stuff that it couldn't digest

78
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,330
but end up lamb killer at the past

79
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,221
[inaudible] of animal.

80
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:20,620
And there's so ruthlessly efficient
in terms of like how much food.

81
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,450
Yeah. So a deal walk along
and it will pick, you know,

82
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,680
it would just pick the top soft grass
and the grass regrows you know, a pig.

83
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:31,410
We'll go through and eat that grass and
it will turn it over and eat the roots

84
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,370
and everything goes well.

85
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,000
Core just causes a lot of erosion and
then there's no regrowth cause there's no

86
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,740
roots in the ground that greedy
pigs, they greedy pigs. Yeah.

87
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,010
About 'em you don't hit the number one
cause of death on farms. Really? Yeah.

88
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,990
Apparently with a domestic animals,

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,320
people falling into pig pens and
just into them they just devour.

90
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:57,160
And you know when you're dealing with
these giant domestic pigs they get fucking

91
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:59,890
huge, massive yeah. Hundreds of pounds.

92
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,190
Yeah. In like Western New South
Wales when times get tough,

93
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:07,060
which is like seems to be
fucking all the time now. But um,

94
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,520
they'll get so desperate
like you'll shoot a pig,

95
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,490
you're going for it for the farmer
and you just shoot it to me.

96
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,670
Not even really taken any made
often because they like they can,

97
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,840
they are eat meat,

98
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:20,940
their self and their like skin and bones
and disgusting as more of like a coal

99
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,590
mission and you'll come
back in the afternoon.

100
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,850
That pig will be completely skin and
bones cause the other pigs just get in

101
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:31,530
there and just, and you'll hear him,
you'll just hear him just screaming.

102
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,520
It's the most God awful sound there is.

103
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,860
Cannibalize that. Cannibalize. Yeah.

104
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,300
I was in to hone ranch and we were
walking by this really high grass.

105
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,420
The grass is like five foot high and you,

106
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,350
we were only like maybe 10 yards away
from these pigs fighting and I said to

107
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:50,860
Rinella, I said, no, come on man. If
you didn't know that those were pigs,

108
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,740
if I told you there was demons
in that case, you would,

109
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,040
you would completely believe it.

110
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was great.

111
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,450
But it sounded like Lord of the rings.
So like some horrific scene.

112
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,090
No monster movie. Yeah. It sounded
like an aura. It really did.

113
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,370
I mean they're there.

114
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,080
It's just how was that the same animal
as those cute little things that Whitney

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,420
Cummings is totally cause the
one that she had was like, oh,

116
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:25,760
fluffy and sit in her bed Q, loving it
that she taught her how to go outside. Go.

117
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,240
Was it a cake wean pig? No, it was a pig.
I, that was the other thing she told me.

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,250
Apparently those little pigs are not real.
All they are is just underfed.

119
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,190
That's pretty fucking,
that's fucked up.

120
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,950
Like when those people have those little
tiny pig, she's like, that's not real.

121
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,060
They're just, oh it's a baby
pig. Gets a tiny little pig.

122
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,580
It's just going to stay tiny. No, if
you don't feed it, she'll stay tight.
