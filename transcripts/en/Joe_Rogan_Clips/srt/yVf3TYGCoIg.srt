1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,430
Like Edson Barboza but then you know,
it's an instrument.

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:09,990
Edson Barboza you saw once he
realized he was going to survive,

3
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:12,030
like when it was like two
minutes left in third round,

4
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,510
maybe ish site the first round. He's
like, I'm getting, I'm getting fucked up.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,430
Just gonna I'm just going to survive.
Right.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,800
But then when there was called
minutes lots, he's like,
no. And he was like, okay,

7
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm gonna fight again.
I want to make it through this shit.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,790
I might as well if I were
to make it through this,

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,700
I might as well just fight back.
Right.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,680
And so he started fighting back really
hard like the last two minutes. F tried.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,640
He certainly tried,

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,550
but there was a period in the middle
where he like had resigned to just taking

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,940
an asshole. Well, I think he was
just, body was just not responding.

14
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,930
He was getting so fucked up and you
could see the pace that Habib put on them

15
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:41,310
hard first round,

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,240
like halfway into the Round
Barboza is like Jesus Christ.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,840
You see the look in his eyes, get that
thousand yard stare. It's like, Whoa,

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,350
what I signed up for.
This guy's on another level.

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean he really is on another level.

20
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,560
I'm fascinated by him
fighting Tony Ferguson and
apparently they're going to do

21
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,030
that now.
It's sitting happened April.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,540
I don't know if it's going to be for
the interim title or the actual title

23
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,500
within. They're going to strip Connor.
They're in a weird way. Beats Up Tony.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,710
That's just my [inaudible] and I've
underestimated Tony before so I could be

25
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,190
wrong again. I just think, I
think it's the, again, Trump card,

26
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,310
I think Tony is kind of one of those
guys where he's pretty good everywhere is

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,060
pretty damn solid wrestling,
high level Jujitsu. Uh,

28
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,900
but I see Khabib dressing me and
better than Tony's wrestling.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,280
So it's going to end up on the ground.

30
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,870
And I think Tony's going to think he can
submit him because his Jujitsu is very

31
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:31,704
high level.

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,680
But I think it'd be one of things where
it could be just good enough not to get

33
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,130
submitted. And then he's going to land
damage and land damage, inland damage,

34
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,761
inland damage.

35
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,790
And Tony's going to get close to a
submission and close to a submission,

36
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,430
close to a submission
but not quite get it.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,640
And then all this damage is going to
just accumulate and accumulate and

38
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,520
accumulate at. That's kind of how
I see it going. It's fascinating.

39
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,710
And I also think it's
fascinating now that could be,

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,590
but has changed his training
and has a real nutritionist,

41
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,310
had no problem making weight.
Yeah.

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,100
So all the factors that played into him
getting removed from the last time they

43
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,430
were supposed to fight, pulled out
of the car, those kind of overblown.

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,230
He only missed weight one time.
He only missed w wait one time.

45
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,350
But his body shut down when he's making
way for the Michael Johnson fight in a

46
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,690
similar way. But he still did
the Michael Johnson fight. Yeah,

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,770
but it was the same thing happened
during the way and it was a rough way in.

48
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,690
But there's been other guys
who missed weight many times.

49
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:25,340
I mean if we go to a Johnny Hendricks,
Johny Hendricks, Melvin Gallard,

50
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,090
Calvin gasoline, and they missed
it by a long with, so yeah,

51
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,350
I thought the QBE thing kinda overplayed.
He must wait one time.

52
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,010
He had some injuries which
sucked for him. Um, but it was,

53
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:36,590
that was happening for a
world title fight, you know,

54
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:39,920
they were fighting for the interim title
him. He misses, wait. Yeah. I mean,

55
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,050
and so it was one of those
where he probably just like,

56
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,640
it was like okay for him to make it,

57
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:46,880
but be difficult and they just got
just a little bit too big. Actually.

58
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,290
Was it for interim title
when he was supposed to,

59
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,650
I don't think it was the original
time. It was Kevin Lee, right?

60
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,460
That was for the world, Tom. Yeah. Yeah.
Or interim title job that, Oh yeah.

61
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:58,640
The whole, that whole division
is kind of fucked up with Conner.

62
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,120
Not even knowing whether or not he's
fighting it. They're going to strip him,

63
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:04,840
right? Yeah, mostly I think
so. I would imagine, unless
Connor says, fuck it, I'm in,

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,580
I think the best comeback.
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it.

65
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:13,650
I want to keep me belt. I know the best
course of action strip Connor let, let,

66
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,270
could be even Tony fight it out.
And then if Connor wants to go back,

67
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,590
give him a title shot that's going to
happen. Whatever. Well, I think the,

68
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,250
what would be the most lucrative
thing as Connor versus GSA?

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,700
Shut up Joe on a fight. GSP. Oh, you do
the one that I want to be number one.

70
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,780
I don't want to fight Tyron cause we've
been your friends for 20 years. Uh,

71
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,970
I wanna fight GSP that
that's who I want to fight.

72
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:35,740
Do you think that they would set that up?
They would know.

73
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,110
They would try to set up GSP versus Tyron.
Right.

74
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,600
That would be the big super fund.

75
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,460
GSP doesn't want to fight anyone who can
hit hard because he's worried about the

76
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,320
brain damage. So yeah,
I don't hit that hard.

77
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:56,910
Yeah.
