1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,900
Removing it. They're removing all the
stores. When I was there, they were like,

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,140
they were having some sort of a
closeout sale cause they were,

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:10,800
they were getting shut down. I don't know
if that's since been amended or fixed,

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,290
I don't know. But socks died
and when he, when he moved in,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,370
when he moved in, I was like, okay,
this kids fucking pissing me off.

6
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:22,010
He's not picking up his shit.
He'd not not doing his dishes.

7
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:24,830
He eats like mom did all that
for me and I'm like, okay,

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,650
I either could get pissed off and kick
him out, but then I realize I'm like,

9
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:30,140
he doesn't even know. He doesn't even
know. So I'm going to work with them.

10
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:32,300
I'm going to try to treat him like
my little brother and help him.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,450
And he was willing to
like kind of follow along.

12
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,670
And then he started slowly
starting to eat better,

13
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,270
started eat spinach and his back
problems started to go away. And um,

14
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,410
what kind of background? My back would
always hurt. Always inflamed, always.

15
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:50,090
I don't know what it was. I just, I
remember getting it looked at my lower,

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,830
lower back. It was, it
was, it was nothing.

17
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,660
It was literally from eating shitty food.

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,660
It's just all the inflammation from
all the shitty food I was eating.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,240
And I didn't know that at
the time. I remember my mom
took me in there, like, up,

20
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,690
your back's fine, but it's,
it hurts so bad. Always.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,720
I started eating more anti inflammatories
that started making shakes with

22
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:08,210
spinach and almond milk and
blueberries and Chia seeds.

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,930
I started eating healthier and I'd
slowly notice like, oh, I feel better.

24
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:14,180
I started, so I started getting
more into eating healthier.

25
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,910
I remember just recently,
um,

26
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,890
I eat a vegan diet for six months and the
people on Instagram hate me now that I

27
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:23,670
don't eat vegan diet anymore.
Again,

28
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,940
go off Vegan Diet, man. That's
like when you become a Muslim.

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,570
Apostacy seriously. They
want death to you. Yeah.

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,460
Yeah. Because I've been posting pictures.
I posted a picture of, I got this, um,

31
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,570
grassfed beef jerky for him. Whole foods
yesterday. Got Probably 30, 40 messages.

32
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,650
Why aren't you vegan anymore?

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,610
Or just meet like people that they're
mad at me for not eating a Vegan diet

34
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:47,990
anymore. But I, I would say like, I hate
that Vegan diet for six months, but I did,

35
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:51,080
I incorporated eggs and do it. Cause I
just couldn't, I wasn't eating enough.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,910
But I never, I never felt bad. I didn't
feel worse. I just didn't feel great.

37
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,540
Once I started eating good quality
meeting and I felt my energy levels,

38
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,010
I'd wake up, my energy levels were way
higher. I just felt more aggressive.

39
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:08,250
I felt more like manly. Um, so
vegans right now getting angry

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,020
in the contenders, I know you lost
me. The contender series fight.

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,270
He weighed 138 pounds. He was a
Vegan at that time. Sick lease,

42
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,170
dislike skinny.
There's more to that,

43
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:24,260
to them than just the weekend that I
had a concussion, a bad concussion.

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,140
Three weeks out from that fight against
Alfred and licking tender series.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,460
I remember waking up in the middle of
night puking. Um, I couldn't train. Um,

46
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,250
I remember I even woke up with a
little headache going into the fight.

47
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,110
Do you remember? It was from, um,
yeah, I was from sparring. I hit hard,

48
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:43,370
boom. And I remembered, I'm like fuck.
But I knew it was the huge opportunity.

49
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,110
Um, I liked the matchup. I knew I had to
go out there and perform, but yeah, I was,

50
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,580
I weighed in at one 36 and I walked into
the cage at one 38 like I was, it was,

51
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,900
and you can even look, go by. I look,

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,390
go back and look at that video and it
looked just unhealthy, but it all works.

53
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,960
Yeah. I just, I so skinny. I
was like 138 pounds right there,

54
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,200
but I still dropped his ass.
Then two weeks later we went to,

55
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:10,930
to hang out with her buddy, a Scott
Holtzman in the UFC for a UFC Fresno.

56
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,650
And Dr Andy Galpin was with him for
the week and I knew sugar was with me.

57
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,830
He watched what the health,
and that's what turned him Vegan.

58
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,170
So I made sure to ask doctor
handy in front of sugar. I said,

59
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:25,030
how much would Sean benefit from
eating like elk or a grass fed meat?

60
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,270
Twice a week. He's like
fucking hugely, hugely.

61
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,740
And then Sean right
there made the decision,

62
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,780
I'm going to start making
some guys tell him if this,

63
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,640
if he's this smart and he's telling me
that some good quality meats going to

64
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,510
benefit me,

65
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,490
I would be stupid to not
take him up on that and, and,

66
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,130
and do that. So, and I don't
regret, I feel so good.

67
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:46,600
Eat and media and I feel way stronger.

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,030
It's hard when you see those documentary
and also you get a lot of positive

69
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:53,170
reinforcement from other vegans that
are very happy that you're Vegan. Yeah.

70
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,220
They love that you
joined the team and look,

71
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,670
people want to be healthy
and for the most part,

72
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,470
eating vegetables is very healthy.

73
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:03,980
The problem is there's a lot of nutrients
that you're gonna really have to

74
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:07,340
search for if you're just
eating plants and it's,

75
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:11,630
the protein is not as bioavailable.
The amino acids are not as bioavailable.

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,300
It's very hard to get vitamin
B without supplementation.

77
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,530
There's a lot of shit that you're just
not going to get and they like bang for

78
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:22,940
your buck in terms of what the amount of
nutrients that you get in like a small

79
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:25,880
grass fed steak versus
a big plate of Broccoli.

80
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,240
It's just not the same and they don't
want to admit it and a lot of these

81
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:29,661
feelings,
those,

82
00:04:29,661 --> 00:04:33,170
I think those what the health guys I
had the mom when they did Cowspiracy I

83
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:36,830
think they mean well but they are
fucking true believers and they,

84
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,620
they are not trying to put together a
documentary that states all the facts

85
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:46,621
subjectively they're doing
a vegan propaganda film and
on it debunked a shitload

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,200
of the things.

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,970
We had an actual nutritionists
analyze what they were saying,

88
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:56,630
go over the studies and they debunked a
shitload of what they put in that film.

89
00:04:56,631 --> 00:05:00,320
That film is propaganda film and it gets
a lot of people thinking this is the

90
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:04,130
way to go is going to reverse
heart disease and help
your body and but they get

91
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:08,000
so many things wrong deep into
the meat does not cause diabetes.

92
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:11,600
Like this is nonsense like that when
they do these studies with people,

93
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,010
especially like um,

94
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,840
studies that they do on people that
show that people that eat meat more than

95
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:20,270
five times a week have a higher
instances of heart disease.

96
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:23,180
All these different things,
they don't measure what else they eat.

97
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,380
These people that are eating meat all
the time or eating fries and shakes and

98
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:32,381
soda and you're not analyzing someone who
eats sauteed spinach and olive oil and

99
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:38,730
a piece of grass fed beef or bison or
elk or something like that. No, you're,

100
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:41,900
you're getting some assholes eating
Jack in the box. Yeah. Like, yeah,

101
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:43,040
that stuff's terrible for you.

102
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:47,870
It's fucking sugar and refined
carbohydrates and nonsense and trans fats.

103
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,820
Oh, it's those terrible
for you. If there's,

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,450
there's no studies that show that
eating clean like people have eaten for

105
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,840
thousands of years.
I mean literally if me caused cancer,

106
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,430
97% of the planet would have cancer.
That's the,

107
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,740
that's the numbers that eat
meat on a regular basis.

108
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,390
It's like 95 plus percent. Fuck, and
then those people like that are Vegan.

109
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,950
They're like, oh, I'm
going to try a Vegan Diet.

110
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,510
And then they're eating all these veggies,

111
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,340
getting these nutrients that they
didn't get before and they're like,

112
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:17,390
I feel fucking kid off that bullshit diet.
You Stop Eating Jack,

113
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,120
The star Jack in the box
in the middle of the night.

114
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:21,950
Sometimes I do go to us for comfort,

115
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,530
but it's just fast food, shitty
food, processed food, you know?

116
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,850
That's what the problem is. We to like
people like you're saying like ramen.

117
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,530
I like ramen and every now and
then, fuck, it tastes good,

118
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,930
but it's not good for
you. I couldn't eat. Yeah.

119
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,890
It's just like knowing what that what
that what it does your by knowing that you

120
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:44,660
are what you eat, it's high can't, I
can't cheat. I can't do it. If I have no,

121
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:48,260
that's not going to benefit my body. I
can't eat it. It's hard from what you eat,

122
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,210
like 100% and I so simple. You know, it's
such a simple, it's such a simple phrase,

123
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,100
but literally your body is made out of
what you eat and that mouth pleasure

124
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,930
[inaudible] hi damn man.
Ice Cream Sundae,

125
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:03,830
but hot fudge.

126
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,080
But there's so there's
all these healthy you can,

127
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,840
you can replace all of
that with healthy stuff.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,430
I haven't had any Quito ice cream,

129
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:17,780
but I've heard good things and some people
said there are some Stevia sweetened

130
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,620
or Xylitol sweetened Kido ice cream
that doesn't fuck with your body. Nice.

131
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:25,400
That new halo top man has that coconut
sweetened coconut milk and Stevia.

132
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:28,790
That's pretty tasty. Well there's, there's
stuff that you can eat that is good.

133
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:32,030
And of course fruit, you know, eating
healthy fruit. I mean look man,

134
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,080
a nice delicious ripe peach
is about is fucking good.

135
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:40,700
It's any bullshit. Fucking fake
dessert you're going to get anywhere.

136
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,990
We don't appreciate it because we think
of it as being like a healthy choice.

137
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:45,590
So it doesn't,

138
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,270
you don't get that I'm being a naughty
boy reward that you get from having a

139
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,630
banana split or something. Fuck
God. It's just not worth it.

140
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:58,610
It functions might asleep up. It fucks
your blood sugar up. And that's the thing.

141
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,000
It's crazy that most people
don't know. They're like, God,

142
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,790
I just eat and then I'm tired and
then I just get starved again.

143
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,330
They just don't know about those blood
sugar. Fucking, yeah, the insulin spikes.

144
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,490
And I had a regular coke the other day,

145
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,490
like a couple weeks ago for the
first time in years. How come? Oh,

146
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,320
just whatever it was there.
So I haven't had a coke in forever.

147
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,990
Let me have a coke.
And it was, I was like,

148
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,700
it was like drinking syrup this sugary,

149
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,690
it was like felt thick when it was,
when I was chugging it down and it was,

150
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,430
I was like, stomach. No, no.
But I did feel like shit after,

151
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,700
after it was down, I was
like, Whoa, I feel terrible.

152
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,800
But how many people drink those
fucking things every day? Every day.

153
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,690
First 42 at 34 ounces or what are they
doing to us? Pop. It's hard. Yeah.

154
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,900
It's hard cause it's who you're
surrounded with to like, fuck dude.

155
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:50,630
If you're surrounded with everyone, like,
oh come on pussy. Just have a good time.

156
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,161
Enjoy your life.

157
00:08:51,161 --> 00:08:55,680
If you're like pocket and then you're
like exactly like who you you like it's

158
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,040
such a

159
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,530
common thing. You are who you surround
yourself with but people don't,

160
00:08:59,520 --> 00:08:59,911
I don't know.

161
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:04,770
It's like I'm so lucky that when
I was surrounded myself with Tim,

162
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
like he,
he introduced me to eating healthy.

163
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,890
I remember when I was 19 I
moved to the lab every day.

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,010
We have pro practice Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday,

165
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,360
every day I was going to the coffee shop
and reading mind gym books meant not

166
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,420
like all these mental books and we're
doing it the other we were reading

167
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,450
constantly improving each other,
wanting to get better,

168
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,850
wanting to help each
other improve and that's,

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,030
it was so important for me to you are
who you surround yourself with and I see

170
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:34,200
people not surrounded with themselves
with the best people they can be around.

171
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:34,890
And

172
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,750
to trap. Yeah, it's a terrible trap.

173
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,630
And sometimes those people that are not
the best people are really fun to be

174
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:43,470
around the problem. That's a
distraction. It's like what's keeping you

175
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,740
back from wanting to be the very like,

176
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:48,320
I want to be the best
Bantam weight in the world.

177
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,050
Like what's keeping you people back
from wanting to be the best of them and

178
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:54,770
still distractions. People who are fun to
be around alcohol, you know, even women,

179
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:55,604
like certain foods,

180
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,640
like distractions of what's keeping you
back from wanting to be the best you.

181
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,350
So just our brains are crazy.
Our brains are nuts.

182
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,380
Yeah. I mean just, well you got to think
about just what you do for a living.

183
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,640
I mean, just that alone, it's
crazy, right? The desire to
be a professional fighter,

184
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,200
to desire to fucking kick people in the
head and choke them and have them try to

185
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:19,590
do it to you and that this is what excites
you and that this is what's driving

186
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:23,850
you to go to the gym to improve constantly
at, I mean, that alone is crazy,

187
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,451
you know?

188
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:29,040
And then these other people that are
living their lives and drinking too much

189
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:33,690
and smoking too much and eating
shitty foods, and you know, they,

190
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:37,740
that's their path, you know? But their
path is not compatible with your path.

191
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,650
That's the big key. I like that. Okay.
