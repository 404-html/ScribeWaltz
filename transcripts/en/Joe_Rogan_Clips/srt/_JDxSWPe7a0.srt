1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,310
Herod is right near the president's
2017 budget provides 69.4 billion in

3
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:12,250
discretionary funding. Is that,
but that's education. Yes.

4
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:17,010
This is for the education bill 139.7
billion in new mandatory funding for the u

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,190
s department of Education.

6
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:21,910
The budget's supports implementation
of every student succeeds act,

7
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,870
which embraces many of the reforms and
administration along as long supported to

8
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:28,090
improve outcomes for all students.

9
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:32,590
That also makes crucial investments that
build the administration's worked to

10
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:37,591
advance educational equity and excellence
support teachers and school leaders

11
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:42,070
promote college affordability
and completion. These include,

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,390
I think college should be free.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,850
I think we could figure out
how to make college free.

14
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,740
I'm with Bernie Sanders on that.
It's a rare thing.

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,860
I just don't think you should
be in fucking debt up to
your ass hole by the time

16
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:52,420
you get out of school.
I think that's crazy.

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,150
It's a fucked up way to start your
life and people are like, well,

18
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:55,980
you want to make a little bit of,

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,530
it separates the people that really
want it and the people that no bullshit.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,370
Just get stuck in debt and you
can't even get out of that debt.

21
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:07,390
It's not even a regular debt. It's
blood debt. Some weird debt but doesn't,

22
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:12,250
doesn't have a more educated society.
Help everybody. Everybody in the long run.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,670
Sure.
How he'll make more money.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,440
Everybody would make more money,

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,110
but you would have to like make sure
that whoever the fuck is teaching these

26
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:24,994
kids,

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,710
like you'd have to be real stringent with
what you're letting get pushed through

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,360
if you're going to throw
that much money on it.

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,230
There's a lot of shit bag and teachers
out there. We'd have to clean that up.

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,670
You know a lot of people is a lot of
shitbag teachers out there and I didn't

31
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:43,390
want to give him gun. That's the
dumbest shit of all time. I'm like,

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,930
I'm just the dummy shit.
That is the dumbest shit of all time.

33
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,880
Can't you can't expect teachers
to become soldiers. That's crazy.

34
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:51,130
That's not what they do. They're
not, they're not warriors.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,900
They shouldn't be out there.
Have a firefights with
pilled up, you know, formal,

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,960
former high school students.
Yeah, it's fucking insane.

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,660
I don't know what the solution to that is.
Honestly,

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,570
I do not know what the solution is.
You know,

39
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:08,290
the NRA thinks it's having guns
everywhere. The anti second amendment.

40
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:11,090
People think it's getting
all the guns away. Um,

41
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,480
but you're not going to get all the
guns away. The thing about like,

42
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:16,570
people say guns don't kill people.
People kill people. I'm like, no,

43
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,830
people with guns kill people.

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,370
They definitely do hear exactly how much
the government would have to spend to

45
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:25,780
make public college tuition free.
How much do you think it is? Okay,

46
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,890
let me guess. 1 trillion
a year. Wait, wait, wait.

47
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:34,450
You left way less. Yeah. I would
say come on into this article.

48
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,430
Okay. What does it say on
about it, but what is, what
is the website? The Atlantic.

49
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,910
Okay. That's a left leaning
website but it can not ridiculous

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,691
dated.

51
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:48,691
This other article says 62
point $6 billion a mere 62
but there's updates on the

52
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:51,250
bottom of the article that said,

53
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:55,060
that's some readers say that's an
addition to what they already spend.

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,590
So that makes it maybe double,

55
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,190
well, you know, one way they
make it really fucking cheap,

56
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,160
have it available for free online.

57
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,310
Everybody should be able
to get an education online.

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,580
That's what I really firmly believed that
I think they should have courses that

59
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,760
you could just sign up and take
them like a regular college course.

60
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,550
You don't have to be in a physical
location anymore. That's so retro.

61
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,920
That's so unnecessary.

62
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,190
Get in your car and get
the traffic and go to UCLA.

63
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,940
The only thing good about that as you're
in the room with someone like a Jordan

64
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,910
Peterson or some really good professor
that's really inspirational and you're in

65
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,370
there with him and they talked to
you and like you're like, oh, okay.

66
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,920
And you get to like be in
their presence and see like,

67
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,980
oh this guy was probably like my age one
day and he figured all this shit down

68
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,320
and like, oh, maybe
some extra juice to that

69
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,230
to have a bookmark saved.
I think it was Harvard I,

70
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:46,200
it was a long list of us recorded
lectures that were from any class.

71
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:49,150
I think there's probably was a limit
to what they were doing. Right.

72
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,930
Definitely not accessible anymore,
especially for the public,

73
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,110
but it was fully accessible. Anybody
that wanted, that's why I had it saved.

74
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,610
Hmm. I don't know Joe. I mean, let me
think about that. Like I said earlier,

75
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:00,680
like all these formulas
fit into different things.

76
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,670
You say that and it's like you can be at
home while you're looking at them on a

77
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:09,671
screen and I'm learning versus being
in the same room and it's like,

78
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,060
yeah.

79
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,230
But like you could also go to a strip
club and watch strippers dance or he could

80
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:18,800
be at home watching some porn and
when you're at home watching him,

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,200
you're going to pull it out,
rip one. Hmm. You know? Right.

82
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,230
So you're saying, let's say it's
like if you're at home station home,

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,073
you just going to beat off.

84
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,020
That's, that's a real problem. You know?
Uh, Louis C K was saying once the, uh,

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,240
he has a computer that he writes on,

86
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:41,630
it's not connected to the Internet
because you just can't get distracted.

87
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,600
Forced himself to,
I think that's what I'm saying.

88
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,520
The problem is the
distraction with having,

89
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,820
having access to everything
right there. That's true. Um,

90
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,320
when you opened the window with the
teacher, that's, that's, that's the part.

91
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,680
It's discipline, it's discipline. And
that, that goes back to what I believe.

92
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:00,740
That ties back into what I was saying
before about all this entertainment out

93
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:04,370
there. Everybody, everybody's,
it is always like scratching
at you like, hey day,

94
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,500
pay attention to me.
Give me something to do.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,130
[inaudible].
