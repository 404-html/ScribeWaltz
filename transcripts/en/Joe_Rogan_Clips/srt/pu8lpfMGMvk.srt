1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,540
Would do things in the FBI would let
them get away with it because they were

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:07,890
providing information that was the whole
ball. Exactly right, and he fought.

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:12,250
Two guys died in prison wrongly. By the
way, this guy's not a fucking good guy.

4
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:16,410
I know. He's a marine and decorated marine
in Shit. They make those sacrifices.

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,980
They make those decisions where they're
just going to like help a person who's a

6
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,790
criminal because they're
criminals providing information
that can allow them to

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,590
get more criminal large,
wide.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,380
He was providing all kinds of shit
about the guineas and he sponsored.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,240
That was a great movie too, by the way.
Nice to train a guy who was one of the,

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,790
he's Hitman. Dana White. No, no,
no. Tito. I see like a threatened,

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,600
he had to move out of town. It was a ball.
Joe Wasn't balls. Baltar related. Yes.

12
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,140
It was both elated.
When I was teaching taekwondo,

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,590
I had one of the guys
that was in my class.

14
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:50,130
It was whacking people for what he Bolger.
He was asking me,

15
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,170
if you want to kill somebody with your
bare hands, where would you hit him?

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,040
I was like the neck. I was like 18. I
was like, oh, he goes, correct Joe? Good.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,800
Yeah, I like that. Who was it, Kevin? Uh,
no, no, no. But you know Kevin, you know,

18
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,720
he went away to this, um, now the top kit.
Yeah. All related. All of them together,

19
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,010
you know. Um, this guy was a
different guy. This guy, this
guy was, he went away too.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,250
But I mean, he went away forever.
He was one of those guys.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,010
Like they caught him with blood under
his fingernails and he was working with

22
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,740
white. Yeah. Yeah. Well there's
a lot of guys that were, I mean,

23
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:23,070
it was a big organization when,
when we were kids. I mean,

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,010
everybody knew it was a big org. I mean,
it wasn't a fucking secret. Oh No. Oh,

25
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,870
I know. How did Hannity's attempt
to link Mower to Whitey Bulger?

26
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,850
Hold up this article in the Boston
Globe. So that's not true. What ever.

27
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:38,970
It's the FBI. He wasn't, wasn't
there. It wasn't there then. Oh,

28
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:40,080
he wasn't at the FBI.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,820
Lower serve the US attorney's
office in Boston from 82 to 88,

30
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,080
his chief of the criminal division,

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,080
first assistant us attorney and acting
us attorney for more than a year.

32
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,741
During that time,

33
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:53,220
Bolger ran a sprawling criminal enterprise
and got away with murders because he

34
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:57,540
was a longtime FBI informant who
corrupted his handlers, the FBI.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,490
He corrupted his handlers.
I love it.

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,000
And the FBI and the New Guinea to
know organized crime strike force,

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,740
a prosecutor prosecutorial unit that
worked independently in the US Attorney's

38
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,490
office reportedly, uh, reported
directly to the Justice Department,

39
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:15,300
used Bulger to build cases against the
mafia and give him a pass on its own

40
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,950
crimes.
The FBI is corrupt.

41
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:20,460
Relationship with Bulger was exposed
after he was indicted on federal

42
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,610
racketeering charges in
1995 became a fugitive.

43
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,620
He was captured 16 years later, I
would hear, you know, so, uh, yeah,

44
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,070
it was captured in Santa Monica. And, uh,

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,750
so when did Mueller says did mujer no,

46
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,570
the four minute had been wrongly
convicted and look the other way,

47
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:40,820
there's nothing linking Mueller to that
case. According to several attorneys for,

48
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,660
for the men volumous court records and
a former federal judge who presided over

49
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:48,720
their wrongful imprisonment trial in 2007,

50
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:53,721
the US District Judge Nancy Gertner found
the FBI deliberately withheld evidence

51
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,800
at the foremen were innocent.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,260
The bureau helped cover up
the injustice for deck cheese,

53
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,180
Chrysler fucking hate
reading shit like that.

54
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,430
She ordered the government to pay the
men and their families 101.7 million.

55
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,210
Okay, maybe worth it. How
long did you guys go away for?

56
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,303
Let's be honest,

57
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,680
you're never going to make a hundred
millions chicken scratch too.

58
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,580
All got 100 million. If every one of
them got 100 million. I mean I'm, I'm in.

59
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,530
I mean,
how much time do you have to do?

60
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,440
How many times do you get fucked
where you're in jail? How's it?

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,280
How bad money per load?
Fuck man.

62
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,400
So maybe it was just a rumor
that he was a part of that. Well,

63
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:33,070
like you said though, let's, the
FBI, soon as a story broke shut,

64
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,590
they call the paper and said, listen,
get your facts straight. Well,

65
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,281
how crazy is it?

66
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,420
The FBI covered up the information
and knew those guys were innocent.

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,060
That is dark.
Who went to jail for that?

68
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,060
Did the guys who covered it up
and go to jail? I'm not sure,

69
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,930
but a couple of them died. You can't
died in jail. Two of them died in jail.

70
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,943
Oh,

71
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,230
you know they caught him because his
wife was yelling and shit all the time.

72
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,040
Yeah, she was cocoa. He had
fucking cash on the walls and shit.

73
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,160
I used to sell dope,
meet door to door when I,

74
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,680
before I started comedy and I used
to go to fuck, I went the hell,

75
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:12,130
not one where I was and I would,
I would want the white people look at my,

76
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,010
I'd take out my shit and they go,
that's slapped up.

77
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,030
Break sound like 40 bucks a pop,
get the fuck on.

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,060
And then somebody explained to me, you
know what the hell is like, why he bolts?

79
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,820
Wow. So you were selling
meat in his neighborhood.

80
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,860
Fucking same in East Boston.

81
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:30,430
I knocked at the door a couple of guys
and revere that we'll get like fucking

82
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,500
connected. My buddy l know who
they were and shit later on. Well,

83
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,190
they probably knew
people from meatpacking.

84
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,200
They've probably got it right off
the books of course. And I'm like,

85
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,890
I'm doing my little spiel there
for a boy. Look, you know,

86
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,560
a fucking boiler room operation. Now you
break it down per mail, it comes out,

87
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,170
they're three bucks a week and
they're doing the math in the head.

88
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,610
You could tell they were like bookies,
you know,

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,670
I feel like that's like 40 bucks a pump.
Get the fuck up.

90
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:56,300
My steps wasn't really that much, but it
was, it was ridiculous, you know? But uh,

91
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,550
and I was in Rhode Island, a
banging doors and, and, and uh,

92
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,130
I got the same response and I looked down,
I see in the streets,

93
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,900
the lines of the streets
are red, white, and green.

94
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,950
I was in federal hill and providence
with the mafia stock. Look at that sign.

95
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,330
Look at that article. Look at this
Whitey Bulger, Santa Monica high.

96
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:14,470
That was full of money.
It's still brims with mystery.

97
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,620
He was living in like a normal
apartment. I know. So weird.

98
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,960
He had $822,000 in cash and valuables.
Wow.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,890
Jesus Christ. I liked that
movie. I thought Johnny Depp
was great. And uh, yeah,

100
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:30,700
he was, he was great in it.
Yeah. That's a creepy dude. Yeah.

101
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,720
He was as creepy as they get.

102
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:34,840
It's just amazing how much corruption
was involved in that case. Yes.

103
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
And at which the federal government was
a part of it and they let that monster,

104
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,230
they let them thrive. Yeah. Yeah. So it
makes you wonder about the FBI today.

105
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,710
Well, it should make you wonder, shows
what they're capable of it. That way.

106
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,910
Whenever you're doing that,

107
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:53,020
whenever you're allowing someone to
commit murder and deal drugs to get other

108
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:55,880
people that are committing murder
and dealing drugs, like what?

109
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,200
Because they would just want it.

110
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,460
They just look what happens with
cops in this is very unfortunate.

111
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,450
But this is just,

112
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:06,620
is just what happens when you have a
a game and the game is arrest people.

113
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,890
The game is when, right. You have a
certain amount of calls you have to make,

114
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,400
and if you could make more callers
because you're in bed with a bad guy,

115
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,790
especially if maybe you grow up in that
neighborhood has always been kind of an

116
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,170
accepted part of that neighborhood. Yeah.
That Guy Conley grew up with one. Yeah.

117
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,220
Yeah, yeah. Exactly. It makes a
sneaky little deal. Yeah. It was,

118
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,160
Sam had lawyers. It's all about you
have to have it. It's like sports.

119
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:31,660
You have to have a winning
record. Yeah. You're not going
to succeed. So they, yeah.

120
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,310
You know, play outside the rules. I mean,

121
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,280
that's one of the reasons why cops and
people have such a weird relationship

122
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:40,400
because they're always looking to arrest
people and [inaudible] cops talking to

123
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,670
her like, ah, I don't put me
on your record. I'm on. Yeah.
