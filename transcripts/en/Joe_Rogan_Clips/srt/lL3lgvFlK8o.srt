1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,930
Edwards, what's going on? My friend?
Not much. My man. What's that shirt?

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,490
What does it, a moon, smiley face.
Graffiti and the moon, you know,

3
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:11,900
me and my smiley faces, people would
graffiti the moon. They get up.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,610
That's probably the first thing we're
going to have to worry about these virgin

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:18,990
flights. People leaving some shit
that you could see from Earth,

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,880
you know, pissing everywhere. Dude, so
much to talk about. So much going on.

7
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,040
There's a lot going on in the world of
MMA in the world of Doug Jitsu. Yeah.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,660
Your world, MMA, even boxing. It's a lot
of, a lot of shit going on. A boxing,

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,320
which just like, we're going to get
beyond Deontay wilder on Monday.

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,300
He's going to be in here. Oh yeah.
Yeah. He's uh, he's saying that.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,700
Did you see the video
on his, uh, Instagram?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,350
He shows that it's more than 10
seconds. Yeah, it is. It's fact.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,000
And he plays the clock.

14
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,180
As soon as Tyson fury goes down and
then it's more than 10 seconds before he

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:55,110
gets back up. The only problem with that
is, I mean, it's human error, right?

16
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:58,110
You can't, you can't start
immediately. Right. You know, there's,

17
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:58,890
there's always that little,

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,680
that little space and ties and they're
supposed to be a guy on the sideline

19
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:06,040
though that starts the right. Yeah. Yep.
And then he picks it up with five, four,

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,150
right? Yeah. But the rep problems,

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,020
referees know when they're in the heat
of the battle, the fucking adrenaline,

22
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,410
there's seconds. It's not like they have
a stopwatch in their hand to hit it.

23
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:20,690
Every time a guy goes down,
which, why don't they have Paula?

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,610
It's too much to remember. We were just
talking about the heat of the moment.

25
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,750
Boom. Click too much to remember. I mean,

26
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:32,550
think about all the Shit Tyson fury
as to America. That's all in stake,

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,580
right? If you're, I mean,

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,890
that fight I wanted, of course I'm
rooting for a while there cause I like,

29
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:43,530
I like big knockouts, you
know what I mean? And um,

30
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,710
he looked good in the first two rounds
and then he just looked like he abandoned

31
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,240
the, the game plan and he was just looking
for the knockout after that. Well, he,

32
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:55,410
he's got a problem. The problem is
he can knock anybody the fuck out.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,100
That's a problem.
Anybody except that Guy Tyson theory.

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,200
It seems like you almost knocked him
out like he knocked him out. Yeah,

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
if it wasn't,
I mean he definitely made,

36
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,410
did 10 he was definitely down for 10
but here's the thing, if the referee,

37
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:13,710
instead of saying eight said seven
instead of saying six at five,

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,670
we've gotten up quicker.

39
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,060
I think you probably would have
because he's waiting for eight,

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,790
nine and then he's standing up
cause he's trying to give himself,

41
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,210
he's an old vet. He's trying to give
himself as much recovery time as he can.

42
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,130
I don't know. When I watch,
when I watch him getting up,

43
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,490
I look at that replay and you see his
head like his head comes up like he's

44
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:33,450
trying to get up and he can't and then
he just like stands up like a Zombie.

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,310
I think that's an gypsy shit.
It's scary.

46
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,440
Well I did not expect
him to get up, um, fight

47
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,050
that. So it was while
they were celebrating too.

48
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,800
The thing was like when he
went down, I went, oh shit,

49
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,010
I can't believe he knocked
him out in the 12th like that.

50
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,470
And it was the left hook going down.
That was the craziest. He was boom,

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,700
the right hand, that bang, the left
hook going down. It was so insane.

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,410
And he walked off. It was a walk
off. It was a walk off, knock out.

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,750
He was dancing and he was pointing to
his woman in the audience and she was

54
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:15,130
saying, I love you. And he was like, the
whole thing was to celebrate Tory moment.

55
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:18,520
And then the look on his face when he
realized that Tyson fury had gotten up.

56
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:21,220
Like what? Yeah. You know,
you know what that is?

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,400
Remember I remember the eighties
and nineties, um, the Friday,

58
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,150
the 13th movie when you killed Jason and
then you turn around, it's like, oh shit.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,630
That thrives when a full set up.
That's what that was. How does wild,

60
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:36,250
they're punched so hard as a man who
studied martial arts his whole life.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,130
Like there's some dudes, right?
Don't you think? Yeah. Just,

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,990
they have some free explosive power,
but it's crazy how much he's gay.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,780
He's only 212 pounds.
That's the crazy thing.

64
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:48,880
It's like he's very
small for a heavyweight,

65
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,910
like a lot of these guys to 50 remember
I remember a guy named Mike Tyson.

66
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,430
Oh yeah. He was still like in the two
fifteens right? He was like two 15 yeah.

67
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,810
Yeah. Not much like a truck.
I don't, I don't know how you,

68
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:01,990
I mean I didn't have that kind of power.
My knock outs were from like,

69
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,940
stuff you didn't see and quickness,
but like a guy like Jeremy Stevens,

70
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,930
it's like that, you know, Melvin Guillard
had that kind of pillar. I don't,

71
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,910
how do you develop,
I don't know if you could develop that.

72
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,690
I think that's a natural thing. Yeah.
Rumble Johnson type pounds. Yes. Yes.

73
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,230
I think you can develop that. I don't
think so. I think you can accentuate it.

74
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,200
I think we got to hits hard with
better techniques and get hit harder.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,940
I think it's a bone structure thing.
I mean it's like if you look at uh,

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,410
Deontae he's kind of built like a
gigantic Tommy Hearns. Yeah. You know,

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,680
just widen the shoulders and his back
is just a fucking bundle of like small

78
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,500
soaps.
It's just like those little,

79
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,130
those thick ass ropes that they use
for, for boats, you know what I mean?

80
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:49,630
When they more ships, that's like the
muscles in his back, just, just jack back.

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,630
That's where all the power comes from.
I guess you should let him body shot.

82
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,560
You fuck all that.
Fuck all that dude.

83
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,010
That dude's a scary dude man.
Yeah,

84
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:04,900
he hits harder than anybody I think in
reaching memory. Like his one shot power.

85
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,630
It's ridiculous. What
do you think? I mean I,

86
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,870
Tyson was a better boxer.
Pure boxer too. So,

87
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,570
but like I would love to see like
big power punches. Like I, they,

88
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,830
they need to make a boxing game
where they, where they have all the,

89
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,910
and I'm to guess they might have,
I don't know,

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,580
but they need to have one where they
have like all the power punchers power

91
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:30,930
punch it. I won't have it. Right. Well,
you know what, I feel like that's a,

92
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,770
there was a perfect boxing match because
you haven't Tyson fury, first of all,

93
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:40,150
you have this guy that overcame depression
and suicidal thoughts and you know,

94
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,320
drug addiction and alcoholism
and he was just obesity. Yeah.

95
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,120
He was living in a world of depression.

96
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:51,070
He was just drinking constantly and doing
coke and fucking his life up and then

97
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,100
loses more than a hundred pounds.
Cleans himself up,

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,250
gets in there against the scariest
guy in the heavyweight division.

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,910
It puts on a boxing clinic.
However, he still gets clipped.

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,840
He still gets clipped not once,
but twice hard and dropped hard,

101
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,010
especially in the 12th round.

102
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,550
So it's like for a person
who loves watching fights,

103
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
it's such a perfect fight because
you've got so first of all,

104
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:17,960
they're both great guys.
Like, like both guys.

105
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,970
Like if you're a fan of like
exceptional human beings,

106
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,820
both guys are great guys.
Yeah.

107
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,360
Like the more I see Deontay
wilder interact with his
family, talk about things,

108
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:32,960
talk about the way he approaches fighting,
the more I appreciate what he's doing,

109
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,460
you know?
And then Tyson fury.

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,880
How do you not love the guy and the way
they exchanged like pleasantries after

111
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,030
the fight was over and Tyson was telling
him he loved him and he kissed his

112
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:45,830
fucking fist. I mean, it's like you is a
great all around a great feeling after,

113
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:49,010
even though it was a draw, I was like, I
felt good about it. That was rocky one.

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,460
It was rocky one. That's what that
was. It was rocky wine, right?

115
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,500
It was rocky one sort of. Right. But it
wasn't a slugger. That one, you know?

116
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,020
I mean, what it was was just a great,
nobody won. Nobody won in rough.

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,370
Yeah. Yeah. It was a great,

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,070
great boxing match. That's what it was. It
just like, it had all the good elements.

119
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,070
It was the best heavyweight fight
I've seen in a long time. I mean,

120
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,550
that might have been better than,
than Holyfield Tyson.

121
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,220
That's hard to say because I know
Holyfield was like the good guy coming in

122
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:26,420
against the bad guy. Like there was so
much to that fight and then with Tyson,

123
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,620
like you thought he was invincible and
then Holyfield just eaten his shots and

124
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,800
slowly beaten them down and
then eventually stops them.
