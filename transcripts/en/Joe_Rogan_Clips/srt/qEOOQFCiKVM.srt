1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,800
Her low freak bitches.
I'm supposed to ask you about it.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,240
Johnny Gill who thought he could
beat Oscar de la Hoya. Oh yeah, man.

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:11,580
You know why somebody told me?
Somebody told me.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,980
How did you know about that one man?
I think it was Thompson.

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,120
Gloria told me that that was,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,240
that was one of the days when that's
back when asked. It was still, you know,

7
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:20,520
fighting too.
That's what made me really angry.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,750
They asked who was whipping somebodies
ass and I'm sitting next to a balladeer,

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,990
you know, I respect you.
You get singing on it,

10
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,750
but don't point to know Friday and go,
I could whip him that.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,680
I don't want to hit that man.

12
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:35,610
He really said that vehemently
man jumped up and I even,

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,690
I even the fact that you brought it up,
it ain't like I'm snitching.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,500
I told him, pharisees,
you ask him the same room,

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,350
making sure that ask it
knows that you feel that way.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,320
I want to be there.
I'm making sure he knows that you uh,

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,350
balladeer crooner you could
whip them out. Yeah, man,

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,461
that was up to me.

19
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,380
That was the highest insert and of the
highest level man you make your money,

20
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:04,520
he roses flattening and all that saying
you're going to look at a frightening

21
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:08,610
and talking about how could whip him.
Come on man. He needs to know that.

22
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,110
He needs to know you feel that way.

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,090
I did it with Mike Tyson and rough house
used to talk shit. Oh yeah. My, my,

24
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:18,030
my I do this and that.

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,480
The MAG Bababa about so one day we will
all together and I said you know Mike,

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,410
this dude told me whip your ass man.

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,380
He really,
he tells me all the time,

28
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,970
why don't you tell Mike
what you be telling me?

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,080
Why lashed them turning the Koolaid
Ms Chair, what did he said Mike?

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,710
He didn't say nothing. She didn't
say nothing. That was my whole point.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean you probably encounter before.

32
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:46,730
I've been in the hood up in the barbershop
sometime and I got to tell folks my

33
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,940
name, he's like Yo man, cause man
don't make nothing man. What do you do?

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,740
You work for ups, right? Don't
bring up Max names. Then staff it.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,460
Bring up another truck drivers,

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,920
cause I'll take me out to Gleason's
rate now and pick out any heavyweight,

37
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,670
somebody who you never seen on TV and
he'll make you call them integrators.

38
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,220
Stop it man. You got to
fight it. You don't do what?

39
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:11,730
This guy does respect what he does and
I said him jumping around and we'll have

40
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,610
your truck. I'm trying to beat you on
your routers. It's not going to happen.

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,740
When it happened, man,
Dude's get delusional about
their ability to kick ass.

42
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,940
He really thought he back in the day,
I don't have been. Maybe he's more.

43
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,120
You just think that he felt,
he felt he was more powerful,

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,190
faster, but you never, you never
boxed before as an the jewelry.

45
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,750
I'm talking about being a
man. I was like, what are you

46
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,520
talking about being a man?

47
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,690
That's a dude that doesn't understand
what an eight week campus or like an eight

48
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,640
week trial he was.
He was bumped him.

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,670
I think he was working out with bags and
he had a little cut on and everything.

50
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,510
I was like, you know those muscles
don't translate to a wind. Brenna.

51
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,890
People translate to best in show
at the bodybuilding cancer context.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,980
Not that you're going to win the fight.
And if you look at real fighters,

53
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,040
they don't have the chisel body like
Gi Joe. You know what I'm saying?

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,830
Look at the Anderson Silva.
Look at his body looked normal man.

55
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,310
And look what happens when
those dudes come in with the,

56
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,470
you know the Gi Joe King Classic.

57
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,730
The problem with all that muscle
is it needs fuel. You gotta,

58
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,670
you gotta feed them so you
only good for about 30 seconds,

59
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,730
20 seconds of full fury. When
you're all big like time, the guy,

60
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,470
he can hang on deal. It's
like riding a bull, you know,

61
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,090
but the boat was like real bad endurance.
Then you burn it.

62
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,620
Just ride them to the beware
of themselves, their arms.
They fill up with blood,

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,710
then they can't move. They get
heavy. It's crazy. You Watch,

64
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,570
like there's a guy named Marius,

65
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:53,860
put your Nowicki strong world's strongest
man does those crazy fucking things

66
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,310
where the, you know, they throw the beer
bottles in the air and the cars and shit.

67
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,390
You know that strong man shit.

68
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,010
He's one of the bunch of times and he
just started doing MMA and he gets fucked

69
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:07,220
up by fatty foods. Kay. He's throwing
some with punches and kicks off.

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,510
Tim Silvia beat the fuck out of that boy.
He had that dude purple purple as fuck.

71
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,250
He telling Sylvia was like,
how dare you,

72
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,090
I was a fucking two time heavyweight
champion or more a maybe, I don't know.

73
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:19,871
Either way.

74
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:24,780
It's a fucking world UFC heavyweight
champion and you think that you,

75
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,640
you can pick up a car
so you can kick his ass.

76
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,290
It was like a slow methodical
ass kicking by an overweight guy.

77
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,450
Essentially. We've got what the car's
not moving the cars and that, you know,

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,180
doing techniques. But if they can
get you in those first 15 seconds,

79
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:43,590
you could have a real big fucking problem.
Cause for those gaskets,

80
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,260
those guys get street people
are like, you know, yeah man.

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,020
That guy who could throw a car goes to
the supermarket and you get an argument.

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,910
He could probably throw you across the
meat section. Yeah, get back or something.

83
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:59,260
You are going to be on expecting me across
the meat section but you ain't an MMA

84
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,960
fighter. You know you aint
inboxed you ain't whatever. Any,

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,980
any kind of professional athlete,
whatever professionally is in respected.

86
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,620
Don't disrespect.
Not even thinking straight up.

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,090
Now you got me thinking about fights
and supermarkets. Yeah Dude. Yeah man.

88
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,930
There's no weight classes in supermarkets,
Norway.

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,280
A few years ago this dude
was talking about jumping on.

90
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,290
It was one of them rented
bags and asked him, yeah,

91
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,940
we're the same size physically.
I was like,

92
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,900
you really think you can beat that guy
and say we're the same size. I said, yeah,

93
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:33,000
but I've seen him run over five guys
his size. I never seen you ran over

94
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,840
getting a hard time going up the
steps and you mess with this boy.

95
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,740
You know what I'm saying? You're the same
size, but you don't want the same thing,

96
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,940
man. Yeah. People don't understand a super
athlete understanding until that's why.

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,290
That's why we have the ability
to buck eyes express that,

98
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,010
to express that. When you
get surprised. Oh Shit,

99
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,070
I didn't mean it wasn't
practicing. Exactly. Yeah.

100
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,180
You can't hang out with dudes and talk
shit. Talk Shit about how they'd fight.

101
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:09,290
Mike Tyson guys are useless.
But now I'm telling you,

102
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,240
if you come around me and
talking about who you whip it,

103
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,260
cause a lot of my friends a phrase
and I've seen him in the room,

104
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm going to send him know how you feel.

105
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:23,610
Okay.
