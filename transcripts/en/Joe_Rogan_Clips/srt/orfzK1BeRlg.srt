1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,790
It is,
I mean fucking president after this guy,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,880
like the scrutiny that he's been under
and whether he deserves it or not,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,050
I'm not saying he doesn't,

4
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:10,740
but who the fuck would want that
microscope up your ass? Yeah.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,850
Who would want that?

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,240
I think it's an arrangement just like
him and stormy Daniels that she wanted a

7
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,260
job in the apprenticeship.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,090
What I'm saying is like how will we going
to get another president like they're

9
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:22,590
going to do you know what
the fuck they're gonna,

10
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,160
they're gonna look up Kanye his ass with
a microscope and he's going to go crazy

11
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:29,310
again. He's gonna flip freak out
and go to some insane asylum.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,250
Like he doesn't understand that
he's saying he treated, he was like,

13
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:33,900
does this look like the sunken place?

14
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,780
And it's just like his giant
corridor and his house and it's like,

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,930
I don't know dude. I think you're
like, oh cause from get out.

16
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,000
Cause that everyone's like,
dude, you're in the sunken place.

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,250
How many sinks down to the second place?

18
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,800
But he's like doubling down and he's like,
does this look like the sunken place?

19
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:50,460
And I was like showing his baller
house is baller house in hidden hills,

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,760
which is like, have you seen,
what does it mean? Um, Mayweather?

21
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:58,500
Is that the guy's name? Yeah, his lawyer
has a, Instagram is unbelievable. Dude.

22
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,090
He's great. He's all like, he's all like
wearing costumes and shit. He's like,

23
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,250
I'm the joker. And he's like,
dude, it's not even Halloween.

24
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:07,020
What are you doing please?
I'm having fun.

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,880
Just running around. What time? His
life before traumatic brain injury.

26
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:18,180
Not just joking. He doesn't even have
brain injury. It's fascinating about him.

27
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:21,580
He was whipped his ass because he's such
a good domestic. Whoa. Look at that.

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,550
He's such a good defensive.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,230
This is counting as the breadwinner.

30
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:30,750
It says he's just sitting there counting.
Dude.

31
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,660
There's a hilarious photo of him like
sitting in the middle of just this huge

32
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:37,740
empty room and he's just like, I don't
even know his find the Kanye photo.

33
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:41,610
Terracycle dude Kanye. He's a trip.
He really is a trip and he's, he's,

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,410
whether he means to be or not,

35
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,550
he's a master at getting people
to pay attention to him. Whether,

36
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,010
whether this is just because he's so
wacky that everybody's paying attention to

37
00:01:50,011 --> 00:01:55,011
him or whether it's a real calculated
sort of maneuvered to act outrageous and

38
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:58,770
act like he's out of control. But boys,
he fucking good at it. Here it is.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,990
It's like, dude, do you
even have any furniture?

40
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,300
It was like a bench at the end of this.
A weird ass hoe.

41
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:07,830
This look like the sunken place
and he's crying. Laughing.

42
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,140
No, it looks like this.
Looks like a table. Kind of.
Looks like got some chairs.

43
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,530
You don't really have good
style. What the fuck? A whoa.

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,240
He's got a white torso in the
background. Scroll up again. But what,

45
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,780
what does that torso in the back row?
What's that?

46
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,770
Kim's like actually can we just get that
out of here? The waist is too thick.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,820
Yeah. Can, can you give this thing light?
Libo a bigger ass. Give it a bigger ass.

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,003
So straight.

49
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,440
What is long ass open
space with white walls?

50
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,950
Suck it. Does this look
like the sunken place? Wow.

51
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:48,480
Fantastic. Um, babe, we had a rule
not to shore home on social media.

52
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:53,481
So can we now allow K U W K to keeping
up with the Kardashians filming in the

53
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,970
home?
This is so well,

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,420
so they're communicating only
through tweets. Yes. She's like,

55
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:05,800
come home and take care of the kids.
They've been winning now. Fucking genius.

56
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,150
Wow. Poor. But I'm not here blowing minds.

57
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,180
Do you like how Trump is so desperate for
attention that he was like, cool. Kanye,

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,200
Kanye. I was talking about how
I wanted Kanye or not Kanye.

59
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,720
I wanted, uh, to, to meet with Trump,

60
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,710
to see if I could talk him and it
actually fighting Joe Biden. I was like,

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,740
you're a businessman. You want to
make that? I'd be like, you're,

62
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,080
you're the best at everything. You
can be the best at fighting. Hey,

63
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:35,710
we're in a reality star culture. Why not?
Why not? How much I don't, first of all,

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,690
awesome Joe Biden's on death door.

65
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,780
All you have to do is have a stiff jab
and Joe Biden's going down. He's fucked.

66
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,530
You know, he could, Trump really
could win. It's take is just state.

67
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:48,490
Just ramp up the diet pills, choke him
with the hairpiece. Hairpieces fragile.

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:48,970
He can't.
