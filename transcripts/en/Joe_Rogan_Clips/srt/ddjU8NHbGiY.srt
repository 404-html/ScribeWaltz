1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,940
That was a Turd, Megan. Another one? No,

2
00:00:02,941 --> 00:00:05,220
I think it might've been John Wick or
they're going to be doing a third one of

3
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:09,810
course at 200 right on WIC. Yeah.
Yeah. He got killed. I repeat.

4
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,720
He was in was an awesome movie.
I think they changed the name of,

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,750
but I don't think that's what it
was originally called. But you know,

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,200
we have to keep redoing the scene.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,030
He goes back and they ended
up like killing everyone.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,870
What's my anatomy tomorrow? That movie
the day after tomorrow. Oh right.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,660
Wasn't that the name style? Remember
we used to be called kill, die,

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,780
repeat edge of tomorrow. Edge
of tomorrow. That's right.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,140
That movie was fucking bad ass.
That was a reasonably solid,

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,780
really good science fiction movie.
But it was one of the ones that came out.

13
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,020
What year did it come out in?

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,080
14 2014 was just a few years removed
from him being wacky when he did that.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,870
Uh, Matt Lauer interview on the today show
where it was like you being Glib, Matt,

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,590
you're being Glib.
What he's talking about.

17
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,420
Brooke Shields taking psychiatric
medication, and I understand this.

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,160
Scientology is highly critical
of psychiatric meditation.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,020
They prefer you stay crazy. They don't,
they don't know what medication out. Matt,

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,420
have you done the research? I've done the
research. You're Glib, man. You're Glib,

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,830
but Lowery didn't handle it that good
either. Now you're supposed to go.

22
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:19,500
We'll explain to me the mechanism of the
what's happening with the psychiatric

23
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,510
drugs and what do you pose?
Yeah,

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,990
and why do you think that you understand
the biological makeup of all these

25
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,590
different human beings and that none
of them should be taking psychiatric

26
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,424
medication?
Yeah.

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,970
That's a crazy thing to say that you're
smarter than all these biologists and

28
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,290
medical scientists and all these people
that have concocted these SSRI is and

29
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,370
different. Have you done
the research? Have you done,

30
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:42,590
you've done the research or you
Glib or making topcon too right now.

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,740
Did you ever tell you the first time
I did Letterman when Cruz was on it?

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,840
Did I ever tell you that story? No.
I was doing my first letter, man.

33
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:53,210
I'm super nervous and I'm just
trying to tell myself, you know,

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,260
just like any other show, it's just
like any other show, right? Tom Cruise.

35
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:59,960
It's his first time.
He's on the show and like 10 years,

36
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:03,440
15 years and he's on and I'm
watching through the monitoring,

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,620
he's running up and down the uh, he's
running up and down the hallway there,

38
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,770
the theater, like saying hi to people at
during the break. Yeah. He's like, hey.

39
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:15,250
And he's like running up and down and
having the screen time. Like it's just,

40
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,380
it's just another shoulder.
It will, it'll be okay.

41
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,890
And then they bring you down stairs
and you're standing outside this door,

42
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,891
like to go onto the stage and he says
good night during the show and he,

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,420
the door swings open and a very sweaty,

44
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:33,800
Tom cruise is like nose to nose
with me and he's like, you're next.

45
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,920
And he hugs me. He's like,
whew, it's great out there.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,250
And it goes bouncing up the
stairs and I'm like, oh,

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,910
what's going to happen to me out?
This is terrifying.

48
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,150
He totally took all of my coolness
and just chew on a strange guy.

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,360
Yeah, but the energy just, he was like
all an electric eel and I'm just like,

50
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:56,090
it's all right. I can get
through this. Be such a strange,

51
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:00,490
strange guy when he into that,
like I'm laughing.

52
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,870
Thing is just gets weird.

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,210
Well,
it's funny now.

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,000
It wasn't such a high altitude
that it would have to know.
Sure. That guy's death.

55
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:23,834
Three

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,540
standing in the wings right now.
What are you thinking?

57
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,200
Like what am I going to save first?
Yeah, just I think with those things,

58
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,750
those things are such a little
weird sprint. How's my tie?

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,790
How's my tie? Right? What's my
first line? What am I going to say?

60
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,130
Did I go out casual? Yeah. Gets it.
There's a heated interview for Matt Lauer.

61
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,890
Play that. It's right there. I was
coming up next. Here it is. Here's Matt.

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,050
Matt had a full head of hair
back then. Yeah, we'll get back.

63
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:55,070
He's got all that hair in 2014 I'm
looking at my handsome bastard.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,680
It was radio play was my first exposure
to this story. Just an alien movie.

65
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,770
Th th the story breaks down on a lot of
different levels and in one each other

66
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:07,940
already. Yeah. Not the best father
in the world. When we are working on,

67
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,770
on the story, originally, three years ago,

68
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,770
Steve and I came up with this idea
of making it amount of family.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,270
It's okay. That was a good
movie. Love Dot. Yeah, me too.

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,730
Okay. You go ahead and want to
go inside. Of course you'd do it.

71
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,970
That real sense of like, where
are we going to go? Well,

72
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,720
that's what I think it would probably
be like if we did get invaded two,

73
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,840
there'll be robots like that.
Yeah. That'll be cool. Yeah.

74
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,570
Play some of that. Before
I was a scientologist, I
never agreed with psychiatry.

75
00:04:36,571 --> 00:04:38,820
And then when I started studying
the history of psychiatry,

76
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,880
I started realizing more and more
why I didn't agree with psychiatry.

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,510
And as far as the Brooke shields
thing, he's, look, yeah, I understand.

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,040
I really care about Brooke Shields.

79
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,430
I was a wonderful and talented woman

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,550
and uh,
I want to see her do well.

81
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,590
And I know that a psychiatry is,

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,620
it's a pseudoscience,
but Tom,

83
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:11,030
if she said that this particular
thing helped her feel better,

84
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,900
whether it was the antidepressant or
going to a counselor or a psychiatrist,

85
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,330
isn't that enough?
You have to understand this.

86
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Here we are today when I talk out
against drugs and psychiatric abuses of

87
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:29,711
electric shocking people against their
will of drugging children with them not

88
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,770
knowing it's good, good, good effects of
these drugs. Do you know what Adderall is?

89
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:37,070
Do you know Redland? Do you know
now that Ritalin is a street drug?

90
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,210
Do you understand that the differences,
and this was not a matter of mathematics,

91
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,630
wasn't addressing your question,
Matt, I'm asking a question.

92
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,350
Abuse of all of these. Now
you see, here's the problem.

93
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,290
You don't know the history of psychiatry.
I do.

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,390
Aren't there examples in my book,

95
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,840
shields being an example of someone
who benefited from one of those drugs?

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,100
All it does is mask the problem, Matt,
and if you understand the history of it,

97
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:05,860
it masks the problem. That's what it
does. He is pretty aggressive. Yeah,

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,720
you're not getting to,
it wasn't being shitty thing.

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,980
He said it's like intense on balance
while he's right about a lot of it.

100
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,220
He's definitely right about Adderall and
Ritalin that some people would abuse it

101
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,160
but abuse.

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,330
Just because someone abuses it
doesn't mean it doesn't have uses.

103
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,430
You know it doesn't,
I don't.

104
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,570
I've met people that are on
Adderall and they say they need it.

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,140
I don't know if they're right.
Yeah.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,490
But the guy who developed Adderall
says that it should be, uh,

107
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,910
for about 4% of the population.

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,840
That's a lot like a four people out of
a hundred and a room full of a hundred

109
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,081
people.

110
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:46,730
Four of them are cranked out and doctors
are cranking it out like 30% patients.

111
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,910
They say, yeah, it's
like super high that he,

112
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,280
the guy who made it said it's
being abused. Well, I'm sure it is.

113
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,070
And Amongst Journal, if you've done the
research, Jo, have you done the research?

114
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,650
Well, I know I understand about
it. I understand. I understand.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,260
But he's right about little kids
and Ritalin and I had a neighbor,

116
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:07,520
they drug their kid up the
fucking Ritalin. It was
weird and wrong with the kid.

117
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,100
He just had energy and the
parents were working all the time.

118
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,070
They just didn't want to deal with
it. Put the kid on Ritalin. Terrible.

119
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,430
They were bad parents. That's terrible.
It was. I was watching it happen.

120
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,760
I was like, whoa. And then
they, they zoned the kid out.

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,740
They got him on some shit
and he was just like,

122
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,270
like a weird little Zombie kid after that.
Oh Man. Say Hi to him. He's like, hi.

123
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,720
Oh my God. It's terrible. It was,
we could have been an artist.

124
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,630
It could have been something great.
Take it away from him.

125
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,020
You put a kid in a classroom and you
make them listen to boring shit all day.

126
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,810
They don't want to do it. You think, well
there's something wrong with this child.
