1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,750
My brother in law had a metal plate put
in his shoulder because his collar bone

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:05,300
was shattered in a motorcycle accident.

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,920
Was going to say it's either like
motorcycles or skiing or like any,

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,460
any anything where you're going
over 30 miles an hour slam.

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,600
That's the only way to
break a collar bomb.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,770
There's no other way to fake collarbone.
Yeah, cause he's, cause he's got it drawn.

7
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:20,370
Get hit by a car or motorcycle crash.
It's like why I'm saying, oh he wiped out.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,300
Wiped out. Dude. I saw a guy get
hit the other day and it made my,

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,410
made my heart hurt for the cake.
Yeah, he got smoked. I watched it.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,320
I watched it happen.
He was key,

11
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,510
was going left her in their
section and a guy ran the yellow,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,170
but he was really running a red, it
was red, you know what I mean? And,

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,040
and he slammed on the brakes and the car
turned a little bit and the bike and he

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,800
tried to like jerk the bike
as hard as he could, but boom.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,140
And it made my heart he was alive, but I
was just like, oh, probably broken. Oh,

16
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:53,160
he was, oh dude, he couldn't, he
didn't move. I mean, fuck yeah.

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,060
Motorcycles are so scary.
The shit out of me, man.

18
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,310
Red Light this morning and the light
turned green and some dude just whizzed in

19
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,250
between me and some guy who
is about to change lanes.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,430
So like I'm in this lane and I'm driving
straight and this guy was about to

21
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,750
change lanes.
This guy went and I went oh inches away.

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,070
I almost saw death.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,120
I also saw a guy get killed and that
happens all day every day in la because

24
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:22,270
they're allowed to cut lanes. But here's
the thing, they assume risk. Yeah. Yup.

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,750
They assume all the worrying,

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,750
that thing where you're cutting lanes
and a guy turns into you and kills you.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,470
It's their fault. It's on you.
Yup. It's crazy. Like in Chicago,

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,760
do you can't split lanes in Illinois.
You're not allowed to, but didn't appeal,

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,350
but there's no helmet law. I
seen that to me is like, man,

30
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,190
this shit's all these fucking
guys on Harleys. Fuck yeah.

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Fucking helmets or feed up on the
the things not wearing a helmet.

32
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,570
I'm not some fun knowing,

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,080
not some faggy did push
the skin a head trauma.

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,040
They should just all be forced to
look at Gary Busey before and after.

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,680
You don't want to wear a fucking element.

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,680
Did him and I know you know he
hit a curb with his skull. Dude.

37
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,410
The fact that he's alive is insane.
Oh, the doctors, doctors this shit.

38
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:10,680
I just smothering him with a pillow.
You're good. We're going to take you out.

39
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,970
Dude. Pulled bastard. I was watching
some thing the other day with him.

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,800
Joe Really recently talking
and I was like, Whoa, it's
right to be here on Rogan.

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,110
Joe fucking love you man.

42
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,130
He's fucking breakable of
having like normal talk.

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,240
It's all like theatrical and
animated because I think years of,

44
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,220
I think years of of acting and stuff
late in his brain and now that he's got

45
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:35,640
kind,
Kinda like he's off the edge.

46
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,540
I think he feels like he has to be
a caricature to like feel normal.

47
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:40,681
You know what I mean?

48
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:45,681
I think he's the way he masks the
serious brain trauma and pain,

49
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,110
whatever pain is really going on.
I think that's it. Maybe it's fine.

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,050
Maybe a meet him and he's
like, Hey, I'm playing it up.
This is what I got. He said,

51
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:55,860
what do you mean this is a bit, it's my
thing. He's outside smoking a cigarette.

52
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,920
He goes, what are you guys talking
about? It's a fucking bit chill.

53
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,000
It's just me doing fucking try and
make a living. Just making money, man.

54
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,220
I'm trying to feel my fucking family
away cause fuck is wrong with you.

55
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,490
So I got one eye is like two
inches higher than the other one.

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,460
That's what he's got now.
It's above his eyebrow.

57
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,280
It's like where eyebrow it should
be. It's like way up here. Well he's,

58
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,690
Oh got caved in. I mean, and it was not
funny to laugh at it, but my God, it just,

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,480
he just looks, when you see
him when he's young, you know,

60
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,440
he's kind of like a normal looking dude
and like, okay look and dude and the,

61
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:27,130
now you're like Jesus Christ
and he's just all squirrely now.

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,720
But if you go back to him and like lethal
weapon, he was a bad motherfucker. Look,

63
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,130
look at his left eye's like down.

64
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,550
It's like shifted. Something's
wrong. Yeah. But when he was young,

65
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,440
like the lethal weapon, like when he
played Mr Joshua. Yeah. Fucking wicked.

66
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:48,040
I was awesome. I go to that one
picture with the two heads scroll.

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,130
Scroll down please.
None of these are Photoshop.

68
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,020
Go to that one picture with the
green lettering. Photoshop. Oh yeah.

69
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,470
Don't go to that. So a lot
of these hearings after
rude, that's just being rude.

70
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,710
Being an ass about the one on the right
hand side with the suit. The suit on

71
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,280
Deloitte below that with a suit. The
actual suit. That's a real photo player.

72
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,500
Just being silly.

73
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,320
Well this was back when helmet laws
didn't exist. Yeah, no helmet law.

74
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,320
You could ride around La with no
helmet if they should all be. I mean,

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,370
even if they're within the law, why
wouldn't you want to mean fuck me? I,

76
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:26,680
I get that. It's probably wait, I don't
listen to all the community is like,

77
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,960
you don't get it. Yeah Bro.
You don't understand. Freedom.

78
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,950
I like my fucking brain Caribou. Me? Yeah.
I like my, I like my brain. Sorry man.

79
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,050
I don't like, you know, but
there's a lot of states,

80
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:38,180
Arizona's and other one you see people
with no hell no helmet law. Yeah,

81
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,220
no helmet. Texas. I think Vegas
he allowed to have in Nevada.

82
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,190
I mean I've seen plenty of guys on bikes
without one, but I can't tell you who,

83
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,100
what cop would pull you over. You know
what I mean? It's kind of like in Vegas.

84
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:51,680
What do they do? The last thing on
their fucking mind are supposed to,

85
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,240
in Vegas you are look up
just Google states without
helmet laws and see how many

86
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,420
there are. Colorado. I know you don't
have to have one. Definitely seen people.

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,970
Wild country man. That's,
they don't give a fuck. Nope.

88
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,920
It's square state square style.

89
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,700
Perfectly Square man in 19
states that require it. Wow.

90
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,290
And three one, there is no motorcycle
helmet. You Slot in three states,

91
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,820
Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire.

92
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:17,170
But says currently 19 states and
DC have laws requiring all writers.

93
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,890
So that's what the all writers,
both 19 states, all riders. Yeah.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,050
But three states have no laws. Yeah,
yeah, Illinois. But what, but some states,

95
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,070
wait a minute, it's only three
states where you can wear no helmet.

96
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,830
What of those states? Illinois, Iowa and
New Hampshire. But in Chicago or Colorado,

97
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,190
maybe it's, maybe it's maybe the
law. It's new. Yeah. Wait a minute.

98
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,210
Is it just Google helmet laws in Colorado?
Motorcycle.

99
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,750
I've seen people ride motorcycles
in Colorado with no helmet.

100
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,920
The helmets are proven to save
lives and Colorado. However,

101
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,020
if the motorcycle operator passengers
are under 18 they must wear a helmet.

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,020
Passengers, yeah, that same passenger law,

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,720
but that's under 18 under 18 if they're
over 18 they can do whatever the fuck

104
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,610
they want. Is that what it says? What
it says. So there isn't a helmet law.

105
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,740
You just, if you're, if you're 18 or
if you're 16 they have helmet laws.

106
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,410
So what you're saying is three
states have no helmet laws.

107
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,400
That means under 18 over eight doesn't
matter. It doesn't matter. Right.

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,030
But some states have laws, but grown
ass adults can decide to go suicide,

109
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,830
but they won't style. And
yeah, that's where it is. Yeah.

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,770
That's fucking crazy weird. The people
that fight for that, they don't,

111
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,110
but that's like saying no seatbelt law.
That's the crazy thing. What do you don't?

112
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,510
You don't want to wear it,
but here's the thing,

113
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,540
like how is it okay to
ride a motorcycle ever?

114
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,800
And I have to have a seatbelt on. Yeah.
Like I'm inside a metal cage. Yes.

115
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,390
Motherfuckers that 3,500 pound cake,
a steering wheel,

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,350
and this motherfuckers just got
handlebars. He'd go fly him ad.

117
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,280
I'll get that shit. I don't know why you
wouldn't want to fucking wear helmet.

118
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,310
There's no, there's nothing to hold
you on. You're fucked. You get clipped.

119
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:01,700
You're done.
