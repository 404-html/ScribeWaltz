1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,400
What can they do to stop it? Well,
the game, the game strategy's clear,

2
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:10,140
they've deployed it before,
right? So, um, you know,
they'll, they'll say things like,

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:13,720
this is welfare for politicians.
Um,

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,320
this is just corrupting free speech.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,270
You don't believe in the first amendment
if you don't believe that, you know,

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,320
the Koch brothers are,

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,280
the sources have the right to spend
unlimited amounts of money and political

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,810
speech.
Um,

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,140
and so I think the way around that
fight is to agree free speech is the

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:35,640
fundamental value.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,010
And nothing of the reforms I support would
like try to restrict people's ability

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,330
to speak. What we're talking about
is congressman raising money.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,300
We're not talking about individual
speaking in the marketplace.

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,010
So you have a very loud voice.
Joe,

15
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:55,011
your voice is heard by millions and
nothing in our constitution should permit

16
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:58,140
the government to be able
to suppress you at all.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,780
So long as you're within the
bounds of decency or at least, uh,

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,550
not decency because that's not
a bound boundary. This thought,

19
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,760
guess obeys often, but, but at
least if you're not, you know,

20
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:13,150
spreading false rumors and causing
great harm. But the point is, um,

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,650
even though this free speech
needs to be protected,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
we still should be able to focus on
the influence the economy of influence

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,920
congressmen live under when they spend
30 to 70% of the time sucking up to the

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,820
lesters to fund their campaigns.

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,260
That should be a focus of regulation
without the first amendment getting in the

26
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,350
way because we want to Congress filled
with people who care about what their

27
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,050
voters want,
not what their funders want.

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,480
The framers didn't create a constitution
to replicate an aristocracy.

29
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,350
They were fighting and aristocracy.
They had a system where there was a house,

30
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:53,400
the House of Lords, the had to ask
the aristocracy, what do you want?

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,850
And everything could be blocked if
the aristocracy didn't like it. Well,

32
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:01,110
we've replicated that system more
efficiently in America than they had there

33
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,710
because we have a system where both the
House of Representatives and the Senate

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,980
is filled with people who are
obsessed with a single question,

35
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,440
what to my funders want?

36
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,010
And if they can't answer that question
in a way that supports the legislation

37
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,740
and they're not going to support the
legislation or if it's important for them

38
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,140
to block legislation,
they will block legislation.

39
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,970
And that's the dynamic of Washington right
now. Um, uh, Francis Fukuyama describes,

40
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,680
uh, our government has a
veto ocracy veto ocracy.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,270
And what he means by that is that
there's so many places we're influenced.

42
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:39,790
Powerful influence can block the ability
of the government to do something.

43
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:43,440
Did it just can't do anything
anymore. And that's, I think,

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,800
the consequence of allowing
this corruption of money
to be so deeply woven into

45
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:53,190
our political system. Is
it possible to fix? Yeah,

46
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,930
it is possible effects because
you know, for, for example,

47
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:02,931
HR one plus Roca Han is bill
all perfectly constitutional.

48
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,230
You wouldn't have to amend
the constitution to do it.

49
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,550
I think that bill alone would
solve 80% of the problem.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,810
The possibility,

51
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,510
the problem isn't like conceiving
of what changes have to happen.

52
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,210
The question is how do you build
the political movement to get there?

53
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,360
And what that takes is
leaders willing to say,

54
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,100
we have to fix this corrupted
democracy first. And,

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,450
and leaders who stopped,

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480
like pretending that we can get like
a Christmas list of great changes in

57
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,210
government without fixing this
democracy for it. So, you know,

58
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:39,211
Bernie published our last month in the
Washington Post list of the 10 things

59
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,240
that should happen in the first
hundred days in the next democratic

60
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,580
administration.
10 great ideas,

61
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,230
not a single one of those ideas address
the corruption of our political system.

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,460
You know,
it was just,

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,080
it was just a Christmas list of all the
things that the progressives want it.

64
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,460
And you know, I'm a progressive,
I want some of those things.

65
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,360
But the point is which things were the,
you know,

66
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,040
things like a trillion dollar
infrastructure project, single pair,

67
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,450
healthcare free college, um, you know,
all the things that Bernie is pushing,

68
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,480
it has made so sale it and things that
I think it's great that he has made

69
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,320
salient.
I mean,

70
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,890
he's a hero and like making these
issues central to at least the debate.

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,520
But what frustrates me is that
instead of focusing our anger on the

72
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:25,120
billionaires, which he does, we need
to focus more anger on the congressman,

73
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,940
the politicians, which
he does not. I mean,

74
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:30,280
the guy's been in Congress
for almost 30 years now.

75
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,090
And so it might be natural for him not
to notice that the people around him are

76
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:34,930
the problem,

77
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,250
that natural thing.

78
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:41,251
Or do you think that he's possibly aware
of the consequences of stirring up that

79
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,460
Hornets Nest? Because you know, if
anybody has a right to complain,

80
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,720
when the DNC conspired to rig
the primaries against him,

81
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:53,170
he's the number one guy.
He should be screaming from the rooftops.

82
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:56,240
You're dealing with a corrupt system and
this is disgusting. And he'd done it,

83
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,840
didn't do that.
And he didn't do that while he'll,

84
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,420
Hillary Clinton was running
for president and he knew it.

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,120
He knew that he had been
screwed out of the primaries.

86
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,120
He knew they had conspired.
He knew it was all illegal,

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,520
and he kind of just kept his mouth shut.

88
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,750
Yeah. Well, I think, you know,
that was a responsibility.
I think that was a kind of,

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,550
um, um, you know,

90
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,450
I was a person reflecting
on the horrendous outcome
if he took Hillary Clinton

91
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:26,380
down. And so I think he
restrained himself. Um, you
know, not perfectly. I mean,

92
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,110
the fact is after it was clear he
was not going to be the nominee,

93
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,530
he still continued to talk about
the coat corruption round Hillary,

94
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:36,580
which Donald then picked up and
turned it into a weapon against her.

95
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:40,570
But I think he, he recognized, you know,
is every responsible politician does that.

96
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:44,290
You know, it's not just about him,
it's about the future of America.

97
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,350
So when he restrained himself and didn't
want to take the whole system down,

98
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:51,280
then, um, I get that. But
what I'm talking about now,

99
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,150
I'm talking about when you've got the
House of Representatives talking about

100
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:58,010
fundamental reform,
it will be the first they take up.

101
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,580
We at least ought to have a presidential
campaign where candidates are saying,

102
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,420
hell yes.

103
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,230
The first thing we will do is to end the
corruption that makes it impossible for

104
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:10,700
this congress to function and stop
pretending like we can get all these

105
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:14,570
wonderful things given to us by Santa
Claus without fixing this first.

106
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:19,310
You gotta do the hard work of convincing
America that there is a solution

107
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:19,761
because you know,

108
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:23,060
the reality is I think most of America
is where you started this podcast.

109
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:27,290
Most of America thinks it's deeply
corrupted and there's nothing that can be

110
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:31,880
done. They're half right. It is
deeply corrupted, but it's not true.

111
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,670
There's nothing that can be done.
We can do something.

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,290
And in fact I think we can solve
almost uh, you know, 80% of it.

113
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,550
I still think there's constitutional
changes that might be necessary.

114
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,330
And I've been working like how do we get
constitutional changes and talking to

115
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,940
people at PR, my, my podcast,

116
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,420
which of course has about one 1000th
of the one 1000000th of the people

117
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,860
listening to yours does,

118
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:57,470
but as your podcast so people
can listen to it's another way.

119
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,490
So season two is released today,
which is about an article five convention.

120
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,020
But season one was about how to think
about the 2020 election. Um, um, but,

121
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:07,680
you know, I think that, uh,

122
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,060
we might have to have constitutional
change and I have been supporting the

123
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,170
efforts to think about that.

124
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:16,130
But what we've got to do is to give people
a sense that there's something we can

125
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:19,730
do before we amend the constitution.
You know,

126
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:24,731
we did a poll and found 96% of Americans
believe it important to reduce the

127
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:28,280
influence of money in politics.
And 91% didn't think it was possible.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,610
So that's the politics of resignation.
You know,

129
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:35,570
if you'd gone to Egypt under Mubarak
and you'd stop the average person in the

130
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,990
street and said, you know, what do you
think of Mubarak? They would have said,

131
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,990
you know, we hate Mubarak. And they say,
why aren't you doing anything about it?

132
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,540
And they say, because nothing
can be done. Or, you know,

133
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,590
African Americans in 1900 and
America, what do you think
about Jim Crow? You know,

134
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,930
we hate Jim Crow. Why aren't you
doing anything about it? Well,

135
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,490
because there's nothing
to be done about it. Well,

136
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:56,900
that's how Americans think about this
political corruption. They hate it.

137
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,480
They think it's deeply unjust,

138
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,850
inconsistent with what they
thought America was about,

139
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,780
but they don't do anything
about it because they don't
think there's anything to

140
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:06,501
be done about it.

141
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:11,330
And that's where leaders have a role
and what we need our leaders running for

142
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,090
president right down to
begin to explain to people,

143
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:19,091
here's what we could do if only
we built the power to do it.

144
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,430
Recognizing the most
important opposition here.
