1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,250
Be careful and walk
this line between just,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,490
just completely bring them in but not
trying to change them into who you are.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,060
Did the six year old already have
things he was really into or sports or

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,340
activities or, yeah, he was,

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:17,550
well the funny thing has sun is really
athletic and I'm, I'm really not.

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,750
So I know you guys are, but I'm
not. I'm so Nomis and me especially,

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,823
he's an acrobat.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,190
You saw what I was doing yesterday
cause an animal. But uh, but no,

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:33,330
he's really athletic and he's just always
been good with, with all of that stuff.

10
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,820
And it's funny for me because
I wasn't that kid at all,

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,140
but it's great for me cause I'm like,

12
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:40,590
he's able to do this stuff that I
wanted it so badly when I was little.

13
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,190
I sucked at sports and I so want him to
be good at sports and he's really good

14
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:48,060
at it and it makes me, what does he
play? Well, he, I mean whatever he plays,

15
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:49,530
he's just tends to be pretty good at it.

16
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:52,650
So he played flag football for a while
and he's playing lacrosse now and he's

17
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:55,440
played soccer.
Keep him away from Lacrosse and football.

18
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,540
We were just playing it with
Brennan shop the other day.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,710
I had no idea how many people get
knocked the fuck out playing lacrosse.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,980
Really crossing guard island man.
Why Lindt?

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,080
We were saying like there's
a difference between this,

22
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,740
even in football in that they're
striking each other. They're allowed to,

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,680
they're allowed to hit each other with
the stick but they're also striking each

24
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:14,580
other with elbows,

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,750
the running in and they have the stick
in their hand and they're elbowing each

26
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,240
other in the face as the running.
I mean Whoa Shit.

27
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,050
It's a crazy amount of force if they
generate and these kids are getting

28
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,950
flatline touch.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,180
Cause I had Dale Earnhardt Jr
here today on really Nice Guy,

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,910
great guy.
Um,

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,850
suffered 12 concussions over a
period of four years racing. Yes.

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,500
And has like some significant brain
damage because of it that he had to go

33
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:47,640
through a therapy for to help them like
to the point where he was walking and he

34
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,000
had a hold on to things because it's
balancing so fucked up. He couldn't,

35
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,020
couldn't just walk, couldn't get off
the couch and walk to the bathroom.

36
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:57,510
He had a hold on to like a
table and a chair and hit him.

37
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:02,460
Make his way through all of this from
concussions and you know what they're

38
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:05,400
getting in Lacrosse so they're going to
get football. It's all the same shit.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,610
Head trauma. It's head trauma.
Yeah, so I'm a terrible parent.

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,390
My kids go to a very nice school.

41
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,300
It's a great school and we
went to a football game the
other day where the older

42
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,000
kids are playing football
and I'm just sitting there.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,000
All the other parents are having a
good time and I'm like, brain damage,

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,790
brain damage. There's some brain
damage, there's some break. I'm like,

45
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,800
Jesus fucking Christ.
These are kids.

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,050
They're kids running at each of the
full clip, smashing and withdrawn.

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,030
It fall to the ground.

48
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:33,510
They see the kid get up slow and
hope put his hands on the ground,

49
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,900
he's all fucked up. I'm like, this is
crazy. Look, you always felt like people,

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,500
I always felt like lacrosse because my
high school had lacrosse too and I always

51
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,320
felt like it was way crazier ones
cause I didn't know about it.

52
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:45,300
And then I'm at this school
and they have it and I'm like,

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,070
this shit is nuts because they have
stiffness. Yeah. And they're just,

54
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,260
Oh yeah, of course. Yes. If
you're a football player,

55
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,390
you can become some Herschel Walker type
character and become a baller. Yeah,

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,290
that's true. But you got no shot.
If you're a Lacrosse player,

57
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,400
I love when they interview

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,030
like all the guys in the NFL, they're
like, uh, the young guys, they're like,

59
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:04,990
you know,

60
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,980
all this evidence is that your lifespan
is going to be way shorter and it's

61
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:13,981
going to be probably horrific at some
point because of the impact of what you're

62
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,350
going through playing football. You
know, what are you thinking about that?

63
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,500
They're like, Shit's worth it, man. This
is awesome lifestyle. Nobody is like,

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,390
you're getting some guys
that you see retire early,

65
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:30,340
which was unheard of 10 years ago guys,
one guy came out,

66
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:32,020
played his rookie year and retired,
you know,

67
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,450
you're getting guys early retirement.
Um,

68
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,500
some guys play finish out a contractor
up for a big contract and they're out.

69
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,110
Yeah, that's happening. But
there's still, you know,

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,550
there's no shortage of guys who are like,

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,290
I'll take the guarantee whatever my
signing bonuses and take some brain damage

72
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,540
with it.
That's how our brains work.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,680
Our brains are designed to not have
that kind of foresight and you get much

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,540
older. Of course you're like satisfying
me now. I don't know what that is,

75
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,210
but you can tell people, hey,
whatever it is you're doing right now,

76
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,640
this is really going to
cause you a reference

77
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,020
when like today. No.
Well fuck it. You know.

78
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,540
Well that's the same way we deal with
climate change. Literally the same thing.

79
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,070
People with driving around with
cars blowing smoke. I like, yeah,

80
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,670
one day we'll have every fucking fix it.
It's going to be a real proud,

81
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:20,330
like you tell us what can
be a real problem here on
earth and like 300 years and

82
00:04:20,331 --> 00:04:24,560
they were like, that sucks. Whatever,
whatever. I won't be here Bro.

83
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,730
Or even 40 years, sadly. Yeah. It will be
like, all right, there's also the issue,

84
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,670
we get a lot of head trauma. They
get very impulsive and they, um,

85
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,030
they don't make good decisions anyway,
you know? So even if, you know,

86
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,620
even if they could have the foresight,
they would be,

87
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,700
probably wouldn't make good decisions.
They're don't,

88
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,860
they're not thinking rationally. And
they did some study. What was that study?

89
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,740
Jamie? We've referenced
this before where they, um,

90
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,770
they looked at kids that play football
literally from pop Warner all the way

91
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:59,420
through college. And how many
of them have CTE? Really? Oh,

92
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,350
Jesus Christ. It's
stunning. See, I, I always

93
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,080
felt like my,
my point of view on it was always like,

94
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:09,910
I played football fourth
grade through high school,
right. And I always just like,

95
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,600
man, that's why you're so fucked up. I
know, I know. That's what I'm fucking,

96
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,690
but I just feel like, you know, the, like
you have definitely some big, uh, in a,

97
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,170
in an amateur career, you have
some, you can think back. Like, man,

98
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:25,030
I got my bell rung a Bell Rung.
I don't know. I mean probably,

99
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,580
I mean, here's the thing, in fourth
grade and fifth grade you're like,

100
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,730
that doesn't happen really. I
mean, kids are like, you know,

101
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,250
walking up and like wrapping up slowly.
Did you,

102
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,400
you're playing with kids who will
eventually not play football even in sixth

103
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,850
grade. Right. You know,
so it starts to be you,

104
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,810
you might have like a stud on a team in
middle school and still a bunch of guys

105
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,830
who won't play in high school
and then in high school. Yeah,

106
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:52,480
there's definitely some, uh, athletes
that stand out for sure. I mean,

107
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:57,010
those are the kids that are eventually
go on, but you play teams are,

108
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,950
there's weeks where you're just like,
no one is really good on this team,

109
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,060
you know? Um, and you'll have a
game where you'll feel like, yeah,

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
I mean there was a couple,
I've got a couple good hits in,

111
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:11,030
there was nothing really of impact.
And then something will stand out.

112
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,770
Like you'll play a school that has like
an all state are all American player.

113
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,430
You're like, Holy Shit, that
guy fucking fucked me up bad.

114
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,610
And, and you remember it. I
mean, I remember it to this day,

115
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,300
some of those like really
stand out guys and you're like,

116
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,580
that hit stuck with me. But that's once
a year that you play that guy, right?

117
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:36,581
Or that you remember a school that good
and then if you don't go on to play in

118
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:41,090
college really feels like kind of a,
I dunno,

119
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:44,990
a risk assessment where you're like,
I didn't feel like that was, you know,

120
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,040
do I have damage? I don't know. But
I mean, once you get into college,

121
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:54,041
football is where I feel like that's
where you're really playing with really

122
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,430
good athletes.

123
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,680
It's a friend of mine,
a guy in his neighborhood.

124
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:02,681
I'm a kid who was 21 committed suicide
and he was a college player who was about

125
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,130
to go into pull up into the pros.
He was 21 years old really. And um,

126
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,000
the uh, significant CTE,
like just really ravaged.

127
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,010
He every year a player played tackle
football under the age predicted the early

128
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:24,011
onset of cognitive problems by 2.4 years
in behavioral and mood problems by 2.5

129
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,840
years. Yeah, but there's a
study. Wow, this is okay.

130
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,040
Average study found that 211 players
who diagnosed with CTE after death,

131
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,080
who played tackle football before age 12
suffered from cognitive behavioral and

132
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,800
mood symptoms earlier than those players
that didn't start to play till after

133
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:43,160
age 12. Wow. They're saying that, okay.

134
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,530
Study included 246 former players,

135
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,060
211 of whom were diagnosed
with CTE after death.

136
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,470
That's insane. Well, in college there's,

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,590
there's definitely,

138
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,180
there's no such thing as getting around
real high impact hits. That's it.

139
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,300
Those are all people that know
how to play. They're all athletes.

140
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,640
What they're realizing now is that sub
concussive trauma is what's responsible

141
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:09,720
for the majority of brain damage.

142
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,470
What's subconcussive you're not
getting a concussion. Oh yeah,

143
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,820
he just getting rattled.
Yeah.

144
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,720
So getting rattled where it's not even
fucking you up, but over time, over time,

145
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,480
that and multiple hits that are just not,

146
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,050
they're not knocking you out that just
Jocelyn, you, you can always happen a lot.

147
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,840
Yeah. Even get it from getting
hit to the body. Right.

148
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,700
You get hit to the body and your,
your head snaps back and you,

149
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,570
you don't even get hit in the head and
you're like throwing up and your head's

150
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,640
all fucked up and you're trying
to figure out what's going on.

151
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,600
It's because your brain's been mushing
around inside of your head. Yeah.

152
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:42,570
The thing that I remember too,
the thing that stands out is when you,

153
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,930
cause it's such thing as like bracing
for a hit and then feeling it and you're

154
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:50,310
like, fuck, but when you don't see
someone coming, oh yeah. Oh yeah.

155
00:08:50,311 --> 00:08:54,760
It's like a fight punch
coming. Oh yeah. 100% yeah.

156
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,530
Yeah. It's, it's, it's dangerous.
You guys are saving my child's life.

157
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm telling you right now.

158
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,090
He's good because I don't
know that much about Lacrosse.

159
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,370
I had to actually like
Youtube Lacrosse to be like,

160
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:07,650
how did you hold at the video?

161
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,850
Cause there's some videos of some fucking
hits that we were watching the other

162
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,840
day.
And Brendan Played Lacrosse in college.

163
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,950
He played Lacrosse in college
and football, Jesus. And
then he fought in the UFC.

164
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,400
So his brain looks like a walnut.
It's gotta be man. You talked to him,

165
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:25,020
you kind of know. Yeah, it's a,

166
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
it's a crazy fucking sports.

167
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,460
Oh watch these guys just over and
over again. These guys getting Kol,

168
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,250
boom, boom. See that? I mean
they're smashing each other.

169
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,900
The impact is horrific. Oh
fuck it. That boom, this,

170
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:47,550
these are strikes. This is like me
kicking somebody in the head. This is,

171
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,950
this is not much different
than a kick in the head.

172
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,980
You're just playing him with an elbow.
But the amount of force,

173
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,360
so these guys are getting kicked in the
head with these helmets on and if you

174
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:01,350
think the helmets protecting your head,
that shit ain't protecting anything. Boom,

175
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,070
look at that. Boom. All right, look, I
don't know anything about this stuff,

176
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,660
but I've thought for a long time. Hard
helmets. Ooh. Gotta just make it worse,

177
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,560
right?
Well,

178
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:14,640
it makes you more confident that you got
slam your head into somebody and then

179
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,670
you don't realize how bad you're
getting fucked up from that.

180
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,000
You know it's your head.
When you get hit in the head,

181
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,910
even though you have a helmet on,
it's not going to crack your skull.

182
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,130
Your brain still still subsist.
It's hitting you.

183
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,760
You get serious punishment
smashing around in there.

184
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:37,590
You're all the connective tissue.
It's like, oh, it's awful. It's awful.

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,310
Boom. And this is coming from
a guy who's probably seen,

186
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,700
I probably see more people get fucked up
than 99.9% of the people that have ever

187
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:52,200
lived in terms of like being there live
when someone got the fuck beat out of

188
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:52,560
them.

189
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,480
I probably see more people get the fuck
beat out of them than almost anyone

190
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,920
that's ever lived in history.

191
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,470
It's probably a small handful of people
that have seen more. Sure. So yeah.

192
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,810
How many fights have you called?
Hundreds. Thousands, thousands.

193
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,640
It least more than a thousand.
Probably 2000 but then I've seen more,

194
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,181
I mean,

195
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:15,780
I've seen a bunch of live and when I was
competing I saw a bunch of people get

196
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,350
fucked up. I mean, it's
just, I've seen it a lot.

197
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,790
It's just that when you can
avoid that, avoid it. You know,

198
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,730
especially something like Lacrosse, you
can't, can't make a career out of it.

199
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:30,720
Like get out of there
because they actually just
started because right now I'm

200
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:34,200
used to like kids soccer where they're
just running around chasing the ball.

201
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,890
It's cute. It's fun to
watch. And uh, and yeah,

202
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:41,130
my son just got into Lacrosse and we play
catch with the lacrosse stick and it's

203
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,440
great. We have, we have a good
time playing catch with it. But no,

204
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:46,860
I haven't seen him get him about
tennis, man, soccer, even soccer,

205
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:49,140
which you think you know, like
who, who's getting hurt in soccer?

206
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,160
Soccer from heading the ball, just
heading the ball, the ball flying.

207
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,130
You hit it with your head.

208
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,050
Soccer players are suffering from CTE
to the point where they're starting to

209
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,000
minimize the amount of heading
they do in practices. Really? Yes.

210
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,690
This is what we're finding out
about brains like this is, you know,

211
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,650
there's a good friend of mine, Dr.
Mark Gordon, who specializes in CTE.

212
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,260
He deals with a lot of soldiers coming
back and a lot of them that are, um,

213
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,100
like my friend Andrew Marr, where they
would blow open doors, so they'd set up a,

214
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,910
a charge on a door and step
back and the door blow.

215
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,230
These guys mean he didn't
even get hit with anything.

216
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,780
Or maybe I eeds like that are nearby.

217
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:34,050
Those guys suffer significant brain damage
and it's just from the impact of just

218
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,480
getting shook by an explosion,

219
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:39,640
not even anything actually
hitting them in the head.

220
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,710
Which high school sport as the most
concussions? Is it soccer girls,

221
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:45,790
soccer girls soccer,

222
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,140
cheerleading had rates
CD boys football by 2015.

223
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,310
Wow. I know. When you stop
and you look at those, uh,

224
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,180
like when they're going to commercial
on the college game and they throw that

225
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,630
grew up in the air and you're like,
man, to get that right. The documentary,

226
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:05,140
but it's one of the most dangerous
sports show world is his high school

227
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:10,141
cheerleading because these girls fall on
a gym floor and just smack their heads

228
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:12,360
on the floor.
It's crazy.
