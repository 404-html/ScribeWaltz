1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,540
I have the probably the
most minor of brain damages.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,810
Probably the most minor cause I stopped
when I was 21 yeah. What's your number?

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,620
How many times I got hit and I mean like
how many times do you think that you

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,450
like, oh that did damage? Oh,
100% there's a bunch of them.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,400
There's a bunch of them
that I could think back.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,660
Getting rocked and feeling my knees go
like getting punched in and then keeps

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:24,900
barring heaps barring spar,

8
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,570
two more rounds of that guy spar
three rounds with another guy.

9
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:31,380
He's hitting you in the face too. Like
you didn't stop. It was really dumb.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,970
He'd get hit and you get rocked and you
didn't, nobody likes sat you down and go,

11
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:39,270
okay, let's take the day off. And
then you get right back in there, man,

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,220
you're fucking legs would go bang.

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,480
But your legs would go and you cover up
and you know people be throwing bombs on

14
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:50,010
you and you'd next day sparring again.
Could you, is there a way to detect it?

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,550
Like get at your brain scan so you can
see her ways now. There's better ways now,

16
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:55,320
but I had a limited amount of it.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,060
I mean I had the real getting wrapped
in the head for me came when I tried to

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:04,660
transition from taekwondo to
kickboxing or doing taekwondo. I got,

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,540
I definitely got hit in the head for sure,

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,290
but they didn't get hit in the head as
much because it's hard to kick people in

21
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,340
the head.
You definitely get hit.

22
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,380
I mean I don't know how many
times I definitely got hit,

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,200
but I'd never got knocked
out from a head kick butt.

24
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:21,201
I got knocked out from punches before at
least Ko Tko Tko but when when a punch

25
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,840
hits your face,
it's like your,

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,140
your legs go everything like shuts off.
Like if you get rocked and you,

27
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:32,460
you see like a person go down.
It's not that they go down like,

28
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,500
oh there's so much pain I have to go down.
No,

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,830
you get hit and everything shuts off.
It just goes boom.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,550
And then you feel your legs like rubbery.
Trying to stand back up.

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,090
Did you just watch the last UFC
where Edson Barboza head kick.

32
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:49,200
Kevin Lee see that he's spinning wheel
kicked him and you see Kevin Lee's legs

33
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:52,800
just go blank. They just gave out for
a second and then he came back and

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,530
those those ones I got way
more when I was boxing.

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,480
She got way more of those like I was,
I was not good at boxing.

36
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,690
When I first got into boxing, I was
learning, I was good at taekwondo,

37
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,140
but then I got into boxing. I was not good
at it. I didn't know what I was doing.

38
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,360
I didn't understand the distance.
Taekwondo,

39
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,130
you didn't punch in the face
and we punched the body.

40
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,250
So you had a real distorted perception
of how good you were with your hands.

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,430
And then once I started boxing I was
like, Ooh, this is terrible. And that's,

42
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,860
that's what I was taking like probably
the most damage of my life of a period of

43
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:32,580
like two years of like a lot of sparring,
did a lot of sparring.

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,820
Everybody sparred everybody's
part with everybody.

45
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,830
People knock people out all the time.
This just stupid.

46
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,870
So stupid. I see guys get
knocked out. I mean out cold,

47
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:50,160
right hand to the chin, boom. Eyes
rolled behind their head, legs give out,

48
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,940
they bounce off the canvas.
They put a cold towel on him.

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,460
They put some ice on his head, he gets up.
He's like, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

50
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,370
You want to keep going? Yeah, let's
keep going. Let's keep going. No,

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
you would just unconscious.

52
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,500
You would just unconscious five minutes
ago and you want to keep sparring.

53
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:07,900
This is crazy. And they'd let
them, they let them keep spar.

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,220
You did it from when you were like really
young, right? Taekwondo from one owes,

55
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,070
why took karate classes when I was 14
but when I got super serious I was 15 I

56
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:20,800
was like right at my,
before my sophomore year of high school.

57
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:24,340
So like I got into it from
the time I was in the, uh,

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,480
ninth grade as I was 14.
Like that summer,

59
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,900
like right after my birthday around
is when I started getting into Thai.

60
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,901
So I was probably either
14 or just turning 15 asked
like was there a point you

61
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:41,950
could tell where people actually could
be able to knock people out and give that

62
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,210
damage? Cause there may be 14 year olds
can knock you out or the whole time.

63
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,690
The thing about kicks is almost anybody
can knock you out. It's really crazy.

64
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,670
Like when you think of the amount of
power that you have to have like in your

65
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,480
legs, like say if you decide
to put a heavy backpack on,

66
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:02,740
like one of those outdoors mins,
atlas trainers put 90 pounds on.

67
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,230
You could walk up flights of stairs.
Dude.

68
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,380
Just think how much power
that is in your legs.

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,650
You could throw your body up flights of
stairs for exercise just to Bush Bush,

70
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:17,650
coach your body is whatever you weigh,
one 5,200 whatever your way,

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,850
your body's just launching that through
the air over and over and over again.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,210
Even if you're a girl
that weighs 135 pounds,

73
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,780
you're still launching 135
pounds through the air.

74
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:33,781
And if that girl fucking shins you
boat Blang right on your temple,

75
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:37,800
I, it goes across the jaw,
temple area, got blind.

76
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,820
Your legs are going to give out,

77
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,030
your brain's going to shut off
if somebody hits you. Perfect.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,800
There's a video of a, I think
the guy was shot, I think it was,

79
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,440
I think it was mighty Mo, mighty
moe, who's this huge kickboxer.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I believe he was Samoan and I mean
just like typical Samoan Dude,

81
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:03,550
big giant fucking powerhouse of a dude.

82
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,990
And he fought this little Thai guy.
This Thai guy was 175 pounds,

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,730
so much smaller than them.

84
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,790
I mean it was crazy to watch and tie
guys just moving away and moving away and

85
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,180
moving away. And then the Thai guy
roundhouse kicks him in the head.

86
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,100
This guy like, look at the
difference in size. Yeah.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,430
And watch this.
This dude just comes over the top.

88
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,080
I mean the difference
between the two of them.

89
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,270
Mighty moe is a base to seriously
dangerous knockout puncher.

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,950
He put a lot of guys to sleep,

91
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,090
so not as this guy in there with someone
way bigger than him but he's in there

92
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:42,070
with a killer. But look at that one
head kick and mighty most down and out.

93
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,000
I mean backed that up again because
that is a crazy thing to watch.

94
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,150
You're talking about a guy who might've
been a hundred pounds lighter than him

95
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,560
and mighty mouse. Just
a vicious puncher. Bang.

96
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,030
He just claimed him right in the head.
That's what I'm talking about.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,080
Girl does that to you?
Night night son. Yeah,

98
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,820
I was thinking more like two 10 year
olds like no knock each other out.

99
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:06,080
That's a good point because the thought
process is that if you teach kids

100
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,040
technique,

101
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,330
don't teach them to just go on these
wild fucking haymaker exchanges but teach

102
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,800
them how to do it correctly.

103
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,770
It's good to do it when they're young
because they don't hurt each other cause

104
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,710
they a little tiny arms and they just
kind of touch each other and they can't

105
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,140
really generate knockout power.
They just sort of,

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,760
and if they learn how to do that from
the beginning and then develop knockout

107
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,660
power and the pads and on the bag,

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,610
then you develop much more technically
proficient fighters rather than brawlers.

109
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,590
So the problem with fighting is like
most people don't fight to the physical

110
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,260
ability of their body.
Like they, they just,

111
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,650
they decide like they're
going to knock this guy out,

112
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm gonna try to hit him with this.

113
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,540
And they think in this real
limited sort of linear, aggressive,

114
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,790
like almost obvious manner.

115
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,150
Then you got guys who see past that
who take things to a new place.

116
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,370
You got guys who,

117
00:06:56,371 --> 00:07:01,371
who figure out that you can be like
really elusive and confusing and then you

118
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:06,410
see those guys fight like limited blocky,

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,210
like obvious fighters.

120
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,350
And like Anderson Silva in his prime is
a perfect example that Anderson was an

121
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,360
artist. I mean he would just, he would,

122
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,410
you didn't know what he was going to
do it study you. He'd be moving around,

123
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,090
he'd be standing in front of you,
he'd be dancing,

124
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,630
a just be following you around and
then all of a sudden he just say,

125
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,220
I got this motherfucker figured out.

126
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,000
He would just move in on your bank and
you didn't know what was coming flying

127
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:32,270
knee. He didn't know what was coming.
Roundhouse kick front kick to the face,

128
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,020
know what the fuck was coming, man. It
was a totally different kind of fighter.

129
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,310
So the difference between that and a
guy was just a like a powerhouse of a

130
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:43,610
person and can knock guys out but never,

131
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,200
never achieves this sort of
mastery of space and distance.

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,320
They win fights through brawling and
power and just kinetic brute force rather

133
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:58,970
than artistry and avoidance and countering
like Conor McGregor when he knocked

134
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,950
out Joe's a Aldo perfect example,

135
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,880
all of those like fuck you
charge Anam Connor slides back,

136
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,380
flap drops a fucking left hand on the
button, pop out and he's the champ champ.

137
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,810
I mean come on. Or champ then became
the champ champ champ. But that that,

138
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,990
you know, that thing is,
it's hard to figure out.

139
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,120
Sometimes guys just decided to rub,
they'd rather buy down their mouthpiece.

140
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,050
Let the fucking chips fly. It's not
fun. It's part of the end of a fight.

141
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,840
Yes. Like the last 30 seconds, 10
seconds and they just throw it out.

142
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,780
He could crazy cause they know
there's no more time left. Yeah.

143
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:35,630
They just try to win. I try
to try to stop it. Yeah.

144
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:37,850
Some of those fights are awesome.
Look as a,

145
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,540
as a person watching those things are
awesome. There's two different parts.

146
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,650
The way I look at fights,

147
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:47,030
like I love a good Diego Sanchez Gilbert
Melendez fight where they just fucking

148
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:51,410
go crazy for three rounds. I loved that.
That was one of my favorite fights ever.

149
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,890
But I also love real
technical fights where I see,

150
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,120
I see like two artists trying
to solve each other's riddle,

151
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,350
trying to figure each other out.

152
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,180
You know like Luke Rockhold
versus Yoel Romero.

153
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,290
Was that like Yo,

154
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,570
well just trying to figure him
out and trying to figure him out.

155
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,980
Maybe I move like this and then boom,
drops that left hand on him.

156
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,670
Same thing with him versus Chris Weidman.
He just moving around.

157
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,200
It's hard to figure out
what he's going to do.

158
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,760
Hard to figure out what's coming and then
wome flying knee to the chin or to the

159
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,410
head.
He's a,

160
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,100
he's a great example of a guy who just
figures out how to break your rhythm and

161
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:33,960
figure it through rather than just running
that Yang because clash, clash, clash,

162
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,610
you know Frank Mir was just talking about
that fate or fight and he was saying

163
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,860
that his ego got the best of them.
Did you see the fight?

164
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,240
It was a really good fight. Really
crazy. Until fate are Keto, them fade.

165
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,760
[inaudible] caught on with the left
hand and dropped him and put him away.

166
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,020
But before fade or cowed him,
Frank Mir had hit fade or,

167
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,640
and it got interesting in
the very beginning seconds
of the fight but then fade

168
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:01,110
or hit him with a perfectly timed
hip throw, which is fucking boom.

169
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,320
I mean sent him flying through the
air and slammed him to the ground.

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,810
And apparently frank
said from that moment on,

171
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:09,000
his ego got the best of me
is trying to get them back.

172
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,810
And then he wound up just getting this
crazy brawl and getting knocked out.

173
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,400
It's really fighting to me. So
it's so interesting. You know,

174
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,550
it's just so interesting when you see
all the different things that people can

175
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,470
do and how they're going to
match up together and out.

176
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,740
What one person's going to be able
to figure out how to get there,

177
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,370
their ideas through my ideas. I want
to kick this motherfucker in the head.

178
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,850
How can I do this? I've got to figure
out how to get to and his ideas.

179
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,410
I want to take this guy down
and punch his fucking face in.

180
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,610
How do I figure out how to do this?

181
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,730
And then the two of them are just like
trying each other's strat and you don't

182
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:41,190
really know. You don't fucking know.
You don't know until they get in there.

183
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:44,280
For the most part,
it's great a shit ever.
