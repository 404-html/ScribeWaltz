1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,610
When I heard that Adam and Eve
story, I was like, yeah, right.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,810
Maybe Adam was a bitch and maybe
blamed it on eve and he wrote,

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:13,180
he was the guy who could write. So he
wrote things down. He's like, either drop,

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,940
well I don't do shit. Well good.
Listen, he probably ate the apple first.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,110
He probably gave it to eve. You know,
history's written by the winners.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,590
This is correct. And a lot of
women just, they let that shit go.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,670
There's like let them talk. Yeah, right
down. Then I ate the apple. Fuck you.

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,910
And he's like, fuck
you. Yep. Adam and Eve,

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,040
I don't see Adam and eve
having that New York accident

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,760
where the hell they get it
in New York wasn't there yet.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,150
I feel like Adam and Eve would talk
like British people because anytime they

12
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:46,170
have a movie where people talk like old
timey, whether it's gladiator, whatever,

13
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,800
everyone talks with an English
accent. You ever notice that? Like if,

14
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,880
if we have to, right, if we have to, uh,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,100
there's like the suspension of disbelief,

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,500
like we don't know Latin to talking Latin.

17
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,340
Who the fuck knows what that
sounded like? Right. So when,

18
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,890
when you watching some old ass
movie about people talking Latin,

19
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:09,250
they'll speak English but they'll
speak it with an English accent. Right.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,920
The only speak proper.

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,080
They always have some weird old timey
way what's ever watched the movie

22
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,680
otherwise. Right, but you
right. But why is that?

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,410
Because it's got to make a watchable.
That's why they ruined stories.

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,060
What ti to English people is that played
out like Eleanor's are played out to

25
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,640
him. Do you know what I'm saying?
Absolutely. Like to English people,

26
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:33,840
they hear that accent every day. That's
a normal accent. But to us it's like, oh,

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,510
this is like an old time
language English paper.

28
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,960
Like why is Russell Crowe talking
like he's from fucking London?

29
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:44,040
This is bullshit. Yeah. I got
a friend of mine, a big Chris,

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,410
and he likes to say, well, we invented
the English language and I'm like, yeah,

31
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:51,510
and you fucked it up. Yeah, you guys made
it to the people don't understand it.

32
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,930
That's stupid. That's not smart.
We've made it better. We really did.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,020
I just say that Matt rebuttal
to him was like, oh yeah, well,

34
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:02,130
somebody from your town is still trying
to be a rapper and their defense though,

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,980
they will always say to
you like, yeah, but listen,

36
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:08,610
you guys respect our language more
than you respect yours. And it's true.

37
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,750
Like American English is not
as respectable as English
English because that's

38
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,920
why they use those English people to sell
like late night mops and shit. Right?

39
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,370
Oh, the dude, they do
fucking nonstick frying pans.

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,940
It's always a man with a proper accent.
You look at this,

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,000
I can just find these eggs and
they slide right onto the plate.

42
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,640
Unbelievable. And Hook on to throw a bag
of nickels in there and scratch it up.

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,930
Nope, not a scratch. If that was a guy
from Jersey that was selling you that,

44
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,501
you'd be like,

45
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:42,130
look at this asshole trying to lie to
me about his bullshit frying pan. Right.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
And it's fucking shitty mop.

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,850
But something about like
English accents get us for sure.

48
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,200
They have a better, they have a more
respectable version of our language,

49
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,350
but our sounds better. You could
say it easier. I understand it.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,660
They understand us.
We don't always understand that.

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,080
I was literally just a phone call with a
lady in Europe before I got in here and

52
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,460
I couldn't understand a word she
was saying. The thing is though,

53
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,640
here's where I'm wrong, here's where
I'm wrong. Dan Understand each other.

54
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,590
They fucking dealt. They'll
start. I was in Belfast,

55
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,730
Northern Ireland,

56
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,140
which is you might as well be in
the Cantina scene in star wars.

57
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,040
These mother fuckers,
they barely speak English.

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,180
They speak English for sure.
They understand each other 100% but to me,

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,630
I was talking to this guy and he was
drunk out of his fucking mind and we were

60
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,670
drinking dark beer.
Just me and this dude,

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,740
this is like early 2003
early UFC and UFC in Dublin.

62
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:43,180
I all, I remember this guy saying
how to fight any man who's hammered.

63
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,270
How have high tiny man,
I'm telling you your challenge,

64
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,260
rocking your fucking how the fuck
I showed him how shamrock nowadays.

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,570
Yet he says,
hey to him he was making perfect sense.

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,330
All I caught was I'll fight any men.

67
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:57,370
This motherfucker might've
said that a hundred times.

68
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,250
He just kept buying drinks hammered
with me and some dude from with Belfast

69
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,500
where we understood like 20% of
what each other's was saying.

70
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,580
You got to use the translate thing
on your phone. Wouldn't work.

71
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,220
I had fight any mine.
Oh, what is this color?

72
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,763
This Guy

73
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,580
Shane who you want to skip to kill?
This guy is so cool to fight me.

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,640
You want me to kill? Same be
skipping is a kill to the hospital.

75
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,350
If you put knowledge on her
passenger side to see if I can,

76
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,800
I ain't finished with,
if you're promoting,

77
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,143
pause it.

78
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,250
Now imagine being hammered post UFC event
trying to mingle with the locals were

79
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,180
drinking dark beer and whiskey.

80
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,390
There's maybe 30 people around me that
are yelling like that and I'm talking to

81
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:45,300
this dude, so all the people around
me, who are your allies? If I go drunk,

82
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,560
no one knew. No one knew what
anybody next to him was saying.

83
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:53,040
Everybody is loud and hammered and this
guy is fucked up and he's telling me

84
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,430
this, how does high tiny mine? And
I'm like, okay, you go fight him.

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,070
Funny, we've, we've pulled up
the video before that exact guy

86
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,660
video a long time ago. What is
this one? This is really old.

87
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:10,050
You talking about this. Oh, let me tell
me about this guy that's hilarious.

88
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,173
Right here.

89
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,340
Eight years ago or some shit.

90
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,430
What does that from two things play at
the same time and that's from an old,

91
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,180
it's two things going on in the
background. Did you hear it?

92
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,390
Damn, I had a beard back then. That's
the same guy. That's hilarious.

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,780
Now that's like pikey
language, right? I guess.

94
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,300
I mean it says he is the first video
I pulled up and said he was from,

95
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,970
I think I typed in Belfast or something.
But here's the thing,

96
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,110
here's where I'm wrong.

97
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:45,140
They fucking understand each other 100%
they understand every word they say

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,420
wrong. I just, I'm just
not in that environment.

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,930
What do you hang out and you'll get it.
It's got a flavor though.

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,070
They have a flavor that we
don't have, right? That's a
dark old world flavor. Hey,

101
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,853
listen,
mate,

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,220
that's a fucking dude who just came over
on a boat and he's shooting arrows at

103
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:04,500
people.
They kept that same language

104
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,060
and they're always
looking to fight out of.
