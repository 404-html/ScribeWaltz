1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,260
Be so good. He's so good in
everything. Looks so young there.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,910
While he was man, man. Oh Man.
What a fucking movie this was.

3
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:11,700
Cause I wanted to believe so bad.
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,770
I so wanted to believe they got me.
Hey, did you talk about Spielberg?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,720
Did you talk about that alien craft
that came into her? What happened?

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,990
We tend to our galaxy. It did then it
won't the Hawaiian name. Oh, so it's over.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,020
You didn't hear about that one. The
one that looks like a joint. Yeah,

8
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,450
it looks like or a big piece of poop.
Yeah. That's just a real big duty copter.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,240
It's just a weird rock. I
think. Now they said that, uh,

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,380
some like legit people said that it
changed speed and went in different

11
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:42,890
directions and people, legit
people. Scientists. Oh,

12
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:47,840
them guys said that it was a, it
could be something. Mm. Could be,

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,880
what does Neil degrasse say about it?
He's not talking right now.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,140
Yeah. He's in a little bit
of a kerfuffle. Kerfuffle.

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,650
What's his Jame Harvard scientists say
aliens makes plain bizarre interstellar

16
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:08,620
object. Yeah. I saw that. And then I
saw someone refuting the scientists.

17
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,910
Harvard. Nobody wants to believe more than
me, bro. Come on Joe. It's real. Well,

18
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:16,970
if I was going to mask my spaceship
to fly through the galaxy,

19
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:20,480
I would definitely make it look like a
big rock. Like a big asteroid. Right.

20
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,550
Why wouldn't you driving through space
may. Maybe what they were like, look,

21
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:30,320
if we just make this thing drive
by them and don't change speeds,

22
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,280
they'll now have no idea.

23
00:01:31,281 --> 00:01:34,370
They just think we're in the store and
they'd be psyched that we miss them. Okay.

24
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:38,990
Yeah. Good call. Good call. Someone just
hits the gas. I'm tired. I don't want it.

25
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,960
It's fucking taking too long.
Which he just decides. You got it.

26
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:47,960
The fucking cops are behind is
Dave Shit. God dammit. Dave,

27
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:52,660
you're not supposed to just
take off 65 you fuck that.

28
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:53,990
Start throwing this weed out the window.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,490
Why would it be so hard to believe a
space rock traveling through space?

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,310
That would be the move, right?
I mean if they are so advanced,

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,660
they can travel through galaxies.

32
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,790
They can make the shit look
like anything they want it to.

33
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,720
Why when you doll it up,
radiation pressure.

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,580
The only thing separating Thor's would be,
well there's no air and space,

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,560
right? So it wouldn't be aerodynamics.
What would it be? Momentum. No,

36
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:20,110
go down a little bit.
Take it answers your question.

37
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:25,111
If radiation pressure is the accelerating
forest then own Mo Momma represents a

38
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:30,370
new class of thin interstellar material.
Whoa.

39
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,810
It has a different thing for energy.

40
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,120
What as to what may have produced
this previously unseen material,

41
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:41,930
it could have emerged naturally from the
debris of the planet forming disk in a

42
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:45,170
distant solar system going
through yet an unknown process.

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,460
They've got a whole nother way to makes,

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,580
we went from Toyota
Corollas to this thing.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,240
Imagine if that's what we find. The only
thing that I think what it does, the um,

46
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,460
the like a rock, right? Rock hat is not
smooth, but it doesn't necessarily need,

47
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:04,870
this is where I'm stupid. This is one
of one of many places where I'm stupid,

48
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,600
but it doesn't necessarily
need to be aerodynamic. Right?

49
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,630
Cause it's not going through air. It's
called you the vacuum of space. Right?

50
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,380
Exactly. So I'm not wrong there.
It could actually look like a rock.

51
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,900
It could be the only issue would
be getting it into space. Right.

52
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,470
The aerodynamics is assuming that
you shooting it from a planet with an

53
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:25,420
atmosphere. Again, gravity not be talking
about this way too stupid. No, let's go.

54
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,120
Let's keep, let's keep going on
about if you shot, if you'd like,

55
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,010
if you're launching it from
Earth into space, right? Yeah.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,320
What if you had it in cased
in like this outer area,

57
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,540
sort of like the space shuttle is,

58
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,470
but then once you get to a place you
could jettison the outside of it.

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,370
Just like they get rid of
those booster rocket fall off.

60
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,880
They just fall into the fucking
land on people. Whether fishing,

61
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,640
that's has to happen. Right. When she
getting killed by a booster rocket,

62
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:59,560
flat space, even in the face it didn't
do great, but then they could do that.

63
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,040
They could release the shell and then
they would just have the rock and the rock

64
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,210
would move through space.

65
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,780
And it didn't matter what shape it
was cause it's in the vacuum of space.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,540
We just get it up into orbit,
orbit like uh, the space station.

67
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,120
Go and build it in pieces
and then launch it.

68
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,980
Do you remember when that Commander Chris
Hadfield gentlemen was on the podcast

69
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,750
and he was talking about some kind
of magnet that they have that uh,

70
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,870
collects subatomic particles out there
in the galaxy and that we only know 5% of

71
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,410
what the universe is made out of?
Oh my God.

72
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,120
Talking about things like
dark matter and he was 5%.

73
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,220
It's the guys scientist space,

74
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,170
a real legit astronaut coming back from
six months in space or whatever the fuck

75
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,750
he was there for. And telling
us this, we're like, wow, what

76
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,870
we've talked about that like you can hang
with those guys for a little while and

77
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,200
then you're like, I don't understand
what's happening now. Well it's also the,

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,630
I mean it's amazing what we do know,

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,280
amazing that they can send a guy to space
and have them fly around the ISS or,

80
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,260
yeah.
I mean,

81
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,570
we'll talk about what you were saying
about why are we here and what are we

82
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,030
doing?
Like we haven't developed yet.

83
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,860
Something that you can go the uh,
the speed of light we haven't like,

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,270
but if we do, then the whole universe
is open to us. Maybe that's what it is.

85
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,840
Maybe the struggle of developing all this
stuff is to get to a scientific level

86
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,460
where we can really go.

87
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,540
I don't think they think the speed of
light is even good enough. Really. Yeah,

88
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
I think, damn it, that was my goal.

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,900
I think that like if you wanted to have
options available as to what planet

90
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,840
you're gonna colonize, you
going to have to, who knows?

91
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,990
Like what have you landed on the planet,
what did he land on a planet?

92
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,430
And it's like, Hey, it's 74 degrees out
guys. Guys, it's all oxygen and nitrogen.

93
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,590
It's just like earth. Come on
out here. Come on out of here.

94
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,580
But it's only been like that for
10 years and then it's a cycle.

95
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,810
It's really fucked up. Like 30 years
from now it's going to be a nice age.

96
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,010
And then all of people have moved there
and they're going to freeze to death.

97
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,550
It's going to be no food at all plan.
It doesn't give a fuck.

98
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,250
My Dad does all our science led us to
that. I don't even know if we can predict,

99
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,080
here's my question.

100
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Can they accurately predict the atmosphere
and the conditions and like what the

101
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,060
temperature would be if
a planet is from a son,

102
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,010
like do they have a
calculation where they say, oh,

103
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:23,060
this sun is this amount of big and
this planet, it was this far away,

104
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,700
so it's definitely going to stay within
a certain temperature range for the

105
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:29,360
entire time that the planet, did they
know that like within like a death range.

106
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,190
I don't know greys. That
range is 40 degrees, bro.

107
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,280
Yeah. You get to 140 that's a
wrap. Yeah. You're done. Yeah,

108
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,560
so like hundreds would make
it 140 everyone's dead. Right?

109
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,090
You live in in a sauna,
you're going to run out of water.

110
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,590
I just don't think we're going to make it.
