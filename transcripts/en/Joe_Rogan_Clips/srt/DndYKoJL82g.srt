1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,240
There are some efforts right now to
try to de extinct some animals there.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,300
Thank you. Yeah, you mean that
one new word and a w like what is,

3
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,760
what is currently going on right now?

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,180
They're calling it the dawn
of de extinction and it's um,

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,570
it's a lot of very,

6
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:23,571
very intelligent genetic scientists that
are trying to isolate specific genes

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,700
that are specific to the animals that
have been extinct and putting them into

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,690
extent animals,

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:35,460
animals that are still here to basically
make this Frankenstein animal because

10
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:37,170
it will never be the animal that's gone.
Right.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,770
It will look like it'll behave like
it will think like it, et Cetera,

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,340
but it will never actually be the animal
that we've lost. At least not yet.

13
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:46,260
We haven't,
we don't have that technology right now.

14
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,790
What we can do is isolate a genome,

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,870
put it into an existing animal that gives
birth to an animal that looks and acts

16
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:53,430
very much like the extinct down,

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,140
but it's some degree different because
it's like part like of a mammoth.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,950
For instance, they would have to
take some DNA from a mammoth, right?

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,170
That they would somehow, or another
get and introduce it to an embryo,

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,230
but how much of an elephant and the
elephant would give birth to a very hairy,

21
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,890
very large Tusk,
like these isolated genetic codes,

22
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,820
elephant. And it would look like a
mammoth. It would act like a mammoth.

23
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,300
But the reality is it's a shaggy
elephant with big tusks. Right.

24
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:25,830
So if you did like 23 and
me on it, it would show, oh,

25
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:29,490
it's mostly LF. Exactly. That's a
little bit of a mammoth. Yeah. I mean,

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,700
if you think of a double helix,
like a DNA strand, right?

27
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,730
You have these little bars in the
middle of it. So what they do is,

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,560
this is a very crude way to explain it,

29
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:41,750
but they pull out a bar from an
elephant and they put in a bar from, um,

30
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,670
a mammoth and then eventually
you get this mammoth.

31
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,410
And so this would be like gene
editing tools like crisper. Exactly.

32
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:53,040
On those lines. Exactly. Wow. And so
how far away are they from doing this?

33
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,200
Uh, it's, I mean, it's been successfully
done a couple of times. They've, Yup.

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,970
They've given birth to a couple
of animals that are very,

35
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:03,720
very close to the extinct animal. Most
of the time there's problems, right?

36
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,670
There's, it's in fertile, it's a,
it has lung issues, whatever it is.

37
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,890
There's a couple of different cases.
I'm not a geneticist,

38
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:14,610
I'm a wildlife biologist so I don't
really understand it, but it's,

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,330
they've done it.

40
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,330
They have successfully reproduce things
that are gone basically clone things and

41
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,300
then the animal hasn't made it to
adulthood. Man, that seems really,

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,380
really like playing. God does. It is,
it is absolutely like playing God.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,750
I feel like, I mean is are people
doing it just cause they can,

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,640
is it one of those things or a zero,

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,680
like a real valid scientific reason for
trying to reintroduce these animals are

46
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:45,240
d extinct them? Well, the,
the valid reason is to
conserve the ecosystem, right?

47
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,110
Like we talked about,

48
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:50,280
but I think it goes back to what we
were saying half an hour ago, which is,

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,420
it's just that that quest for knowledge
that can we do it, the innovation, right?

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,040
Can we play God, can we fix it? Can we
take this thing that's gone and say no,

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,400
not like we have the tools to make
it not gone. Yeah. There was um,

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,600
some article that I read where they were
talking about reintroducing the mammoth

53
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:12,601
to Siberia and that there would be some
ecological benefit to reintroducing the

54
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,310
mammoth because of the way
they forage for food. Sure.

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,590
They would have some sort of an effect
on global warming. Sure. Which I mean,

56
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,030
do you know about that?
I don't know about that specifically.

57
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,864
You could find that Jamie,

58
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,190
the reintroducing the mammoth to
Siberia to benefit the environment.

59
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,110
Look whether that's accurate or not
until you put mammoths on the ground,

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,740
how do we actually know it's a great
theory and that's what science is, right?

61
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,700
It's coming up with hypothesis and then
trying to prove them and it sounds cool.

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Like, do I want to see a mammoth
walking around Siberia? Fuck yeah.

63
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,450
But does that mean it's actually good
for the world? Hard to say. Whoa.

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,180
Could bringing back mammas
help stop climate change?

65
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,470
Scientists say creating hybrids of extinct
bees could fix the Arctic Tundra and

66
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:58,120
stop greenhouse gas emissions.
I don't understand that.
I find it hard to believe,

67
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,750
to be honest.

68
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,590
Maybe it's just some scientists clever
way of sneaking it in because he wants to

69
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:06,910
play God like, Hey, we're going to fix
everything. Yeah. Fucking use coal.

70
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,660
Who gives a shit? Yeah. Hamets we got
Matt. Just give me the funding clean,

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,390
man. That's, that's sadly
very real. Well, is it really?

72
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,640
Oh yeah. I mean, look, if you're
a scientist, right? Right. You,

73
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,080
Joe Rogan is a scientist.
How are you going to make your career?

74
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,230
Are you going to make your
career by raising money
through being like, yeah, sure.

75
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,110
Like I'll study cricket legs,
or you going to be like, look,

76
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,340
give me the money to stop global warming
by bringing back fucking mammas like,

77
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:33,911
right.
You know,

78
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,990
like why you can make the outrageous
claim if you think it's going to fund your

79
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:41,350
research. Right. That's how you
make your bones. Right. And that's,

80
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,950
that's one of the sad realities of some,
certainly not all science.
