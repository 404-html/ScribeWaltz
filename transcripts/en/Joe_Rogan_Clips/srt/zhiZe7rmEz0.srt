1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
It was a good fight for as long
as it landed on his last brother.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,520
One of the cool things that we've gotten
is to be ability to hang out casually

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:12,330
with these fighters.
Like having just breakfast with Randy,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,870
seeing him having with enough times with
you that I remember one time I was like

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,510
going into a buffet or
whatever or the hotel,

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,100
like free breakfast and like looking
around and just having him going, hey,

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,010
come sit with me. I'm like,
oh, okay. Just like, oh, you're
just such sought after it.

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,120
I'm just like,
I'm talking about nothing.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,080
But some of my favorites were in Chicago.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,350
Do going to the weigh ins and then like,

11
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,590
let's go to the show and then
just junk drive in with clay.

12
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:42,150
Guido am like, I'll drive
you just, it's his city,

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,270
it's his city. And he's like,
come with me. We're like, okay.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,040
And you white knuckling,

15
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:52,020
holding onto the front seat
as he's swerving with a
brown paper bag drives like

16
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:56,040
he fights and I'm just
like, I accept that.

17
00:00:56,041 --> 00:01:00,240
So either way cause it mattered and
he would just go and for it on these

18
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,730
highways that he knows and then I
believe the rain and it was just like,

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,640
I was just like so fun.
Yeah.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,370
Another one that I remember
early on early on, John Jones,

21
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,850
he wasn't anything then. It's four
and oh, maybe something like that. Um,

22
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,300
meeting him, uh, talking about shit,

23
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,370
and I could talk about this now because
it's not no longer a banned substance in

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,370
the UFC, but like, uh, talking about
weed and was like, yo, let's smoke bro.

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,900
He wasn't anything, it wasn't anything.
And just going like, he was like,

26
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,681
who's got wait, am I, oh,

27
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:35,430
Rogan's got a piece in his hotel
room and texting you flip phone,

28
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,040
texting you back when it wasn't cool.

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,380
You don't have to have like hip to
have a flip phone where it was like,

30
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:43,650
that's all anybody had. That's
how long ago. And then just go on.

31
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:48,120
Like maybe it's that, maybe it was early,
uh, iPhone, but like just going, hey man,

32
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,140
are you up? And you're like, yeah, I'm
kind of and go to sleep. And was like,

33
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:56,040
Fuck John, I think he's doesn't want us up
there. And then be like, no, no, let's go.

34
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,950
He's got the weed. Let's go. Because
some fan gave it to us, right?

35
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,460
You had this fucking like
tin foil of weed and um,

36
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,300
and just knock on your door and you're
like, what? And you're like, uh,

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,300
you were retired. And it was like, um,
do you have that? We'd like to come on,

38
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,130
I want to go to sleep, man. John, when the
smoke and you're like, you looked at us,

39
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,880
who opened the door fully looked at me
and this young fighter and you were like,

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,853
come on in.

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,150
And we all smoked pot together and this
hotel room and fucking wherever it was,

42
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:24,750
I think Montreal, Ashley's Montreal.
Yeah. Yeah. And it just a fun time.

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,800
And then seeing this guy move on to
become the baddest motherfucker on the

44
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,580
planet. But we also had a
conversation with him about, I was,

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,840
I wanted him to go to a different camp.
That's right.

46
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:38,250
He was training in fucking youtube
videos in New York with his buddies in a

47
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,670
garage. You too. Good. I'm Mike, you
should be in a real cash. That's right.

48
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:45,930
We had that over weed in a
hotel room. He's like, you
really think so. I go, I know.

49
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,870
So I know. I go, you only have a
certain amount of time in this thing.

50
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,950
I go and your time should be
invested with a real coach.

51
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,000
Who's going to hone your skills. I go,
you, you can be an all time. Great man.

52
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,500
Wow. Yeah, I remember telling him that
and he's like, you really think so. I go,

53
00:03:00,501 --> 00:03:03,190
I know. So I know. So you,
you really got to move on.

54
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:07,600
I forgot about that part
of how influential was that
in the fucking future of

55
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:11,220
mixed martial arts. So I hope it helped.
You know, he did. He went to Winkle,

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,570
John a hunk, uncle junk eventually.
I mean, he'd probably be what?

57
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,710
We might've done it anyway.
He might, who knows? But, uh,

58
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,460
I think it was a good conversation to have
with a young guy. You know, I was like,

59
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,700
listen man, you, you,
you, you have real talent.

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,090
Like you could really be something,
but you gotta be,

61
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,210
you gotta be coached by guys who are
going to find out your tendency technique

62
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,360
isn't worth, isn't going to go take
you that far. Well, I mean fucking,

63
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:40,390
he was so good. Who knows how far
he might've been a world champion,

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,070
even with the camp that he was in.

65
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,720
He's so good and his wrestling is so
powerful and he's so physically talented,

66
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,050
but it made a big difference for him to
go to Jackson's and be able to train on

67
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:59,521
a regular basis with world class fighters
being there on a daily basis with

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,270
Carlos condit who is, you know,
at the top of his game back then.

69
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:08,710
And I mean Keith Jardeen
and they just had a massive,

70
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,090
they had ruined tailors,
the,

71
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,000
they called it the ring of fire where
you would go five rounds of sparring with

72
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:20,680
to get ready for a fight with
a different high level. I mean,

73
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,160
highest level fighter.
So like Nate Marquardt like cool.

74
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:26,740
That was around one get out of here at
Giardia and you come in and now I just

75
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,230
finished a fucking route and they'd walk
quite now I got go with kicked Jardeen

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,940
cool. Round three charge didn't get out
Jon Jones who come in and it's like, what?

77
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,470
I mean the training you got
there. Correct. Johnson's
camp. We're like, well yeah.

78
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,460
I mean look,

79
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,870
there's a reason why so many extremely
high level fighters are coming out of

80
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,830
there. And then Rashad
Evans was there as well too.

81
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,310
And Rashad had a real problem with John
Coming there because Rashad was like,

82
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,880
hey, this guy's in my weight class, but
what are you going to do? I have one guy,

83
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:56,290
he's way class. Right. It's an
issue. Yeah. And then, you know,

84
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:00,850
Rishad and John became friends.
They did fight. Is that they would,

85
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,840
yes, they fought and John beat the shit
out of him. I don't even remember that.

86
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:09,070
They thought after they had a big falling
out because Rashad was upset that,

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,920
you know, John Wound up, John
Wound up getting a title shot, uh,

88
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,640
and beat shogun because were shod,
got injured.

89
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,220
Rashad was supposed to get the title shot,

90
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,930
John Steps in and they were friends at
the time and then somewhere along the

91
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,410
line then the trash talk started,
you know, I'll fight Rashad, fuck it.

92
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,900
And then it was like, man, I thought
we were friends and then, oh yeah,

93
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:31,240
that's back when it was like, you know,
you guys can fight as front and center,

94
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,210
but you don't have to like be at enemies.
Everybody fight.

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,220
It's a sport and it's a money thing.
And then when John beat him,

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,250
it was a real drubbing
and it was a five rounds.

97
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,780
It was a decision and uh,
it was a real clear cut,

98
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,700
unanimous decision. He did some crazy shit
to him, like step in elbow to the face.

99
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,270
I kind of do remember this one now,
and this was John when he was developing,

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,210
John Wasn't even John,
like the John that knocked out DC.

101
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,940
I remember him when he sang it in fights
that I didn't really ever see this

102
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:09,050
where the fighters, where he would talk
about after wins, talking about the holes,

103
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,050
the fuck ups he had more than the,

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,040
what he did right was most guys would
be braggadocious, but I love that I did,

105
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,390
but it was like he was upset at
things that went wrong. Yeah,

106
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:20,330
I guess I got to cover that up.
That could get exposed. You know,

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,410
John's a fucking smart data,
me as reckless and chaotic
as he is. And you know,

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,970
I've said this before that I don't know
what causes that kind of recklessness,

109
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,971
but there is a direct correlation
between traumatic brain injury,

110
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,960
brain damage, and impulsive behavior
and recklessness. It's a fact.

111
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,610
It's well researched.
It's well documented in neuroscience.

112
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,490
They know that this, this
is a, there's a connection.

113
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,970
I don't want to exonerate
him from his past behavior,

114
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:52,850
but we see that in football players,

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
we see that and BMX riders that go crazy
and fucking land on their head a bunch

116
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,050
of times. People, they get crazy. Wow.

117
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,260
They get wild and impulsive and it's just
a fact. It's just a part of the game.

118
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,760
You know, they, they,

119
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,850
those people that engage in any kind of
an activity where you bring gets rattled

120
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,970
on a regular basis,

121
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,160
you are way more likely to do ridiculous
things that don't make any sense. Yeah,

122
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,810
it does. It's what I said about John. Have
you talked to John about it? You know,

123
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,120
um,
and you know,

124
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,700
I know John was upset with me after one
of those things before we actually did a

125
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,000
podcast together. He was upset and
I said, listen, man, I have to be.
