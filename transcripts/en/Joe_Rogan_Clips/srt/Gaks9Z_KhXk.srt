1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,780
Her low freak bitches,
but I do.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:08,781
I do feel like the country is
divided to a point of like,

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,800
I don't know, we're not going
to be honest. Again, it's not,

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,020
it doesn't seal on the
Internet. It's bad. I got my,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,720
I got my news a lot from the daily show.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,540
What I would watch the
daily show and I would see,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,590
I feel like Jon Stewart is a
obviously a very left leaning guy,

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,490
but he's also a very smart guy in a very
funny guy and when he would talk about

9
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,420
like events in the news and mock them
and show clips and mock the clips,

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,930
that to me is a way better
version of what I would get.

11
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:40,860
Like I can discern what's a joke,
I can discern how he's making fun,

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,210
but then I will also get the
actual information of these
events from him as well.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,470
That to me is a way better version of
news entertainment than what fucking CNN

14
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:49,950
is doing.

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,940
Cause with CNN is doing is having s
what are essentially actors like really

16
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,880
boring people that are reading some
stupid shit off a teleprompter.

17
00:00:56,881 --> 00:01:00,090
Like you take fucking Anderson
Cooper away from the news. What?

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,370
Who was Anderson Cooper? What do you,
are you interesting dude? You know what?

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,010
Let's have him talk. Have him give a
speech somewhere. Have him talk to people,

20
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,850
have him have him do, do a standup
routine. He's boring as shit. I bet.

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,470
You know what I'm saying to me that if
you're watching an entertainer give you

22
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,900
the news, which is essentially
what CNN is doing, right?

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,570
Fucking John Stewart should be on CNN.
Yeah.

24
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:24,640
But then he'd have to like
go to work every day. He
didn't want to do that. Right.

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,820
Is that what he's, his deal is he
doesn't want to work and you know, he,

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,350
I mean he doesn't want the daily
show after so many years. I mean,

27
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,230
I was there for a lunch. I talked to John
a lot. I think a lot of it is just the,

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,090
the feeling of like, you know, doing
it a talk show four nights a week,

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,670
every day and calling
through all that news.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,330
Like we were giving people the little
golden nuggets that happened throughout

31
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:47,610
the day. But like we have
to watch it. Like, you know,

32
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:51,930
we were absorbing a lot of like radiation
from all that stuff and like, you know,

33
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:54,600
like the closer you yard of the radiation,
the more you know your,

34
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:58,140
your hair gets grade, your soul hurts
after a while. And I think for John,

35
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:01,710
I mean I, I think him leaving when
he left, it was a good way to do it.

36
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,860
You just make a bunch of money and say, oh
that's it. No, it wasn't even the money.

37
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,380
I think it was just, he felt like,
and he said it on the last show.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,590
I wasn't there for the, I mean I, I'd
stopped working there before he retired,

39
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,260
but I think he just got to
a point where he said like,

40
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,930
I'm not doing this at the
level I could do it at anymore.

41
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,250
Therefore someone else should do
it. Like he was telling, he used,

42
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,240
he was just kind of, he did it, you know.

43
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,730
And I think if you waited through
this election, which people were like,

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,620
I wish she was to align. It's like, yeah,

45
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,490
but now Trump would be in
and then everyone would be
like, you can't quit. No try.

46
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,110
You know, like he'd be, he'd be
stuck in it forever, you know?

47
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:35,340
And I think he just wanted to walk away
like on the top, you know, like the way,

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,170
you know, like a retire after a super
bowl win kind of thing. You know,

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,890
people forget that he wasn't the original
host. Isn't that fascinating? Yeah.

50
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,820
At Kilborne was, yeah. What
happened to that guy? I don't know.

51
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,650
I never worked there with Kilborne.

52
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:49,830
I started like six months after
John Stewart started and uh,

53
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,770
so I've heard a lot of like
funny Kilborne stories.

54
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,990
Like he was a good dude and
he was a really funny guy.

55
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:59,330
But like definitely much more of
a read the teleprompter. Yeah.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,730
Read what they put in. The
prompts are kind of, you
know, Raga Ron Burgundy style,

57
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,330
you know, fuck yourself. San
Diego. Yeah. Great job with, uh,

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,550
John. When John came on and he was
like really a writer, producer mind.

59
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,670
There was definitely like a sea change
at the shadow of like the writers.

60
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,050
The original writers go on
like, what the hell? Hey Buddy,

61
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,670
don't ruin our little
show. And he was like, man,

62
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,220
I don't know if you understand how
this is going to work. You know?

63
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:27,100
There was a little girl, there was like
a clash a little bit, a little bit.

64
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:30,230
What was their vision that he was just
going to read whatever they wrote? Yeah.

65
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,130
Period. Yeah, I think so. But
he's a really funny comic.

66
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,790
Why wouldn't they want him to contribute
and make it funnier? Right? Yeah.

67
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,570
I don't know. I mean, it
worked out in his favor.

68
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,950
I think his contributions ended up making
the show pretty down, honestly. Yeah.

69
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,990
But Egos are a motherfucker, man.
It's fun. It's always an odd thing.

70
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.
