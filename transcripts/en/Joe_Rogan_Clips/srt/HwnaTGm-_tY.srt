1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,690
The joe rogan experience that you think,
why am I asking you this?

2
00:00:04,691 --> 00:00:09,100
But I think you might have an answer.
So, but I'm being totally honest,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,600
I am exhausted from dealing with like I,
it's,

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,430
it's not like it's a big deal,
but it's like the first time you,

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,830
whether you can admit major
things in your life, like, oh,

6
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:21,340
I have a drinking problem,
but to be stupid little
things. Yeah, mine is eating.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,170
Like I'm exhausted from doing it the
wrong way and everything comes back to me

8
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:29,440
for self control. So when people want
to tell me about a diet, I don't,

9
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:33,250
it's not portions. I know a portions
are, I just want to eat more.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,900
So it's all down to how do I fucking
get self control? I have zero.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,970
I mean if I'm not going to
call it zero self control,

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,440
then I don't know what the hell I'm
going to call it. But as you now you're,

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,170
you're not, you're hard on yourself.
I think you have self control.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,200
Todd think you're a wonderful
man, but you're, you're hilarious.

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,880
And one of the reasons why
you're hilarious is because
you're so, you're free,

16
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:57,040
you're impulsive and that sort of debt,

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,550
it's very difficult for that to lend
itself to dietary discipline. It's like,

18
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:04,600
how can I eat it? Fuck it. Hey, that's
a fucking eat it. Right. That's you.

19
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:07,450
But it's also part of what makes
you such a hilarious comic.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,490
It's like you have these impulses.
It makes me feel better.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,200
You don't want to split the difference,
at least with what you're saying,

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,330
discomfort and you want to have fun and
it's like it's right there that want he,

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,260
I want to eat that food. Fuck it. The
thought of me like picture me at the,

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,300
at the uh,
shoving cheesecake,

25
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,940
him in my mouth and my friends are
like looking at me like Todd and I go,

26
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,010
Joe Rogan said that because I'm creative.
Good.

27
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:36,480
I should eat whatever I want. He said
it and you can go listen to his podcast.

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,430
He said that I should eat. He goes, Joe
Rogan and you can go listen. He said,

29
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,560
clear up the minibar before you
get in your hotel beds. Even,

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,780
even if you're not really
hungry, does some creative, okay,

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,610
so I don't have control over this.

32
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,780
There's also a problem.
There's another problem with discipline.

33
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,250
This is a pro and disciplining that
hit me already. Yeah, for sure. No,

34
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,420
that's probably just the we'd hit yet.

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,300
It takes a little while
for the spray again. Yeah,

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,180
usually a few more minutes than that.
Um,

37
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,900
I forgot my point about, um,

38
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,890
the self control. Oh, that when you
really disciplined people and comedy,

39
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,010
they don't go well
together that much either.

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,120
Because if you're too
driven and too disciplining,

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,780
that's almost always Dickey.
You know what I mean?

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,330
I'm saying like you'd be
able to disciplined, too
rigid, too determined and,

43
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:39,350
and, and, and to like too
enthusiastic about success.

44
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,780
You get Dickie, let me ask
you this and I'm not, I don't,

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,020
this thought could be wrong.

46
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,630
Like I'm okay with thinking
something and then maybe finding out.

47
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,070
But whenever it comedian, and I bet
there's funny ones out there. Definitely.

48
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,470
Cause over the years I remember my,
can't think of which ones,

49
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:58,280
but they definitely exist.
They are funny, they are funny,

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,880
but they've never smoked. Drank, oh,

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,590
can you be a good comedian if
you haven't done those things,

52
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,820
I think you'd be a good
comedian. If you're a man,
you could be a good comedian.

53
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,500
If you're a woman, you could
be a good comedian. If you're
gay or trans, you just,

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,300
you are a good comedian. If you're a good
comedian. Is that, why do I ask that?

55
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,120
Because I'm,
I should be embarrassed to ask that too,

56
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:25,030
is a lot of people that are really good
that don't do shit and never, yeah,

57
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,060
they don't, they don't
have a desire to, you know,

58
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,100
it's just everybody's
brain works different.

59
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:35,101
And some people like the idea of losing
control with a substance is not not fun.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,620
Right.
They don't like that feeling and it's,

61
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,810
but they can keep their shit together,
you know?

62
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,940
I know a lot of people that don't drink,
they don't do anything,

63
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:47,110
but they keep their shit together
and maybe that's better for them.

64
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,100
They feel like it is. I
don't know. I, you know, I,

65
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:55,720
as I asked that you gave me the answer
that you know to go, you're right.

66
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,920
You're right. Yeah. But like I s it means
that I had a question about that and I,

67
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,220
and that I think I've talked about
this in the past and once I was like,

68
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,180
somebody was saying, well, they may be,
what if you're not experimenting? But no,

69
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:09,940
there's a billion ways to,
uh,

70
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,870
to do those things that you use pot to
do without the pod. Obvious. I think I,

71
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:16,540
you edit that out. I use
yoga for that too, man.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,950
I love going to a hot yoga class
fucking hard. And it's like a drug,

73
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,620
like you get a lot of
thinking done in there, man,

74
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:27,580
when you're just holding these poses
and there's no, no music, no nothing,

75
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,220
just everybody in the class.
Breathing is a 90 minute class.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,700
There's some sort of
psychedelic effect there.

77
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,090
Okay.
