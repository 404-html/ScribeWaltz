1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,520
The joe rogan experience
but never got injured.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,890
Even if he did, he wouldn't know.
What does that guy doing these days?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,840
I have no clue.
I know he wrote a book.

4
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,630
It was the last time we handle on the
inside of way. Oh, you guys had them on?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,340
Yeah. I mean that's five years ago. That
guy, my guy was a fucking character.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,230
I mean if it wasn't for
guys like tank Abbott,

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,000
I mean there would have
been no early days. Yeah.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,260
You know you needed a guy
looked at identify with him.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,970
A lot of these crazy guys out there. Shoe.
You can do what? I can do this. Yeah,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,160
that's what you need. Yeah. I had a giant
bell in. You would knock people dead.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,840
Yeah. He was like a Roy
Nelson only with no stamina.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,420
Yeah. Well and and and no black belt
tech. No black belt in Jiu Jitsu. Yeah.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,350
Well Roy Nelson is a fucking
complete anomaly. Yeah, he is.

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,850
Looks like if you lose weight,
how is it possible that he trains so hard?

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:57,590
I've seen this guy throw world
like 130 155 pound kettle bells,

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,260
like one arm swings. We can wing being
like, it's nothing. You would lose weight,

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,100
right?
You would think,

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,450
but he would be a 185
pound phenom instead.

19
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,284
He's a heavyweight.

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,030
He's a cubic contender and maybe it's an
implant in the belly that he just wants

21
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,870
to do that because the Buddha belly
implants kick them and he didn't even feel

22
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:19,320
it. He's aware a chess pad.
He imagined someone did that.

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,420
I mean if girls get fake boobs,

24
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:24,240
let's think about this cause girls
do get fake boobs and they fight.

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,030
You know girls have got it. I want
to mention any names, but we seen it.

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,340
Girls have had no boobs and all
of a sudden they have boobs.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,630
You can get fake boobs and still fight.
But what about a fake belly?

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,900
What about a guy who says, I just like,
oh, I like a belly. I like looking good.

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,450
You know, if, if a guy had a fake belly,

30
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,880
I was going to try to see if
we're going to hit it to the back.

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,740
I'll say I'll make a
hunchback out of them.

32
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,090
See if you can move the battle all the
way to the back. Way To hook to the back.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,390
Lower back. We never had
one like that, you know,

34
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,820
I mean the hunchback from not
are dumb. That's a high, but no,

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,540
you never saw a hundred beck from
the bottom right. Like lower back.

36
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,490
We can make that like a lumbar pad.

37
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,970
Work as a lumberjack.
Yeah. Sleeps all night.

38
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:15,360
Then he works all day. Like
if, if you look at Roy Nelson,

39
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:20,340
he's like the size of a really
good middleweight. Yeah, no he is.

40
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,590
Yeah.
But meanwhile the guy knocked out,

41
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:27,591
Chuck Congo knocked out Brendan Shab
knocked out some big fucking heavyweights.

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,550
Knocked out mitre own.

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,770
I mean fucking knocked out
a lot of people. Staples.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,820
Troover right. That'll show,
did he knock out seven?

45
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,300
I do not remember that
fight. Wow. Um, and it does.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,630
The worst thing is it's
with his right hand.

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,330
So you were thinking that people
going to the hill to left up,

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,820
but somehow he connects
anyway with the arm bars.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,460
You know what's going to happen? We can
stop it. No, almost knocked down over him.

50
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,980
Remember that? Yeah, he heard
over him. Yup. True. Back home.

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,130
Jesus Christ. Crazy. Yeah. I
mean, Roy is like six feet tall.

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,540
Stephan's true. Seven feet tall.
Yeah. I mean fucking animal.

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,080
Roy is an animal and I honestly,
I mean look at his gut right there.

54
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,090
How much does that, he weighs
about two 50. Right? He's, he,

55
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not bullshitting.
Yep.

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,710
He is 50 pounds overweight and
he's a world class athlete.

57
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,250
I mean, you cannot say the Roy
Nelson is not a world class fighter.

58
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,150
He's absolutely a world class fighter
and he's 50 pounds overweight.

59
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,250
So you dropped down 50 pounds. Now you're
200 pounds, you make 85. You cut weight.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Everybody does that. Cut 15 pounds. You're
85. You're a world champion. You know,

61
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,770
there's not a butter bean. You
know, we were somewhere, uh,

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,140
and the letter commissioner taught
me from all the boxes on the cart.

63
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:55,020
He had actually the best blood
pressure and cholesterol for, for real.

64
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:59,530
He said we were a shock that the
guy is in the phenomenal shape.

65
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,750
That's what he told us. Yeah. That's
insane. Butter being made him look like,

66
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,800
yeah, you're Rodriguez. Look at
him. Jesus Christ. I actually,

67
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,980
it looks good here is the whole family
is going to look exactly like that.

68
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,810
I hear go upper right hand corner.
Yeah.

69
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,910
That's what he looked like when
he was at its worse. Meanwhile,

70
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,320
he's another guy knocked dude's dead man.
He is so funny.

71
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:24,350
That's such a good time with him and
[inaudible] Prince George in Canada.

72
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:27,190
He was there. He's a player. Oh yeah.

73
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,870
That's hilarious. Very
funny guy. That's funny.

74
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,810
You know he's a fucking hell of a cook.
Apparently

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,450
you can't tell,

76
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,310
but it like there's was watched a video
of butter being cooking some ribs and I

77
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:46,900
was like, damn, that looks legit. Like a
smoker. Who was cooking them in a smoker?

78
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,090
He broke the rule though.
Don't get high if you're on supply.

79
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:02,200
Okay.
