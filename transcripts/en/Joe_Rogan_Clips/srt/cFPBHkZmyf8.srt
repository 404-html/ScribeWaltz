1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,830
But you, you, you've made it out
perfect man, you know, so far, so far,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,130
so far. Years will tell. Yeah.
Do you worry about it? Um,

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,290
not really. Um, like, uh, I try and keep
my mind active. I play a lot of chess.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,570
How often you play chess? Every day.
Really? Yeah. Do you play online?

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,640
I play on line because whoever, whoever
jumps in the battle. How good are you?

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,030
Good. Yeah. Pretty good. Bully.
Did you play? You know, he,

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,510
he used to get mad at me cause I'd
go to his house and he'd be like,

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:37,020
you want to play chess? I
go, I don't know, just play
golf. Play. Just beat me him.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,980
And he was like, get out of
here. Just move, bringing
somebody to complain to you.

10
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,810
Study chess. None as much as I should. Uh,

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,530
I just played often. And uh, you know,

12
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,320
when you play an offering there,
you know,

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,420
people will come out with the
same moves and it's like, oh,

14
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:57,500
I've seen this move before
and know what to do. Right.
Uh, but you know, it depends.

15
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:00,220
There's people that use the palms to,
to,

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,390
to wage war user the nights
or the bishops in combination.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,160
So it really depends on what type
of player they are. You're right.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm a bully play.
I like playing right.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,410
You know what he is the Joe Rogan of
pool to annex of chat. Well listen,

20
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,400
I can, my defense Lennox
challenged me. He watched her.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
I was too late or just two people don't
challenge anybody on their own table.

22
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:25,880
That next challenge.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Giotto came a pool before the podcast
and Joe fucking cleared the table before

24
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:35,050
Lennox could get one shot.
Yeah, it was, it was good. It
was a, that was the warm up.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,610
Well, I won the second game too, so yeah,
he doesn't need the second game as well.

26
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:42,690
I'm still warming up. I will go back.
He's got a, he's got the time deficit.

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,920
That's a crazy game though on that
table because that table has four inch

28
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:51,060
pockets. Yeah, that's my practice table.
Should show you a four inch bucket. Hey,

29
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:55,860
wait a minute. It, uh, I
have a regular table at home.

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,650
Well not a regular tape. It's a diamond's
got four and a half inch pockets.

31
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,520
It's still still a little tired and normal
po Po, like if you go to a pool hall,

32
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:05,120
they'll give you a five inch pocket
or a five and a half inch bolt.

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,050
[inaudible] much fucking,
I got the best. This table,

34
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:13,920
you can't mess. And it's dirty
right now too. So it's, it's even,

35
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:16,200
it's even like the cloth.
It's slow.

36
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,250
So balls don't drop unless they go right
through the same type of coffees up

37
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,600
blood supplies. Yes. That's
the most, that's the best one.
Yeah. It's the best. Yeah.

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,801
It's a great table.

39
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,210
That's a 1972 pool table and some guy
had it in his basement forever and my

40
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:33,790
friend Dani sold it to me. Yeah, the
guy just had it sitting in his basement.

41
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,870
It's in perfect condition. It's
a basement find. Yeah, man,

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,770
that's a hard table to get some
clarity around this California.

43
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:43,710
I love about the table.
Well guess what? What?

44
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,280
You don't want to have to walk around
and take the buckets of balls out of the

45
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:51,550
park. Yeah. That's annoying. Yeah, it's
like ball return. They're all there. Boom.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,730
Yeah, those, those holes. When I got the
crown and I got those, it's annoying.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,910
But you probably have like a
decorative pool table at the house

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,730
even though you've been
invited many times.

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,460
He's been to my house when it was with
my parents and they were kind of my house

50
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,640
as a, as a solo man. Now, um,

51
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,340
when you play chess, um, are
you like, do you get ranked?

52
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,110
Are you, uh, what it
is? Is your, your, um,

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,010
your points go up? So
I'm out of 11, 11, 7,000,

54
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:28,480
1100 right now. Sorry. What is that?
Well, the rankings are like, if, you know,

55
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:32,470
if you're up to 14, you're a master for,
so you're closing it on being a master.

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,210
Well, I wouldn't call me a master yet,
but you know, obviously if I get that,

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm trying to get as high as possible,

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
but if someone talks shit
and they're like Linux,

59
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:45,130
I want to please not pull some
chats. You'd be like, oh, okay. Yeah.

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,640
See straight away what's one of
the most mentally intensive games?

61
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,390
It's probably one reason why you
stay so sharp, I would imagine. Yeah.

62
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,380
There's a time restriction.
10 minutes till you played that,

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,200
that we hit the slap the clock. Yeah.
We'll on 10 minutes for a mover.

64
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,560
10 minutes for the whole game.
For the whole game. Oh Dang.
Whoa. I'm the on the, um,

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,800
it's a fast game, you
know, on the computer.

66
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,600
Once you've made that move at the time
goes over. It just resets. So it's good.

67
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,200
Now. Do you ever go like to Washington
square park and play those dudes done?

68
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,460
Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that was, that
was fun. They talk a lot of Shit, Huh?

69
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh yeah, they're good too.
They're good. The guy was playing,

70
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:26,020
was talking a lot of shit. Yeah.
Yeah. Did you beat him? Um, no.

71
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,230
Wow. You should've hit him. Why
did you have to ask that question?

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,920
It was just fun playing him.
You're gonna be a winner all the time.

73
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:37,390
And those guys are masters.
It's true. I mean, good. They
got nothing else going on.

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,560
Well, I mean, that's all they wanted to.
I mean, when you get really good at chess,

75
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:44,080
and I'm not really good at chess,
but I have friends that are,

76
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,450
they explained to you like
it becomes your whole life.

77
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:48,940
Like you start thinking like as
you're walking down the street,

78
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,650
you're thinking about chess.
He just,

79
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,690
it becomes a thing where
it's just everything.

80
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:56,390
It's all it's so it's such
an intense game. Yeah.

81
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,880
I played like four games a
day. Wow. Online Tam. Yeah.

82
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,200
What's your online name? Um, do
you use an online live? Yes, I do.

83
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,980
They don't use your real name, right? I'm
going to get it right now. It's uh, oh,

84
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,250
I made this name a long time ago and see,
yeah,

85
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,660
I'm Washington Square Park that playing
some masters at MC supernatural.

86
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,600
Those dudes love that game though, Matt.
I mean there's those guys who were there.

87
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,960
If you go there and there'll be there
every day, they fucking live for it.

88
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,920
You know, it's, um, it's one of
those things I really admire.

89
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,850
I really admire people that get her
get really, really good at chess.

90
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,590
Trying to find 2000 Inter,
2000.

91
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:46,300
What does that mean? Well, it was
supposed to be Interpol thousand.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,940
It's like the name and to pull that
sounds official when when people were

93
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:55,690
playing, playing is integral. I think
this is the government I'm planning

94
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,030
Scia so if you're out there and you
play an inter 2000 you're playing Lennox

95
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,840
motherfucking Louis. Yeah, I
was going to put my real name,

96
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,140
but yeah, I don't want everybody
to try and beat the champ.

97
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,270
Well now they're going to send
us retired writing though.

98
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,970
Let it be known that Lennox Lewis is one
of those dudes that walks around with

99
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,570
no case on his iPhone two
and it smashed it smashed.

100
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,660
If I tell you what happens,
what happened?

101
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,580
I was doing something. Then all of a
sudden, you know, my wife said do this.

102
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,590
And I went, whew. And it
flew out of your hand.

103
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,510
But you have the biggest hands of any
human being I know. And A, and there's no,

104
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,030
there's no phone that's gonna be big
enough as you carry an iPad. Well,

105
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,880
let me tell you,
I don't know who makes these iPhones,

106
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,390
but they may come to slip out of your
hands. You know what I mean? They do.

107
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:45,400
They really do like put something on that.
That's grips have a case.

108
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,050
That's the first thing I did was
put a case on right. And then, um,

109
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,500
I forgot what I had to do. You have to
take it off to charge it up or some yeah,

110
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,100
some now he got the wrong case.
You get the wrong case.

111
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,780
Whoever sold your cases an Asshole,

112
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,550
I guess it doesn't have a thing where
you could just stick a hole in it.

113
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,260
Look at it. Never run jre case.
What could these guys challenged?

114
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,220
They're all challenging me or they now
I've got a boy called this game right

115
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:15,090
now. They're gonna come after you now
though. They find out they could play it.

116
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,530
I liked that they're doing it
while we're doing the podcast live.

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,860
I ain't you look, he's going to get
obsessed. The wheels are spinning.

118
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,680
The competitive drive. Let me tell you, my
wife gives me problems on this. He says,

119
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,521
you know,

120
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:29,540
he's playing chess that women don't
understand that you playing chess and

121
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,770
focusing. I'm trying to tell her,
listen, I'm up to this score point.

122
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,700
Don't interrupt because it affects
my score, but I need you now.

123
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,880
I needed to do we need to do this?
That's five minutes please. Five minutes.

124
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,920
You know she's looking at me weird, but
she's gotten better. She's actually,

125
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,540
are you playing chess? So and then she
leaves you alone. Yeah. That's good.

126
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,840
I think because I got mad a
couple of times a problem.

127
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Yeah. Big bully with his wife. Jean.

128
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,760
Play chess with people other than Lennox.
No, I can't play chess, so I don't know.

129
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,630
I can't either. Maybe you and I played
together. We should really learn the gap.

130
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,493
Yeah.
Herded together.

131
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,130
I want to video this game. Do you have any
fucking disgusting? Well, you know what?

132
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,950
You could coach the game. No, this
is the first time I was, I was,

133
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,540
I would ever see a chess game
turned into checkers. Mm. Oh Man.

134
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,410
It's like I said, we're fighting. How,
how do you play this game again? How rude.

135
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,790
All this coming from man doesn't
really know how to play pool. Oh,

136
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,720
you're right. You're right. I play
billiards, billiards, pocket billiards.

137
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,740
You ever played three cushioned billiards?
You know what that is? One, two,

138
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,470
three and then you have to get it.
The whole of the holes,

139
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,020
is that the one with the bumpers?
Yeah.

140
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,940
Well the whole table so you have to
touch it. Yeah. Yeah. That's Russia.

141
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,800
Russian isn't, no, but I mean
Russians play it until a big,

142
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,070
it's real big in South America.
It's real big in Mexico.

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,280
It's real big in parts of
Europe. Real big in Asia. Yeah.

144
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,440
So different game there's
a to two different color
balls and like is he the two

145
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,890
white balls and a red ball or two red
balls and white ball and you got to,

146
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,200
or sometimes it's a yellow ball,
red ball and a white ball.

147
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:13,680
And the idea is you make contact with
one ball and then you have to hit three

148
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:17,450
cushions and then make contact
with the second ball. Wow. Yeah,

149
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:22,140
it's very complicated to watch. It's,
well, if you know how to play it,

150
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,490
it's good to watch. But if you
don't know how to play it, it's,

151
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,990
it's a thing about what I like about
pools. I liked when the ball's disappear,

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,360
like you make a ball goes away, it goes
in that hole by bitch. You sink the ball.

153
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,850
It's like a, it's got a
finality to it. It feels good.

154
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,620
But with that it just clicks. It's
like just Ding, Ding, ding, click.

155
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,660
But the people love it.
Love it.

156
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,510
It's a very intellectual game
cause it's all about geometry.

157
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,360
It's all angles and spin and you know,
I'm not good at that either. Yeah,

158
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,860
it's tricky. It's a tricky
game. I'm not good at it.
