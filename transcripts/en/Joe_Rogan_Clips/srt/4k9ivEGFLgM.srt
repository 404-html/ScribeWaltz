1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,230
You would love it, dude. There's an
octopus who makes a seashell suit.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,610
He literally makes us suit of armor out
of shells to block himself from a shark.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,150
It's nuts. It's super nuts.
Yeah. Animals are huge. I mean,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,480
they're weird and we're,
we're, we're animals.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,560
We don't like to think we are because
we can talk and sing songs and Shit and

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,970
get her eyes done.
But we're,

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,090
we're animals and some sort of strange
way. We're the same as Trump. Yeah.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,290
Do you see the shoe boxy suits somehow?
He's got a good ass Taylor man. Well,

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,730
is the Trump statute. Jamie and I
were talking about it yesterday,

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,740
which was it? The presidential
house of wax or some show? No one.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,180
Please tell me it's bad. It's crazy.
It's like they're punking him.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,950
Do you ever seen it? I look at
it. Look at it though. Good.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,600
Make that larger so he could
see what it looks like.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,580
Operation Trump debuts at Disney world.
But I'm telling you,

15
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,730
it doesn't look anything like him.
Like if I was the person who created like,

16
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:03,810
look, that's George Washington
seems normal, but look at
the Trump one. Wait. Like,

17
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:08,410
what in the fuck is that? It doesn't
look anything like him. Oh God,

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,293
look at him.

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,920
He looks like he's like 20 years older
than he doesn't even look like him.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,660
I mean, whoever that artist is
like he's gotta be punking him is,

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,780
this is no way.
He liked did some weird shit to his jaw.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,150
His jaw is like extended and creepy.

23
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,810
He made his neck skin is the same artist
that did the Chris John, Chris Johnno,

24
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,580
Renaldo bust. You saw that right?
He looks pretty much the same.

25
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,380
And see if you can go find a photo of it.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,440
Because in high res
photos is a low res video.

27
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,430
It's difficult to see how shitty it is,
but it's so shitty that it looks fake.

28
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,470
Like, like no. This is not
really the one. Like, no,

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,670
they fucking commissioned an artist
and this is the artist's creation.

30
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:52,250
Where is this animatronic
question? I don't know, but
I'm going to remember this.

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,890
And Disney world.
Disney land in bread looking,

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,960
um, do you think they are looking
bread? Eric Trump. He looks odd.

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,100
He looks like he has no upper
that come on. Oh my God,

34
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:09,780
that's parking. Good. But either way,

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,210
good or bad.
This is clearly [inaudible] if Hillary,

36
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,450
no, do not tell me that. No two
they saw, okay this is the fire.

37
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:20,340
This guy who at the Obama one.
That's terrible.

38
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,250
They just saw I could do better than
that and I suck at Scott Wax Museum.

39
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,230
Look how bad that is. And it doesn't look
anything like him. Oh God, I turn it off.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,310
It's great that they can do like
Jefferson and Lincoln and all that stuff.

41
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:39,570
Cause all they had was drawings. No,
terrible. Yeah, it was pretty bad.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,010
I don't know how we got onto that.
Oh, humans malleable humans. Yeah.

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,770
I mean I'm hoping, you know, intimate,

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,120
just like slavery doesn't exist
anymore in the United States at least.

45
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,950
I'm hoping that as time goes on there's
going to be less tribalism and then as

46
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,170
human beings are able to freely travel
and communicate with each other that

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,450
we're going to be dealing
with less of this.

48
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:03,480
But isn't it sad that it seems
like it's almost getting worse,

49
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:06,390
even though we have all the information
available at our fingertips, we're still,

50
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:06,601
like,

51
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:10,440
we just elected someone who basically
got famous politically because he said

52
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,570
Obama was a secret
Muslim and Kenyan people.
