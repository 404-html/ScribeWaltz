1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,460
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,770
I also want personal neat for me to
achieve something that is unique,

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:12,210
that is rare, that maybe that never
been attempted before. You know,

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:17,211
that would be something that excites
me and I'm not only driven by money,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,650
you know, like, like, like I, it's
good to have money, like money. It's,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,080
it drives us all,
including myself,

7
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,750
but it's not the unique
thing that drives me.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,300
It needs to be more than
money and they need,

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,220
need to be some kind of achievement that
comes with it. That would exciting me.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,450
So what would that be? That would be
155 pound title. They, they uh, they,

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,180
they offer me Nate Diaz known.
Yeah. And, and, and uh, it was, uh,

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,790
it was a rumor.
It they said it was a done deal.

13
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:50,070
It's not a done deal if not on my part.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,880
And I don't think it was on Nate Diaz part
as well, because from what I've heard,

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,660
his brother Nick set, and even
Nate says, that's his big brother,

16
00:00:58,661 --> 00:00:59,071
his fight.

17
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:03,910
It's not his fight from
Nick, Nate, Nate Diaz's.

18
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:07,230
There is that incredible fight fighter,
a very well rounded.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,480
However,
from if you put yourself in my shoes,

20
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:16,200
there's nothing good that can come out
of it except money and money is not the

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,350
only thing that really drive me.
If I beat Nick Diaz,

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,270
Nate Diaz decisively,
some people will say, ah,

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,210
most people would say, oh, you took an
easy fight or whatever. Like the, the,

24
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:32,630
the criticize them, we'll say, we'll say,
oh yeah, he uh, he's a bully, you know,

25
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:36,180
155 he fought a smaller guide
that compete at a smaller,

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,410
maybe it's not even smarter than me.
Maybe we're about the most fifth one.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,460
A lot of one 55 or the guys are bigger
than me right now. It's a big guy.

28
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,340
He's a big guy. He's about
that same size. I mean,

29
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:51,090
but because I compete at one 74 most of
my carer and you won the title of West,

30
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,530
it wouldn't make me look bad.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,400
They will make me look like a bully
and this is if I win decisively. If I,

32
00:01:56,401 --> 00:02:01,110
for example, if I win, not decisively,
if I wouldn't get savoir back and forth,

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,020
but people was high, you suck. You
cannot even, you know what I mean?

34
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,750
And if I got beat, oh my God,
if I get it, this format,

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,040
this is the end of the world is all the
work I put in is finished and I could

36
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,390
have a bad day.
Yeah.

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,890
Something that I discovered during my
career is being the strongest men in the

38
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,280
world. That's my, that was my dream when
I was young and that's why I did UFC.

39
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:24,500
I want it to be this stronger men in
the world and I realize over there this,

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,540
it did not exist. You cannot be
the stronger men and the world.

41
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,920
This is an illusion. I love the
younger guy. They say, well,

42
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,330
the bad ass man now you're not man,
it doesn't exist.

43
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,550
You would be strong.

44
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,990
You would be a better fighter than this
guy and that particular day at that

45
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:44,400
particular location at that
particular moment, maybe in an hour,

46
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:48,450
if I would ask her an hour later or an
hour before or maybe in a different place

47
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:52,730
where they, the altitude desire or
lower or the different scenario,

48
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,490
different environment, you will lose
that fight. It's always that question of,

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,010
you know what I mean? So being a
stronger man, they're, well it does.

50
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:04,600
Its style makes fight. Maybe we're
three guys. I beat you. You beat him.

51
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,220
He beat me. Who's us? It was the best guy
is no bad guy. Right? That's MMA math,

52
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:12,250
right?
It is like this as the way to see it.

53
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,280
There is no stronger man in the
world. You can't. You'll say, oh,

54
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,470
I'm the baddest man on the
planet because I'm champion.

55
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,240
Like the belting is is an illusion.
The belting belting is assemble,

56
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,920
but it's an illusion. It doesn't exist.
You're not the stronger men in the world.

57
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,270
I know a lot of people will disagree
with me, but is it is what it is. I said,

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,220
if you ask most experienced fighter,

59
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:37,930
and most people would think the same
way because we realize at one point like

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,480
when we're young because of our confidence
or maybe they are the cockiness or

61
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,480
confidence after it.
Not that it fades,

62
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,170
but we we we see we have more
experience with knowledge. We rise,

63
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,370
they tell it's all bs. It's not true.
So the UFC offered you, Nate Diaz,

64
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,960
did you consider it at all
or was it like I consider it,

65
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,210
I consider it however AA I analyze it.

66
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:07,120
I talked with Ferris would what my trainer
and everybody we were all on the same

67
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,420
page on death is say say it's not
what it's not, it's not worth it.

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,710
But did the UFC announce it? Did they say
that they were working on it? I think,

69
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,110
I think they had say that. I'm not sure.
I think they said there was a done deal.

70
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,260
Look, it's not that first time
it happened and, and I'm not,

71
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,170
they have a business to
run the UFC and they're,

72
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:28,171
their biggest fear is someone take that
title and run with it and has been,

73
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,350
I've been doing it two times with Johny
Hendricks and with that and Michael

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,520
Bisping like I run, they say I run.
But it was for the reasons, you know,

75
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:44,320
there's always a reasons and, and
that's their biggest fear. Sure.

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,430
So that the, and I understand that they
have a business to run. It's, but it's,

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,950
it's like WWE when

78
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:58,110
g three the giant passed the torch to
all Cogan he passed that doors because

79
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,930
it's four and a business and he
agreed to pass the torch. Yes.

80
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,260
But the thing in this, in this,
in this part, we're nothing.

81
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:09,160
Wwe is my life on the line here.

82
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't care about the business.

83
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,570
I do what is the best of
all my end threats to me.
Sure. You have to. I have to,

84
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:17,440
I have to be selfish and I am selfish.

85
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,441
I say it open the I am I say it to the
fan to every I am selfish because it's a,

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,830
it's a sport that I can die,
man,

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,800
you can die in this sport and this is
the truth can get or not. Maybe not that,

88
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,040
but it could create,

89
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,160
create at your death in there next
time to come in the next year.

90
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,440
Maybe you get at below that messed up
something in your brain because of a

91
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,780
trauma that create the something else.

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,760
So it's a very serious sport man.
Is is not like a, you play hockey,

93
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:50,590
play baseball, play football. You don't
play finding. So you do it for yourself.

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,600
You do what is best for yourself.

95
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,690
The organization will do what
is best for the organization.

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,830
They are not your friend,
right?

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,280
So that's why the relationship with
Dana and some of the guy in UFC,

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,680
it's a very special relationship.

99
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,160
Maybe one day we'll sit down and we'll
talk about the good old day then and have

100
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:11,570
a blast. Have a laugh more. Right now
we always am always on the defensive.

101
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,370
When my phone rang,
I see that no way.

102
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,180
Like God damn like then
I say what I should say,

103
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:18,730
what I should not say then and then,
uh,

104
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,780
and I'm completely honest about
it is like some virus or no man,

105
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,740
I just as I, if you do that because
you are in need yet, if you do that,

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,490
if you just take any fight that fight in
that name. No, I mean it doesn't work.

107
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:36,210
Like that isn't the ascension
to be champion is not a
straight line is this all

108
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,700
is a nap stucco there, you know,
then you come back and that is it.

109
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:40,790
It is what it is.

110
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,820
It is what it is and you need to be
surround by smart people and if you don't

111
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,680
want to have smart people,

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,220
you need to be smart enough to find
those people that are competent,

113
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,230
that will help you in particular domain,

114
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:56,120
that you are not competent to make the
job for you and complete your circle,

115
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,090
you know? Yeah. Dana was saying for a
while that you didn't want to fight.

116
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,970
He was saying George doesn't
want to fight. He's Seth. Before.

117
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:05,050
I didn't want to fight before I fought
Bisping. You know, he said that life. Why?

118
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,020
Why do you think you were saying that?

119
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,600
Do you think he was putting
pressure on you psychologically?

120
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,380
It was fucking with your head. Yeah,
so I'm so by ego. What made me,

121
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,020
I'll show you that I couldn't
fight. Bring me those guy. Right?

122
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,450
That's where it is bad. It's I
freaking game. It's all a game.

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,660
We say it's not a game. It's real out.
It's all a game. It's all business.

124
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,480
It's all a game. I like Dana, Dana Man.

125
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,110
Thus part was nowhere.
That sparked was government.

126
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,120
He didn't go nowhere because of Dana.
We hold Dana,

127
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,980
my living,
I hoe it to Dana white when I do the UFC.

128
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:44,120
Wayans when I introduced
everybody, I pointed him, I
say, Dana White. Without him,

129
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:47,480
none of this would be possible and you
write a hundred percent a hundred percent

130
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,410
ease that best pound for pound
promoter of all time of all.

131
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,760
I don't care about dunking. Wherever
you, Dana White is the best.

132
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,820
He's better than all sport. Include
it. I'd never seen anything like this.

133
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,850
He can sell ice to an Eskimo if he want
to ease an incredibly good fun and he's

134
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,900
good at messing up with my head too.

135
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:11,060
Because even though I
sometimes my ego was like Nate,

136
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,880
Nate Diaz it because of the stuff
he said to and the way they try.

137
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:18,470
I don't if the UFC tried to make him
say stuff because some fighters are more

138
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:23,270
like pond on a chest on a check
Cherchez board than others.

139
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,620
Me, I'm not, I don't follow
when everything analyze.
I'm thinking, I was like,

140
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,960
why you say that? Why? Okay, that's big.

141
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,980
So a lot of stuff I've been
selling my ego somewhere like, man,

142
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,030
why didn't I want to say alright you
think my, my schedule is too busy.

143
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:40,490
I'll dark dark forest there. No, I
kicked her out. You know what I mean?

144
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,050
But I shall not do it at this as Tupin
move. If I start acting like this,

145
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm Barone and I lot of guide,

146
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:50,660
they don't have that self control
and self discipline in them.

147
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,890
It's all that game, man. That's all
that game there was. It's not, it's all,

148
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,440
it's bs. It's all a game,
man. It's all a game.

149
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,110
What did Nate say the fucks with you.
Oh, okay. Made the eyes and, and Nick,

150
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,830
nick is that I kind of together.

151
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:09,150
And then when they say that I took
steelhead when I fought this brother, uh,

152
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,440
sorry, I messed up my
glove, my, my rap. Um,

153
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,120
I didn't make weight. And uh, what did
you say? Oh yeah. Put something in the,

154
00:09:19,121 --> 00:09:22,710
in the ivy of his brother. So he said
if I want to take care of it, like if,

155
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,440
I don't know, I, you said it in his own
like word, like in English slang, like,

156
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,170
oh yeah. If you want to take charge
of this, I'm there. You know,

157
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,890
said someone poisoned him.
Breathe. Yes. Who was, was
that for? Which fight was that?

158
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,940
Is that Anderson Silva? Okay, I got
to confess the Joe, I gotta confess.

159
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,710
I got to confess. Okay. I was,

160
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,040
I was so scared during this,
this fight.

161
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,220
So we tried to poison,
I was so scared of fighting Nick Diaz.

162
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:54,750
So we poison is ivy,
but the survived,

163
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,380
so it was even more terrify, you know, so

164
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,190
all the athletic commission
was on my prior role.

165
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,920
So they treat their way and then I made it

166
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,360
and it went through.
So I was even more than RFI.

167
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,590
So the Elio and abduct me
and they put the Gamma Ray.

168
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,210
Do I increase my strength like the og,

169
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,400
like I performance enhancing drug and
ended the fight was still happening.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,260
So right before I put some
glass and cement and my gloves,

171
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,450
make sure and still add a
crazy hard fight, you know?

172
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,220
So I got to confess with Nick Mile, but
it's completely insane. You know, fight.

173
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,220
You said all that you said, you said
for my fight that I present is ivy,

174
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,560
that I was unstable aid, that I, my my,

175
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,810
my rap was wrong. And,
and you said also what,

176
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,290
what did you said that
you said? Yeah, Dad, Eh,

177
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,260
the way and like I didn't make weight.

178
00:10:55,261 --> 00:11:00,000
Like I w I tricked the athletic
commission or a, they were on my legs.

179
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,930
It's all like, it's just funny.
I think easy. He has that.

180
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,510
He has that problem of constipation,
transpiration, eat to eat.

181
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,920
Take everybody's against him.
You know, paranoia. Yes. I
think that's the way it is.

182
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,750
That might be the weed. It could be
weed. They said, hey, I don't want to,

183
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,010
I don't want to say nothing bad
about the way that they get.

184
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,610
Yeah.
