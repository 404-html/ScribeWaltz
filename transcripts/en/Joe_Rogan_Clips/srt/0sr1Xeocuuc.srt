1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,170
There's a supermassive black hole,
the center of every galaxy. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,400
But there's also other black holes that
aren't necessarily in the center of

3
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:10,090
galaxies.
So these little ones,

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,170
a little [inaudible] a few times the
mass of the sun and they're from collapse

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,780
styles. So they are stars
at the end of their life,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,540
very bigger than us and
more massive than the sun.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,690
But they run out of their fuel and they
start to collapse because gravity squash

8
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,680
she's done.
And if they're sufficiently massive,

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,170
then there's nothing that
can stop the collapse.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,700
And so they collapse as far
as we know to a point, right.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,720
Essentially an infinitely dense point.
We don't really know what happens.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,360
We don't know what happened
right in the middle,

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,890
but they collapsed to such an extent that
there's a region around it where from

14
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:52,710
which light can't escape. And that's
uh, so nothing can escape and that,

15
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:57,690
that's a black hole. And what
happens to them? Do they travel?

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,010
They moving through space? Yeah.
There, there, there, there still stars.

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,210
So they, they still there, um, they,

18
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,960
they surrounded this region where you
fall in, it's called the event horizon.

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,010
And if you go across that horizon,
then you are going to the center.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,290
There's one way of thinking about it,
which is quite cool,

21
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:21,150
which is that at the time and space sort
of flip is one way to think about it.

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,900
So in the same way that we are
going into the future now, so,

23
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,450
so we're going to tomorrow,
there's nothing we can do about it.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,920
We are going to tomorrow. Um, in the
same way, if you fall in the cross,

25
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:35,190
the event horizon of a black hole,
you are going to the middle,

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,180
the singularity is called. So
that's, that's your future. Every,

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,260
every line of your future points
to the center of the black hole.

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,970
So it's kind of the ultimate of
no escape for the ultimate prison.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,500
You're going to get squashed to
an infinitely dense. So point,

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,360
not every star becomes a black hole
at the end of its life. Now. Cause if,

31
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,110
if I'm syncing light the sun and we
have a small star, it's quite small.

32
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,640
Yeah. And when it collapses,
there's, uh, there's a, uh,

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,040
I saw the pressure of force,
if you like,

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,370
which is caused by the fact that electrons
don't like to be very close to each

35
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,380
other. So it's called the
Paleo exclusion principle.

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,910
But essentially what happens is that
says they get squashed closer and close

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,200
together. They move faster and faster to
get out of each other's way, if you like.

38
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,960
And that makes a force
which holds them up.

39
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,200
And so that creates what's
called a white dwarf star. So,

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,950
so you can have a blob of Matzoh,
they're about the size of the earth,

41
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,660
but they're about the mass of the sun. And
uh, so that's, that's for smaller stars.

42
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,400
They end up as these white dwarf things,

43
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:45,150
which are very dense
objects as another version,

44
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,410
which is called a neutron star, which
is the same thing, but for neutrons.

45
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,410
And they move faster and
faster. So the, if it's,

46
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:55,800
if it's massive enough that he
overwhelms the electron thing,

47
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,050
then the electrons so fought,

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,080
crush into and turn into neutrons
and the whole thing starts again.

49
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,930
And so a neutron star can be,
you know,

50
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,330
elite one and a half times the
mass of the sudden, let's say.

51
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,710
But it can be about what,
10 miles across. So,

52
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,090
so that's an incredibly dense
ball of matter held up by this.

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,790
The neutrons moving around.
It's got a fancy name,

54
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,250
it's called Neutron degeneracy pressure.
But that's what it is.

55
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,410
But if you go even bigger than even that,
can't hold it up. And as far as we know,

56
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:29,380
then there's no known force
that we know of that can hold,

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,930
hold the thing up if was too massive.

58
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,230
And so that's when it just almost
winks out of existence, if you like,

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,700
it collapses and collapses and collapses
and that's when you get a black hole.

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,360
We try it.

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,140
Put that into perspective. The, the sun
is a million times bigger than the earth.

62
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,930
Yeah.
And there's this neutron star is,

63
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,590
would you say one and a half times
the mass of the SAS 10 miles wide.

64
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,960
Yeah. Yeah. So, and the loads of that
around that, they're cold wholesales.

65
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,010
So we, we, we see those
all over the place. That,

66
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,250
the first one that was discovered was
called LGM GM one because their spin very

67
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,880
fast.
And then the,

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,280
it was called LGM one cause it's a very
regular pulse and they thought it was a

69
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:13,210
little green men, so they called it kind
of jokingly little green men one. And um,

70
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,470
so yeah, we, we've seen that
there's one called the crab pulsar,

71
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:21,430
which is in the crab Nebula,
which we saw the CIF for Nova Explosion.

72
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,520
So that's when one of the stars
explode at the end of its life and then

73
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:26,650
collapses to form a neutron star.

74
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,560
And we saw that in 10
54 Aidy Wa wasn't it?

75
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,670
There's some speculation that our Gao or
our source system at one point was had,

76
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:42,171
it was a binary star system and that
one of those stars had become a dwarf.

77
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,060
I don't know. Um, some,

78
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:50,680
someone had said something about that
in relationship to the dense object they

79
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:54,040
believe is outside of the Kuyper belt.
Yeah. I mean there's some evidence,

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,020
the bits of evidence that there's
something out there. Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,510
It could because of the
periodic extinctions and
things on earth that you get

82
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:04,420
periodic bombardments from out
in the Kuyper belt. So yeah,

83
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,300
I think one of the theories is
the attic extinctions. Well, yes,

84
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,340
I figured out like they,
you know, they've been,

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,110
there had been mass extinctions on
earth when a lot of the life died.

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,890
And, um, we don't know what
caused all those, but, um,

87
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,300
sometimes their impacts from space,
that seems clear. And so, yeah,

88
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,750
there are theories that there's something
orbiting out there which can disrupt

89
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,310
all these objects out in the kite.

90
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:32,200
The belt that sends loads of comets and
asteroids inwards to the inner solar

91
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,810
system.
And that can cause havoc.

92
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,530
And so there's some people
look at those theories.
