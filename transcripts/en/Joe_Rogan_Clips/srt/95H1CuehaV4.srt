1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,470
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,720
It's just crazy to me that you got so
deeply entrenched reading the story that

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:09,520
you started getting into Santa Maria.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,080
I was actually until I was married
to a Brazilian for 10 years. Ah.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,400
So they have their centers in the,
he is called Macuna.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,080
And what's different about their version?

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,120
It's almost exactly the same and
they have all the same saints.

8
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:25,150
It's the same thing. Same thing because
of the slave trade came through Brazil,

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,360
Africa,
Catholicism mixing.

10
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,710
They that just the music is different
with the Cubans. It's a Roomba.

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,620
All this wonderful room
or music that you hear a,

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,280
there's a whole bunch of great
music that grows up around it.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,990
So you were married to a Brazilian woman,

14
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,150
get divorced to keep the religion
cause that what happened? Uh,

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,830
yeah,
I was,

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,160
I can't go to places like Cuba and
Brazil because I get so influenced and

17
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:56,580
overwhelmed by the changes, the
direction of my life. Really.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,520
I went to Brazil the first
full day I was in Brazil.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,480
I fell in love with the woman that I
married and lived with for the next 10

20
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,530
years.
Wow.

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,890
When I go to Q a it's dangerous
to me because I'm so uh,

22
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,910
seduced by it.
I'm so intoxicated by Havana,

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,650
by Cuban culture. What is it? Well,

24
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,341
first of all,

25
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:26,341
it's the most sensual place you have
an is the most sensual place I've ever

26
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:29,830
been. Everyone flirts, the women flirt.

27
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:32,140
Doesn't matter if they're married
or not married, they flirt with you.

28
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:35,770
I suppose guys flirt
too. Um, everyone flirts,

29
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:40,060
there's like sexual energy everywhere.
The Sky and the,

30
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:44,800
and the climate is just kind of
sultry and, and, and sensual.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,130
The music is,
makes your body move.

32
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,591
Joe,

33
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:53,591
would you let me play a video for you to
show you some of the dancing and Cuba?

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,460
Sure. When women dancing
Cuban, they cover that pussy

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,230
because what I'm trying to do,

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,160
the whole dance is me baiting you.

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,550
It's one of the prettiest things
you've ever seen in your life.

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,320
It's me coming up to you
with this movement. Like when
I played it like you all,

39
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,880
I was getting nowhere with DOL.

40
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,910
I was getting going with
us way before the podcast.

41
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:24,080
He was tightening up so I had to
play low Papinas. Then my town size,

42
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:29,380
and once he heard that
I could see Nigeria coming alive.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,360
He even got up and
kicked his leg one time,

44
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:36,080
which meant we're on because
it's so embedded in your culture.

45
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,290
But in Cuban dancing,
I'm coming up to you. Oh.

46
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,100
And every time I come up and I'll
go like this and go like this. Yeah,

47
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,540
you got to come and put your ass.

48
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,290
But the whole time he'll be covering
your pussy because I'm the exchange.

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,520
I go to grab your pussy.

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Harvey Weinstein would do phenomenal.
Here's how serious I take it. By the way,

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,780
what is this? Oh, I love, I love
Afro Cuban music, Latin Jazz.

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,310
So I'm hosting,

53
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,810
I'm curating and hosting a Latin jazz
series in New York at a bar called sync

54
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,850
every Thursday night,
Tj English and his Latin jazz explosion.

55
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,180
So I get to choose the music,
the musicians that performed there,

56
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:20,440
and I and I host the evening.
Wow, you do this every week. Yeah,

57
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,820
we're going to cry. Try to just
keep, keep it going indefinitely.

58
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,060
That's phenomenal.

59
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,450
So this to you was a natural subject
to sort of ink engross yourself?

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,060
Well, I had written, I had
published the book, Havana Nocturne,

61
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,830
which was about the mob in Cuba in
the 50s. Um, and I really got into it.

62
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,240
Then I made numerous trips to
Havana for extended periods.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,210
So this book was almost
like a sequel to that. Yeah.

64
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,950
It was a nice way to revisit that culture.
Pick up the thread of that story.

65
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,460
Uh, cause this one is sort of an answer.
You get to the end of the event, uh,

66
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,570
Havana Nocturne. Then you, you ask
yourself, so then what happened?

67
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,620
What happened after the mafia got chased
out of Cuba? What was their response?

68
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,910
How did they take it? I want to show
you this as a Cuban dancing. Okay.

69
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,670
What does it say? What's the name of
the, well, I call this a little bit,

70
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,750
watch to see how everything
is. Look, look at this.

71
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,763
Uh,

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,100
yeah. It just gives a little
fuzzy. So it's watch, hold me.

73
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,170
Holbys about maybe watch him move
so that they talking about genes,

74
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,170
about what was the DOL, see
he went to grab up. Was He,

75
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,710
so the dancers is a seduction. The
seduction, they're both there. They're,

76
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,540
they're engaged in a mutual seduction.

77
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,370
Uh, this is a crazy dance.
Jamie, what's the name of this?

78
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,850
Show it to me.
Guar.

79
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,140
Say that Joe and Co is the
rhythm one goal is the real you a

80
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,560
lot more and when you're
Ketos Ketos m u n e Q.

81
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,900
U. I. T. O. S. D. My time's up. My
Time's, this is the province then. Wow.

82
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,540
Watch how she grabs a pussy
every time he comes close.

83
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,153
Okay.

84
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,560
Now that mute. Does it grab it seems kind
of grab it and she blacked it. Oh yeah,

85
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,930
that'll fuck around.
That's hilarious.

86
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,610
Drumming you're hearing and the use
of what's called the Shaker Ray.

87
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:30,540
That Gord there and the chanting
that's going on that you would all,

88
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,620
you would hear all that in
a Santeria ceremony. Wow.

89
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,120
This grabbing the pussy shit is
hilarious. Hilarious. Hilarious. Yeah.

90
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,650
He kept trying to kick out to his junk
to occasionally, right originally,

91
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,930
but he's probably just checking
how are we doing down there?

92
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,120
See like he's grabbing it. He's like
squeezing it to see if it's hard.

93
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,350
He just played with it. He just
threatened the grab and she grabbed it.

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,410
That's hilarious. So it's very
playful. Flirtatious. Right.

95
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,520
And this is the culture there?
That's Cuba.

96
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,340
Okay.
