1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,000
So with sterling it's like sterling
called out Covington. Yeah. Garb. Rant.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,873
Yeah.
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,440
I'm saying Colby Covington already
cause I'm already thinking that mother

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,250
Gamelin that marketing.
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,390
Well he's good at talking shit and getting
his name out there and it's the best

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,630
thing for the welterweight
division right now.

7
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,300
After it loose man just
dominated Tyron Woodley.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,390
I was blown away by that fight me to
loan away. I were texting each other.

9
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:28,830
It's weird cause I had people around the
house to watch the fights and they were

10
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:32,430
like, God, this fight so boring. And I
look online like God, this is brutal.

11
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:35,250
I'm like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,080
I was one of the greatest title fight
performances I've ever seen her forever to

13
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,710
do that to Woodley and dismantle him.
You don't understand.

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,010
You have no idea what you're watching.
It's fucking insane.

15
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:50,760
It's not just insane that he dismantled
them, which is for sure insane.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760
But also his fucking gas tank Uzman was
pushing on the pedal for five fucking

17
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,910
rounds.
Never let off the gas.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,180
How about the way he looked in between
rounds when Dan and to me it was his

19
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:06,150
mentality. When you look from
the f, the first round she was,

20
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:10,160
they break it up and then you're ready
standing there like this. I'm like, oh,

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,130
he was, do you know that word was
that he had a fractured foot? Correct.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,690
So he took a fucking cortisone shot coming
into that fight. Imagine that savage.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,110
Imagine that and still no
problems with his endurance.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,440
Apparently didn't train the whole
week of just didn't do shit.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,020
Still made the weight. No problem.
But think about what he has to do.

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,560
His coach is gone. You got to go
in there. You got to out grapple.

27
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,820
How maneuvered Tyrone Woodley, who's one
of the best welterweights of all time?

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,340
Well he,
how does he get taken down?

29
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,050
Did empties and get taken dad who doesn't
get taken down? He also was kind of,

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,390
I dunno, he's 37 I don't know if it's,
he just didn't show up what happened.

31
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,590
But he's 36 [inaudible] 36 either way.
Same thing.

32
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:53,160
Either way he's been doing for a hot
second. This is why I feel bad for thing.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,450
Maybe you know Joe,

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,190
but Woodley was always that guy
where he didn't get along with Dana.

35
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:03,000
He was kind of difficult to deal with,
did it his way and made some demands,

36
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,120
want the big fight and then it never
happened for him. Right. He just,

37
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,230
he was in a big draw and but he could get
away with that when he was champ right

38
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,010
now that he's not champ the road frame
to get back cause going to be so fucking

39
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:16,380
tough. Right. Because of what
he did when he was champ.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,350
That's why I feel bad for Woodley and
he's one of the greatest to ever do it.

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,960
He is one of the greatest to ever do
it and I was making the argument before

42
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:23,450
this fight that he,
you could argue,

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,850
you could argue that if he beats Guzman
spawn, he is the greatest. Correct.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,580
He's in the, the the greatest
is George Saint Pierre, right.

45
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:33,900
He was a legend at welterweight.
You, you look at his career,

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,330
I mean how many years
was George to champ for?

47
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:39,540
Was it six years or something crazy
that the most title. So you have George,

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,190
Matt Hughes and Woodley Matthews has
legend status because he was the original,

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,570
right?
He was,

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,220
I mean he was the first wrestler that
really developed rock solid submission

51
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:55,140
skills. The, the fights with frank
Trigg, the f I mean he, when he,

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,160
um, armbar George Saint Pierre and their
first fight, I mean he was amazing.

53
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,840
But then the new school was George,
you know,

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,260
George was the best
welterweight of all time,

55
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,590
but I was saying that d he's
in the running right now.

56
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,790
If you consider the opponents he beat
Wonderboy twice, knocks out Robbie Lawler,

57
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,590
the wind, the title, and then goes
on from there. Beats Damien Maia.

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,240
Um,
I mean you,

59
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,900
you look at how he beat Darren till
for some reason he was an underdog and,

60
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,910
and Darren till five,
which didn't make any sense to me.

61
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,140
I thought everybody got
excited. I got excited too. I
thought Dan is going to win.

62
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:33,980
That really? I did see, I thought Darren
tills very good, but I did not do much.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,170
I never saw him on the ground.

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,290
I never saw a real wrestler take
him down and ground and pound.

65
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't know what he had off his bass.
He,

66
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,920
I think there until it can be a prompt
for Huseman what really is size.

67
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,460
Yeah. I think we see a problem and Dan
has committed to one seven. He still is.

68
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,270
He still, I think especially
now that one 70 cause what is,

69
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,620
if you are a fan of fighting,

70
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,610
what is fun is Woodley be an out
the welterweight division. So fun.
