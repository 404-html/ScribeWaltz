1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,700
Um,
how did you wind up living in Mexico City?

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,230
So I,

3
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:09,231
I came to Mexico or went to
Mexico in the year 2000 and uh,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,400
I kind of messed around
for a few years in the UK.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,170
What did the game to journalism.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,060
So I found one way to get into it was
to start working in a foreign country

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,020
rather than going to my local newspaper
and work and go to a foreign country and

8
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:27,460
start working and had a romantic idea
about Latin America, thinking I'd be like,

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,620
I saw the movie Salvador. Ah, you know,
Oliver Stone's movie from the 80s.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,410
I kind of had a, had a, had
a romantic idea about running
around with grillers, um,

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,330
fighting military dictatorships.
Um,

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,160
so I arrived in Mexico
in 2000 and got a job at,

13
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,990
I had an English language newspaper.
How old were you?

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,630
27 when I first left the UK.
Yeah,

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,970
28 when I mess around for
a bit in Mexico as well.

16
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:50,200
And then got the job when I was 28.

17
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,310
Mexico City is a wild place. Yeah. Yeah.
It's so packed. It's, it's hard to,

18
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:56,900
I've only been there twice
for a UFC events. Yeah.

19
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,510
But every time I'm there
I'm just shaking my head.

20
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:01,480
Like I can't believe how it's
traffic works. It's crazy. Yeah.

21
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:03,610
18 years and nothing,
a lot of time in that traffic.

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,280
Nobody cares about red lights,
green lights, they don't care.

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,100
It's stressful at Evelyn. Cut. Who
wants to cut you up all the time? Yeah.

24
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,540
People shout at you a lot.

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,010
You'd have to get used to people
calling you like Ben Deco Salvador.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,850
I tried different tactics, not
just one, relax and not get angry.

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,190
Did you know how to speak Spanish
before you went there? Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:24,550
So I spent one year in Spain living in
Spain before I went there and spent a

29
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,050
year in the Middle East

30
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,770
as well. Um, and uh, but yeah,

31
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:31,320
I started off when I arrived I
spoke more to Spanish, Spanish,

32
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,030
which is like all yet DLC on your deal.

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,180
And then I change more to like the
Mexican Spanish, which is like,

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,460
or your way keep us all away.

35
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,450
Right, right, right. Yeah.

36
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,950
So when did you start getting
into narco journalism?

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,400
So like I arrived, say with a romantic
idea about why might cover in, in,

38
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:50,591
uh,

39
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:55,591
in Mexico or Latin America and right away
realize all that idea of grillers and

40
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,900
military dictatorships that are, that
are gone. That was the last century,

41
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,730
Che Guevara, all that stuff out of
gone. But right away when I arrived,

42
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,310
my very first of all,
first back in the UK,

43
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,050
I grew up around a lot of drugs in the UK.

44
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,630
So going back to the eighties,
I grew up a lot of people taking drugs.

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,160
I had a few friends who died from heroin
overdoses back then for people I knew

46
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:21,730
died of heroin overdoses.
I had a sister who went,

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,240
who became a schizophrenia
smoking a lot of,

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,330
a lot of winner.
She was,

49
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:32,260
became schizophrenic and there'd be a lot
of drugs being smoked around that time

50
00:02:32,261 --> 00:02:33,080
as well.

51
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,740
Was it pot? Yeah, back then it was
a Moroccan hashish. There's, there,

52
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,660
there is a connection, you know, and
we've been exploring that a lot lately.

53
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,820
We went into this, uh, marijuana
debate between, um, uh,

54
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:51,530
Alex Bernstein and I'm Dr. Mike Hart
from Canada and we talked about it.

55
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:56,531
And I know people that have
had that happen to them or
they've had schizophrenia

56
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:00,370
or a psychotic breaks
because of just massive doses

57
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,203
of marijuana.

58
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,980
And especially people that don't do it
or people that do it too much for too

59
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,890
long. It does happen. I had that debate.

60
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,860
That's one of the reasons why
it came to mind. Uh, I mean,

61
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:16,060
I don't know a lot of people smoke weed,

62
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,910
smoke hash while people,
it's fine now when,

63
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:23,911
when my sister had a breakdown when she
was 18 and I was 16 at a time and when

64
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,580
that came out it turned out also my,
my,

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,730
my grandmother had an issue
with schizophrenia and I think,

66
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:35,020
I don't know if it's a time bomb waiting
to go off or if it was how much the,

67
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,900
the, the hatch was involved in
that. There's other issues as well.

68
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,750
So I don't really know the science
of it, but Ben way going back. So,

69
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:46,480
so I've been around a lot of drugs
before. Um, so when I arrived in Mexico,

70
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,540
actually one of the first,
uh, first arriving in Mexico,

71
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,730
I ended up hanging around with some,

72
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,820
some people and they were smoking
a lot of crack in, in Mexico.

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,380
It's one of some of the first people I
met. Wow. Um, I went down to the beach,

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,800
like backpacking down to the beach and
these people were smoking, smoking crack.

75
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,880
And I was like,
this is kind of strange.

76
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,770
I didn't know those people
smoking crack down here.

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,210
So when I got a job at the
local newspaper in English,

78
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,700
and I just started looking
at the crime thing,

79
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,480
one of the first deals I did was on the
issue of crack being sold locally and

80
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:21,140
how that linked her to cartels. And
then very soon does very, very quick.

81
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:23,800
I just fell in right away. Like I said,
are these things happen by accident?

82
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:28,540
I just fell into covering the crime
beat and this is going back to 2001.

83
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,330
So 2001, it was the same year that
chapel was man escaped from prison. Uh,

84
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,930
then I was calling a lot then to
a great journeys from twiner has,

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,970
is blank on Ellis.

86
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,510
You're a real legend from Tijuana
who survived the shooting by it,

87
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:47,350
by cartels and you know,
phoning him up all the time.

88
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:50,800
Just getting him and had given me
information can be tips and that is how it

89
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,840
really started with it. And our big
store, I did it back in those days was a,

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,560
the court marshal of some
generals for drug trafficking.

91
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,920
And that was really where it began back
then. Generals for drug trafficking.

92
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,000
How much of an issue is that? Uh, I mean,

93
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,210
corruption must be unbelievably rampant.

94
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,170
So I mean, corruption even isn't
a strong enough word for it. Um,

95
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,050
sometimes I call it state capture.
I mean,

96
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:17,050
so this is the real beginning and this
has been a whole crazy 18 years of

97
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:19,840
covering this stuff. And this is
just the very beginning back then.

98
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,480
I've seen a whole lot of
crazy stuff in that time.

99
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,410
But like just to get a sense of
how bad the corruption is or,

100
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,250
or what it really means. And on,
on the ground level, they're like,

101
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:34,010
there's a policemen let
you interview policemen,

102
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,420
you get to know the policemen in
a certain town, certain city. Um,

103
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,600
and it's hard to know now or,

104
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,360
or military guys are politicians and you
want to believe these are good people.

105
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,660
You want to believe there's good policemen
out there who really want to stop

106
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:51,310
crime. So there was one policeman,
his nickname was tight at Dyson,

107
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,090
like Mike Tyson, his nickname was Tyson
because he was a well built bloke,

108
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,400
well built guy and uh,

109
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,050
he was friendly with depressed
governed from Mitchell,

110
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,330
friend friendly would depress.
Um,

111
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,350
and then it came out that he was actually
a drug cartel member ranking member in

112
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:14,410
a drug cartel. And he
actually confessed, they,

113
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,790
they used to have a thing where
the police, the federal police,

114
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,330
when they got him going to confess
on camera and he confessed,

115
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:25,160
not only was he turning a blind eye,
not only was he carrying out murders,

116
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:29,270
he was training the young kids how to the
capitate people, how to cut people up.

117
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,070
And it was expanding in graphic
detail how he like in a,

118
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:35,660
how they might have to cut limbs off,

119
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,710
how it gives young people train the cut
limbs off to get them to lose their fear.

120
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,400
So that's the level of corruption that
could be a policeman you're dealing with

121
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:46,670
and that's really who they are.
Um,

122
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,700
so that's one of the crazy things
about a corruption down there.

123
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:54,790
Did you have any hesitancy in getting
involved in narco journalism knowing this?

124
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,211
I mean,

125
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:01,211
I would imagine that's one of the
most dangerous avenues to pursue in

126
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,960
journalism. So this was little by
little, I got involved in covering this.

127
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:08,210
So like it like going back to
2000 and this hadn't happened,

128
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:12,110
this war hadn't happened. It was still
like a crime issue at that moment.

129
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,780
So I began to cover these things and
then around 2004 I got a job for the

130
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,840
Houston chronicle out of
Houston, Texas. I was covering,

131
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,320
I was a stringer covering Mexico for them
and I flew up to a lot to Nuevo Laredo

132
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,830
and there was a turf war beginning there,

133
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,730
which is really the beginning of the
drug war, which is toward Mexico.

134
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:39,200
Part began on the border with Texas in
this city called Nuevo Laredo over the

135
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,490
bridge from Laredo,

136
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,670
Texas back in 2004 so there was a lot
of interest from the Texas newspapers,

137
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,230
what was going along as a whole bunch
of bodies piling up there. But again,

138
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,770
it's going back to these days and
this is kind of innocent looking back,

139
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,010
innocent, looking at myself. Then an
innocent looking at what Mexico is like.

140
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,820
Then they would simply say, go to
the place, I draw up the Monterey,

141
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,530
rent a car,

142
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,690
and just drive the car to Norbury
either with bus by myself.

143
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,290
And now people just don't do that. There's
just too much crazy stuff going on.

144
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,270
But back then it was still
light or you can just do that.

145
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,380
So there was this crazy stuff, like
what kind of crazy stuff? I mean,

146
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,430
now you can get stopped by an armed
group driving on those roads. He could,

147
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:25,730
you could just drive along and it could
be a group of guys with guns could stop

148
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,010
the car, get someone out,
takes, take your way. I mean,

149
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:32,150
there's a whole people a lot more careful
about, you know, where you are now now.

150
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,390
And um,

151
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,120
when you move around a roads that you've
gotta be very careful how you move and

152
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:39,620
how you plan this stuff. He didn't just
wander by yourself. Dry ran his places.

153
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,140
So, so back then when this was
happening and um, there was, uh,

154
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,950
these body turning up and I was trying
to figure out why. And, and I, uh,

155
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:52,370
there was one a guy interviewed who
was a head of chamber of commerce.

156
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,140
Um, and, uh, talk to me, no very
guy. About a couple of weeks later,

157
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:01,440
he became the chief of police for
the city and they asked him and said,

158
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,270
are you scared? Um, and I used to
get about being killed. He said, no,

159
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,011
I'm not scared.
I said,

160
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:11,011
of the corrupt people who get killed
and he was shot dead six hours after he

161
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:15,900
gave that statement, they shot him dead.
And that was one of the real markers.

162
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,760
If something really strange
is going on in Mexico,

163
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:21,620
something is like going
to erupt in Mexico. Uh,

164
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,880
and then from there it kind of just
escalated and escalated and uh, um,

165
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,340
started working by the other media,
Time magazine, New York Times,

166
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,370
different people in after what I said,
I can't do the [inaudible] right.

167
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,401
New stores about it.

168
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:37,170
It's got to write books about this
because this stuff is big and it's

169
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:38,004
complicated.

170
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,570
It must be immensely complicated
for the people that live there.

171
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,080
It seems like there's no escape.
I mean, if you, you can't

172
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,530
turned to the police, the police are the
cartel. There's the cartel, the police,

173
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,690
all of the politicians, most likely if
they're alive, have to be compromised.

174
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,460
Yeah. I mean there's been some varied,
very desperate people and I mean,

175
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,220
there's been some bird has
been some inspirational
people as well. Fight in this.

176
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:06,490
There's been heroes. There are heroes. Um,

177
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:10,030
just to get more of a sense of what that
means on the ground as well. Uh, I and I,

178
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:13,240
and some of the things
you see, uh, you know,

179
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:15,460
some of the things that stay
with me in Africa for a while,

180
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:18,190
it was quite romantic covered next.
It was like, wow, I'm covering,

181
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,700
I'm going to these places where Chapo
goes, man is from, you know, what,

182
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:26,230
I've got up to the village of me's mother
meets family. I'm writing about these,

183
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,210
these crazy people. But then you start
seeing the, the human pain in all of this.

184
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,690
Um, one of many stories that stick
with me was a mother in Monta Ray,

185
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,420
a school teacher. You know, when
you have arm guys moving around,

186
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:41,620
they're also like,
uh,

187
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,210
really effecting the civil population
had attack and the civil population and

188
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,540
one mother,
um,

189
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,560
she was in our home with our
two children in Monterey and a,

190
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,910
it was like in the night just chilling
in their house and in the door broke down

191
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,310
and about 15 guys in bulletproof
jackets or came in long arms,

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,530
just taking stuff from the house, held
the family, you know, pinned him down.

193
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,610
And I said to the mother,
which of your children as the oldest?

194
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,550
And she was like, didn't know how to
reply. I mean, which of your children?

195
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,020
The oldest, how do I, how do I reply
to that? She just couldn't speak.

196
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,260
And the eldest, Satya
Tucson's one 18, one 15,

197
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,760
the 18 year old was a
philosophy student and he said,

198
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,750
um, I'm on the oldest, said,
okay, you're coming with us.

199
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,250
And took him away. The next day
she got a phone call saying, oh,

200
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,430
could got your sign, give us this
amount of money. We'll give them back.

201
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,730
So she went round to like
relatives just got the money,

202
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,270
she wants to get the money right away.
She turned up with the money,

203
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:49,330
gave some money and then they just cut
off the court and she hadn't heard from

204
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:54,010
him since.
And I miss seeing her face devastation.

205
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,950
Um, the page that I,
you know, just couldn't,

206
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,070
couldn't go with life after that and
just not knowing, not having the closure.

207
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,760
And I met her when I went to report
on one of the worst atrocities,

208
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,290
which was 49 bodies who'd
all been decapitated or had
their hands and feet cut

209
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:19,190
off and all been dumped on a road and
they would take them to the Morgan

210
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,700
Monterrey and arrived in the morgue.
I was inside.

211
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:26,320
The more just smelling the smell of the
dead bodies is kind of weird smell you

212
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,700
get from like decaying flesh,

213
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,150
kind of a sweet smell you get from when
you around those places where you can

214
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:35,400
smell that the board is the cane and
I was inside the Morgan a came out is

215
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,840
outside the morgue and
she was trying to see if,

216
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,110
if her son might be among those people,
among those bodies.

217
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,743
Wow.

218
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,543
No,
it's,

219
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,970
it's so insane that this is right next
door to America and there's so little

220
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,940
effort put on doing something about it,

221
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,360
including doing something to mitigate
the influence of illegal drugs by making

222
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:06,960
drugs legal. And that would
be one gigantic step. You're,

223
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,910
you're not going to stop people from
doing drugs. I mean, this is an illogical,

224
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,350
ridiculous approach. I don't think
people should do most of those drugs,

225
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,210
but when you make drugs illegal, only
criminals are going to sell those drugs.

226
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,150
And this is exactly what you
have right next door to American.

227
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,990
It's just unbelievably insane
that there's this amount of crime,

228
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,230
a drive away from San Antonio.
