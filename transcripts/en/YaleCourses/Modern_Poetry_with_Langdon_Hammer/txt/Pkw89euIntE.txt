Speaker 1:          00:13          Second and lecture I was reading last time from, uh, uh, poems from the 30s, uh, those love poems. Um, uh, lay your sleeping head, my love and this lunar beauty. Uh, the, the ballad, uh, that I, uh, read for you as I walked out one evening. Uh, also a poem about love a also comes from the, uh, later thirties. Uh, it is collected though in this book, uh, called another time a book, odd and published in 1940. Uh, and I wanted to, well, let's see. I'm afraid I've got my order all mixed up here. Um, I wanted to show you what I'm [inaudible] just the table of contents of this book because it's, it has a number of masterpieces in it, uh, that you are reading. Uh, it's also significant that it's organized in the way that it is. The first section is called humbly, I guess, or practically, uh, people and places.

Speaker 1:          01:32          A edit includes a in it, um, the poem I'll be discussing. Yeah. Shortly. Museo de Boza. Uh, there's, um, uh, another, uh, couple of sections, a section called lighter poems, uh, includes, um, uh, well all kinds of, um, song forms, a refugee blues, uh, different kinds of blues and some, uh, uh, kind of a gothic satirical ballads. Uh, Miss G, uh, James Honeymoon, um, uh, poems that are antecedents for a song like Maxwells silver hammer. This is the kind of thing Auden was riding a, and then there's also something else called occasional poems. And in this box od and has put Spain 1937, that, uh, uh, great political poem, uh, from the civil war. Um, and, uh, these, uh, palms that I'll be discussing today and memory of WB Yeats and in memory of Sigma Freud, uh, I wanted to call attention to this, uh, uh, book.

Speaker 1:          02:45          First of all, because it shows us these poems embedded in the actual context in which they first appeared. Uh, but also to point out the way in which Auden, uh, has organized his, his book, uh, that is to say has, um, thought of his poems as belonging to specific categories, uh, and, and place them accordingly. Uh, and they, uh, they have different genres, different forms, suitable to different purposes in occasions. And this is very much, um, the, uh, uh, way in which od and imagines himself as a poet, I think, uh, that is, um, someone I'm writing with a kind of a technical mastery with, uh, access, access to a whole repertoire of traditional forms, which are suitable to different purposes and different occasions. Uh, this general perspective on, um, uh, on his work, uh, is related to, uh, the topic that I introduced in, uh, discussing as I walked out one evening.

Speaker 1:          03:52          And that is the whole question of perspective, uh, in on are you remember I talked about how that poem seems to include, well, at least three different, uh, perspectives. That is the, um, uh, quoted Song, uh, of the lover, uh, who tells his beloved that he will love her, um, uh, until the end of time. Uh, then, uh, there's the voice of the clocks who speak from the point of view of time, uh, and, uh, uh, correct. Uh, his, his, uh, claims. Uh, and then finally there's a kind of a narrative voice that seems to frame the whole thing, um, with that image of the river running on, um, uh, as in that poem, uh, odd and seems to be able to incorporate in his poetry, multiple perspectives, each of which, uh, comment on or are framed or conditioned by the others, but each of which has its independent truth.

Speaker 1:          04:59          You could say. Um, this is a topic that we'll explore more today. Looking at other poems. I wanted to show you some, uh, photographs. Um, in the, in the 1930s during the, um, uh, Japanese, uh, Chinese war, a prelude to the Second World War, um, on, uh, went with his friend Christopher Isherwood, uh, to China, uh, and created a book together called journey to a war, which includes Isherwood's pros and Auden's, uh, poetry. Uh, it's quite a remarkable book. It also includes a photographs, uh, which are presented in an interesting way. Uh, we have here, um, two different photographs of boys, uh, boys, uh, uh, who are classified here as soldiers. And, uh, and then, uh, grimly, um, uh, are identified, uh, as with legs and without, uh, there's, um, a kind of interest in these photographs and in their presentation of how, in the ways in which in war, uh, who we are is a matter of perspective and point of view.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Um, the, um, um, war gave a Auden an issue with, uh, a opportunity to, um, uh, experience what it is like to be on the ground when, uh, planes or overhead, uh, bombing you. Um, and, and here's, uh, here's one, a photograph, uh, of that, uh, condition, uh, in here is, is another, uh, uh, illustration of this general point I wanted to make. There's a, there are n a d unidentified corpses, uh, under blankets. There, uh, there are then, um, uh, scattered human remains and debris. Uh, and the one photograph is identified as the innocent and the other as the guilty. Well, the great poem, uh, on this general theme, uh, in Auden's work is a music day. Boza. Uh, it is a poem that Auden wrote a after returning from China, uh, in, uh, December, uh, I believe, um, 1938, ah, contemplating a, a, a return to the United States where he had, um, uh, uh, visited, um, a short time before, uh, contemplating in fact, expatriation also contemplating, uh, an imminent war, a world war that would, uh, extend the, um, horror that he had witnessed in China, uh, to all of Europe and beyond, uh, suffering in other words, uh, was on his mind.

Speaker 1:          08:24          And, uh, it's the subject, uh, or rather arts relation to suffering is the subject of this poem. The poem, uh, has as its occasion, uh, a visit to the museum. They bazaar in Brussels, uh, where um, odd and saw among other works, uh, this painting, uh, the fall of Icarus, um, uh, that, um, uh, is painted by Peter [inaudible]. Uh, this and other, uh, Roy Eagles are referred to in the course of, uh, of the poem which precedes almost as a kind of imaginary gallery tour or walk, uh, in which, uh, Aaden, uh, as our companion, uh, takes us to a different works and contemplates their commentary on the general issue that, uh, he is, uh, uh, raising here. What is arts relation to suffering about suffering? They were never wrong. The old masters, how well they understood it's human position. He's concerned with how you position suffering in human life and use taking Roy goal and, and uh, uh, as a, as a model how it takes place while someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking Deli along as this line of poetry itself seems to how when the aged ar reverently passionately waiting for the miraculous birth.

Speaker 1:          10:05          Now he's contemplating Nativity scene. There must always be children who did not specially want it to happen. Skating on a pond at the edge of the wood.

Speaker 2:          10:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:19          They never forgot the old masters that even the dreadful martyrdom. And now he's looking at [inaudible] painting the massacre of the innocence that even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course anyhow in a corner. Some untidy spot where the dogs go on with their Doggie life and the torturers horse.

Speaker 2:          10:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:45          No more innocent or guilty than those boys, I suppose. Scratches. It's innocent behind on a tree.

Speaker 1:          10:55          The old masters, no, the human, the human position of suffering, it's positioned in human life. Uh, position is important. It's an important word for odd. And here he's concerned with, uh, how experiences placed. Uh, sometimes he calls this geography. Uh, it is a, um, uh, tote posts, a Motif, a, an idea in his poetry that Elizabeth Bishop will take over quite directly from him, uh, and develop and make central to her poetry. The idea is that things have meaning in relation to, uh, in their connection with, but also their separation from each other. Suffering is part, uh, but only a part, not the center of human life. A repertoire of actions and conditions and states of being that is much larger, uh, in, uh, um, embroil, uh, in his massacre of the innocence. I won't try to find it. Now, among my, my slides for you, uh, odd and focuses on the torturers horse, the, uh, uh, the animal, uh, that is a part of the scene, uh, and that, uh, motivated by an Itch, scratches, uh, it's, uh, behind, uh, while the dreadful martyrdom runs its course, uh, in this poem, uh, as an other, uh, uh, Auden poems, a note, the pros, rhythms, uh, the poem does seem to at times walked Deli along, uh, Auden like more is riding in an expository manner, I guess.

Speaker 1:          12:53          Essayistic manner. Uh, this is a part of the tone of the poem.

Speaker 1:          13:01          Uh, Auden is getting into his poetry, uh, uh, kind of neoclassical, uh, 18th century, uh, aesthetic, uh, uh, an ability to talk about ideas, uh, in, in, in poetry, uh, in, in, uh, again, a discursive expository manner that includes humor, uh, and that, uh, uh, is matter of fact is observant, uh, pain like the tiers that I talked about last time that had dried on Auden's pages. Uh, pain is part of the picture, but it is just a part, it's in a sense, been put aside, all of this is a function of what I'm calling Auden's perspectivism. Uh, any scene borders on other scenes where other people are positioned, uh, looking at the same thing differently or not looking at it at all. Uh, and this is one of the, uh, uh, themes of the, uh, second section of the poem where a odd and specifically, uh, describes this painting.

Speaker 1:          14:13          He says, embroils ICARUS for instance. Uh, and you know, this is a poetry in which the poet says, for instance, just as a, um, uh, more might've said, however, how everything turns away quite leisurely from the disaster. And he's, he's talking about a shepherd who's looking up to the sky. He's talking, uh, about, uh, the Plowman, uh, who, uh, has his back turned to, uh, um, the fall. Uh, and, and where is it? It's hard probably for you to see, but it's hard to find in any case because this dramatic event that is the center of broils pictures, in fact, these bare legs disappearing into the sea as the, uh, uh, overreaching son of Daedalus plunges into the water, uh, not at all. Uh, in the center of the picture, how everything turns away a lot and observes quite leisurely from the disaster. The Plowman may have heard the splash, the forsaken cry, but for him it was not an important failure.

Speaker 1:          15:33          He's not concerned with, uh, flying to or beyond the son. For him, the son merely shines it. It, uh, uh, uh, helps him cultivate the land, the sun shone of necessity as it had to on the white legs, disappearing into the green water, the white legs disappearing into the green water and the expensive delicate ship that must've seen something amazing. A boy falling out of the sky had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on, well here, uh, odd and wasn't thinking about Hart Crane, but he might've been a, it's almost as if this, uh, figure has leaped off the back of the boat. Uh, as crane did, uh, he is, however, thinking I suppose, uh, about Romanticism in general and its ambitions, uh, here the sun shines as it had to, uh, what it illuminates our white legs. There's a kind of objectivity in that there's a kind of naturalism, uh, it shines on green water.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Uh, it's as if from a certain perspective, from the perspective of aesthetic form, these elements of the picture are, uh, merely elements of a picture, uh, colors, uh, uh, which have meaning, uh, as they are placed in a system of relationships and the system of perspectives. Well, there's a great deal more to be said about this, uh, uh, painting. Um, I think, um, one, uh, idea that, uh, is worth emphasizing, uh, is the, uh, uh, way in which the plow men, uh, in Auden's account as in goals, uh, painting, uh, has prominence, uh, has a greater prominence than the, uh, uh, heroic, a romantic figure plunging into the sea. The Plowman is going about his ordinary daily work. And as he turns these furrows, we are reminded as odd and surely was reminded of the ancient classical, uh, uh, connection between verse, uh, meaning the turning, uh, of, um, in Latin, uh, from one line to another.

Speaker 1:          18:17          And the, uh, uh, uh, shaping, uh, action of the plow that, uh, creates these furrows in the earth, uh, committing the poet as he identifies with the plowman to a kind of poetry of craft and of the earth that involves, in a sense, turning away from a disaster. Well, uh, this poem was written in Europe. Uh, it is, um, a, um, a poem that Auden. Um, let me find this picture here, uh, with which Auden in a sense turns his back on, uh, Europe and for the moment at least the, uh, uh, imminent world war, he comes to the United States, he immigrates to the United States, uh, in January, uh, 1939, um, this, uh, personal, uh, uh, turning point, uh, in a poetic career, um, uh, comes at a moment when, um, uh, the world is about to be split in war. Uh, it also, um, uh, comes a, at a significant moment in literary history, uh, when Yeats dies.

Speaker 1:          19:49          And Auden recognizes this occasion as, as a moment to celebrate the poet, uh, uh, contemplate the achievement in modern poetry that he represents Yates, uh, and, uh, in a sense, um, um, provide a kind of a epitaph for, um, uh, poetry now, uh, in the past, uh, in behind us that positions on a, in the present. Let's look at the, the view of, um, uh, Yates and of Yates is poetry that emerges here. Uh, the, um, the poem extends the questions of Music Day. Boats are by asking, uh, not so much. What is arts relation to suffering as, what is the place of art in society generally, or poetry in particular? Uh, Arden begins, he disappeared in the dead of winter. The bricks were frozen. The airport's almost deserted and snow disfigured. The public statues, the mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day. Oh, all the instruments agree. The day of his death was a dark cold day. Uh, there's, there's a, a sense as odd and, uh, elaborates these ideas that, um, um,

Speaker 3:          21:26          mmm,

Speaker 1:          21:28          well, the natural sciences here mocking the, a pathetic fallacy that all nature should more when the poet dies, uh, and reflect, uh, the, uh, um, grief of this, uh, event, uh, he's saying is it was a cold day and we had instruments to measure it and that's what it, it was kind of a factual way. Uh, he continues, Arden does. Um, uh, now he Yates is scattered among a hundred cities and wholly given over to unfamiliar affections. Uh, the words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the living. Yates is passed on to us. Uh, and yet to whom is he passed on? What difference does he make?

Speaker 3:          22:26          Uh,

Speaker 1:          22:28          odd and doesn't want us to, uh, make the mistake to a thinking that Yates is too central figure that he matters too much. But in the importance and noise of tomorrow, he continues when the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the Boris and the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed in each and the sell of himself as almost convinced of his freedom. A few thousand, we'll think of this day as one thinks of the day when one did something slightly unusual. This is, this is a attempt to, in some sense, uh, plays poetry. Uh, realistically, uh, in culture. Uh, it doesn't matter to the brokers worrying like beasts on the floor of the Boris. Uh, it doesn't matter to the poor who have their suffering to which they're fairly accustomed manner as well, perhaps to a few thousand people, not a negligible number. Uh, but not a large one either.

Speaker 1:          23:34          There's a kind of a modesty, a in Odense claims for Yates for poetry. Uh, you could, you could contrast pound at the same time. Uh, is this poem is written a broadcasting his ideas on fascist radio. Uh, or you could think about, um, uh, Stevens at the same time dreaming up a poem. He will call notes towards the supreme fiction. This is a rather different, uh, claim for what poetry might do. Uh, it, uh, returns to a theme of the wasteland somehow. Uh, the world that Auden, um, is describing is one in which we are each imprisoned in the cell of ourselves. Uh, recalling the, the locked chambers, uh, of, um, uh, Elliot's poem. Um, in the second section, Auden moves to address Yates directly. Uh, now, uh, Yates is in a sense claimed for us. Uh, his, his difference, uh, the, the, uh, that Hick, uh, powers of language, the visionary ambition, uh, the, uh, a cult learning, uh, all of that, uh, that would distinguish and separate him from us, uh, is, um, um, put aside. And, uh, what he shares with us, uh, is, um, emphasized. You were silly, like us silly. Your gift survived at all. It had to survive a lot. It had to survive the parish of rich women who doted on him, uh, his own physical decay himself.

Speaker 1:          25:30          Arden says Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry. Now Ireland has her madness and her, whether still you did not affect it, uh, you did not affect it because you are a man and only a man. In fact, poetry makes nothing happen. This is a, um, hmm. One of the most quoted sentences in modern poetry. Poetry makes nothing happen. Uh, it, uh, is almost always quoted. However, out of context, it is part of a long sentence. Uh, it, it comes first as a, as a, uh, uh, qualification on, on what Yates and the difference Yates has made in the world pod and saying in a sense, no, you, you haven't made a difference, uh, for poetry makes nothing happen. Uh, but the poem continues. Then the sentence continues. Uh, Auden says colon, it survives poetry makes nothing happen. It's survives where it's survives. In the valley of it's saying where executives would never want to tamper.

Speaker 1:          26:52          It flows south from ranches of isolation and the busy griefs, raw towns that we believe in. Diane, it survives a way of happening. A mouth poetry. It doesn't make things happen. What it does, it has a different kind of action. It's survives. It lasts. A, how does it last? Where does it lasts? It lasts in the valley of it's saying a kind of imaginary landscape or kind of world that is created through speech here. Uh, the Valley of its saying, uh, perhaps a rich place to live, but also a space that evokes a kind of absence or hollow, right. Uh, or we're kind of opening, uh, perhaps, um, or gap, uh, as odd and develops this idea. Uh, the, uh, um, uh, poetry becomes what he calls, um, a way of happening, a mouth. And then that valley is refigured as a mouth, uh, and open mouth, I'm sure a mouth open, uh, where words are coming out, uh, where, uh, more words will, uh, follow and flow like a kind of river, uh, poetry in that sense. It doesn't make anything happen. It is rather a way of happening. Uh, that is a kind of method or model, a path or discipline, uh, way. Uh, not a deed a, but something more like the symbol of the deed or the figure of a kind of potential action and nothing that is somehow something to, uh, again, uh, I think, um, uh, an image implying an open mouth, uh, that is, uh, the mouth of a river, the mouth of a poet, uh, through which, uh, language flows.

Speaker 1:          29:07          Then the poem moves into, um, I think, uh, a kind of illustration of the kind of action that poetry engages in. Uh, and that comes with the movement into the ceremonial quite trains, uh, in, uh, I am Vick, uh, uh, Ted Transmitter, essentially. What does that, what it is? Well, uh, uh, it's, it's definitely a tet tram runner. Um, the, um, uh, rhyme mentors, uh, the rhythms of the palm up to now a give way to a kind of ceremonial, a lyric language, uh, here, uh, poetry is identified with praise and with prayer. Uh, the poem gives us a kind of performative language of human ceremony that, uh, honors, uh, Yates that, uh, uh, lays him to rest, uh, and yet, uh, also absorbs and affirms the power of poetry, uh, that was, um, in him earth. Receive an honored guest. William Yeats is laid to rest. Let the Irish vessel lie empty of its poetry.

Speaker 1:          30:39          Oh, hadn't goes on to, uh, uh, describe the, uh, uh, way that, um, time we'll honor poetry and we'll honor Yates, uh, that time. Uh, we'll even, he says, Auden does forgive Yeates for the right wing politics that, uh, Yates is a later career is marked by and that, uh, Auden, uh, separates himself from and, uh, uh, needs to come to terms with in this poem, he says a time that with this strange excuse, pardon Kipling and his views and we'll pardon Paul Claudel, uh, uh, Kipling for his imperial jingoism, uh, Cadel for his, uh, you know, Prodo Fascist, uh, uh, uh, ideas, pardons Yates also for writing. Well, uh, odd. And looking back on this poem, uh, would ask himself, how could I possibly presume to, um, uh, judge Yates and forgive him morally for his politics? Uh, and, uh, struck these, uh, uh, condescending lines from his poem so you won't find them in the collected pumps, but you will find the powerful lines that, uh, proceed from them in the nightmare of the dark. All the dogs of Europe bark and the living nations wait, each sequestered in it's hate. Intellectual disgraced stares from every human face in the seeds of pity. Lie locked frozen in each eye.

Speaker 1:          32:41          What does the poet do in this condition? Follow poet. Follow right to the bottom of the night. Poet descends and descends into night, uh, uh, a night that is a, um, this nightmare in which, uh, uh, Europe

Speaker 1:          33:06          barks ready to attack itself with your unconstrained voice. Still persuade us to rejoice with the farming of a verse. And remember the plowman now as a figure for the poet. Make a vineyard of the curse. Sing of human unsuccess in a rapture of distress in the deserts of the heart. Let the healing fountains start in the prison of his days, teach the free man how to praise. This is what poetry can offer. Uh, these, uh, uh, it can offer a lesson in how to praise. This is not a, this is not making something happen, uh, politically in the world, perhaps, uh, but it's making something happen in the heart. Uh, and, uh, perhaps within the eye of each of us, uh, who, uh, look, uh, locked and, uh, staring with our pity, uh, frozen there, uh, poetry would, um, uh, would be a kind of farming in the desert of the heart that would, um, uh, break open a that which is locked there, uh, and, uh, free feeling.

Speaker 1:          34:34          Uh, it's a, uh, it's a powerful and very traditional a claim for what poems can do. Uh, and, uh, you know, in, in talking about the wasteland, I, I stressed, uh, the ways in which Elliot sought a language of, of public ritual that might, um, uh, join people, uh, separated in the cells of themselves. Here Auden is working through the same ideas and providing a kind of model for how that might work. Uh, let me, uh, turn ahead with you to, uh, another, uh, great poem from this period. Uh, in memory of Sigmund Freud. Uh, fried, uh, is a kind of plowman. Uh, he is, uh, another model for the poet for Auden. Uh, and this poem, uh, proposes still other ways to understand, uh, poetry's relation to suffering a represented here by Freud's humanistic therapeutic technique.

Speaker 3:          35:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:53          Uh, what sort of hero is Freud a and calls him and important Jew who died in exile? Uh, it's significant that he has called that by, uh, on, uh, at this moment. Uh, if you, if you look for the figure of the Jew in Garanti and Eliot's early palm, you'll see that, uh, the, uh, uh, figure is not dignified with the capital j. Uh, antisemitism is a, uh, uh, crisis in Europe. Uh, and it's certainly a pervasive current, uh, in, uh, modern poetry, whether, uh, it is actually a theme or Motif as it appears in Elliot, or a pound or a simply a, uh, um, kind of, uh, uh, voluble prejudice as you would find it in Williams. His letters, uh, antisemitism is, is, uh, powerful. Uh, and here, uh, Aaden is identifying himself with Freud as a Jew and as a Jew in exile.

Speaker 1:          37:00          Uh, and, uh, it seems as though Freud in this way represents a figure for people, uh, uh, who are in some sense extracted from the nation, uh, and, uh, who are international in their perspective. Uh, and Auden himself is writing in America from a similar point of view. Um, as in the Yates allergy. Auden is reluctant to single fried out when, uh, as he says, death is so common and suffering is so common. But Freud's point of view for Auden, uh, is powerful and valuable precisely because it emphasizes the common placeness of human suffering. Uh, its ubiquity,

Speaker 3:          37:54          uh, um,

Speaker 1:          37:59          he's praised, uh, Freud is, uh, as the palm a unfolds, uh, specifically for the ways in which he responds to suffering. Um, his, uh, uh, how does he, how does he do it?

Speaker 3:          38:15          Well,

Speaker 1:          38:17          uh, around line 28 or so, on page eight of eight Oh four,

Speaker 3:          38:22          mmm

Speaker 1:          38:25          Oh, Adam says all that he did was to remember like the old, and be honest, like children. He wasn't clever

Speaker 2:          38:36          at all. He was silly like us. He merely told the unhappy present to recite the past like a poetry lesson till sooner or later it faltered at the line where long ago the accusations had begun and suddenly new by whom it had been judged how rich life had been and how silly. There's that word again and was life forgiven in more humble,

Speaker 1:          39:06          no wonder the ancient cultures of conceit in his technique of unsettlement, that's what he hadn't called Freud's therapeutic technique, the talking cure. It's a technique of unsettlement the ancient cultures of conceits seeing it, the fall of princes, the collapse of their lucrative patterns of frustration. If he had succeeded Freud, why the generalized life would become impossible. The monolith of state be broken and prevented the cooperation of Avengers. Of course, they called on God, his Freud's detractors, but he went his way like the poet who follows right to the bottom of the night down among the loss. People like Dante down to the stinking fast, where the injured lead the ugly life of the rejected and showed us what evil is, not as we thought deeds that must be punished, but our lack of faith are dishonest. Mood of denial. The king Coupa since of the oppressor, odd emphasizes, ah,

Speaker 2:          40:22          okay.

Speaker 1:          40:24          Freud's, uh, um, um,

Speaker 1:          40:30          literary dimensions, uh, uh, the talking cure, uh, is, is like a poetry lesson. Uh, it, it puts faith in speech and the powers of true speech to, uh, correct and reshape and heal human life. Uh, it is a technique of unsettlement that is a threat to princess all worldly authority because it questions authority, uh, and empowers the individual speaker to take life into his hands, uh, like Dante or like pounds Ulysses and Canto one, uh, uh, like the poet, uh, in, uh, the end of, of, uh, the eights elegy. Uh, Freud in Auden's poem, uh, goes down among the last people, uh, goes into the stinking fos, which is a powerful word. It's a word that appears in Canto.

Speaker 3:          41:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:35          Uh, where are you list these, uh, uh, pounds Ulysses goes to, to seek Tyree cs a foss, it's an Anglo Saxon word. Uh, it reaches back in that sense and cultural history, uh, to suggest, um, you know, that are our present mystery. Uh, excuse me. Our present misery is, um, uh, one with continuous with that of the past. Uh, and yet history is something here that can be intervened in, in, uh, an individual way through the kind of a true speech that a Auden celebrates in Freud, uh, and that he aspires to in poetry, uh, as, uh, the LG builds towards its conclusion.

Speaker 3:          42:31          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:32          Uh, on page eight Oh six, again, the night appears, uh, Freud would have us remember most of all to be in the ass dick over the night. And it's lost people ourselves, not only for the sense of wonder that it alone has to offer night the unconscious, but also because it needs our love

Speaker 1:          43:02          for, with sad eyes. It's delectable creatures look up and beg us dumb Lee to ask them to follow. That is all the properties here of the unconscious who, uh, that are identified at the same time, uh, with, uh, all those who are lost in society, uh, and need to be, uh, represented, uh, and claimed they are like Freud, a exiles who long for the future that lies in our power. Again, power of speech. Uh, they too would rejoice if allowed to serve enlightenment like him, like Freud. Uh, even to bear our cry of Judas as he did in all must bear who serve it. Uh, Freud here, uh, is uh, uh, uh, an exile and he brings insight, uh, but he also brings love.

Speaker 3:          44:02          Uh,

Speaker 1:          44:04          Arden is imagining a kind of general state of homelessness, uh, which Freud's technique of unsettlement, uh, isn't meant to redress, but rather to recognize and accept and help us adjust to and live in. Uh, Arden's own technique here, uh, is, um, uh, I, uh, well his verse form is a simple syllable count. 11 syllables, 11 syllables, nine syllables, 10. The normative 10 syllable line comes last and fourth and gives a kind of resolution to each quad train. Uh, this a simple pattern. Again, accommodates and promotes a kind of pro speech, a kind of ordinariness that identifies Freud's work and the poet's work with a kind of ordinary ongoing work, uh, and, uh, that accommodates rationality and irrational voice, uh, as, uh, uh, uh, odd. And we'll describe Freud's as being, and yet also accommodates feeling at the same time. Uh, accommodates love. One rational voice is dumb.

Speaker 1:          45:26          Freud's, he's silent in over a grave, his grave to household of impulse. Morin's one dearly loved because he understood how to love our impulses, sad as Erath builder of cities and weeping in our kick Aphrodite. Uh, it's, uh, uh, eventually a, a, a, a, a powerful, uh, uh, moving, uh, conclusion arrows and Aphrodite have lost their champion. Um, I'm gonna, uh, conclude, uh, by, uh, commenting very quickly since we're almost out of time. Um, uh, on one last poem, uh, arguably Auden's, uh, greatest, uh, in praise of limestone, a poem written from the perspective of the postwar, uh, in the United States, uh, but, uh, about, um, a kind of imaginary landscape that combines elements of, uh, his childhood, uh, landscape in northern England. Uh, and the, uh, Italian landscape, uh, where, uh, he returned, uh, in the postwar period, uh, and, um, uh, became increasingly, uh, attached to, uh, it is a kind of, uh, allegorical, uh, space.

Speaker 1:          47:03          Uh, and it represents a kind of home, I suppose for, uh, the homeless for, uh, uh, we, the inconstant ones, uh, as he describes us. Uh, it is this limestone landscapes something to be praised. And it is a poem of praise. Uh, it is, um, uh, an image of the world without another transcendental world beyond or behind it, uh, to be in the world as described in this poem, uh, is to be in an entirely earthly realm. And again, you might think of the Plowman, uh, turning away from, uh, the, uh, uh, overreach or, uh, who tried to fly to the sky and turns rather to, uh, the earth. Uh, it is, uh, a landscape like that of Steven's in Sunday morning. Uh, it is, uh, uh, a landscape, um, that Arden can only describe as a kind of imaginary place, uh, as a, uh, through counterfactual, uh, statements.

Speaker 1:          48:19          Uh, it is, uh, uh, well, uh, porous. It's rich. It's fertile. Uh, it's moderate. Uh, it is not a place of extremes and, uh, hermits and Caesar's, they don't belong here. They go elsewhere. Uh, it, it's rather, uh, a, uh, uh, a place in which ordinary life and ordinary people, uh, might live. Uh, the very end of the poem, uh, is extremely powerful because it looks towards a kind of a redeemed human life, sees it in this landscape, uh, and yet represents it. Uh, in the conditional, uh, Auden says a, insofar as this is an eight oh eight w in so far as we have to look forward to death as a fact, something he will never let us forget. No doubt we are right. But if sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead, and you note the conditional in both phrases, these modifications of matter into innocent athletes, the people that he people's this landscaped with and just stipulating fountains made solely for pleasure, make a further point.

Speaker 1:          49:46          The blessing will not care what angle they are regarded from having nothing to hide deer. And now he speaks to a beloved dear. I know nothing of either. What? Uh, what that is, what it would mean to be blessed or to have nothing to hide. I know nothing of either of those things, but when I try to imagine a faultless love or the life to come when I hear is the murmur of underground streams, what I see is a limestone landscape, a landscape that is Auden's version of an earthly paradise. Uh, our only image of these ultimate, uh, uh, promises, uh, ardent manages somehow here to, uh, make us see and feel what the life to come might be like, what it might be like to be blessed while still acknowledging that we can only live in and be in and speaking, uh, the world before us. Uh, which is the one that Auden remains throughout his poetry dedicated to, well, uh, we'll go on to a poet closely, uh, identified with Auden, uh, Elizabeth Bishop on Wednesday.
