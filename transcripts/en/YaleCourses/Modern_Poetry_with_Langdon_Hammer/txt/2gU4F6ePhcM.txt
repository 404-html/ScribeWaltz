Speaker 1:          00:11          Um, last Wednesday, uh, talking about the poetry World War One, we're talking about poems written in the period 1914 to 1918 pretty much the, the period of the first world war. This is a, a period that we've already had a certain amount to say about it is the period in which fraud fraud starts writing, uh, publishes a boys will in London and then north of Boston in 1915. Uh, it's the same period in which a Yates is work a undergoes. It's, uh, uh, important, uh, stylistic shift, uh, in development in the volume called responsibilities. Uh, and, uh, other, uh, books from the teens, uh, exemplified in that little poem a coat. Um, it is a period, uh, in which, uh, in London itself are gathered, uh, frost, uh, Yates pound. Okay. Uh, and Elliot, uh, all, uh, poets wheel, uh, study, uh, not simply gathered, but interacting, talking to each other, reading each other's work and giving each other, uh, ideas and criticism. Uh, another figure, uh, in this, uh, Amelia and have this moment, uh, is the poet HD. Uh, he or she is a in a, uh, photo from a 1915, uh, with a, with a lock it, uh, in a poetical pose. Uh, let's see, I've got some other photos of the poet here.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Let's see. This is as an older woman, uh, and in a familiar place, uh, seated, she's on the left or right on your left. My right, uh, with, uh, her companion brier right here. And that nice man in the middle, uh, is one of my predecessors in this position. Norman Holmes, Pearson, uh, a professor of modern poetry, one of the founders of American studies at Yale. Uh, and one of the, uh, one of the people, um, involved in the creation of the incredible archive of modern poetry. That is the key, uh, where we have the papers of Ezra pound HD. Uh, lots of, lots of materials from Williams. Uh, um, um, uh, um, I'm, I'm getting stuck here. Uh, Langston Hughes and many other figures. Let's see. Yeah, there she is. A on her 70th birthday in the nave of sterling. Um, well, and this is, this is over and buying a key to that is her death mask. Well, we've gone a long way from that. A young woman with a locket, uh, to this point. Uh, uh, let's return to her in her youth. Uh, this was, uh, uh, also over and buying a key. It's a, it's a photo of a HD, uh, and it is inscribed to Marianne Moore, uh, her friend, uh, and pounds friend. Uh, on your, on your handout, you'll see, um, the interesting anecdote relayed from Hilda Doolittle's autobiographies.

Speaker 1:          04:17          I had never heard of very Libra until I was discovered by Ezra pound. Pounded a lot for modern poetry, including naming HD. Uh, I did a few poems that I don't think Ezra liked, but later he was beautiful about my first authentic versus, and sent my poems in for me to Ms. Monroe. That is Harriet Monroe, the editor, very powerful woman of Poetry magazine. He signed them for me. Hd Image East. Uh, the name seems to have stuck somehow. Uh, well this, this is a wonderful anecdote, sometimes told differently, uh, which, uh, pound and HD as she would come to be known, uh, were conversing about her poems, uh, and, uh, in a coffee shop and pound, uh, put, uh, at the end of a hds poems, a new signature to them, uh, HD, uh, that is, um, uh, and, and uh, at the same time name the kind of poet she was Ema [inaudible] East, uh, and, uh, uh, promptly, uh, since pound is a great entrepreneur, sent the poems off to be published, uh, and to found a movement.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Uh, it's a, it's an interesting, uh, and, and uh, telling story. Um, I suppose if, uh, this is poetry magazine, uh, it's covered where you see, uh, uh, poems, uh, by pound, uh, and others, uh, that included hds work in the same volume. Uh, there's, uh, there are a couple of things to be said about this, this little anecdote. Well, first of all, there's the kind of a complicated literary exchange of a, a man telling a woman, uh, what to call herself, uh, and, and in fact, doing it for her. And, and sending it, uh, uh, her name and her work to be published. The, uh, the name [inaudible], uh, is, is funny. Uh, it, it, uh, uh, it seems to, uh, well, it seems to evoke something excitingly, uh, and pretentiously foreign. Uh, and, and you could remember, uh, the force of French painting in this period.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Uh, you know, everything that was modern came from Paris, it seemed, uh, and here is a pound trying to in effect, create something, uh, some similar kind of, uh, public relations, excitement for poetry, uh, Amazon GC, uh, highlights, well, it highlights the word image, uh, and it highlights the visual, uh, as if poetry, we're a kind of painting a, that's important. Uh, and then there's the, uh, the fact of, uh, uh, Hilda Doolittle a transformation into HD. Uh, I, I don't know, uh, is the name Hilda Doolittle insufficiently poetic? Uh, the, the compression of that kind of wonderfully homely American name, uh, into the enigmatic, uh, initials HD seems emblematic of, uh, image, just aesthetics in general, which depend on the, uh, you know, uh, radical compression, uh, of, of, uh, language and the, uh, um, uh, conversion, uh, of, of, um, well, uh, the prosaic and every day to the essential.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Uh, and you could, you could say that, uh, here, here pound is trying to, uh, do something, uh, with the same, uh, ideal of extreme economy with, uh, uh, hds name. Well, uh, what was images and, uh, this is, uh, um, well, uh, these are, these are, um, copies of, um, uh, hds poems as they appeared in poetry magazine. Uh, Palm Hermes of the ways. Um, HD was, uh, and there's, there's her initials right here. Uh, this new pen name. Uh, she went under, uh, she, uh, uh, his writing even in this very early phase, uh, poems that have classical subjects and antecedents and are sometimes, uh, in fact, uh, translations from a classic sources, uh, from the, uh, Greek anthology and others. Uh, here's one epigram after the Greek. And then here's hds name, uh, followed by the Amazon East in quotation marks. Uh, identification that pound has introduced, um, images, um, was, uh, initially marketed.

Speaker 1:          09:33          I think that's, that's the fair word to use, uh, in a series of anthologies that, that collected this, this new exciting, uh, representative Lee. It seemed modern poetry, uh, in an anthology called days. Amazon East, uh, again, uh, French defied. Uh, and then, uh, uh, you can see this is from 1914 and it's published in London and New York. And then, uh, well, uh, I'll tell you, it's table of contents. It's got, um, poems, uh, by a hds friend and lover. Uh, also a Folger poet, Richard Allington, a HD herself, uh, fs, Flint and others including Amy lol and, uh, William Carlos Williams. James Joyce is appears here and Ezra pound, uh, who, uh, uh, here has at least a couple pumps that you've read for today. Uh, this was followed a little bit later by this book called, uh, some images to poets 1915. At this point, pound a is no longer the, uh, master a entrepreneur.

Speaker 1:          10:52          Uh, and the movement has rather been taken over by, uh, the very amply represented Amy Lowell, uh, who, uh, has become the primary, uh, exponent of images. And, uh, already by 1915 and pound, uh, has, has more or less despaired of, uh, his own creation images and, and now complains of it as being merely Amy Jizzum, uh, as he referred to it. Uh, Amy, uh, well you, you can see in this, uh, kind of, uh, uh, oh, you know, envy and competition on pounds part. He, you know, he's, he's unhappy that his, his, uh, uh, his little group has been taken over by Amy Lowell. Uh, and so he doesn't want him to have anything to do with it. Uh, Amy Loral herself would later become, uh, a distressed at the proliferation of images and images and attempt to copyright the name, uh, which she was unable to do.

Speaker 1:          11:57          Well. Uh, this is, uh, her, uh, her longish a poetics, uh, presented as a preface to that volume. And An, I, uh, recommend it to you. It's an interesting statement of, uh, images. Um, uh, in, here's a photo of pound from this same period, uh, pound, uh, despite, uh, Amy lols taking over of images and remains the, the real theorist of, of, uh, images. Um, and, and the, uh, the one who's formulations, uh, we still return to, to understand what images and was and, uh, to an extent to understand some of the essential, um, aesthetic ideas and criteria of, of modern poetry.

Speaker 1:          12:48          On your handout, you have, you have pounds rules. He liked to make rules, uh, for, for writing an image, just poem. Uh, and they're happily there. Just three of them, not too many, uh, one, uh, direct treatment of the thing where they're subjective or objective. Two two's absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation. You can see even in, in his, uh, uh, telegraphic, uh, rules here. He's trying to be a economical and three as regarding rhythm to compose and sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome. Well, uh, these are each suggestive and as I say, important ideas in there. They're worth dwelling on, uh, to understand some of what, uh, directs pounds, uh, thinking, uh, and, uh, some of pounds important influence early on in the, uh, uh, development of modern poetry. First of all, that focus on the thing, uh, a poem is imagined here as an image of a thing.

Speaker 1:          14:16          Uh, there's, there's a kind of empiricism in this, isn't there? Uh, uh, I kind of vaguely scientific language. Uh, and if you look in pounds retrospect, when he goes back and reprint some of his, his writing about images and reflects on it, uh, in that essay that's in the back of your anthology, you'll see pound talking about, um, uh, his wish to ally poetry with science rather than advertisement. Uh, and, and, and here you can see him really trying to do so in this stress on objectivity or, or, uh, uh, the, the, the aim of objectivity. Notice that the thing may be as he says, subjective or objective. Uh, but, uh, when we call it a thing, uh, this has the effect of turning even the subjective into something objective. Uh, something oddly objective. And there's also a in that, that first rule of kind of emphasis on directness, you know, direct treatment of the thing that's important.

Speaker 1:          15:27          All of this leads to a in pounds a second principle. They are the ideal of concision of efficiency. Uh, nothing that does not contribute to the presentation, you know, uh, Hilda Doolittle, your name is too long. Hd, uh, presentation, pound doesn't say representation. Uh, he says presentation. Uh, again, there's, there's, uh, an emphasis on, um, immediacy, a directness on, on, uh, an ideal of presence if you will. There is in pound a wheel to override or do away with mediation, uh, to bypass in a way the medium to make the word a thing, to make the word an image in the image of thing. Uh, direct, uh, also implies a kind of stripping down of rhetorical ornament. Uh, the idea again that we saw in frost that the truth is something you arrive at through reduction, uh, or, uh, in, in Yates as little poem, a coat.

Speaker 1:          16:45          Uh, and, and remember that, that Yates and frost are coming to these ideas. And just the same time that a pound is finding these formulations for his own poetics, uh, these ideas, uh, in frost, in Steven's, uh, excuse me, uh, in frost and Yeates, not in Steven's, uh, importantly, uh, and, uh, here, uh, centrally, uh, expressed by pound these ideas all point to a kind of radical skepticism in modern poetry, towards imagination and towards rhetoric. Uh, there's a skepticism about poetry's own Elysian making, uh, powers. Uh, there's a kind of linguistic skepticism here, uh, and, and, uh, good poetry, uh, is, um, uh, has, has, um, uh, it has a kind of aesthetic dimension, a four pound or so it seems at this point. Uh, finally that third point about proximity, uh, that's important to what pounds says, uh, cause the kind of priority of the musical phrase over the sequence of the metronome.

Speaker 1:          18:03          Um, the musical phrase over kind of bigger, uh, and regularized pattern. Uh, that's a kind of privileging of the part, the smaller thing, uh, over the whole, uh, and certainly over a repetition. It's a privilege of individual detail over pattern or sequence. Uh, it's, it's a, a, a privileging of, of this idea of the musical phrase over the abstract a or a kind of continuous structure, um, which is, which is viewed as, as a kind of mechanical discipline. Um, all of these ideas are, are rehearsed, uh, again, uh, by Amy Lowell, uh, and, uh, given sometimes somewhat different emphases and you can compare her, uh, account. Well, let's, uh, let's look at some of hds poems, uh, to, uh, see images him at work, uh, as it were, uh, at least, uh, as practiced by HD. They, a number of the early palms here, uh, in your anthology come from her book, See Garden.

Speaker 2:          19:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:31          Uh, a wonderful and fascinating first book, um, that imagines the poems themselves as constituting together a kind of well see garden. I kind of enclosed, uh, space, uh, that offers reflection on symbolic objects that suggest a kind of allegory of poetic activity for HD in which flowers stand for kinds of poems, certainly kinds of feeling, uh, and the garden itself constitutes a certain kind of pastoral, imaginative space. Uh, and a h d has a classical sources for this Greek models for this. Uh, and the, the crucial poet for her, uh, is Sappho. Uh, and like Sappho, uh, HD is a lyric poet of sexual desire. Uh, you, you can see her, her, um, uh, translation of, of Sappho fragments 68. On page three 89, uh, let's look at the, uh, the Palm Garden three 90, uh, which gives a sense of, of hds s aesthetic, uh, aesthetic aesthetic program. Uh, here, there's an address to a, to the rose, uh, traditional symbol of romantic beauty. You are clear. Oh, rose, cut in rock hard is the descent of Hale. I could scrape the color from the pedals, like spelt dying from a rock. If I could break you, I could break a tree. If I could stir, I could break a tree. I could break you.

Speaker 1:          21:35          Oh, wind rand open the heat cut apart the heat rented it to tatters. Fruit cannot drop through this thick air. Fruit cannot fall into heat that presses up in blunts the points of pears and rounds. The grapes, cut the heat, plow through it, turning it on either side of your path, the rose image of romantic beauty. You could compare it to, uh, uh, the rose and in the eights, his early poems. Uh, but here the images transformed. Uh, hds emphasis is not on its softness or sweetness or a sensual abundance. It's richness of color or touch a instead, the rose is clear and hard, uh, just as an image, just poem is supposed to be. It is cut in rock. Ah, you could compare it to, uh, uh, see rose on, on three 95. The, the page before rose harsh rose marred with stint of Pir pedals, meager flower, thin, sparse of leaf, where again, it seems a HD is writing about her poem, uh, in, in its properties, a stunted with small leaf.

Speaker 1:          22:57          You are flung on the sand, you are lifted in the crisps and that drives them. The wind. Can the spice rose drips such accurate fragrance hardened in a leaf. This is a Po poetry that wishes to convey to us, uh, an accurate fragrance, uh, in, in hardened forms, uh, in, in garden. Well to, uh, HD is interested in, in a kind of experience that is harsh or a stringent, uh, that, uh, would open itself to elemental forces, uh, here represented by the wind, uh, uh, forces that, that suggest human passion as much as weather, uh, and, and, uh, that would transform, uh, and, um, uh, transform the poets Torpor and, and heat, uh, and, and, uh, uh, do so specifically through the action of cutting, which is important, uh, here. Uh, and really in all these early poems, hds poems, uh, take place as a kind of lyric drama of Apostrophe Apostrophe, that is the act of address, uh, through which a a speaker finds her voice, uh, by speaking in some relation to a part of the object world, speaking to a thing, uh, which she identifies with or struggles against.

Speaker 1:          24:36          We're, we're both, uh, as is the case. I think in, in the poems I've just read, uh, here, here too, you could see these, these, uh, these images in, in hds poems as a, in some sense, uh, uh, things subjective or objective to take pounds, uh, phrase the extreme compression of these poems expresses a kind of wish for intensity as if by compacting things you made them more fierce. Uh, sometimes a wish for braking or, or cutting, uh, and, and, and, uh, uh, you might say fragmenting of things to get down to essential parts, uh, to do away with the, um, let's say the lassitude of mere rhetoric. Uh, and to cut to what is essential well, um, or a ad is, is, uh, maybe, uh, uh, hds most famous poem from her early work, uh, and, and, uh, a poem, um,

Speaker 2:          25:50          often

Speaker 1:          25:52          presented as, as a, um, a paradigm of images them.

Speaker 2:          25:57          Uh,

Speaker 1:          25:59          if so it makes us see, uh, images and in somewhat different terms from those pound presented. Uh, it is like the other pumps I've just been discussing, a kind of dramatic monologue, uh, which is not something that that pounds ideas emphasize. Uh, here orient is the name for a wood Nymph and, uh, it indicates the speaker of the poem who says, we're all up. See Whirl. You're appointed pines, splash your great pines on our rocks, her earlier green over us. Cover us with your pools of fur. Again, there's a, a kind of, uh, uh, lyric act of Apostrophe of address where, uh, what is implored, uh, would be a kind of overwhelming experience. Uh, who or what exactly is a oriented, uh, is this nymph addressing? Uh, it's hard to say. Uh, is she speaking in fact to the sea as she seems to be? We're up, see, splash your pines over us, or is she speaking to the woods and the pines as if they were the sea?

Speaker 1:          27:25          Uh, I, it's hard to decide. Uh, it is, um, a poem that presents a kind of enigma on that level, uh, and um, uh, doesn't, uh, uh, resolve the question. It provokes the very brevity of the palm, uh, expresses a kind of wish for intensity that is right on the edge of canceling the poem. You could say, uh, uh, leaving us nothing there, uh, at all. Um, uh, a speaker in this case who wishes to be covered up to be subject to a greater force. Uh, and the, uh, uh, uh, palm leaves us with this cognitive problem. Uh, the difficulty of identifying what is figure or ground, what is a literal or a, what is a metaphor, um, that is whether she is speaking to c four pines, seeing the seat like pines or the pines like the sea. Uh, the pool is another, uh, enigmatic, uh, poem, uh, here, uh, uh, one that poses questions. Well, this, uh, this problem that Ori add raises is in fact one that you see in other images, poems. Um, the question of what is literal and what is figurative. Um, pound again, uh, theorizes this, uh, the, the effects, uh, that I'm trying to describe, uh, in the, uh,

Speaker 2:          29:19          middle

Speaker 1:          29:22          quotation on your handout, he speaks of a, the idea of instantaneity or sudden this, uh, he talks about the palm as constituting a complex of elements held together, uh, made in some sense simultaneous with one another. Uh, rather, you know, as if as as, uh, uh, Orient holds, see and pines together in a way that asks us to see these elements as joined a pound says in images that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time. And it, and when he uses that word complex that it has, uh, perhaps, uh, certain, uh, resonances, uh, from psychoanalysis, uh, and also perhaps from, uh, uh, uh, uh, chemistry. Uh, it is the presentation of such a complex instantaneously, which gives that sense of sudden liberation, that sense of freedom from time limits in space limits that sense of sudden growth, which we experience in the presence of the greatest works of art.

Speaker 1:          30:42          And then he says, one of my favorite quotations, it is better to present one image in a lifetime. Then to produce voluminous works, uh, um, the, uh, uh, you could say oriented as a palm, uh, wishing for and, and, uh, seeking that sense of sudden liberation that pound, uh, talks about here. Uh, it's important, uh, again, that pound emphasizes a presentation. It is the presentation rather than the representation of such a complex, um, as he describes it, uh, how his presentation different from representation for pound. The literary image is not, uh, a memory of a prior reality, a reflection, but is rather, it's something more like a new experience itself, not an imitation of a thing. Uh, but itself a kind of thing. Uh, again, impound. There's, there's a, there's a kind of as pound thinks about these things. There's a drive specifically through technique to arrive at a kind of transparency beyond technique. Uh, this is also, uh, it should be emphasized a, a, a romantic project. Uh, uh, the, the image, uh, gives a kind of epiphany, a visionary experience for both poet and reader gives us sudden liberation from historical, particularities of, of place and of time. Uh, let's look at at lbs own poem, uh, in a station of the Metro, uh, which is on page three 51, uh, as a, um, uh, important test case and example, uh, for this poetics.

Speaker 2:          32:55          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:57          It has the honor of being the, the uh, uh, uh, shortest famous palm and modern poetry. You can memorize it, uh, in a station of the metro.

Speaker 2:          33:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:15          And, and wonderfully when I've said the title, I've already said a third of the palm, uh, the apparition of these faces in the crowd, petals on a wet black bough in a station of the metro. The apparition of these faces in the crowd, semi-colon, petals on a wet black bough, not many elements. The title, how does it function? Uh, it functions as a kind of locator. Uh, it places us somewhere. It places us specifically in the Paris underground, in a station of the metro.

Speaker 2:          34:02          Uh,

Speaker 1:          34:05          as I said that that title really is, um, well you could understand it as a standing outside the palm or really as a part of the poem itself. Lines one and two, again, pose for us this question of what is the figure and what is the ground, what is being observed and what does it, what does, uh, what does the metaphor, uh, it is generating? Are we in fact well are these, is pound observing faces and comparing them to petals on a wet black bough? Uh, is he seeing both those things in some sense? Uh, we have here two elements joined and compressed radically.

Speaker 2:          34:57          MMM,

Speaker 1:          35:01          probably it's wrong to speak here of metaphor or for that matter similarly, uh, but rather we can use the word the pound is this image, uh, or as he would later call it idiot Graham, a borrowing from his ideas about Chinese writing. Uh, the key to this poem, uh, as, uh, two other pounding in palms is syntax. Syntax is the temporal ordering of language. Uh, the ordering of a sentence is unfolding. Consequently, the definition of its elements and the relationships among them. Uh, pound has here a kind of abbreviated para taxes. That is a syntax of series here. Uh, only two elements, uh, are in that series. A, the series is joined by an and usually, uh, but here there is no end. Uh, here are the syntax is a compressed, uh, in the service of rendering what is ineffective new kind of perception, a perception that is modern urban of the crowd, momentary, but also as pound conceives it timeless pointing us elusively to historical and cultural overlays.

Speaker 1:          36:31          We're in Paris, but this literary form draws on Japanese verse models and Japanese pictorial aesthetics. The time is now the present these faces, uh, this is self consciously an image or picture of modernity, but it's also the picture of an underground that inevitably recalls the classical underworld. And so, uh, also recalls the long poetic history of comparing dead souls to leaves, which you find in homer Virgil, Dante, Milton, uh, here. Uh, it says if an epic simile from one of those great poems had been taken out, uh, and, and presented, uh, to us, uh, in fragmentary form all of this, this, this kind of a rich allusive overlay is created through a kind of stripping down to the poems, uh, essential primary elements. Uh, pan gives us the story of the poems composition here, uh, which, whether it's true or not a is an important poetic fable.

Speaker 1:          37:52          Uh, uh, that, that in a sense stands behind this poem he says three years ago. And your footnote in Paris, I got out of a metro train and Lacan could and saw suddenly a beautiful face and then another and another and then a beautiful child's face. And then another beautiful woman, you know, a whole series. Uh, uh, and I tried all that day to find words for what this had meant to me. And I could not find any words that seemed to me worthy or as lovely as that sudden emotion. Again. Suddenness and that evening I was still trying and I found suddenly another experience of sudden this, the expression I do not mean that I've found words, but there came an equation, not speech, but in the little splotches of color. The one image palm is a form of, uh, uh, super position. That is to say, it is one idea, a getting out of the impasse in which I had been left by my metro emotion.

Speaker 1:          38:50          I wrote a 30 line pump and destroyed it. Six months later, I made a poem. Half that length, a year later, I made the following Hoku like Haiku, like sentence. Uh, so, uh, there interestingly, this poem that purports to present and present again is the right word rather than represent, uh, a moment of intense, vivid, spontaneous emotion is arrived at as pound describes it through laborious technique, uh, and over time, uh, and, and that technique is concentrated specifically on what compression, cutting things down and eliminating words, uh, again, uh, as in frost mowing, uh, uh, uh, the truth is, is something you get down to a by cutting away rhetorical ornament. Um, pound takes Japanese and Chinese. Poetry's a as models for this aesthetics of compression. And, uh, it's worth stressing that, uh, on the one hand pound is, is polemically, uh, writing and protest against late 19th century, uh, drawing rooms that are crowded with brick or brack and the ornamental aestheticism of, uh, uh, well of poets such as Swinburne or even the early Yates, uh, and yet pounds taste for Japanese.

Speaker 1:          40:23          And Chinese art comes right out of a Victorian decadence. Uh, and, and well, you can, you can see this yourselves. Uh, if you look at the paintings, uh, of James Whistler and others, uh, pound is, is, uh, um, a polemical modernist artists who was also really a, as he looks right here, a Victorian decadent, uh, for pound, um, compression in Japanese and Chinese, uh, poems, uh, means implication. And that's what he's really interested in getting at. Uh, in your, uh, Ras handout a, you'll see his translation of leap pose a jewel stairs grievance as pound renders it, uh, in in pounds handling. He says the jeweled steps are already quite white with do. Again, this is a dramatic monologue. It is so late that the do soaks my gauze stockings and I let down the crystal curtain and watched the moon through the clear autumn and then pound, uh, ever the, uh, teacher, uh, in his poems as elsewhere says, uh, I'm, I'm, uh, in his, uh, uh, presentation of this poem.

Speaker 1:          41:45          Note a jewel stairs, therefore a palace grievance. Therefore, there's something to complain of Gauze stockings. Therefore, a court lady was doing the complaining, not a servant, a WHO complains clear autumn. Therefore, he, he for whom she was waiting has no excuse on account of the weather. Also, she has come early for the do, has not merely whiten the stairs, but has soaked her stockings. The poem is especially prize because she utters no direct reproach, uh, here, uh, as pound, uh, unfolds it for us. Uh, does, is explaining for us the human situ situation is inferred from the scene, uh, because it is so exactly rendered, uh, in the power of sentiment is felt not through its direct expression, but rather through a kind of deliberate restraint. The palm is a specially priced because she utters no direct reproach. A narrative here in this palm as an other instances of, um, uh, pounds work is displaced by the pictorial or, or you might say, is it's not so much displaced as condensed in it.

Speaker 1:          43:02          Uh, uh, all that matters of the story of a lover's grief can be told in a quatrain. Well, uh, I'm going to finish in just a moment, but I want to suggest a further dimension to, uh, this, um, uh, aesthetic that I'm trying to describe, uh, in other translations from the Chinese, uh, pound who didn't know Chinese. Uh, and I'll, I'll say a little bit more about that next time. Uh, builds a kind of layered narrative out of discreet images, uh, and finds a way to innocence, not simply create a poetry, radical compression, but rather a poetry that expands out of, uh, this, uh, image. Just stick a basis. Uh, the river merchant's wife, a letter on three 52 a is an example. It's one of the really great love poems of modern poetry. Uh, like the jeweled stairs grievance. It is a dramatic monologue for a female speaker.

Speaker 1:          44:09          Uh, but these are different poems. By the end of this one, the wife speaks very directly, uh, not in reproach, uh, but in self knowledge and paint desire, the leaves fall early. This autumn in wind, the paired butterflies are already yellow with August over the grass and the West Garden. They hurt me. I grow older. If you are coming down through the narrows of the river king, please let me know beforehand and I will come out to meet you. As far as [inaudible] of the, of the paired yellow butterflies, the wife says with sublime simplicity, they hurt me. I grow older. It's possible to forget that the speaker who says this is 16, not 36. Uh, but her age makes no difference. She is already grasping as you two will have through in this case the pain of her separation from her husband that uh, the essential experience of living in time is lost with this recognition.

Speaker 1:          45:25          Pound's poem, uh, reaches out of the confines of its images, him towards something much larger. Uh, and at the same time you see him carrying forward the, uh, the images. It's don'ts. Uh, this poem is a direct treatment of feeling. It uses absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation. And, uh, it is composed in the sequence of the musical phrase, not that of the metronome with those, uh, dramatically varying line lengths, how pound develop this poetics on a truly grand scale. And the role that translation played in it. Uh, these are things I'll discuss next time when we turn to the beginning of his epic poem. The cantos.
