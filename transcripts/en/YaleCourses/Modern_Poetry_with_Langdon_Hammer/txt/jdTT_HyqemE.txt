Speaker 1:          00:01          Is private ritual possible. This is, um, this is a kind of oxymoron, a private ritual, because ritual is or should be, uh, precisely something that's collective and shared. Um, uh, is it possible for the individual to, uh, produce, uh, some kind of a shared patterning of experience such as ritual represents, um, for Freud, uh, who is, uh, of course, I think are in the background of, um, the wasteland and all of the poetry that we're reading. And, uh, thinking about this, uh, semester, uh, private ritual meant neurosis, uh, sickness of a kind, um, some kind of, um, uh, derangement, uh, and indeed, uh, the wasteland, which is a, a poem that in certain ways tries to imagine forms of private, of form of private ritual or at least struggles with this question, uh, was certainly considered by some readers to be an erotic poem. Um, I began by last time by talking about that first, uh, verse paragraph a of the poem.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Why don't we go back there? Uh, that's, um, on four 74, uh, in your anthology. Uh, I'll try to talk about the poem, uh, in, in sequence, uh, from, uh, for section two last, uh, and, and at least tell you some of the ways in which I make sense of it. Uh, and, and this may be, I hope, helpful to you, uh, in, in the, this first section, the burial of the dead. Um, we have, um, well when I think of as, as a series of preliminary statements, uh, about the poems, ames, uh, what it seeks a, what it would gesture towards or move towards, uh, they include, well, some form of ecstasy. Uh, I think Maurice sled ride, uh, is, is the experience of personal freedom, uh, in its modest way. Um, uh, in the mountains there you feel free. Uh, she says, uh, uh, recalling, um, that experience, uh, prophecy, uh, the poem a introduces us to prophesy in the second verse, paragraph, uh, freedom, I suppose, uh, intimacy between people.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Uh, some kind of meaningful coherence. Uh, all of these possibilities of experience are a, as it were glimpsed in the poem in this beginning glimpsed a and then withdrawn or blocked or parodied, um, Marie sled. Uh, well isn't that a, um, a kind of a figure for letting go? Um, and um, well, uh, for release, uh, and, and, and for trust, uh, uh, an experience as I say, of of freedom. Um, ultimately, uh, in what the thunder said, the poem will again return to those specific themes, uh, when, um, um, uh, it interprets, uh, those, um, uh, Sanskrit words, not a dyad vom and so on. Well, uh, in the second paragraph of the poem is her second stroph fee. If you, if you like, um, we, uh, we're introduced to this through wasteland landscape. Uh, it is, uh, it's a kind of landscape that the poem returns to at different points. Uh, what are the roots that plush, what branches grow out of this Stoney rubbish, son of man, you cannot say, or guests for, you know, only a heap of broken images where the sun beats in the dead tree gives no shelter. The cricket, no relief. And the dry stone. No sound of water. Uh, excuse me.

Speaker 1:          04:56          Um, here. Um, well we, we have a kind of symbolic representation of kind of, uh, a modernist iconography if you like, of a spiritual state. Uh, one of desiccation. It's, it is as it were, a kind of picture of the mental space inhabited by the people that we'll meet in this poem. Um, it's, well they're there. There's a quotations here as your notes from Elliot and then your editor, uh, explained from Ezekiel. Uh, the poem is drawing on a prophetic language and giving its own form of prophecy, uh, but as he keel here is, is secularized in this, uh, uh, context. And, uh, you might look at this as something more like a quotation from prophecy rather than prophecy itself. Uh, here, the poems general concern with, with, with, uh, a spiritual state that, let me call the withdrawal of God is represented as, as I say, as dryness, as dryness and as fragmentation.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Uh, what we have is stony rubbish, a heap of broken images where the Sun Beats, uh, here, you know, w w we've got to kind of fragment of, of sacred text itself. Uh, you know, if you like a bit of rubbish, um, uh, eh, that has that, that's part of the palms heap of broken images, uh, that we will explore. Uh, the withdrawal of God, uh, in the poem, um, is, is a kind of fall into fragmentation, uh, where experience, uh, doesn't cohere, uh, where, uh, there's dryness. Uh, there's no connectivity, there's no fluidity. Um, the palm then moves abruptly, uh, and, and the poem, you know, moves that this kind of exhilarating a abruptness, uh, throughout, uh, between kinds of language, uh, here, uh, introducing Wagner and a little quotation from, uh, a quad train, uh, from the, uh, Libretto, uh, for Tristan and Isolde, uh, translated for us.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Uh, uh, fresh blows the wind to the homeland. My Irish Darling, where are you waiting? Um, uh, is old. Uh, here's this, this song, and it's a, it's a kind of, uh, uh, well song of a longing, a as she goes off to marry the wrong man. Um, uh, this Wagner text, uh, and, and the little quotation from it, uh, down below, uh, again, another quotation from Wagner, uh, [inaudible], um, is, uh, uh, a more sinister and haunting, uh, phrase, uh, maybe, uh, translated as a waste and, and empty the sea or desolate and empty the sea here. Um, this frame's a little vignette and a little little scene, uh, a dialogue or part of a dialogue. Uh, you gave me hyacinths first a year ago. They called me the highest and girl, and then out of that quotation, the poem, uh, now speaks to us as it were more directly, um, without quotation marks.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Yet when we came back late from the hyacinth garden, your arms full in your hair wet. I could not speak and my eyes failed. I was neither living or dead and I knew nothing. Looking into the heart of light, the silence, a kind of ecstatic, uh, vision. Uh, but here, one of us, certain, uh, perhaps frightening emptiness, uh, where, um, uh, a, uh, um, a couple presumably, um, have, um, had some kind of, uh, exchange, uh, that leaves the speaker, uh, with this particular vision of, uh, the heart of light and silence, the, um, uh, references to, uh, the flower, the highest synth, a call up, the, uh, uh, the whole system of images of April and spring. That the poem, uh, we'll play on a as well as the, uh, uh, story of hyacinth, uh, from, um, the metamorphosis. Uh, and, uh, your, your editor here, we'll explain that Apollo loved and accidentally killed hyacinth, uh, from his blood, sprang the flower named for him, inscribed with I a cry of grief. Um, here, uh, love, uh, is associated with killing, uh, and with um, uh, also with, with a kind of, um, uh, generation, uh, though of a painful, uh, and um, uh, disturbing kind, uh, here.

Speaker 1:          11:02          The, the, the general, you know, wasteland space with what I'm calling the kind of space of God's absence, uh, becomes a space between two people, two lovers, um, and, uh, a, it seems some form of missed connection, uh, as a sequence. Uh, these lines I've just been talking about like the poem, uh, as a whole, uh, advanced by collage. Uh, they, they make a kind of argument, they make a kind of sense, but perhaps not in the ways that we're used to. Um, the, these materials together I think suggests that the loss of common experience that comes with, uh, the withdrawal of God is, is played out between people in their relationships where God was, uh, sex is, uh, or, uh, you could say that the loss of, of collective and shareable meanings, which, uh, results, uh, in the privacy of our mental experience, our dreams, our aspirations, memories, poems, difficult palms is represented here in this poem by the irreducibly private and therefore anguishing nature of sexuality.

Speaker 1:          12:26          And this is, uh, uh, a theme that the palm we'll return to again and again. Uh, instead of a reciprocity, uh, and some kind of mutuality in human relations, we find, um, uh, people doing kinds of violence to each other, uh, dominating each other, uh, finding, uh, incompleteness in their unions. The poem then moves on, uh, two again with a kind of exhilarating shift of register reference to a comic figure. Madam Psas. So stress, a famous clairvoyant, uh, with a bad cold. Uh, I think of Madams assisters often in the winter. Um, she, um, is nevertheless known to be the wisest woman, uh, in Europe, and she has a wicked pack of cards. Um, and what does she produce? Well, uh, here said she is your car, the drowned Phoenician sailor, who is you, perhaps ourselves, the reader, perhaps the poet. Uh, those are pearls that were his eyes.

Speaker 1:          13:43          Look, here is Bella Donna, the Lady of the rocks, the lady of situations. Here's the man with three staves, uh, and here the wheel and so on. Uh, and something, uh, that she has forbidden to see. I do not find the hanged man. Fear, death by water. I see crowds of people walking around and a ring. Thank you. If you see dear Mrs equitone teller, I bring the horoscope myself when must be so careful these days. Uh, this, this is a wonderful passage. Uh, here it's doing a number of different things. Uh, the horoscope seems Alaska kind of a debased modern form, uh, of, uh, a modern system of interpretation, a way of understanding the self, uh, very is in these lines of kind of parody of a cultism, which would include perhaps a parody of Yeats. Uh, although a Yates is a vision, wasn't yet at the same time even while the palm is parotic.

Speaker 1:          14:56          Uh, it's serious too, uh, because in this kind of ad hoc, uh, somewhat fanciful and crazy way the power madam, so, so stress is cards is producing images that, uh, uh, Elliot is dealing us, uh, and that he will collect in the course of the poem and try to make some sense of, uh, in the, uh, collage that is, uh, the, uh, the wasteland, uh, including, uh, among those cards, the drowned Phoenician sailor, uh, who will return for us in that little section death by water. Um, the, uh, uh, well I, I like to think of Eliot himself, uh, as Mrs Equitone, uh, that is, um, because he's so difficult to read in his tone. Uh, and, uh, uh, after all, um, it's a, in a sense, um, nurses equitone who's, who's, who's getting this stuff and it's going to try to do something with it.

Speaker 1:          16:00          Well, um, part one, uh, the burial of the dead ends, uh, with another, uh, instance of scene setting. Now this, the sort of, um, uh, symbolic iconography of the dry landscape is going to be overlaid on another landscape, which is metropolitan London, unreal city. This is Elliot's, uh, evocative name for the urban space that the poem, uh, represents unreal city under the brown fog of a winter. Dawn, a crowd float over London bridge. So many I had not thought death had undone. So many size, shorten and frequent. We're exhaled in each man fixed his eyes before his feet float up the hill and down in a rhyming couplet, King William Street to where Saint Mary Woolnough kept the hours with the dead sound. On the final stroke of nine, you go to the note and in Elliot says, a phenomenon which I've often noticed a just in case you were wondering whether he's in the scene or not a well here.

Speaker 1:          17:24          Um, we are, uh, being introduced, uh, to, uh, the metropolis, uh, which as I say is, uh, uh, the, uh, uh, the scene of the wasteland. Um, it's the, uh, it's where the events of the poem will take place more or less. Uh, what, um, uh, what, what we're seeing here are people going to work, um, people that we're going to see later in effect in the palm. Uh, uh, the typist in the young man carbon killer must be crossing the bridge to, uh, or the people that we'll meet in the pub and so on. Um, there's, um, a kind of strange mixing here of the dead and the living of the apocalyptic and the utterly ordinary, uh, Elliot then, uh, moves with, you know, again, uh, uh, no framing, uh, uh, that would help us to say there, I saw one I knew, and then who of course is this I who's speaking to us?

Speaker 1:          18:35          We don't really know. Um, I saw one I knew and stopped him crying. Stetson, you were with me in the ships at my lai. That corpse he planted last year in your garden. Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? A hyacinth perhaps, uh, or has the sudden frost disturbed it's bed. Oh, keep the dog far. Hence that's friend to men or with his nails. He'll dig it up again. You HIPO Crete Lecter Molson blob of more flair. He says, quoting a bud lair, uh, at the very end, uh, bursting out with it. Uh, it's, it's a, uh, again, fascinating turn that the poem takes. Um, there is perhaps a kind of a glimpse of the still echoing world war in the here imagined hailing of, um, one man who knew another in battle. Um, uh, that is, uh, uh, the ships at, at, at, uh, uh, my lie that the, um, um, um, uh, where they last met.

Speaker 1:          19:47          Um, excuse me. Um, there's, um, here another instance of exchange between, uh, to, uh, people, uh, here. Um, there's, there's a way in which that first person's addressed to Stetson, um, uh, plays upon parodies. Uh, if you like the poets relation to you or to me, uh, the reader, there's a here a, a general, uh, problem or question of how to make each other out, um, how to recognize and, uh, uh, acknowledge, um, the relation between brothers or some blobs, um, uh, as, as, uh, uh, but, uh, layer, uh, would have us, um, call them. Um, the little glimpse of war and the war dead perhaps that, uh, we get, uh, in these lines will, um, throughout the rest of the poem, um, turn into a, a postwar, uh, vision of, um, again, war between the sexes and war between people. Um, most immediately in a game of chess, uh, the second section, which is built around two conversations, the first takes place in, uh, a well to do drawing room the second, uh, in a pub.

Speaker 1:          21:33          Um, there's, uh, much to a contemplate in the opening, uh, description of that, um, uh, home, uh, where the, uh, uh, we'll, we'll hear these, these two characters speaking and thinking, uh, in a moment, uh, one that is important and recurs, uh, often, uh, in the scene when detail that recurs often in the palm, uh, is the, uh, image of a, a male, uh, around line 98 as though a window, or, excuse me, let me go a little bit further. Above the antique mantle was displayed a picture as though a window gave upon the sylvan seeing the change of filler ml. Another, uh, Videon metamorphosis by the barbarous king. So rudely forced, uh, fill a mill, uh, raped by a, uh, terrorists is, um, uh, transformed into the Nightingale. Um, yet they're the Nightingale filled all the desert with inviolable voice. Suddenly where Elliot has, has brought us into this dining room to see this picture.

Speaker 1:          22:44          And now we're in the picture, uh, listening to, uh, the Nightingale filling all the desert, this wasteland space with a kind of, uh, again, song of complaint, a kind of lyric voice. Um, that's called here inviolable and still she cried. And still the world pursues jug jug to dirty ears, a jug jug being the conventional representation of the Nightingale Gail song in a Elizabeth and poetry. Well, um, there are, uh, this is, uh, you know, again, uh, in image of, um, sexual violence that produces a particular kind of a lyric utterance. Um, it is, uh, a kind of, um, motif that recurs in the poem. It's also a way of imaging the poem itself as a kind of, uh, uh, inviolable voice that emerges, uh, from, um, some kind of, um, um, vision of erotic, um, violation. Uh, the conversation that follows if it's a conversation, uh, we really only have what we, what we have is one speaker speaking in quotation marks and the other speaking without quotation marks.

Speaker 1:          24:10          Um, what does that mean? Presumably the one speaker that we, uh, overhear that seems to be female, uh, we're hearing her speak, uh, when we, when those quotation marks disappear probably for the man speech, um, that would seem to represent some kind of interiorized speech. Uh, some kind of thought, uh, my nerves are bad tonight. Yes. Bad. Stay with me. Speak to me. Why do you never speak, speak? What are you thinking of? What thinking what? I never know what you're thinking. Think I think we heard in rats alley where the dead men lost their bones. What is that noise? The wind under the door. What is that noise? Now? What is the noise doing? Excuse me. What does the wind doing? Nothing again. Nothing. Another phrase that will recur in the poem. Do you know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember nothing I remember.

Speaker 1:          25:17          Those are pearls that were his eyes. Are you alive or not? Is there nothing in your head? But Oh, that Shakespearian rag. It's so elegant, so intelligent. What shall I do now? What shall I do? Quotations there from Prufrock, right? Uh, I shall rush out as I am and walk the street with my hair down. So here Prufrock's questions are being answered. Perhaps. What should we do tomorrow? What shall we ever do? The hot water at 10. And if it rains a closed car at four, and we shall play a game of chess, pressing lidless eyes and waiting for knock upon the door. Uh, this is, uh, often understood as a version of an evening at the Elliot's, uh, the, uh, female speaker, uh, is being satirized. Uh, surely she's a frightening, uh, but surely also her companion. Uh, they're driving each other mad. Uh, it's a kind of fully, uh, uh, the, uh, um, first person here speaks for a kind of state that other people experience in the poem.

Speaker 1:          26:42          And that first persons in this poem a experience that is the condition of having nothing in your head. Uh, nothing almost constituting something, uh, again, nothing being a kind of wasteland, but in that wasteland. Nevertheless, there persist certain kinds of rubbish, uh, fragments, bits of language as in Prufrock's consciousness. Uh, and this speaker recalls, first of all, when pressed, those are pearls that were his eyes, a quotation from the tempest. Um, a quotation from aerial song that holds out, uh, some image of, um, uh, death by water that would provide some kind of transformation, um, where, uh, eyes might become pearls. Um, this is, uh, uh, by calling up Shakespeare and the tempest, uh, Elliot and Evokes Shakespeare's whole romance promise of transformation, uh, through drowning, um, through magic, uh, and, and romance redemption. Uh, in the course of the poem, that little fragment will become another motif that recurs and circulates a becoming almost a kind of object of collective memory.

Speaker 1:          28:18          Uh, in the poem, a bit of shared knowledge of, uh, let's say, uh, potential, uh, that is drawn specifically from the literary past. You could say that here and elsewhere, uh, Shakespeare and literary tradition in general, um, stand in for sacred texts, uh, that would offer some kind of a guide to action and some source of meaning. Uh, here, uh, the, uh, sacred text of Shakespeare is, um, you know, sooner, uh, invoked then it is parody, uh, through, uh, this, um, uh, 1912, a jazz song that comes to mind as also in presumably the speakers had the Shakespearian rag. Uh, it's so elegant. And so in teligent, uh, there's a way in which, uh, well, um, uh, Elliot's making fun of his own, uh, uh, wish for Shakespeare to be meaningful. Uh, there's also a way in which, uh, the jazz brings this speaker suddenly to some kind of manic life.

Speaker 1:          29:33          Uh, and, and he has a kind of energy, uh, uh, fitfully, uh, for a moment. Uh, and uh, here as an other moments in the poem, um, high culture and low culture are brought together and in a kind of rootedness and an interesting way, in fact, you could see this whole section, a game of chess has doing that since we moved from the drawing room. And it's, um, uh, particular, uh, interior decoration to the pub scene that follows, uh, with, um, uh, the, uh, account of, um, uh, little's childbearing, uh, and, and, uh, so forth, uh, that we, uh, then get to over here, uh, and then the palm, uh, or rather this section of the poem and with another quotation from Shakespeare, um, oh, fairly as a parting words in a hamlet, a good night, sweet ladies, uh, and, and so forth. Um, the, uh,

Speaker 2:          30:43          uh,

Speaker 1:          30:45          the game of chess here, uh, well it has all sorts of complex, uh, resonances, um, Elliot's certainly, uh, punning on some sense of stale mating, uh, and, and unions, uh, sexual unions that have gone wrong and that have left people, um, against each other. Um, uh, in warring postures, a, as the poem precedes in the fire sermon, uh, we get more, more scenes of, uh, erotic impass, um, uh, or, uh, or worse, uh, uh, erotic, um, uh, violence of different kinds.

Speaker 2:          31:33          Um, the

Speaker 1:          31:38          scene of, uh, the, the Thames, the water that flows through London, uh, is now, uh, brought into focus again, not at London Bridge, uh, precisely, but, uh, just the, uh, uh, sure, uh, where, um, well Elliot describes it as the rivers tent is broken. The last fingers of leaf clutch and sink into the wet bank. The win crosses the brown land unheard. The nymphs are departed sweet. Tim's run softly till I and my song. The river bears, no empty bottles, sandwich, pab papers, silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends or other testimony of summer nights as it usually does a, the nymphs or departed and their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors departed. Having left no addresses, um, here, uh, Elliot's, you know, conjuring, uh, kind of erotic debris that has been left behind by, uh, these, uh, businessmen and they're, uh, Nymphs as the, uh, uh, poem, uh, progressive, uh, well, uh, they're more images of, um, uh, erotic, um, confusion and, and, uh, uh, desolation.

Speaker 1:          33:03          Uh, but at the back, excuse me, but at my back from time to time, I hear on the bottom of four 79 the sound of horns and motors, which I'll bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. Oh, the moons. I should be able to sing this way. Oh, the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter and on her daughter. They washed their feet in soda water. Aaos save. Why don't phone Sean Tone Doughnut Cooper twit, twit, twit jug jug jug jug jug. So rudely forced to, uh, again, it kind of amazing, uh, linguistic, um, um, uh, vertigo as we pass from a body, a Australian soldier ballad about Mrs. Porter, uh, which has all kinds of, uh, obscene stances that your editor doesn't a quote for you, uh, to, uh, their lens, uh, in a image of a children's voices, uh, singing under the Dome, uh, in his parts of fall. Uh, introducing another narrative and theme that recurs throughout the poem, the grail story.

Speaker 1:          34:18          Um, and, uh, the story of, uh, parts of fall, uh, uh, the, uh, palm moves. Then, uh, with those, those, uh, first of all, just the sounds, uh, which are the, uh, um, uh, the sounds of, um, Phil ml. Um, here, you know, human voice re reduced to a kind of noise almost, um, to, um, another anecdote. Uh, Mr Eugenic Idis, this Smyrna merchant, uh, unshaven who asks the me of the poem and demotic French, uh, to, uh, a luncheon at the Cannon Street hotel followed by a weekend at the metropole a proposition. Uh, it seems, uh, and again, I kind of, um, uh, uh, sinister sexual invitation. Uh, there then follows the, uh, extended scene, uh, between the typist and young man carbon killer. Uh, it, um, uh, a, uh, uh, ugly, a scene of, um, uh, sexual emptiness, uh, and, and, um, uh, domination, uh, [inaudible] and Elliot, uh, doesn't shrink from, uh, um, you know, representing, uh, this, this man in, in a, you know, the, the most, uh, uh, ugly, uh, and, um, uh, both visually and morally.

Speaker 1:          36:03          It must ugly terms. Uh, although, uh, the poem was indeed a lot uglier, uh, yet than it is now. Uh, the very end of it, uh, after he's left, uh, and, and, uh, bestowed one final patronizing kiss, um, uh, the, uh, poem used to, or this section of the poem used to end with a rhyme, uh, that he then stopped outside to take a Piss, uh, that was excised. However, uh, in the, uh, um, uh, course of the poem and there's an unnecessary, um, uh, further, um, uh, uh, registering of the degradation of this scene. Uh, then the poem, uh, moves to, um, well, uh, the, these inset lyric, uh, songs on four 82. The river sweats again, we're on the river, uh, and were given a kind of image of a Queen Elizabeth the first and, uh, Earl of Leicester. Um, a potential lover for the Virgin Queen, uh, who are, are, um, uh, being carried down stream.

Speaker 1:          37:21          Um, and then, uh, finally, uh, another speaker, uh, emerges, um, this time, uh, it seems a a woman, uh, speaking again in quotation marks, trams and dusty trees. Highbury bore me, Richmond and Q, and did me by Richmond. I raised my knees supine on the floor of a narrow canoe. My feet are at more gate and my heart under my feet. After the event, he wept. He promised a new start. I made no comment. What should I resent on marget sands? I can connect nothing with nothing. The broken fingernails have dirty hands. My people humble people who expect nothing.

Speaker 1:          38:19          This, there's a kind of extraordinary, um, metamorphosis, uh, of speaker here. Uh, we're, uh, we, uh, we, we begin listening to the, um, sexual anecdotes of, uh, presumably one of these nymphs abandoned by one of the city directors, uh, who, uh, has been had a in the park, uh, in Highbury Richmond and queue. Uh, uh, there's been, um, it seems an event, perhaps what a pregnancy and abortion, um, uh, he wept. He promised a new start. Uh, what should I resent? Um, that, um, uh, experience then shifts to, uh, another, uh, location. There's a kind of mutation of the speaker going on, uh, on Margaret Sands. It's just that location. And then, uh, I can connect nothing with nothing. And now, um, the, uh, uh, that phrase, nothing, uh, nothing with nothing, uh, what's in your head? Nothing. Um, that, um, those lines and that motif recur.

Speaker 1:          39:37          Um, that first person is like the first person of a game of chess as if that woman had turned into that man. And, uh, Margaret Sands, uh, locate the poem at this moment at, um, one of the, uh, uh, places where, uh, after, uh, working in the city and, uh, succumbing to a kind of nervous breakdown, Elliot went to compose, uh, parts of the wasteland. Uh, so there's a way in which he to the poet is that first person they're merged with, uh, these other first persons who finally then merge with Queen Elizabeth. Uh, when, uh, we hear that first person say, my people humble people who expect nothing. Uh, again, uh, there's a kind of a shifting and metamorphosis of identity, uh, as people are brought into relationship with each other through their shared experience of erotic failure. Um, let's see, um, not too many minutes left to talk about the end of the poem and to give some sense of it's shape. Um,

Speaker 3:          41:02          yeah.

Speaker 1:          41:10          Here. Here's it. Here's a kind of a narrative of the poem. The burial of the dead. The title, it comes from the Anglican Book of common prayer. It's suggests that the poem will search for perhaps itself, try to substitute for, uh, the um, uh, kind of, um, a ritual, um, understanding of life and death, uh, that, uh, the angle can book of common prayer provides a, again, some kind of collective meaning a, a game of chess. Then, uh, specifies the poems problem, uh, as erotic impasse as a kind of stale mating as, uh, the failure of love. Uh, the fire sermon then proposes a kind of solution, uh, from the Buddhist teaching. Self control is a way to combat lust and domination, the selfishness of desire, uh, all of which resonates, uh, in, in a moral register, uh, with the, with the poetic program of tradition in the individual talent where the theme is self extinction, uh, or, or, um, uh, self submission.

Speaker 1:          42:33          Uh, the point, uh, in the middle of the palm where I've been a dwelling for the past few minutes. The point is to convert the fires of lust, uh, into refining and spiritualizing fires. Then there's a kind of scared, so that little section, death by water, uh, where, um, the drowned Phoenician sailors seems to, uh, well be a kind of sacrificial figure to represent, uh, again, I cannot, I can graphically a self extinction. And then finally, uh, after this emblematic sacrifice, uh, we are, uh, introduced to the long final section, what the funder said when there is a return of divine speech and the promise of rain and of water, what the poem seems to be looking for, um, aligning, um, um, the redemptive, uh, regeneration that would come with the rain with the um, uh, uh, with the experience of divine speech made present, uh, here in that simple syllable, da.

Speaker 1:          43:54          Well, um, let me, uh, let me say, uh, just a couple things, uh, about, uh, the shape of the palm as we have it. I'd asked you to look at, um, um, pounds, um, work on the poem in the form of, uh, uh, the, uh, uh, some pages from the wasteland manuscripts, well, uh, pound, uh, collaborated in the writing of this poem by, um, in particular, uh, excising, uh, and, uh, shortening the poem, uh, at many points. And specifically, um, uh, if you study the drafts, uh, by, uh, I think, um, isolating those moments in the poem, uh, where Elliot is drawn to a kind of a romantic lyricism on the, on, uh, what becomes the first page of the poem. Uh, April is the cruelest month, um, pounds, circles the word forgetful with forgetful snow, uh, in the, uh, a passage about a, a Mel. He's, he circles the word inviolable for inviolable voice.

Speaker 1:          45:15          Um, uh, pound wants to get the romanticism and lyricism of the poem out of it in certain ways. Um, Elliot resists that and there are ways in which these two men, um, working together and against each other, uh, to create the poem, uh, enact some of the poems own struggle with lyricism, uh, and with romanticism. Uh, and, uh, help us to see that struggle as, as part of what goes into the creation of the pump, uh, itself. Um, one of the sections that proof, uh, that pound had the biggest effect on, uh, was a death by water, which was, uh, originally a long heroic, a narrative, uh, or mock heroic narrative, uh, ending, um, uh, in, um, the, uh, sailors drowning. Um, that short section a is, is worth dwelling on, uh, for a moment, um, because, uh, it is, uh, an instance where, um, we are, uh, well given I think, um, an image of what a Elliot was giving up a, he is giving up, um, a certain investment in romance quest, uh, and more law, more generally romanticism, uh, that's emblem metabolized by this drowned figure.

Speaker 1:          46:52          Um, there's also in way in which this very short section, uh, points us to, it makes us think about the shortness of the poem as a whole. Uh, the wasteland is the shortest long poem in the language. Uh, it is, uh, you know, a kind of radically condensed epic. Um, and, um, there's, there's a kind of, you could say, um, claim made by the poems form that epic extension and duration are no longer possible. Just as a romance quest is no longer possible precisely because we lack the kind of culturally shared vocabulary and language that would, uh, allow Elliot to create a kind of continuous form. Instead, what we have is a radically condensed, uh, and discontinuous form, uh, the brokenness of the poems form representing the brokenness of the world that doesn't have a sacred center. Um, finally, um, there's the matter of those notes, uh, they are, uh, I think an important part of the poem they get kind of get lost in the editor's notes.

Speaker 1:          48:13          Um, uh, in your anthology. Well, when Elliot first published the poem a, it didn't have those notes when he, uh, when he published it in England in the dial magazine when he published it, um, excuse me in the criteria when he published it, a in America. Um, shortly after, um, uh, uh, he added those notes, uh, to, uh, extend the length of the poem. Uh, it was asked to make a longer, uh, poem. Uh, there's a way in which, um, those notes establish a particular kind of figure, a poet who is also a scholar and an editor, uh, who is, um, uh, producing a poem that needs notes, uh, and that, uh, needs to explain itself in these ways. And that draws on literary tradition and, uh, various forms of cultural knowledge that require annotation. Um, Elliot presents himself as this figure, a poet who's also a kind of scholar and, um, uh, this figure emerges as a kind of central modern, uh, figure replacing the, um, uh, epic poet of the past. The one who, uh, produced, uh, a poem such as paradise lost, uh, without any footnotes. Well, a Hart Crane, um, a response to all of what I've been talking about today, uh, and uses it as a point of orientation to create a related but very different kinds of poetry. As we'll see on Wednesday.
