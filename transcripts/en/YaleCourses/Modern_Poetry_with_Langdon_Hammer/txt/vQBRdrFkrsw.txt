Speaker 1:          00:12          I'm going to talk about William Carlos Williams today. It may be that I end up carrying a little bit of Williams over to next time too. Um, uh, uh, Marianne Moore, his friend, a contemporary and a really close, um, uh, close, uh, uh, collaborator in a sense in the, uh, uh, New York, uh, uh, scene of, of modernism in the, uh, teens twenties, thirties, forties, uh, and on into the 50s. This is, uh, this is the man, uh, as a young man, uh, uh, William Carlos Williams. If you open your, um, uh, anthologies to page two 84 in the long head, note that, um, and useful headnote that Jihad Ramezani, uh, provides you, uh, there's this quotation from a letter, uh, in the middle of two 84 that Williams wrote to Harriet Monroe, uh, the editor of poetry who, uh, 13 years later Hart crane would a right to in defense of his palm at Melville's tomb.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Uh, and William says in this letter to Monroe, most current versus dead from the point of view of art, it's dead. It's lifeless. Uh, and what Williams cares about is something he calls life. Uh, now life is above all things else at any moment, subversive of life as it was the moment before. And I think that's how we know it in William's life is whatever is subverting whatever was a, a moment, uh, before and subversive as is probably an important and suggestive word there. Uh, uh, subversive of life as it was the moment before, always knew irregular. He wants what is new, uh, and what is new is going to be what is your regular and what is irregular, uh, has in some sense, uh, uh, subverted what was in place before, uh, he continues verse to be alive, to have, you know, what pound I think would've called the impulse, uh, for verse to be alive.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Uh, it must have infused into it something of the same order. It has to have life in it, uh, or what he calls some tincture of disestablishment, something in the nature of an impalpable revolution in ethereal reversal. Let me say, I am speaking of modern verse, uh, like, uh, uh, certain of our other poets. Um, uh, Williams is his self consciously modern. Uh, he's defining, um, what modern means. Uh, and he's defining it as a quality of a experience that he calls life, uh, that has the quality of disrupting, uh, whatever, uh, was, uh, in existence before. Uh, and this is a quality, uh, in energy, uh, that he wants to have in his poetry itself. Uh, this is a Williams a little bit older, uh, Williams in 1924, uh, 1924, uh, when he has, uh, established himself through the poems in a volume called springing all, uh, as one of the, uh, major, uh, modern poets in America, uh, he is the author of a poem.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Have you ever seen it called the red wheelbarrow? Uh, and, uh, that might be a good place to begin. Uh, that's on to 94 to 95. Uh, of course I'm joking. Uh, probably, um, that's the one poem every body in this class has read before they came to this class. Uh, it is, uh, you know, better known than the Negro speaks of rivers or stopping by woods on a snowy eve. Um, uh, even, uh, it is, uh, also distinguished, I think as, uh, being the second shortest modern poem. Uh, after in a station of the metro, a poem that it's related to in certain ways. In fact, uh, you know, a link between Williamson pound is, is important. It's relevant. A pound was a friend and rival for Williams, uh, throughout his career. Um, uh, Williams is sometimes seen, uh, in his, uh, early stages, uh, as a, as a kind of images, uh, or, uh, at any rate as a poet influenced by, uh, the image, just a aesthetic image.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Ism is of course, a visual metaphor. Uh, and Williams is above all a visual poet, a poet of the eye. Uh, so much depends upon a red wheelbarrow glazed with rain water, uh, and, uh, uh, beside the white chickens. Uh, well, uh, I think you have to see that poem to start to really be able to read it, uh, to, uh, it's, it's, uh, uh, I think probably does involve some subtle, uh, vocal and auditory experience. But, uh, it's first of all a poem that meets you and challenges you, uh, through the eye, uh, as a visual object in some sense on the page. Uh, the, the kind of seeing that Williams's poems call for, um, is, uh, we can think of as a way of reading that has, uh, uh, deaf. His poems themselves demand. Uh, in other words, there's a kind of link between how he sees the world and the way in which he asks us to read him.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Uh, his poems model, a kind of seeing, uh, unlike in a station of the Metro, uh, the red wheelbarrow, or let me call it instead, so much depends, uh, is a poem a without a title. Uh, this title, the Red Wheelbarrow was, uh, like the title. This is just to say in the poem that follows the almost equally famous pump. Uh, these are titles, a Williams, uh, added, uh, later to his work, uh, in spring and all that volume, uh, first edition 1923, uh, the poem appears simply as a, a text on the page. That's important. Uh, it's, part of, it's as important as the title is for infestation of a metro. Uh, simply presenting the poem on the page to us as Williams does. Doing it without a title a Williams asks us to, in some sense, read and encounter this poem without a frame, without some kind of pre established a boundary or explanatory, a introduction or entry.

Speaker 1:          07:56          That choice, uh, increases the immediacy of our experience. It's as if a Williams, we're asking you to kind of press up close to the poem, uh, uh, face it, uh, uh, just as he is facing the thing he is writing about, uh, or, uh, asks us to face, uh, well, not the, the thing that he's writing about so much as his act of writing, in seeing his act of writing as it embodies a way of seeing, uh, it has, uh, the poem has a suggestion, um, that, um, uh, it requires as a poem the same kind of calm intensity of concentration that the poets observation of the wheelbarrow exemplifies. Uh, so again, uh, you know, the, I think the, the, the kind of seeing that the poem does, uh, models away of reading.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Well, uh, what is that way of, uh, reading, uh, what is the, um, uh, how does the poem embody in its construction, which it calls attention to? How does it embody in its construction, uh, emotive perception, a way of, of seeing, uh, how has William's organized, uh, this, uh, language on the page, uh, by what principles, uh, looking at it? Well, uh, as I suggested before, it's not a poem. I think that we begin by hearing a, and we have to start reading it and seeing it before we can even think about how to really speak it properly. Uh, it is not a metrical poem. This is not, I am Beck pentameter. It is a, a free verse poem, um, in the, uh, in the prologue to Cora in hell. Um, which is, uh, uh, the pros I asked you to read for today at the back of the book. Um, there's, there's a number of sentences and ideas that are, uh, important. Uh, I'll call attention to just a few on nine 58, uh, William says, nothing is good. Save the new.

Speaker 2:          10:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:41          If a thing, ha, if a thing have novelty, it stands intrinsically beside every other work of artistic excellence. Uh, and if it doesn't, no loveliness or heroic proportion or grand manner, we'll save it. Uh, and he, uh, uh, identifies here as elsewhere. Uh, this property of novelty with, uh, uh, kind of verse that, uh, his shoes, um, uh, rhyme and meter, uh, a whole host of, uh, existing, uh, poetic conventions. Uh, again, in the headnote two, um, uh, the William Selection, uh, there's a, a quotation, uh, from, um, uh, Williams on the subject of, of, um, uh, meter, uh, on to 85, uh, from, uh, his pro statement, the poem as a field of action. Uh, he says, I propose, I propose sweeping changes from top to bottom of the poetic structure. I say we are with a, I am back pentameter as presently conceived, uh, through with the measured quite train, the stayed concatenation of sounds and the usual stanza, the Sonnet so much for the Silken tent, uh, Hart crane, a Wallace Stevens, et Cetera, uh, pound, uh, uh, excuse me.

Speaker 1:          12:17          Williams is a, uh, insisting that a modern verse, the kind of verse he describes a has to be, uh, uh, has to break with these models and has to, uh, proceed, uh, by a kind of, um, uh, by patterns that it itself invents. A free verse is a, in that sense, the, um, uh, uh, Williams is chosen medium, uh, free verse, uh, meaning, uh, a poem not pattern by metrical scheme or rhyme, uh, or, uh, indeed, uh, some other, uh, in the sense preexisting principle or pattern. Uh, nonetheless, uh, free verse does always have some kind of operative pattern, uh, sometimes, uh, very strict and structuring ones. Uh, and this short poem is a good example. Uh, in fact, uh, as you examine it, you see a series of four stanzas, right? A four to line groups since, uh, Williams might not like the word stands, uh, uh, uh, four to line groups. And, and, uh, the pattern is long, short, um, three or four syllables, um, uh, followed by two.

Speaker 1:          13:42          Uh, and, uh, this, this, uh, this is itself almost, uh, like a, a, a metrical or, uh, or a rhyme scheme. In fact, you could say this, this poem, this is more strict than a Sonnet, uh, that it's more limited in the range of choices that it allows. Uh, it isn't, however, presented to us as sonnets are. As an instance of a, um, uh, received verse form, uh, that is, uh, at least in its general pattern in variant, uh, and, um, um, uh, again a preexisting instead, the poem presents itself as a kind of ad hoc arrangement, uh, as a, as a kind of a structure that the poet has chosen to work within, uh, reflecting the contingencies of this moment. Uh, the occasion, uh, the poems purpose, uh, the, the poem, the poem shape, and this was one reason it's, it's hard to speak.

Speaker 1:          14:51          It's hard to hear, uh, organizes Williams his speech, uh, in a manner that disregards or disrupts, uh, normal, uh, familiar, uh, syntax. Uh, it does. So a specifically through in jam by carrying one line, a one line over to the next, uh, Williams is in jam [inaudible] have here as, uh, throughout his poetry. Uh, the effect of breaking up language, uh, uh, breaking it up, a, forcing us to in fact, slow down our reading, uh, to stop taking languages sense making for granted. And in a sense to get into the poem, uh, the white space in w a Williams palm is a, is you can think of it as a space for thought. A, a space where we are invited, uh, allowed, uh, required to think about choices, um, to ask ourselves about what a possible, uh, connections can be made at a given moment. In this poem, uh, William specifically breaks words up into their component parts, a wheel barrow, rain, water without hyphens, uh, as if, as if what he was looking at a red wheelbarrow, uh, consisted of those three terms, redness, uh, the wheel, the Barrow.

Speaker 1:          16:33          Uh, these are, it's a component elements, uh, he points out in effect in this device. Um, how, um, in this case, two nouns that are made of compounds that are really compounds represent things that are compounds, uh, things that are made up of other things that have parts, uh, as he established this as this pattern. So much depends upon a red wheel barrow glazed with rain water. You want to carry it forward, don't you? Now that we've learned what he's doing into the next stanza beside the white chickens, as if a white chickens were the same, uh, kind of compound as rainwater and red wheelbarrow, uh, but they're not quite, uh, and, uh, Williams is in a way teasing us. Uh, white chickens aren't made up of whiteness and chicken this in the same way that, uh, uh, a wheelbarrow is made up of a wheel and a bear out.

Speaker 1:          17:44          Uh, he's doing something a little different here. Uh, no sooner has he in effect established, uh, a certain, uh, pattern of cognition. Uh, a, uh, you know, uh, um, uh, showed us how to read his and jam minutes, then he breaks that pattern. Uh, he, uh, revises how it works. Uh, it's just been put in place and now it's changed and in fact, it's over. It's done. The poem is done. Um, if the, uh, uh, first lines of the poem and the first stanza is, are in a sense made to interrupt and disrupt and thereby freshen our habits of seeing, uh, to make us see these things in some new way. This last stanza does away with the habit of seeing that the poem itself has just constructed a, just introduced us to a Williams prevents us from settling into a convention of perception. Uh, even in a poem that is as small and as brief as this one, uh, there's, there's really only enough time in the poems essentially introduction and three parts following to, uh, establish a pattern and break it.

Speaker 1:          19:14          Uh, what this brief moment of heightened perception allows us to see, to experience, uh, it's something small and large. Uh, what is it that depends on the red wheelbarrow? Williams only says so much. Uh, so much. Uh, the idea is I think the beautiful one that the world when it's glazed with rain water, a kind of aesthetic effect and aesthetic effect that implies a light that does the glazing, that somewhere behind our shoulders and the poets as he looks at these objects, that that light, which comes after rain and is a product of change, uh, of the energy of the world is it transforms this light suddenly, uh, allows this world to be seen. Invisible detail, uh, apprehensible in its component parts. And, uh, the ordinary gestalt of perception is interrupted, uh, fresh and in reoriented we see something, something ordinary, newly, uh, and freshly.

Speaker 1:          20:37          It stands out, uh, in what we see in miniature, in the limited space of the moment or of the poem is, uh, world. Uh, well what we see is the elements out of which, uh, uh, the world is made elements ordinarily held in a kind of complex mutual dependency, uh, a kind of complex of relations that we simply take for granted, uh, in the words that we use in the, uh, a way that we see things. Uh, just as we put together, we'll and Barrow and rain and water without thinking about it. Uh, what the red wheelbarrow holes then, and what in that sense it depends on, it, uh, is something pretty heavy. Uh, and that is, uh, the sense of a whole world. We're, we're, we're better, uh, the, the sense of the world in its wholeness, uh, which is something affirmed, uh, in this, uh, attractively modest, momentary poetic perception so much for the red wheelbarrow springing off.

Speaker 1:          21:58          Uh, and there's that idea again in the title a spring as a season of newness, uh, for, for, uh, William's beginning his career spring, uh, registering his own beginnings, registering modernness, uh, a vision of the world in its newness. Well, uh, springing all, uh, isn't a, is a beautiful book. And one I wish I could show you, but the last time I saw it at Beinecke disappeared and no one has seen it. And a couple of years, uh, they have a lot of paper over there. I guess it's easy to lose things. Maybe it's, maybe it's a available. We'll, we'll, we'll look and see. A, it's a, it's a beautiful plane book, a Robin's egg blue, uh, for spring, I suppose. Uh, it seems, uh, uh, it's, it's, it's not, it's not large, small. Uh, it almost has no ornament. Uh, in, in all of this, it seems to exemplify the, uh, American virtues of a plainness and a directness and a simplicity, again, a long way from Hart Crane.

Speaker 1:          23:19          Uh, and the book is, is really, uh, so American that it was published in Dijon. Uh, Williams, uh, is a polemically American poet, even more than crane in certain ways, a more than frost even. Uh, and yet, uh, Williams has, has a very important and vital relationship to European modernism and a French, uh, modernism in particular [inaudible] and even more particularly to French painting. Uh, and to understand how Williams is writing what he's trying to get at. It's helpful to remember what he was looking at. Uh, here. Here's a Brock. Uh, I, uh, George Brock, a 1908, uh, it's, you know, on the way to cubism, uh, and I think sort of helpfully on the way to cubism because it, it looks back to a real list, uh, tradition, uh, with, uh, it's, uh, in a sense conventional, uh, Perspec tival space that's yet being broken up into planes, uh, that, uh, allow us to, uh, register, uh, the, uh, uh, painting as a painting.

Speaker 1:          24:37          And that force us to, uh, really, uh, and, uh, I suppose, uh, even more, uh, striking a is, is this, uh, uh, one of many great, uh, late, uh, Suzanne paintings of a limo, Sam Victoire where, uh, here, uh, again, uh, you know, um, the, uh, Perspec tival space of the, uh, uh, uh, painting as being a, turned into almost a kind of, um, uh, abstract field, uh, of, um, uh, color patterns. Uh, again, uh, these are painters interested in foregrounding their action of seeing through the ways in which they foreground self-consciously, uh, the materiality of the medium in which they are working. Um, the aim in, in, in post impressionist painting, and then in, in cubism. Really is to again, break up that gestalt of, of, uh, perception, uh, that, um, uh, Williams is, is, uh, uh, also opposing himself to, uh, to break it up and grasp in some sense the dynamism, uh, in, uh, the world, uh, before us, uh, precisely through acts of seeing, uh, that call attention to themselves into the way in which that seeing is rendered.

Speaker 1:          26:07          Um, if you, uh, uh, have, have read the prologue to Cora and hell, which is, uh, starts on nine 58, um, you know, that, um, uh, or excuse me, nine 54, William's begins with a, uh, anecdote about Marcel Duchamp, um, part of the New York art world that, uh, uh, Williams, um, um, also participated in through his friend, the, uh, a dealer and tastemaker Walter Errands Berg. Uh, uh, once, when I was taking lunch with Walter Errands Berg, I asked him if he could state what the more modern painters were about. Uh, and then he gives, uh, several, uh, as examples including a Duchamp, uh, all of whom were then in New York. Uh, and, uh, Erin's Berg replied by saying that the only way a man different from every other creature was in his ability to improvise novelty. And since the pictorial artist was under discussion, anything in paint that is truly new, truly a fresh creation is good art.

Speaker 1:          27:18          Thus, according to Duchamp, uh, who was Erin's burgs champion at the time, a stained glass window that had fallen out and lay more or less together on the ground was a far greater interest than the thing conventionally composed in city. You, uh, which is, uh, uh, interesting, um, uh, uh, model for, um, what, um, um, Williams himself might be seen as doing in poetry. That sound sentence. He's taking the stained glass window and, and you know, seeing it laid out on the floor, maybe broken on the floor. Um, Duchamp, uh, uh, painted this famous work, a nude descending a staircase, uh, and, uh, it, uh, is, is clearly all about, uh, here rendering, uh, in a pictorial form, the kind of a multi frame, a vision, right? That, uh, photography motion pictures allow us, uh, to see, uh, to, uh, again here, you know, grasp in representation, uh, some sense of the movement and, uh, energy, uh, that compose a, the, a world that, um, uh, we see before us.

Speaker 1:          28:35          Uh, the other, uh, dimension of, of, uh, uh, the Duchamp. A anecdote that that's nice, uh, uh, in, in Williams is telling us that a well, a stained glass window that, uh, and it's falling out as something you come upon or, or, or find a, and Duchamp is of course, uh, most famous for his, uh, let me turn to the next image. Uh, his ready mades this, a facsimile of the are, that is another version of, uh, uh, his most famous ready made a fountain. Um, a urinal, uh, which we, uh, uh, uh, signed with the pseudonym, uh, are moot. Uh, 1917 and, uh, uh, presented, uh, as a work of art. The, um, uh, our gallery, uh, has, um, um, this work. Uh, this too is a, is it, as it were, a facsimile of the original now loss, uh, uh, a snow shovel, uh, in other already made, uh, this one, um, uh, with the, with the, uh, excellent title in advance of the broken arm, uh, uh, Duchamp, uh, takes post impressionism, uh, to New York, uh, in the form of data, uh, a, uh, uh, movement, uh, with its importance for Williams to including, uh, uh, I think, um, duchamp's mischievousness, uh, in his, uh, willingness to, uh, provoke, be subversive to take, uh, Williams's word, uh, and to play with expectations about what constitutes, uh, art, uh, as Williams in certain ways we'd play with our expectations about what could constitute a poem, a or poetic statement in, um, New York, uh, and elsewhere, uh, Williams is in contact with a whole range of, um, uh, modernist, uh, American artists, uh, influenced by the, uh, European art I've just been talking about.

Speaker 1:          30:52          Um, uh, but also, uh, working in a distinctively American, uh, mode. This is, uh, a, a work by a shark, Charles de Muth. Uh, 1921. I'm sorry, I'm behind on producing my image lists, but I'll, I'll get this for you. Uh, and in here is, uh, another, um, and again, uh, here, uh, in urban scene, uh, that is, um, uh, a realist in it's a mode of representation. And yet the, uh, uh, for grounding of, um, the, uh, uh, lines created by the different shapes of the buildings, uh, call attention to this as a indeed a kind of constructed, uh, image, uh, that is, seems to be, you know, moving out of the, um, uh, realm of realist representation to something, uh, more a symbolic and certainly, um, uh, avowedly, um, uh, created, uh, by, uh, the artist, uh, uh, Damuth, uh, goes further in the same direction in a what is probably his, his best known work.

Speaker 1:          32:12          Uh, this is, uh, called the great figure number five. Uh, if, um, uh, Williams was busy, uh, looking at these artists I've just been talking about, they also were looking at him, uh, and, and, uh, uh, do a painting is a, a attribute to Williams, uh, and a, a little homage. Also, I think a little joke about a Williams is a own poem, uh, also from springing off, uh, that we know as the great figure on two 91. Uh, this is, um, well I'll, I'll read this, uh, again, uh, rain and light, uh, among the rain and lights. I saw the figure five in gold on a red fire truck moving with weight and urgency, tense unheeded to Gong clangs, siren howls and wheels rumbling through the dark city. Uh, and, uh, this is, you know, uh, a rendering of that, uh, uh, that moment that that draws out the, I'm a way in which the poem fines and makes, uh, an exalted symbol, uh, from this ordinary perception.

Speaker 1:          33:39          Uh, it's got bill up top and WCW down in the bottom and Carlos, uh, underneath the five, uh, uh, as part of this, uh, friendly, uh, tribute, uh, the pumps. Interesting to look at next to, uh, the red wheelbarrow. Here's something else that's red, right? Uh, and, uh, again, um, uh, the poem is concerned with a, a moment of, of perception. Uh, here, uh, the poem really tries to render the process by which perception takes place where, or rather the kind of context in which it does, which the red wheelbarrow doesn't. Red wheelbarrow really kind of takes, this, takes something seen. Uh, I'm a fragmented out of, uh, uh, a continuum of, of perception that we can feel implied, uh, but, uh, isn't made explicit in the poem. Uh, the, um, uh, in this case, uh, the, uh, uh, we were given the kind of context, uh, out of which a detail, uh, something that arbitrary contingent, ordinary, uh, springs out, uh, springs out of the rush of things, uh, and, and, uh, uh, catches the eye and the imagination and the intention of the poet, uh, in a station of the metro.

Speaker 1:          35:07          This is a poem about metropolitan urban perception. Uh, so as this poem, uh, here, instead of a, a present moment that's, uh, briefly suspended, uh, as in pound's poem or as in, uh, so much depends. Uh, this poem is, is just as much about memory, uh, uh, in the, in the, the rush of, of ongoing experience, of a kind of ongoing temporality of, uh, uh, figured here by the fire truck moving. And there's that part of Sippeel, uh, a word moving kind of ongoing action. Uh, in the midst of this, the, uh, something, uh, um, uh, catches the poet's attention. Uh, he acts, uh, uh, as a perceiver. He says, I saw in that action, uh, expressed in, in a verb, in the past tense, uh, intervenes in and, and, uh, uh, you know, cuts, uh, into this blurry, uh, perceptual part of Sippeel flow of things. Uh, that is the firetruck, a rushing by. Uh, it fixes on a figure, in this case, a number, uh, and, uh, carries that, uh, away and out of the, uh, experience, uh, that, uh, that five on the firetruck, uh, it's something utterly ordinary. Uh, like a wheel barrel or a shovel, snow shovel. Uh, it's a kind of found object, uh, and yet, uh, here for, um,

Speaker 1:          36:54          Williams, uh, he makes something of it, uh, or, uh, uh, plays with the act of making something with it. It is, uh, uh, something he calls with some joking, some seriousness, the great figure, a great figure, a symbol, but a symbol of what, uh, of what exactly, uh, well, um, perhaps, uh, a symbol of, uh, the very capacity of the ordinary to arrest our attention and become significant, uh, become objects of perception. Uh, perhaps a symbol of the five senses themselves. What do you think, uh, that seems possible to, uh, the five senses, uh, who's powers, uh, uh, are behind for Williams, the way we create figurative language, uh, the way we create figures and poems and discover symbols and discover meaning in the world around us.

Speaker 3:          38:07          Uh, okay.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Now life is above all things else at any moment. Subversive of life as it was the moment before, always knew irregular. Uh, the poem that place just after this anthology is, is, uh, one of William's this greatest, uh, and uh, uh, it too, as it appears in the volume springing all has no title. Uh, but it's given a title here, the title of the volume itself, uh, but, uh, was known rather, uh, for a long time simply by its first line, by the road to the contagious hospital. Uh, this, uh, the poem is about the continual newness that Williams calls life, something that's continually constructing the world around us. Uh, in the poet in this poem gets at it like the post impressionist painter, uh, even perhaps like the data is, uh, by calling his and our attention, uh, to the act of constructing his poem.

Speaker 1:          39:20          Uh, and in particularly, uh, as that construction is, is felt as it's kind of brought to our consciousness through in jam, uh, Williams, his poetry, like the world he sees is constantly in jammed, segmented, renewed, uh, uh, by that act. Uh, let's look at how in jam works here by the road to the contagious hospital under the surge of the blue modeled clouds, driven from the northeast, a cold when beyond the waste of broad money feels brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen, patches of standing water, the scattering of tall trees all along the road, the reddish, purplish forked, upstanding twiggy stuff of bushes and small trees with dead Brown leaves under them. Leafless vines, lifeless again, dead in appearance, sluggish, dazed spring approaches. That is the first verb in the pump. They, he now says suggesting all of these things, they entered the new world, naked, cold, uncertain of all save that they enter all about them.

Speaker 1:          40:55          These things, the things of the world, the cold, familiar wind. Now the grass tomorrow, the stiff curl of wild carrot leaf, one by one objects are defined like a series of images. Poems, it now, not they but it, which is the again now here a world felt in its wholeness Quicken's clarity, outline of leaf, but now the stark dignity of entrance still the profound change has come upon them rooted. They grip down and begin to awaken. It's a great pump. Uh, and in jam is a key part of its energy. Uh, the first, uh, in jam at that is striking a, is bold. It's one of the really famous ones, in fact in modern poetry is that second line, this, uh, under the surge of the blue, it invites us to read the blue as a noun, right? Uh, and to feel and hear that phrase, the surge of the blue, uh, as a kind of a conventional expression of lyric romantic exaltation.

Speaker 1:          42:15          But we're wrong. Uh, blue is, uh, an adjective, uh, and, uh, uh, we learned this as the poem turns. Uh, and, uh, the, uh, in Jasmine, uh, supplies the information that this blue, this kind of exalted thing, uh, is actually modeled a marred war, flawed even in some sense. Uh, uh, and, um, uh, here, um, the newness that the poem is going to celebrate, uh, is going to be something we might feel modeled, uh, that, uh, uh, cold, uh, flawed, which is part of its claim to be new, uh, part of its claim to represent something really real. Uh, not to be found in previous books of poetry, uh, but something, uh, to be found in living. Uh, so at this moment it seems in jam it means disestablishment, uh, that word of, uh, Williams's the subversion of life has, it just was, uh, uh, a surprise of perception.

Speaker 1:          43:35          But yeah. Uh, as in the red wheelbarrow, uh, if you think we've now learned what [inaudible] means in a given context, Williams is going to do something else. Uh, uh, the next lines are also sharply in Jammed, um, uh, modeled clouds driven from the northeast, a cold when beyond the waste of broad, muddy fields. Uh, I mean, that's a, that is itself a bold thing to have done in poetry to break off align at the definite article. Uh, I'm not sure that there's an example, uh, in, uh, poetry previously to align to this, these examples of lines ending in the, okay. Uh, there may well be, but it's, it's, it's yet a, a novel and bold thing for, um, uh, uh, Williams to do, uh, but it works differently from the previous example where, um, uh, the blue invited us to, um, read that phrase as a kind of Noun, uh, expressive of romantic exaltation and then, and then gave us the surprise that no, it doesn't function that way and what you thought was a pure and exalted as in fact modeled and, and a messy, uh, these in jam, it's don't have any kind of interpretive surprise like that.

Speaker 1:          45:06          The lines are just broken that way. Uh, they, they don't change the, how we read the grammar of the phrases. They don't force us to recast our expectations. Uh, together though as a series of, and Jim Mintz, uh, these lines evoke a state in which the world is freshly taking shape coming at us and informs, uh, that we have to confront, uh, that are, uh, uh, that give us abrupt insistent impressions, uh, which are sometimes full of meaning and sometimes not. Uh, this is a poetic version way. Williams is, uh, is constructing this poem is a poetic version, uh, of the action that the poems describing the going forward into spring against the cold, uh, through which eventually one by one objects are defined, uh, defined and organized and energized and animated as William sees it. As I say, uh, the verb does not come in the poem, uh, until uh, we see, uh, that phrase spring approaches, uh, almost a at the middle of, slightly beyond the middle of the poem.

Speaker 1:          46:19          Uh, and then, uh, that next, um, uh, sentence they entered the new world naked. Uh, they being deliberately vague, uh, uh, evoking the things of the world, but in a humanized way, uh, uh, a humanized way as we come to feel them and see them, they enter the world just as we do naked. Uh, and, uh, uh, and we, we enter it naked with them. You could say, uh, this is a poem about, uh, emergence a that identifies a modern poetry modern verse, uh, as William calls it, uh, uh, Williams calls it in his letter to Monroe, uh, identifies modern verse with the process by which the perceptual world takes shape, grips down, grips, down, routing itself in ordinary fact and things, uh, and from which, uh, uh, kind of, uh, energy is drawn and we begin to awaken. This is probably a good, uh, uh, place to, to, and, uh, I want to stress the resonance and, and, and suggestiveness of, of, um, uh, Williams is investment in what is naked.

Speaker 1:          47:37          It's a, it's a way of, uh, um, envisioning the world in its primary terms. It's also a way of calling forth a kind of, uh, human energy, uh, that is, uh, primary, uh, and, uh, again as, um, uh, Williams a imagines that, uh, modern. And here he is a in the buff, um, uh, uh, I guess, uh, skinny dipping in New Jersey with a couple sticks to pretend he's pan. Um, so, uh, go enjoy the spring day. Uh, and we all, um, uh, keep your clothes on. And, uh, we'll, um, talk about maybe a little more Williams, but definitely Mary and more next time.
