Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, crane is a challenge. Uh, he's is a challenge for you. Uh, he's a, uh, a challenge for me as a teacher. He is the challenging poet. He challenges his reader. He, uh, challenges us and he, uh, uh, he makes invitations to us. Uh, he, um, um, well he, he, um, he calls to us in various ways, places, demands on us. Uh, I'd like to, um, talk about, uh, a text. I am not in fact holding. I wonder if, uh, somebody has an ris packet handy and I could have it in my hands. Thank you gene. And that is a, the palm legend, which is, um, the, uh, poem, uh, placed first in, um, Crane's first and only book of lyrics called white buildings. Uh, it's a, it's a poem that he use to introduce himself to the reader as it were. So why don't we, uh, use it to, uh, begin thinking about his work, uh, as silent as a mirror is believed, reality is plunge in. Silence by the poem begins with that, with a kind of, um, riddle or enigma, and then the first person comes forward. I am not ready for repentance nor to match regrets for the moth. Ben's no more than the still imploring flame. So wonderful. It's a wonderful idea. Uh, I'm not going to repent of anything. I'm not going to regret anything. Uh, I have not a bent any more. I have nothing more to regret then the, the flame which has drawn me,

Speaker 1:          02:21          uh, which, uh, uh, bent as well for the moth. Ben's no more than the still imploring flame and tremors in the white falling flakes. Kisses are

Speaker 2:          02:38          Comma Dash. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:41          The only worth all granting,

Speaker 2:          02:46          eh,

Speaker 1:          02:48          characteristically here for crane, there's a, uh, well a compressed set of images. Um, uh,

Speaker 2:          03:00          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Those tremors, uh, white falling flakes, they're, well, they're almost images aren't, they have a burnt moth, a moth that's been drawn to the flame. Uh, and then, uh, those come to be seen as here. Uh, kisses, kisses. If we unpack cranes, od Syntex, uh, it would see the sentence would seem to read, although it's maybe available to other constructions. Uh, kisses are tremors in the white falling flakes, but these cases, these cases that are, um, uh, also emblems of, um, uh, of flame and, and, uh, extinction even a, are the only worth all granting. That is the only value that seems to grant all I think, again, those, those, those, those words all granting, um, uh, might be construed in a couple of different ways. Crane says, uh, it is to be learned what is to be learned. This cleaving and this burning, the kind I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Uh, uh, we, we must learn to be drawn to the flame and we must learn to recover from the, uh, uh, recover from the flame and a renew our desires and renew our quests. Uh, it is to be learned this cleaving in this burning but only by the one who spends out himself. Again, in order to do this, you've got to spend yourself repeatedly over and over again. Uh, and then he gives us other images of this kind of repeated burning twice and twice again. The smoking souvenir, bleeding idle on idol on is the Greek word for image, uh, in yet again,

Speaker 1:          05:13          this activity is repeated and repeated until the bright logic is one. And whispering he returns to that initial enigmatic image on whispering as a mirror is believed, then drop my caustic, drop a perfect cry shell string, some constant harmony, relentless caper for all those. And here we are challenged and invited to meet him and join him who step the legend of their youth into the noon? Well, it's a hard poem. Uh, and yet, uh, there are a few, I think simple basic ideas. It projects that are important to the poet that crane saw himself as, uh, and um, uh, the one he wants us to receive. And an in a sense join, uh, he presents himself as an unrepentant visionary, uh, Romantic, uh, and lover since after all these roles are all held in some association here. Um, he talks about, uh, hear a willingness that's erotic, that's aesthetic, that spiritual to exhaust oneself in the pursuit of one's desires to spend out yourselves again and repeatedly.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Uh, there is in this, uh, the promise that by doing it repeatedly drop by caustic drop, uh, a kind of lyric voice will emerge that will be a perfect cry. And despite this destruction and pain and blood bleeding idol on a constant that is sustained harmony will be achieved a harmony invoking of course, more than one voice, uh, in what is this? This is a poetic project, uh, and it's, uh, it's a project that he describes as a relentless Kapor, oh, relentless Caper, uh, a Cape, a caper. Uh, it comes from Latin, uh, the sense of, uh, the, uh, the goat that leaps. Uh, it's also, it's a word that that suggests. Um, uh, well some kind of a minor mischief, uh, a relentless caper for all those who step the legend of their youth into the noon. Uh, and here, crane presents himself as a young person who would project, uh, all of, uh, the youthful vitality of his vision and desire into this, uh, symbolically pregnant moment that he calls the noon. And so it's a time very important in cranes, imagination. Uh, I think idiosyncratically, uh, individually, but also, uh, in a way that that alludes to a noon and Emily Dickinson's poems, a Dickinson being a poet, that a crane shares a great deal with, uh, the poetry, uh, of Hart Crane. Uh, well it proposes to approach what he calls noon, which is, uh, an experience of a fullness and, uh, uh, absolute presence.

Speaker 2:          09:14          Now, uh,

Speaker 1:          09:17          what does he mean that he's not ready for repentance? Uh, who, who after all is told him to repent, who has, um, who has told him he has something to regret, uh, repent and something that crane heard from the culture at large, uh, in important ways. A crane is writing in the mid twenties. Uh, W we're at this point, uh, I think this is a poem from 1924 or so. Um, uh, it is, um, postwar America. A crane's sees himself as a member of a new youthful world, uh, centered in, uh, places like Greenwich Village. Uh, he sees himself as part of a young America, uh, uh, bound together, uh, across place, uh, by a kind of common dedication to art. Uh, and to their will to free themselves from the sexual and economic disciplines that he calls in this a letter that I have,

Speaker 2:          10:41          mmm.

Speaker 1:          10:44          Quoted, uh, other, uh, sentences from a cause. Puritanism a crane crane is, I'm writing in an era.

Speaker 2:          10:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:00          The era of the 18th Amendment prohibition is in effect. Um, there is, um,

Speaker 1:          11:12          a range of kinds of censorship that are, you know, a real and present threat. James Joyce is novel. Ulysses has been banned from the United States shores for it's obscenity. A, there's a way in which modernist art, uh, is mixed up with questions of sexuality. Crane got his copy of Ulysses smuggled from France, which a friend then stole a crane. A crane is living, uh, to, uh, in, in a, a vital and nascent gay culture in New York in particular, uh, uh, and yet within, uh, an nation. Uh, then as now, uh, that is, uh, strongly homophobic and anti gay and all sorts of ways,

Speaker 2:          12:18          mmm.

Speaker 1:          12:20          Cranes, insistence on, um, his refusal to repent. His refusal to regret, uh, are, um, uh, um, assertions of, um, um, his will towards forms of sexual and imaginative freedom. Uh, they're also, um, affirmations of a romantic poetics, uh, essential to him. Um, the, um,

Speaker 1:          12:59          there's also a literary historical context for this that's important and that I think you can probably already, uh, start to, uh, uh, uh, guests at a crane is a deep and a deeply ambivalent reader of the wasteland. And Ts Elliot, uh, he says in this letter to Guam months and, uh, in January, 1923, there's no one writing in English who can command so much respect to my mind as Elliot. However, I take Elliot as a point of departure towards an almost complete reverse of direction. His pessimism is amply justified in his own case. Why? I don't know what crane crane had his to his fantasies about Elliot sexual life. Uh, I think, um, but I would apply as much of as area addition and technique is I can absorb and assemble toward a more positive, or if I mess, put it so in a skeptical age, ecstatic goal, I should not think of this.

Speaker 1:          14:14          If a kind of rhythm and ecstasies we're not at odd moments and rare, a very real thing to me, I feel that Elliot ignores certain spiritual events and possibilities as real and powerful. Now as say, in the time of Blake, Blake is very important to crane. Certainly the man has dubbed the ground and buried hope as deep in dire flea as it can ever be done after this perfection of death, which is what crane is, is, uh, uh, this is how he's reading the wasteland. Nothing is in motion, but a resurrection of some kind. He says, well, uh, crane is, um, reading the wasteland and he's reading Elliot's criticism. He's responding to, well, he's responding to a series of, of text and I'll just show you some of what he's reading here. Um, this is, um, the criterion, the first place, uh, Elliot's poetry. Uh, the wasteland appeared a, that's an October, 1922 Elliot's own magazine. Um, the first American publication of the poem was in the dial, uh, in, uh, November, 1922. And, um, then, uh, the poem appeared in, um, I don't know if you can see that very well.

Speaker 1:          16:14          Um, the poem appeared in New York Publication in book form, uh, in, uh, as its own discreet, uh, text when, um, uh, the, uh, live right addition of the palm was, was being prepared. Uh, as I mentioned last time, uh, Elliot was asked to make the poem a little longer because after all, it was a little too short, uh, and uh, or so the story goes, uh, and this was impart a, one of his motives for producing the notes to the poem. Uh, as I said last time, and this is the, uh, uh, way the poet poem looked in a America, uh, when it first appeared, uh, with, and of course with just a few lines per page, I, last time I called it the long, long, shortest long poem and the language, uh, you can see the way in which it's sort of drawn out.

Speaker 1:          17:20          Um, here's the little section. I, uh, uh, ended by talking about death by water. Well. Um, as I suggested last time, Elliot's notes, uh, and, um, uh, suggested, created a kind of, um, role for the poet where the poet was not the creative lyric, uh, um, presence at the center of the palm, but was also a kind of a scholar and critic of his own work. Uh, framing, uh, it, uh, mastering bodies of knowledge and, uh, arranging, uh, meaning, uh, in ways that the notes, uh, amble Matteis. Um, in the process Elliot's doing a couple of things. He, uh, that that crane is responding to. Um, he is establishing himself in what I described as a new role. Uh, and that's very much the role you see, uh, Elliot, uh, uh, embodying here. That is the, the poet as a, uh, as a kind of a, a scholar poet, um, uh, a, uh, um, figure backed by institutional authority of various kinds.

Speaker 1:          19:03          And, uh, this figure is created specifically in the wasteland, uh, through the, um, through the poems turning away from, in turning against in complicated ways, uh, its own forms of romanticism, which last time I suggested, uh, we're, uh, emblem monetized by that drown Phoenician sailor, a fleabag [inaudible], um, who, um, is a kind of figure for what the poem sacrifices, um, or you might say a kind of version of the self that Elliot, uh, is willing to give up. Um, crane in countering the poem I think must have been obsessed with the section death by water. Um, must've been, must've seen, must've messed up, heard Elliot talking to him when, uh, Elliot says, consider flea bus, uh, the Phoenician sailor who was once tall and handsome as you, um, crane means to, uh, reassert the power of youth reassert, uh, the potential for romantic vision, uh, and uh, to do so, uh, in a way that would, um, that he imagines as a kind of resurrection.

Speaker 1:          20:46          And as a, as a kind of passage through and beyond death by water, uh, drowning, uh, is a, uh, important imaginative motif in a crane's work. The palms that I'll, I'll concentrate on now to, uh, explore this idea. Uh, all have images of romance quest and, and drowning, uh, at their, their center. Uh, and I mean, uh, first of all, the, a very great love poem called voyages on six Oh nine, um, which, uh, Elliot, excuse me, which crane, uh, began, uh, in the spring of 1920 for about a year, uh, after he's read the wasteland. Uh, and the palm is, I think his first sort of developed reply, uh, and it, uh, centers, as I say, um, on, uh, images of drowning. The poem arises from, uh, a love affair with, uh, as it happens. A Danish sailor, uh, who was part of the, um, uh, Bohemian, um, uh, crowd around the province to province town players in Greenwich village.

Speaker 1:          22:28          Uh, Crane's letters are full of, um, well both reflections on Elliott, uh, and also, uh, ecstatic, um, and, um, very moving, um, accounts of his love affair with Emile for, uh, I'll, I'll read you just a few sentences from one letter to, um, uh, his friend Waldo Frank. He says, Crane does, it will take many letters to let you know what I mean for myself, at least when I say in this relationship that I have seen the word made flesh, I mean nothing less. And I know now that there is such a thing as indestructibility in the deepest sense where flesh became transformed through intensity of response to counter response, where sex was beaten out, where a purity of joy was reached that included tears, uh, imagery from, from this and other letters that crane, uh, wrote during the period, uh, uh, um, emerge in, in voyage is the very first section of, uh, had been in fact sitting on cranes desk for three years above the fresh ruffles of the surf.

Speaker 1:          23:54          Bright striped urchins flake each other with sand. They have contrived a quest, excuse me, a conquest for Shell shucks. And their fingers crumble. Fragments of baked, we'd Gayley digging and scattering and an answer to their trouble. Reflections. The Sun beats lightening on the waves, the waves, full funder in the sand. And could they hear me? I would say I would tell them, oh, brilliant. Kids Frisk with your dog. Fondel your shells and sticks bleached by time and the elements. But there is a line you must not cross nor ever trust beyond it. Spry cordage of your bodies to caresses too, like and faithful from two wide abreast. The bottom of the sea is cruel.

Speaker 1:          24:58          The poem begins on shore, begins with a kids playing, uh, their play. You know, it's innocence seems to imply and gesture towards, um, ferocious energies that, um, uh, our emblem Matteis by the sea, uh, in all of its thunder and lightening and power, uh, you, you, they fondle they flay. Uh, the, the shoreline is a, is a place where they're, they're fragments of debris, uh, proof of the CS force. Uh, the poem begins with a simple moral, a injunction or, or practical, really, uh, uh, uh, practical warning to give yourself over to the sea would be to enter a field of unbounded energy to risk your identity, to risk being overwhelmed. Think of proof. Rock on the shore. Shall I wear my chowders role?

Speaker 1:          26:22          Uh, crane is, uh, they're in the same, same place. Uh, and having issued this warning, acknowledged the cruelty of the bottom of the sea. He throws it off and throws it behind and enters the water. And yet that important piece of cranium, punctuation, the dash a a bit of punctuation that separates and connects elements, uh, pushes that warning away and takes us into the sea. And yet this great wink of eternity of rimless floods come borderless space, unfettered Lee wordings, CMI cheated in procession to where her undying old vast belly cream images. The see here, uh, as a con, as a woman's body and as a kind of belly that bends towards the moon. Uh, you know, it's a kind of vision of, of the, uh, kind of open horizon of the sea is you, you know, it seems to kind of project the curve of the earth.

Speaker 1:          27:35          And, uh, her undying old vast belly moon word, Ben's laughing, the wrapped inflections of our love. There's a, that's a kind of a wonderful cranium word wrapped. Uh, it, it's, it would seem to mean both a wrapped in the sense of wrapped up, uh, and wrapped in the sense of held in rapture. Uh, he's kind of combined possibly through error. These two forms. Crane makes errors. He's unlike the scholarly Elliot. He continues, uh, and and now gives us instructions. Take this, see who's diaphysis and Nell's on scrolls of silver snowy sentences, the sceptred terror of whose session wrens as her demeanor, demeanor's motion will or ill all. But the pieties of lover's hands, uh, here, uh, being in the space of the sea is like being in love or, um, in the act of love as crane imagines it. It's also like being in a fabulous rhetorical world, uh, a space of gorgeous, extravagant, uh, language.

Speaker 1:          28:59          Uh, which crane unleashes here in all of its, uh, uh, um, terrific force. Uh, it's, it's language that that, um, is I am pentameter unlike Elliot, uh, is, uh, uh, language, uh, as rich and, and or Nate, uh, as, uh, on the, uh, English renaissance stage. Marlo would have liked this. Um, it is, uh, also a kind of a romantic, um, uh, diction and, uh, they're, um, elements of serve late 19th century British and French poetry. That crane is combining here. He says, an onward as bells off San Salvador. Salute the crocus luster of the stars in these points. Set a meadows of her tides, a dodgy of islands. Oh my prodigal. Complete the dark confessions her veins. Spell mark, how her turning shoulders wind the hours and hasten while her penniless rich palms past superscription of bent foam and wave hasten while they are true, because they will not be true forever.

Speaker 1:          30:23          Sleep, death, desire close round one instant in one floating flower. Crane understands that love like rhetoric, cast a spell and uh, that love and poetry create illusions. Uh, he does not therefore despise them. Uh, different from, uh, uh, Elliot, uh, in, in, uh, in a basic way. He acknowledges, as it were, the temporariness of, uh, his, um, uh, desire. In fact, he says, bind us in time. Oh, seasons clear and all. Oh, minstrel galleons of carob fire. What are minstrel galleons of care of fire? Well, maybe were actual ships that he's imagining passing among maybe, uh, they are, um, um, uh, the lights of the moon or sun on the sea. He says to the sea, big queen us. I know we're going to die, but Cuiv us to no earthly shore, in other words, don't bury us, uh, until an as in legend crane produces a funny syntactic reversal here, but quede this to no earthly sure until is answered in the vortex of our grave.

Speaker 1:          32:13          The seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise. Uh, there, uh, the subject of the sentence comes last. Uh, the sentences, the seals wide spindrift gaze is answered in the vortex of our gray. What crane has done there is, um, well he's reversed the syntactic quarter of subject and verb. By doing so, he's introduced first the image of death by drowning. Uh, that is the vortex of our grave. Uh, and uh, he's put that up first and then he's followed it with the image of the seals gaze, which, uh, comes, uh, and emerges, um, after drowning, uh, that the seal is here kind of figure of a kind of consciousness, uh, and desire expressed through the eyes, uh, that is, uh, that survives death. Uh, look back to the poem proceeding, um, called APP Melville's tomb. Uh, there is a, here, this is a kind of allergy for Melville, which seems to presume falsely, uh, that Melville, uh, is, uh, uh, drowned and not buried unsure as he is a, and there there's an image of, again, of drowning, uh, in, um, lines 11 and 12th, uh, and again, it kind of image of, of, of vortex.

Speaker 1:          33:51          Uh, then in the circuit, calm of one vast coil after the storm that has wrecked the ship. It's lashings charmed and those lashings remind you of the flanks of the kids on the voyage is in slashings charmed and malice, reconciled frosted eyes. There were that lifted altars and silent answers crept across the stars. How do eyes lift altars in, um, uh, crane's letter to Harriet Monroe in defense of this poem? Uh, and when he calls the logic of metaphor, crane, uh, says, well, um, eyes lift altars in the sense that they bring the object of their desire into being, uh, through their desire. That is a, you, uh, you, uh, you raise the altar, you create the, the, the, uh, object of worship through your yearning for, uh, it, uh, this is, uh, you know, again, uh, uh, uh, a kind of visionary act, uh, and it's, uh, a version of the one that we find at the end of the second section of, uh, voyages where we see the Wa the seagulls, or excuse me, the, um, um, uh, the seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise, a wide, a wide because it's a gaze that, that, that is large and takes in, um, um, uh, much, uh, space.

Speaker 1:          35:25          Uh, why? Because the sea is a, as a kind of space in which we have latitude of action, spin drift. It's a word that crane took from Moby Dick, uh, from Melville. Uh, replacing another word, not such a good word, which also came from Moby Dick Finn Rennie. Uh, it's a good, he got rid of that. Uh, uh, spindrift is important when you are in the sea. It is like being in the crane poem. You don't have the ground under your feet. You spin and you drift. Uh, you spend in new drift and words mix and match and create words like spindrift. Uh, this is a condition that crane calls in the next poem, infinite consanguinity where there's a kind of sharing of, of elements, uh, uh, kind of, uh, uh, transformation, um, through a exchange that goes on. This is understood as what happens, uh, in love. Uh, it's also, uh, understood as a kind of model for poetic process. Uh, it's imaged here in this palm and in triumphant language, uh, as a kind of, um, a transcendence of death, uh, here describing a moment of climactic intensity crane rights and so admitted through black swollen gates that must arrest all distance otherwise past whirling pillars and live pediments light wrestling there incessantly with light star kissing star through wave on wave unto your body rocking

Speaker 1:          37:13          and where death if shed like a skin presumes no carnage, know a final death of the body, but rather this single change upon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn, the silken skilled trans member mint of song.

Speaker 2:          37:33          Okay,

Speaker 1:          37:34          permit me voyage. Love into your hands. Uh, the silk and skilled trans member of song. This is cranes, uh, final fantastic line of I ambig pentameter where, uh, he proclaims a kind of a transformation that is at once a erotic and rhetorical, uh, where, um, uh, elements, uh, uh, between two parties have been exchanged just at Dick's, changed in reverse just as the, uh, s silk and skill, uh, give us phonemes that are held in almost to kind of mirror relation ship, uh, and alliteration. The I, l, k, K, I, l a, and then crane introduces us to another word that he coins a trans member meant a trans member meant what does Trans member meant mean? It seems to be made out of what? Remember Dismember, uh, transformation. He's talking about a kind of activity that involves all of these things at once, uh, and, um, uh, through it, uh, achieves a kind of vision of a union, which is a, again, as I say, uh, both, uh, linguistic and, uh, um, interpersonal. Well, that seems like a good place to stop for now. Uh, we'll, um, carry these poems on as a, as a way to read his long poem in reply to the wasteland. The bridge.
