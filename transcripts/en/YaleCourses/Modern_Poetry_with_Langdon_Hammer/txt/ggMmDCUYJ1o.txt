Speaker 1:          00:12          Well, let's, let's turn to a page five 27 in your anthology where you find a famous poem by Wilfred Owen called Bell K at Decorum S. And uh, your footnote explains, that's that phrase is the beginning of a line from Horace completed at the end of the poem, uh, that isn't the last lines of the palm pro Patrizia Mori, uh, translated as a, it is sweet and proper sweeten right decorous to die for one's country. Bent double like old beggars under sacks, knock kneed coughing like hags. We cursed from sludge till on the haunting flares. We turned our backs and towards our distant rest began to trudge. Men Marched Asleep. Many had lost their boots, but limped on bloodshot.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:31          all went lame. All blind drunk with fatigue, death even to the hoots of tired out stripped five nines that dropped behind gas, gas quick boys. An ecstasy of fumbling fitting the clumsy helmets just in time, but someone's still was yelling, yelling out and stumbling and floundering like a man in fire or lime, dim through the misty pains and thick green light as under a green. See, I saw him drowning in all my dreams before my helpless site. He plunges at me. Guttering, choking, drowning.

Speaker 2:          02:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:30          If in some smothering dreams, you too could pace behind the wagon that we flung him in.

Speaker 2:          02:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, his hanging face like a devil's sick of sin. If you could hear at every jolt, the blood come gargling from the froth, corrupted lungs, obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues. My friend, you would not tell with such high zest to children, ardent for some desperate glory, the old lie Dole k at the core. I'm asked Cro. Patrizia Maury.

Speaker 2:          03:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Paul Fussell, uh, a literary critic who wrote a brilliant book about, uh, the literature and, uh, uh, culture, uh, of, of the first world war. Uh, he speaks of irony as, as the, uh, essential trope or rhetorical figure, uh, of this body of literature, World War One poetry. Uh, here is in this poem, uh, a, uh, uh, example of irony of a really comparatively simple kind, uh, what our school by school boy lines from Horace Lines that, uh, oh, and then many others would have learned in school, uh, to recite, uh, to have memorized that, uh, uh, poetry is here held up as propaganda, uh, as, as a, as a kind of murderous lie. It is sweet and right to die for one's country. Uh, uh, you, you, you, you can feel it in the marvelous texture of this poetry, uh, against horses decorous and elegant Latin, uh, there is placed Owen's Anglo Saxon alliterative inflected, strongly stressed, uh, language, uh, with, it's a rough, uh, and, uh, actual, uh, vernacular diction.

Speaker 1:          05:07          Uh, the power and authority to, of, of, uh, uh, Owens writing, uh, is well certified. We feel, uh, by that first person, uh, that speaks to us, that, that I, who speaks from as a, as a witness, uh, to, uh, war, uh, as a describer, uh, as someone telling a reader elsewhere, uh, what he has seen in speaking specifically for, uh, one fallen soldier. Uh, the reception of Owen's poetry has always been attached to, um, uh, a sense of, oh, and as a soldier and witness to war, uh, and indeed as a victim of war, uh, who, uh, uh, died a week before the armistice. Uh, this, uh, these poems, uh, that you see the cover for here, um, excuse me, poems by Wilfred Owen, uh, originally appeared posthumously, uh, uh, after, uh, uh, Owens death, uh, introduced by Sigrid Sas, soon a comrade fellow poet, fellow soldier.

Speaker 1:          06:37          Uh, and, and as you can see, uh, it, uh, in addition to the introduction, um, uh, the cover advertises also a portrait of the art, not a portrait of the artist at portrait of the author. And there is oh and, uh, in uniform, uh, a handsome young man. Um, this is, uh, all, as I say, very much part of the transmission of Owen's poetry. A doll k et decorum asked, uh, is a, is a great poem. But the kind of irony that it puts forward is I think a simple one. Uh, it is, uh, well, and it's a poem. There are lots of them, uh, that are, are great poems, uh, that when I first started teaching this course, I decided I wouldn't teach. Uh, and, and for a number of reasons, uh, including, um, well, uh, the sense that, uh, g Yates, Steven's, uh, uh, Elliot, these, they're hard poets and we need as much time on them as we can, uh, in, in order to read their work.

Speaker 1:          07:51          And, and, uh, this poem, uh, seemed, uh, like one you might find and be able to read yourself, uh, without me there to explain it. Um, it also is the case that probably probably many of you have already read it, uh, and possibly studied it in school and talked about it. So, at any rate, this seemed to me to be, uh, when I started teaching this course. Um, uh, you know, uh, uh, reasons not to teach it, uh, besides, besides, uh, well, I think the first time I taught this course, uh, the, uh, um, well, uh, was a few years after the Gulf War, the first Gulf War. Uh, and, uh, it seemed, uh, to me, uh, in, in my, uh, historical innocence that, uh, uh, the irony that, uh, Owen is playing upon here, uh, that he's putting forward to us, uh, was, was not one that I would need to talk about a in a classroom.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Uh, it seemed to me, uh, as though, uh, no one would ever quote Horace again as anything but a lie. Um, of course, that's not the case. Uh, you know, uh, as our present, uh, war has gone on. Uh, how many times have we heard people, uh, you know, in many different forms, uh, speaking, uh, of justification for the death of young men and women, uh, on behalf of the nation? Well, um, uh, you know, uh, as we watch our, our, um, as we watch our president's approval ratings for his conduct of the war drop, uh, one wonders, well, could any of us really be surprised by this? Uh, and we'll, uh, certainly Wilfred Owen would not have been. Uh, and it seemed to me as though, uh, in fact, uh, it was important to read well for doe and, and to, uh, go on thinking and talking about his poetry and not only own of course, but, uh, really the extraordinary, uh, rich body of British World War One poetry, uh, as a whole, uh, writing that is not by any means, uh, all about battle though.

Speaker 1:          10:44          Much of it is like that poem I just read, uh, today when I want to do is give you have some sense of this body of writing. Uh, and unlike a, the last few lectures where I've concentrated on a single poet and, and tried to make arguments about, uh, that poet and, and have, uh, you know, thesis. Uh, today what I want to do is really just show you different poems, uh, and different, uh, poets. Uh, you know, a range of, of, uh, uh, brilliant, uh, writing, um, in addition to an opportunity to think about poetry and war. Uh, it's also a good opportunity to start to fill out a little bit our sense of, of what modern poetry is or, uh, was, um, uh, what it is or was also what it did not become a world war one, uh, destroyed, uh, in English generation.

Speaker 1:          11:54          Um, you know, uh, modern poetry as we study it in this class. And, uh, you know, I think, uh, as, as you see it in this, this anthology is an international phenomenon. It's not, uh, um, well, uh, we don't have a lot of English poets on his syllabus. Um, there is a ts Eliot, uh, the only great English poet born in America. Uh, there is, uh, uh, wh Auden, uh, in English born poet who moved to America. Uh, most of the figures that we study are in fact Americans. Uh, there's, there's Yates to, uh, all of them are in a sense internationals. Uh, and there, there's a, uh, uh, you know, a range of, of important cultural reasons for this, but there's also the simple fact of, of the war. Uh, arguably, uh, the great modern English poets died, uh, in, in the teens in France in 1915 and 1917.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Uh, or, uh, they survived, uh, like Ivor Gurney who you have some samples from in a wounded, uh, and, and, uh, um, uh, injured, uh, state. Um, I also think it's important for us to think about the war, uh, as, as, um, uh, an important context, uh, when we go on to read pound and Elliot, uh, when we, uh, encounter, uh, in their poetry, a sense of a apocalyptic, uh, change, uh, of civilization in crisis, which can seem pretty vague sometimes. Uh, well, um, and this is true for the Yates poems that we've been talking about as well. A Yates is obviously writing, uh, in the context of an Irish civil war, but it's also the case that he's riding in the, uh, a shadow of the first world war as well. Uh, you know, uh, on July 1st, 1916, uh, more than a 57,000 English troops, uh, were, uh, wounded or dead, uh, uh, I think, uh, almost 20,000 on that day, um, died.

Speaker 1:          14:31          And, uh, in the, in the battle of the Somme, um, as it unfolded, uh, there were a million casualties. Uh, this, this is a, you know, a scale of, of, uh, uh, human suffering, uh, and, and, uh, uh, um, uh, kind of, um, well, uh, a scale of human suffering that is enormous and hard to comprehend and leaves its shadow across the writing that we will be reading. Uh, I, uh, all the parts we will be talking about today are men. Uh, not quite all soldiers, but most of them, uh, I've given you some quotes, um, uh, from Virginia Woolf, uh, partly to remind us that, uh, the war did not only exist for men, uh, or soldiers, uh, and that it existed in England, uh, as quite as, uh, much as it existed on the continent. Uh, well, uh, w with all of that, uh, said by preparation. Uh, let me show you some more poems. Um, beginning with Thomas Hardy on page 51,

Speaker 1:          16:00          hardy is, uh, this is, this is, uh, a little pamphlet, uh, of, uh, war pumps hardy published, uh, in, um, 1917. And that, that, um, uh, you can find in the binary, keep a hardy, arguably the greatest English poet, um, modern English poet, uh, is, is a figure we don't study in this course. Otherwise. Uh, he is a poet from another century. He's born, uh, in fact, 20 years before the American civil war, uh, when World War One began, uh, he was 74. Uh, he wrote a, his poems from the perspective of, uh, uh, the rural England. That was the setting for almost all of his novels, almost all of his poetry, uh, and channel firing on the bottom of 51, uh, is, um, uh, also set in the west of England, uh, Hardy's home country, uh, and, uh, is, is set right on the verge of the first World War. It's a poem about gunnery practice. Uh, yeah. Uh, it's a, it's a, a dramatic monologue spoken by one of the dead in a graveyard that night. Your great guns unawares shook all our coffins as we lay and broke the chancel window squares. We thought it was the judgment day and sat up. Right.

Speaker 1:          17:51          I heard it already has. It has. It has various gothic and supernatural fancies that he asks us to imagine and vivid homely terms. While dreary some arose, the howl of wakened towns, this is all is this wonderful observed detail of rural life. The mouse let fall the altar crumb, the worms drew back into the mountains. The Glebe cow drooled till God called. No, it's gunnery practice out at sea. Just as before you went below the world is as it used to be. This is not the second coming all knit kind of reply to Yates. Although Yates hasn't written this poem. Yup. All nation striving strong to make red war yet redder, mad as hatters they do no more for Christie Sake. Then you who are helpless in such matters that this is not the judgment hour for some of them is a blessing thing for if it were that have to scour health floor for so much threatening. Ha Ha was hard. He's God laughs like that. It will be frostbit have understood it. Uh, it will be warmer when I blow the trumpet. If indeed I ever do for you are men and rest eternal. Sorely need this. This is God so cruel that he will not deliver the Second Coming Day of Judgment.

Speaker 1:          19:31          So down we lay again. I wonder, will the world ever seen her be said one? Then when he sent us under in our indifferent century, in many, a skeleton shook his head. Instead of preaching 40 year, my neighbor Parson thirdly said, I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer again. The guns disturb the hour, roaring their readiness to event as far inland distort and tower and Camelot and starlet Stonehenge.

Speaker 2:          20:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:10          Gunnery practice, uh, disturbs the dead, uh, disrupts the ground. Uh, you know, here, here, war refuses to let the deadline piece, uh, with the notion that not even the dead are safe from it, unaffected by it. Uh, the church windows shatter well in some sense, this is exactly what modernity might be seen to be doing to traditional English culture. Uh, heart hardy is, is full of all this quaint, Gothic, uh, archaic, uh, Dixon's, uh, and, and fancies, uh, the dead or raising their objections here to two guns, uh, uh, that will be a used very shortly in the great war.

Speaker 1:          21:04          God reassures them though, of course, what he says here is, is not reassuring. Uh, he says that although red war is getting redder, it's really as it always has been. Uh, this is not the end of the world that it appears to be a, he's not about to let Manheim mankind off the hook with Judgment Day. Uh, the speaker narrate or lies back, uh, and wonders, uh, if the world will ever be saner. Uh, his neighbor, uh, says, well, I don't think so. I wish I had, uh, uh, you know, pleasured myself and, uh, uh, rather than, uh, serving that, uh, wicked God, uh, in the last stanza, then there is that extraordinary shift of perspective. Uh, the sound of the guns carries inland, uh, into the heart of England. Uh, and as it does, it carries back also in time to Camelot and to starlet Stonehenge.

Speaker 1:          22:25          Uh, what happens when that happens? What is the meaning of, of this, the power of this, of the sound of the guns to, to echo back in time, uh, as hardy evokes Camelot and stonehengey. You might, you might, uh, read this, understand this says, um, as, as what, as dignifying and legitimate dating the present, uh, uh, present firing the present conflict or in some sense does it go just the opposite? Does it, uh, does it suggest that England's history and its heritage and its honor, uh, are in jeopardy? Uh, uh, does it in some sense demythologize the past, demystify it, make us see Camelot and Stonehenge as part of a bear barbaric, uh, uh, history, um, uh, such as is about to unfold in 1914. Uh, there are a couple other, uh, hardy poems in your anthology, uh, memorable and powerful, uh, that are war poems, uh, including, uh, on page 59 in the time of the breaking of nations. And then on the next page, uh, I looked up from my writing, interesting to look at these together. Uh, in, in the first poem, a hardy affirms the endurance of rural life, and it's, it's cycles. Only a man harrowing. Claude's

Speaker 1:          24:30          in a slow, silent walk with an old horse that stumbles and nods half asleep as they stock.

Speaker 2:          24:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:41          Only thin smoke without flame from the heaps of couch grass, yet this will go on word the same though. Dynasties pass,

Speaker 2:          24:52          okay.

Speaker 1:          24:53          Beyond or a maid and her white come whispering by wars, analysts will fade in tonight, air their story, die. Uh, rural life including, uh, um, rituals of love and courtship, uh, here are represented as poetry's truest subject and as a kind of enduring, uh, uh, source of, of, um, uh, social life and meaning, uh, you could compare this poem to, uh, the poem place last and, and Yates is, uh, uh, last poems called politics. Uh, that might seem to say something similar, uh, in hardy here. And in other pumps, there's, uh, the serve wonderfully self, consciously archaic language. Uh, hardy wants to use really old, uh, dialect words when he can. Um, and, and there's, there's, there's, there's power in that. And this is a poem composed in 1915, uh, when we read the love song of J. Dot. Alfred Prufrock when we read pounds first Canto, uh, remember that those poems are written, published at just the same time.

Speaker 1:          26:11          This poem is being written, uh, palms with a very different, um, uh, ways of, of proceeding, uh, in different kinds of language. Uh, in the second poem here, I looked up from my riding, uh, the poet, the first person is being interrupted a at his desk, uh, at night. Uh, he's, he, uh, his startled, uh, to see the moon's full gaze on me. Uh, her meditative misty head was spectral and it's there and I, and voluntarily said, what are you doing there? And Hardy Hardy works in these, uh, song forms that, well, they sound like popular ballads. Uh, and, and he, he, he wants you to, uh, uh, you know, hear them as part of almost a kind of folk literature, which he draws on. Uh, the, uh, Moon says to him, Oh, I've been scanning pat pond and whole and waterway hear about for the body of one with a sunken soul who has put his life flight out. Did you hear his frenzy tattle? It was sorrow for his son who is slain and brutish battle, though he has injured none.

Speaker 3:          27:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:31          And now the moon says, I am curious to look into the blinkered mind poet of one who wants to write a book in a world of such a kind

Speaker 1:          27:44          her temper. The poet then says, overwrought me in I edge to sh to shun her view, to get out of the moonlight for I felt assured she thought me one who should drown him to, uh, here. Uh, a neighbor father, a crazed with grief at the death of his son, uh, has drowned himself, uh, uh, killed himself. Uh, and the moon, uh, implies, uh, in its gaze that the poet should do so too. Uh, in such a world, uh, it seems writing poems is, is a, a kind of, well, even surviving as a kind of guilty privilege. You could compare with this poem a Kipling's. Uh, uh, poem, a Kipling, one of the great apologists of empire, uh, saying on page one 53 of, of your, your book, uh, in the voice of a soldier, a if any question why we soldiers died, tell them our father's lied. Uh, a statement that is, uh, uh, poignant, uh, uh, pointing and powerful in part because Kipling's own son died in the war.

Speaker 1:          29:10          This is the volume of poems published in 1917 by Edward Thomas and a portrait of Thomas, another soldier, poet, uh, not represented. However, as a soldier here, uh, represented, uh, rather as a, uh, uh, English citizen in Tweed, a man out, in and of nature. Thomas born in 1878. So he was 36 when the war began. He began almost at the same time as the war began to write poems. Uh, he begins writing, uh, under the influence of his friend Robert Frost. Frost and Thomas have a fascinating relationship, uh, an important, uh, transatlantic exchange, uh, for us. Famous poem, the road less traveled by, uh, he, uh, sometimes described as being about Thomas and Thomas' own sense of regret and hesitation and indirection. Uh, to which frost contest it himself. Uh, frost became an England, uh, uh, a poet of New England whom Thomas was reading at that moment in such a way as to help enable him, Thomas to become a great poet of England, uh, and of England's, uh, uh, landscape and, and countryside, uh, and uh, nature. Uh, there are, um, there, there's a good selection from Thomas, uh, in your anthology. Uh, I will, uh, read my favorite poem by Thomas, uh, which is the first one called adol strop

Speaker 1:          31:23          on to 31.

Speaker 2:          31:25          Uh, yes,

Speaker 1:          31:38          I remember adults strop the name because one afternoon of heat, the express train drew up their unwantedly. It was late June, the steam hist someone cleared his throat, no one left and no one came on the bear platform. What I saw was adol strop only the name and willows, willow herb and grass and meadow sweet and hey Cox dry, no witless less still and lonely. Fair than the high cloudlets in the sky.

Speaker 1:          32:29          And for that minute, a blackbird saying close by in round him mistier farther and farther, all the birds of Oxford Shear in Gloucestershire year. It's a wonderful poem in its simplicity, modesty, directness and reticence, which yet provides the most expansive and exhilarating a since of the English landscape and of the power of a moment in time to uh, uh, enlarge and, and, uh, be uh, pregnant with meaning a notice, a notice Thomas's really superb nonchalance and offhandedness and simplicity. It was late June. The steam hist. I mean, there, there's a kind of a colloquial clarity and confidence, uh, quite different from the, uh, vernacular language in um, uh, the hardy palms. I was just reading, which are also poems of the countryside. A here, the name, the name that odd name, adults strop prompts a memory, prompts a memory in such a way that a moment in time stands out, separated from other moments just as the odd and poetic and beautiful name adults strop seems to stand out there. There's a kind of poignant pension between the beautifulness of the name, the awkwardness, and yet the dignity of the name, uh, and the sense of natural beauty that the poem will unfold here. The stopping of the train is like the, the interruption by memory of normal consciousness. That's the basis of the poem.

Speaker 1:          34:47          There's a sense that in this memory of the poet, somehow saw the name presumably, I suppose, saw it on a sign board, uh, in, in the, uh, station as you roll into a station and you see where you are. Uh, but there's, there's more suggestion in it than that. Uh, it says if this moment we're one in which the name and the place, the word and the thing, uh, fully coincided, uh, fully coincided in a experience of, of, uh, uh, uh, presence and, and immediacy where the world is all there. Uh, and, and named, located, placed, uh, the figure, the metaphor for this semiotic unity of, of word and thing, uh, is bird song. Uh, hear bird song a is a kind of natural language, a language in which nature speaks, uh, and speaks in such a way, uh, that the particular voice carries a, the import and, uh, authority of the general, uh, uh, just as, as the one bird seems to sing with many bird's songs by the end of the palm. And so adults strap itself suddenly seems to signify more a calling to mind in the kind of rippling and radiating circles. Uh, uh, Oxford Sheer Gloucester sheer, uh, England,

Speaker 2:          36:28          all of it, the poet's home.

Speaker 1:          36:32          Uh, at the same time, it's also clear that this epiphany is a remembered experience. It's recalled, uh, the poet's first word, yes, wonderful affirmation. Ah, situates the poem in a dialogue as if someone had just said, have you ever been to adults strap, uh, whether this dialogue is, is, you know, actual or in internal, it doesn't really matter. Uh, the pump part of the poems forced derives from, uh, uh, the, uh, status of this moment is something remembered, uh, and remembered, um, uh, within the context of a nation at war. Although I believe, uh, Thomas wrote the palm, uh, the year he enlisted. But I think before his enlistment, uh, you might feel as though Thomas is already on the train, uh, for France. Uh, there, there's a way in which the context of the war to shadows the poem, uh, and, and remains present in it. Um, uh, don't you feel it? Uh, in certain, uh, details, uh, the Erie lack of people in this place, no one left and no one came. Uh, in a sense, uh, it is an image of the English countryside at a moment in which it is being emptied out. Uh, uh, it's young men sent to France to die a kind of no man's land already.

Speaker 1:          38:21          This is Siegfried soon in uniform, uh, in 1916, uh, Sas soons poetry, uh, centers on a hallucinatory overlays of homefront and battlefront. Let's look at blighters on, on page three 89,

Speaker 2:          38:49          uh,

Speaker 1:          38:51          a wonderfully angry poem.

Speaker 2:          38:57          Uh,

Speaker 1:          38:58          a poem that is situated in a music hall, I guess, presumably a London Music Hall. The House has crammed tier beyond tier. They grin and cackle at the show while prancing ranks of harlots, shrill, the chorus drunk with dyn. We're sure the Kaiser loves the dear old tanks. I'd like to see a tank come down the stalls lurching to ragtime tunes or home sweet home. And there'd be no more jokes in musicals to mock the riddle. Corpses Round Bowl Palm.

Speaker 2:          39:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:46          Here, there's an analogy between the music hall and the theater of war. Uh, it's as if the English populous were spectators only consuming as entertainment war propaganda, which makes the poet hate them.

Speaker 1:          40:09          He imagines here the eruption of the real, uh, into this representational space, uh, and, and imagines it as a kind of attack on the, uh, uh, working in middleclass audiences of the, of the music hall. Uh, the, the, uh, the soldier becomes a in fantasy here, uh, the spectator as the war turns around and comes back, uh, uh, reversed by kind of evil charm or spell, uh, coming home and home is here made to rhyme with [inaudible], uh, bringing battlefront and homefront together as a rhyme. Uh, there, there's an aggression towards the urban crowd here that recalls and exaggerates a Yates his attitude at the same time, uh, really in the same, uh, years, uh, in poems like a coat or the fishermen in other Sasoon poems, the, the war comes home. And in other ways, uh, for example, uh, well, uh, in the rear guard, uh, just just down the page here, uh, or repression of war experience, which is about a traumatic repetition of, uh, uh, battle, uh, or in dreamers, uh, where, um, there is, um, uh, again, a kind of juxtaposing of a life in the trenches in life in the city,

Speaker 1:          41:56          uh, rather than dwell longer on them though. And to make sure I get time for a couple more poems, I want to move on and, uh, consider this is a festoons poem, poems, um, counter attack. And this is the poetry of Isaac Rosenberg. Uh, here's a frontest piece with, with Rosenberg in a, a, um, a military coat. A Rosenberg was all besides a poet, was also an artist, uh, and, uh, uh, created these self portraits, self portrait in France in 1915. Uh, Rosenberg in contrast to Sasoon was poor. Uh, Jewish, uh, and rights are rather different kind of poem from those we have been looking at today. Uh, one of the most famous, uh, and extraordinary is Laos hunting on page five oh six, a little bit further on in your book.

Speaker 3:          43:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:24          Nudes stark and glistening, yelling and Lurid [inaudible] grinning faces and raging limbs were all over the floor. One fire for a shirt. Verminous Lee, busy yon soldier tour from his throat with oath. God had might shrink app but not the lice. And soon the shirt was a flare over the candle. He'd lit while we lay. Then we all sprang up and stripped to hunt. The verminous brewed here. The, the soldiers are, uh, stripping their clothes off and, and, and attacking the lice that are attacking them soon like a demon's pantomime. The place was raging. It's nighttime and, and, and the candles and flares, they're throwing shadows. See the silhouettes of gate. See the Jib bring shadows mixed with the battled arms on the wall. See Gargantuan hooked fingers. Pluck in supreme flesh to smuch supreme littleness. See the Mary limbs and hot Highland fling because some wizard vermin charmed from the quiet.

Speaker 1:          44:43          This rebel when our ears, we're half load by the dark music blown from sleeps trumpet, a strange place for this poem to end. Uh, nudes, the poem begins. Uh, it's a, uh, uh, shocking, uh, and, and, and comic and pleasurable to see the armored men. Uniformed men suddenly exposed just naked bodies to see them, uh, here. Bedeviled not by a gas attack or machine guns, but lice, fleas, uh, Rosenberg is writing, not in those little crafted stands as of um, hardy or of, um, for that matter of Thomas, uh, he's riding in a kind of strongly stressed, a free verse with a variable line lengths. Uh, lots of, uh, well the, the, there's a sense in which the poetry itself is exuberant and naked and full of life and, uh, by uh, vital, uh, and naturalistic, you could say in its representation. Uh, Rosenberg is giving us an anecdote from the trenches and yet it's slips very quickly into a sense of fable.

Speaker 1:          46:21          Uh, uh, the, the louse hunting where these big men hunt these little things, these fleas, uh, it becomes, uh, when it's thrown by shadow as it kind of flickering image on the tent or trench wall, uh, uh, when it becomes represented, so to speak. Uh, it, it becomes a battle scene where gigantic forces smuch supreme littleness. We are put in mind of how men are to the gods as flies to men. Uh, this is an analogy as old as and found in homer [inaudible]. Uh, we are also put in mind of how the wars, in fact, anything but a revel, a though it too may have been provoked by a cause as insignificant and hard to trace as some wizard vermin. Uh, those last lines then are so ominous and strange. Uh, though these men have been brought to life, uh, from sleep, uh, there's a sense that the trumpet will sound for them again.

Speaker 1:          47:33          Uh, and they will enter a dark sleep from which they won't wake a, which is just the, the point of, uh, the next poem, uh, returning. We hear the Larks, I won't take time to read it though. Uh, or, or talk about it. Uh, but instead, uh, I'd like to conclude this is, uh, another, uh, great poet of the war who survived though, um, uh, in, as I say, uh, uh, uh, wounded, uh, uh, condition mentally Ivor Gurney. Uh, I want to conclude with a, uh, a poem by Owen. Um, there's, uh, let's see. This is, this is page five, 28, uh, just following Dulcie at decorum asked, uh, strange meeting. Uh, this is a poem that, um, well, uh, if the first poem demystifies, um, uh, one crucial threat of war ideology, uh, that it is right and good to die for the country. Uh, this poem takes on, uh, another, uh, crucial element of war ideology that, uh, the enemy is another, the enemy is unlike me.

Speaker 1:          49:06          Uh, like Rosenberg, uh, like a Rosenberg's poem. Uh, this one comes out of and, and, and returns eventually to, to sleep. Uh, it is, uh, a kind of dream vision, uh, Don Teske in its, uh, uh, mode, uh, and, and, and full of 'em here. Um, powerful. Uh, I am Beck pentameter. It seemed that out of battle, I escaped down some profound dult tunnel. Long sense, scooped through granites, which titanic wars had groined yet also, they're encumbered sleepers, groaned too fast and thought or death to be bustard. Then as I probed them, one sprang up and stared with piteous recognition in fixed eyes, lifting distressful hands as if to bless and by his smile I knew that selling hall by his dead smile, I knew we stood in hell with a thousand pains. That vision's face was grained, hit. No blood reached there from the upper ground and no guns thumped or down. The flues made Moan, strange friend. I said, here is no cause to mourn.

Speaker 1:          50:46          None said the other. Save the undone years, the hopelessness, whatever hope is, yours was my life. Also, I went hunting wild after the wildest beauty in the world, which lies not calm and i's or braided hair, but mocks the steady running of the hour and if it grieves grieves rich lear than here for by my glee might. Many men have laughed and of my weeping something had been left, which must die now. I mean the truth. Untold, the pity of war, the pity war distilled. Now men will go content with what we spoiled or discontent, boil bloody and be spilled. They will be swift with swiftness of the Tigris. None. We'll break ranks though nations trek from progress. Courage was mine and I had mystery. Wisdom was mine, and I have mastery to miss the march of this retreating world into veins citadels that are not walled. Then when much blood had clogged their chariot wheels, I would go up and wash them from sweet wells, even with trues that lie too deep for taint. I would have poured my spirit without stint, but not through wounds, not on the assess of war. Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were I and the enemy. You killed my friend. I knew you in the star for so you frowned yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed I parried but my hands were loathed and cold. Let us sleep now.

Speaker 1:          52:50          We'll stop now and move on to poems written during the same period and associated with images them on Monday.
