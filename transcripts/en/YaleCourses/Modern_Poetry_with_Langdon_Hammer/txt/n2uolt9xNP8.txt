Speaker 1:          00:02          I have a in the chairman's office down the hall to photographs, uh, one is, uh, of the English department in 1924 and there are, um, uh, the number of distinguished gentlemen casually posed in it. Uh, you, you distinguished scholars, uh, but all gentlemen, uh, and combine and take a look at it sometime. I also have a photograph from 1967 in which there are more distinguished gentleman, uh, less casually posed. In fact, a raid, uh, in a, um, uh, you know, sort of Phalynx, uh, and, uh, seated in the middle of these men is one woman, uh, marine bore off. Uh, Marie, uh, is our guest lecturer today and I'm delighted to have her here. She has been a member of this English department and a distinguished member of this English department for a long time. Um, she is a medievalist, uh, a scholar of modern poetry, a translator of Middle English poetry poet herself.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Uh, and she views, um, poetry or you, you Marie, I think of, uh, as as, uh, holding a sense of poetry as a long tradition that reaches back to the origins of our language. Uh, and is, uh, alive with us today. Uh, and that I'm writing about it, writing it, translating it are your activities, uh, and uh, also, uh, teaching it, uh, and, and Ray is one of our best and, and, uh, most revered teachers in the history of this department. So it's a really wonderful a honor for me to get to, uh, give the stage and the microphone, uh, to Marie Bora. Would you please welcome here?

Speaker 2:          02:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:10          thank you Lani. I'm getting over a virus so I hope my voice won't be too scratchy. I have some water to help. I think of it as it's really all the same thing. You know, Beowulf going Chaucer, Milton Wallace, Stevens, it's all the same thing. Nope. Innocence. I want to begin this morning with a little poem that you may never have heard of or read by Wallace Stevens called [inaudible], g, U, B, B, I n a, l. And if you have the poems of Steven's here, you can look at it. If you want though, doesn't matter. I'm going to tell you it, that strange flower. The Sun is just what you say. Have it your way. The world is ugly and the people are sad.

Speaker 3:          03:09          That tuft of jungle feathers, that animal I is just what you say, that savage of fire, that seed have it your way. The world is ugly and the people are sad. In this poem, the voice of the imagination and Stevens, his concept of the imagination with the Capitol lie speaks and it addresses a you that views the world without imagination. That is you. The you have the poem, you take the Sun for granted. You aren't excited by seeing it, by the thought of it, by the fact that it has arisen on this particular day and you hope it's going to rise again tomorrow. You don't feel as Stevens puts it in another poem. The Sun comes up like news from Africa and that's how one with the imagination at work fields about the sun imagination as Stevens conceives of it is the incessant stream of language emanating from the human consciousness.

Speaker 3:          04:26          As we live expressing both the state of the world at a given time and its own state, both of which states are constantly changing. Our interstate changes. Our inner weather changes as the outer weather of the world changes and as the seasons change. The work of the imagination as represented in Goulburn though is the generation of metaphors. The Sun is a strange flower, a Tuft of jungle feathers, an animal I a savage of fire and to seed at. One thing that's important about this to notice is the rapidity with which one metaphor it gives way to another metaphor. You don't stick with one, you don't have a definitive one that has it. You go on and if the poem were longer, there'd be more metaphors. Still the mind is in motion as the world also is in motion. Implicit in this poem also is Stevens's particular concept of happiness without the imagination.

Speaker 3:          05:41          The poem says the world is ugly and the people are sad and we can turn this statement on its head and say with equal validity from Stevens, his point of view with the imagination, when the vital imagination isn't residence at at work, the world is splendid, exciting and the people are happy. Note that happiness has nothing to do with personal fortune with the fact that you've been accepted by Harvard medical school or you perform brilliantly on the basketball court or the football field or got the date you're hoping to get. Happiness is internal independent self starting, but also shared communal human. The work of the imagination for Stevens is the same as the writing of poetry, the generation of poetry on a small scale as in governor [inaudible] and many other such or on a large mythical scale as in the Aurora's of autumn, a lot of Stevens, his early poems are called by him. Anecdotes. Now, an anecdote, if you go back to the etymology of the word is something unpublished. It's like a draft and what Steven's would do, he lived in Hartford, is you probably know, he worked in a big insurance company. It was very successful and he would walk every morning. It was a great walker from his home in West Hartford to his office in downtown Hartford.

Speaker 3:          07:25          As he walked, he would write poems, poems would come to him. He splints said, I never like anything that doesn't fly in at May, through the window, he'd get to the office, he'd call his secretary and he dictate the poems he had thought of on the way to the office on separate sheets. She would give him the poems, he'd put them in a desk drawer, and then about a month he'd go through what was in the drawer and throw some of them away and keep some, and the ones he kept would go into whatever book it was that he was writing. Oh, to have his wastebaskets is what I say.

Speaker 3:          08:07          I dare to think that Stevens would have liked or at least approved of the idea of the first stanza of a poem I wrote many years ago when I was getting up early enough in March to see the sun rise. Black Rim pale dawn. Now as to rolling drums, son, you're a great signal comes to bid me on, but Stevens said at less pretentiously and better, he wrote the Sun. That brave man comes through bows that lie in. Wait, that brave man. I'm skipping a little fears of my bed. Fears of life and fears of death runaway, that brave men comes up from below and walks without meditation. That brave man. And if you can think of the song as a brave man, you're well into Stevens, I think. I'm sure Steven would have liked a story that I'm about to tell you. When I was teaching Stephens years ago in among other poets in my course in 20th century poetry, I was walking on campus one day and I ran into one of my students and we were just reading Steven's then, and I said to him, well, how are you? How goes it? How are things? He said, oh, I'm fine. Uh, he said, all my friends are depressed. But when I hear how depressed they are, I look at them and I think, have it your way. The world is ugly and the people are sad.

Speaker 3:          09:52          And Stevens would have liked that because Stevens said that strangely that poetry should make us happy. It should help to make us happy. He also said, and this is rather hard to swallow, perhaps for someone who's been struggling with the Aurora's of autumn or notes toward a supreme fiction or any of the other big ones, people should enjoy poetry the way a child enjoys snow, and that is true. Well, in reading, Steven's especially reading the little poems, I always say you shouldn't worry about a poem you should read on and find one that tickles you, that that you like and make a mark there and returned to that poem later and read it again. Though it's also important I know to study Stephen's to study, especially the large poems, the big creations, the Aurora's of autumn exists in a sequence of seasonal poems, large scale seasonal poems.

Speaker 3:          10:57          That Stevens road, the earliest one and seasonal terms is notes toward a supreme fiction and that is a poem of the Spring and if you read it, you'll see a lot of things that are associated with Spring and Connecticut. You'll see the, forget me not in bloom though. He calls it the Myo Sodas. Not to be sentimental about it. You'll hear about Forsythia, you'll hear about yellow and the blue sky, uh, and it, it's a spring poem, then comes credences of summer and then comes the Aurora's of autumn. Now these poems go chronologically, seasonally, but they also go chronologically in Stevens, his own life. He has older as he writes, eats one of them. And when he wrote the Aurora's of autumn, he was in his seventies and this is the first of the poems in which the idea of death comes in dauntingly the idea of human death. Because one thing that autumn is, is the season that procedures winter, winter death, the death of the landscape in New England and ultimately the death of the individual human being. And that threat comes into the poem and is faced in the poem.

Speaker 3:          12:20          Now I want to go back to the beginning of the poem. So if you have a copy of it, you could look at the beginning and go very quickly through a sigh sections one through seven maybe. And I'm, cause I'm going to end by talking about sections nine and 10 and then something about section eight in the poem, we see the imagination. It's work as the creator of myth. This is always been true of human culture. There have always been great myths of the world, the myth that the world rests on a turtle or the myth of creation, how the world was created or how the animals first came and Steven's toys with mythical creation. In the poem in particular, in section one, he writes three different myths, which one of which succeeds to the other in trustee Benzion fashion. Because, uh, an essence of the world as Steven stinks about it is change.

Speaker 3:          13:38          As I intimated earlier. Uh, it's hard to imagine Stevens living anywhere, but in a temperate climate where there are seasons, it's hard to think of him as living in the tropics or and at Artica because he's a man of the seasons amount man of the weather. He writes a lot about the weather. One of his poems begins, lights out, shades up, a look at the weather. Let's see what the weather is tonight. On this particular night in the first section of the Aurora's of autumn, there are three different myths, one of which succeeds to another with equal validity. They are three myths about serpents. First we have but cosmic serpent, the bottle is his head, his air. I'm reading from the beginning of the section beneath his tip at night, eyes open and six on us in every sky. Clearly there he is talking about the dawning of stars at night. Eyes Open and fix on us in every sky. So this is a huge cosmic serpent that he is imagining. He's imagining the heavens as presided over by a great serpent, which may well have something to do with the Constellation named Drake Code. DRSC Oh, which is dragon or or snake.

Speaker 3:          15:03          Then we throw that one away and Steven says, or is this another? And or in Steven's always has to be answered or responded to by saying, yes, this is another one. Let's have another one. We've just had one. Let's throw that one out and have another one. The stale, uh, has to always to be thrown out. So now we get a terrestrial serpent on a huge scale. This is where the serpent lives. You could underline that at the beginning. The poem, this is where the serpent lives. Well that's in line one. Uh, now we're in line seven. This is where the serpent lives. This is his nest. These fields, these hills, these tinted distances and the pines above that along and beside the sea. So here we have a serpent that is a trick, terrestrial myth, a myth of the whole encompassing the whole landscape.

Speaker 3:          16:04          And finally at the, almost at the end, his meditations in the Ferns, can you find that? It's the next to last tercet of that section. His as clearly the serpents. Meditation's his meditations in the ferns when he moved so slightly to make sure of sun made us no less as sure. And here is a third serpent and this is a local serpent, a particular serpent, a serpent, visualized in sensory terms. We saw in his head, black beaded on the rock, the flecked animal, the morning, the moving grass, the Indian in his glade, the Indian in his glade, the Indians glade. That is the native of the soil. In this section we find one of the great opposites and Steven's a great oppositions between pairs, a imagination and reality is of course one or imagination with the capitol lie versus imagination with a lower case I and imagination that sort of produces little fancies.

Speaker 3:          17:21          But here we have a strange opposition which is rather idiosyncratic with Steven's between abstraction, not and not between the abstract and the concrete, but between the abstract and the particular, the local. At with that very often characteristically and Stevens, there comes a flash of the sensory, a detail of color. Black beaded, the black beaded head of the snake, a particular glade in New England where native Americans once lived the Indian in his glade. The recognition of that. So this opening section of the poem demonstrates the imagination at work as a generator of myths and one myth succeeds to another myth one there was the cosmic serpent, the terrestrial serpent and the local serpent, the particular serpent, the serpent that we see right there on a particular day. Now something happens that's characteristically Steven's Ian and occurs at the beginning of section two. And this is something that not everyone agrees on, but this is how I interpreted and what I'm giving you is my interpretation of the poem which you have to take for better or for worse. For the moment, farewell to an idea. I take this to be the discarding of an achieved idea and the moving onto something else. So what Steven's is saying farewell to is the whole serpent mythology, a cosmic tr, terrestrial and old.

Speaker 3:          19:13          And from that we turned to something different. We turned to seasonal change, the change from summer to autumn. And another important Steve Benzion opposition comes into play in this section. And that is the opposition between whiteness and color or as Stevens often calls it candor. Candor, as you may know, is whiteness. Uh, and if we were true to our Latin etymologies, all candidates would wear white robes. Of course I, it's a little hard to imagine some of the men of white robe at any rate, candor is abstract quite. He also uses the word blank in this section. The man who was walking turns blankly on the sand in notes toward a supreme fiction. The poem begins with Whiteness and moves from whiteness from that ever early candour too. It's late plural from the abstract to the particular, the multifarious plural here summer, which is stale. It's over. It has happened.

Speaker 3:          20:34          So now it's time to throw it out and move on to something else. Namely autumn. And the whiteness is visualized as a landscape. A cabin stands deserted on a beach and as the sort of summer cabin that we all, most of us probably know, a white beach at a white cabin, uh, probably, uh, white fence and maybe a white, uh, enclosure for a shower that you can take after you've swum. It's summer. The flowers against the wall or white reminding of a white that was different, something else last year or before. And now the wind is beginning to blow. Summer's over. The wind is blowing the sand across the floor here. Being visible is being white is being of the solid of white. The accomplishment of an extremist in an exercise, the season changes. A cold wind, chills the beach, the long lines of it grow longer.

Speaker 3:          21:38          Emptier a darkness gathers though it does not fall and the whiteness grows less vivid on the wall again and again in the Aurora's of autumn we have some sort of reassuring or splendid or restful vision and then come some sort of threat, a cold wind. Uh, in one of the sections the wind knocks like a rifle butt against the door. Uh, and this poem was written during the decade of World War II. So violence, death, the coming of winter are linked implicitly in the poem with the idea of war, the death of war. And then we go to a single man who was always the vehicle of the imagination. In the end, the imagination has to reside in the consciousness of the individual, of each one of us. Although from it we can project a great cosmic imagination and unmoved mover or a generator of, of images as Stevens does later in the poem.

Speaker 3:          22:43          So here we have our hero, the individual man, the man imagining the man who was walking turns blankly on the sand. He observes how the north is always enlarging the change with it's frigid brilliances. It's blue, red sweeps and gusts of great and killings. It's polar green, the color of fire and ice and solitude. So here what happens is very much like what happens to white light when it's put through a prism and broken up into the colors of the rainbow. This is what happens in the beginning of notes toward a supreme fiction, and it's what happens here. The whiteness of summer breaks up into the prismatic colors of the Aurora's of autumn. Now, you probably have never seen them. I've never seen the rowers of autumn, but I happened to know a man who was in ag, Gail living on the old campus in the early 1940s and he told me that he remembered coming out of where he lived at night onto the old campus and looking up and seeing the Aurora borealis in color. It could happen then. I've seen it in Maine in the summer sky, but as I've seen it, it's been quite and dark. And what you see are white pulsations in the sky. They're very beautiful. They're very wonderful, but it's been many, many years since I saw any colors in the auroras. Nonetheless, this is what he's writing about the Aurora borealis in its colors.

Speaker 3:          24:31          Section three here again, farewell to an idea, a way with the cabin way with the man walking on the sand. Now we moved to something else and what we moved to in the next few sections are myths. Large scale myths. First, the myth of the mother, the earth mother, let's say the sky mother, the mother as nurturing, as warm as tender, the mother who could perhaps be symbolized by summer, by a Balmy beneficence, summer day by the warmth of the sun on a summer day. Then we get the father, the myth of the father, and this is the kind of, well, let's say the Joe flight or Zeus like being the, the uh, uh, man who is in, who presides over the heavens. But first we have the mother.

Speaker 3:          25:32          The mother gives transparency to their present piece. She makes that gentler, that congenital beat. But here again, as in over and over. As I said earlier in this poem, the concept of something warm, gentle, reassuring, gives away to some sort of threat, the coming of cold, the wind darkness, and finally the wind like a rifle. But at the end of the poem, boreal night, I'm toward the end of section three here will look like frost as it approaches them and to the mother as she falls asleep and as they say, good night, good night upstairs, the windows will be lighted, not the rooms. What does that mean? That means that they've turned off the lights and going to bed. Nonetheless, there are lights appearing in the windows and what can they be? But the lights of the Aurora borealis that shine in the windows of the house, even though the light doesn't come from within the house, it comes from the heavens.

Speaker 3:          26:41          A wind will spread windy grandeur's round and knock like a rifle butt against the door. The wind will command them with invincible sound. So this is the temporary reassuring togetherness. I hate that word, but I can't avoid it. Really in in this section, this is where we were all together with the mother and all was well and it was summer, but this can't last. It never lasts. Something more, something less welcome takes his place section for farewell to an idea. Leave the mother behind, leave. We've had her now we moved to the father. The father's sits in space. Wherever he sits of bleak regard, he is not a warm nurturing kind of presence. His regard, his gaze is bleak and then we have this curious image as one that is strong in the bushes of his eyes. I think that alludes to the word ambush. Uh, he has a power that is held in check as when someone is an ambush. The strength is there and is not yet let out.

Speaker 2:          27:55          Okay?

Speaker 3:          27:56          He says, no to know. That's an affirmation. He says yes to yes. That's an affirmation. He says yes to know that as an affirmation he always affirms, he never denies and he affirms something new and then something new and then something new as signified by in saying yes, he says farewell. That is when you accept and affirm the new idea, the new imaginative construction. You have said farewell to the one that preceded it as he is done earlier in the poem, farewell to the idea of the cabin for well to the idea of the mother, he leaps from Heaven to heaven more rapidly than bad angels leap from Heaven to Hell in flames. This is clearly an illusion to the Christian myth. And I'm going to bring up the Christian myth later toward the end of what I'm saying about, about the poem you perhaps have read. If you are English majors, you may have read paradise lost. So you've read about how the bad angels leap from Heaven to Hell. They're driven out by the powers of God and his son. Um, so the father leaps, that is his imagination, the cosmic imagination, the large scale imagination that he personifies is hugely vital and capable of leaping from one concept to another from one heaven to another one myth to another.

Speaker 3:          29:37          No, I meant to say a little earlier and I will say that I think though I couldn't substantiate it from this place alone, that toward the end of section three, the mother, she falls asleep. And as they say, good night, good night. I consider that one of a number of illusions in the poem to the play Hamlet. There are a lot of, uh, uh, there's a lot of theater. Theater is one of the motifs of the poem and I haven't time to go into that in detail, but you see it again and again. And one of the things that happens in the poem is that a company of actors comes as happens in hamlet and hamlet welcomes them. And good night, good night, good night. Sweet ladies. Good night's sweet ladies. Good night, good night. I think it alludes to that, uh, Elliot quotes that I think it's in the wasteland that he, that he does it.

Speaker 3:          30:37          So the mask, the masks, the actors come and company. Now I'm at section four toward the end of that section, the actors approach and company in their masks. These are not human actors. This is a super human drama that is being played, uh, and the father is inviting them. And then there's a very eloquent in vocation of the father as the master, the master of the Maze, master Oh master seated by the fire and yet in space and motionless and yet of motion the ever brightening origin profound and yet the king. And yet the crown. Look at this present throne. What company in masks can choir it with the naked wind. How can we celebrate? How can there be a cell, a theatrical celebration of the world when the wind is blowing and autumn is coming and darkness is coming, uh, to call the master the ever the origin of motion motionless.

Speaker 3:          31:48          And yet the origin of motion is to go back to concepts of God. The divine as the unmoved mover applied to the Christian God and sometimes to other divinities. So once again, we have an illusion to religion, which is nonetheless not part of a religious presentation. In section five, the mother and the father give a party. I don't happen to like this section very much. I don't think Steven's really succeeds in jazzing it up. Uh, the way he tries to, the children laugh. The, I don't like the, the Negro buses who dance like curious ripeness is of pattern and make insidious tones clawing the sing song of their instruments. The children laugh and jangle attend any time while he's trying very hard to jazz it up. But for me it doesn't quite work. Nonetheless. This is what it is. This is the party that the world stages for us, that as we look out, the party of spring are the party of the colors of autumn leaves.

Speaker 3:          33:00          And it's kind of symbolic representation of that. The musicians strike the instinctive poem. And so on this then is shatty Yom. Do you find that that's three stances, three tercets from the end of that section? Uh, I believe that [inaudible] is used here, sorry as the name of a great chateau in France, there is such a chateau. So it is uh, a palace, a castle where there could be a splendid party with dancers and with, with music. This then is shatter your as you please. We stand in the tumult of the festival. The world is a kind of tumultuous festival at times that goes on around us. Let's say on an autumn day when the trees are very bright and color and the wind is blowing and the sky is blue and the leaves are drifting from the trees as the two mode of a festival. But all of a sudden what festival?

Speaker 3:          34:02          This loud disordered Mooch, these brute like guests, these musicians dubbing at a tragedy, a dub dub, which is made up of this, that there are no lines to speak. There is no play or the person's act one merely by being here. So once again we have affirmation and then comes threat than comes denial. There really is no play. There is no theater. It's only something that we imagined. But then immediately as if to prove its validity and its vitality. The great imagination speaks in section six and others at the beginning of that section. One of the most eloquent tributes to the beauty of the cosmos that I know in poetry in which an amazing telescoping of time takes place. What do they call it? Fast forward photography perhaps you've seen one where the flower grows up and is seen blooming and here we see geology in fast forward we see mountains rising and falling like water, like waves. It is a theater floating through the clouds itself. A cloud, although of Mr did rock and mountains running like water wave on wave through waves of light.

Speaker 3:          35:34          It is a cloud to transform to cloud transformed again idly the way a season changes color to no end except the lavishing of itself than change as light changes yellow into gold and gold to it's opal elements and fires. Delight splashed wide wise because it likes magnificence and the solemn pleasures of magnificent space and then human history is seen fast forwarding, as the section goes on a up capital, it may be as emerging or has just collapsed. Civilization has come to as a mountain has come and has collapsed the day new mall has to be postponed, but now, once again, the all importance of the hero, the human hero, that is the imagining mind is affirmed. This is nothing until in a single man contained nothing until this named thing nameless is and is destroyed. He opens the door of his house on flames. That's the Aurora. In other words, the Aurora Borealis, the scholar of one candle sees an Arctic effulgence flaring on the frame of everything he is and he feels afraid.

Speaker 3:          36:56          In section seven Stephen's visualizes as a, let's say a mythical hypothesis. Suppose that there is a cosmic imagination that imagines the whole show and imagination that imagines the passing of the seasons that imagines the earth, the solar system, the whole cosmos. Suppose that maybe there is. Let's imagine that there is. So the answer to the questions are always yes. Is there an imagination that sits enthroned as grim as it has been? Evolent, the just and the unjust, which in the midst of summer stops to imagine winter. Yes, there is. Why not when the leaves are dead, does it take its place in the north and unfold itself? Goat leaper crystal than luminous sitting in highest night here. And I have no time to go into this aspect of the poem. Uh, it's, which is another one like the theater, uh, and then the hamlet illusions that I think are there. This is part of the astronomical motifs in the poem and there's a great deal about the stars. I mentioned Draco and the First Section is possibly, uh, underlying the celestial serpents. A great big constellation that is across the sky for us, for us in New England. And here the goat leaper is the constellation Capricorn. A Capricorn means goat horn as, as you know, and you may also know that Capricorn begins in the Zodiac on the 22nd of December,

Speaker 3:          38:40          which choose to say immediately after the winter solstice. So the Constellation Capricorn take soap, comes in, uh, at what Steven's at the end of the poem calls in winters, Nick in the nick of winter, just as the solstice comes and the Constellation Capricorn becomes the dominant constellation of the Zodiac.

Speaker 2:          39:05          Okay.

Speaker 3:          39:09          But now we can't stay solemn. We have the mood has to change. And so we get at the end of this section a change from destiny to slight cap priests with I think an allusion to the word Capricorn. And you may know that the Capri element has to do with leaping. Uh, so the, uh, leaping from heaven to Hell is associated with that. It was changed from destiny, dislike caprice, and thus it's jetted tragedy. It's steel and shape and mournful making moved, defined what must unmake it and what last, what can say a flippant communication under the move. So all this is thrown away and what we have so flippant, something flippant, but that is the way Stevens, his, uh, imagination works, especially on a large scale there. Ares of autumn is not architectonic Lee structured, uh, as say something like the odes of Keats and Shelley are like at an alias or the Ode on Melancholy or the Ode on a Grecian Urn.

Speaker 3:          40:23          That is to say it does not move by logical stages to a climax at the end. That incorporates in is founded on what has gone before. Rather it is structured. If structure is the word, as I've been telling you, you go from one thing to another, you go from one thing to its opposite, you go from something solemn to something flipping, you go from summer to autumn, you go from day to night, from the warmth of the mother to the threat of death and darkness. Nonetheless, it does move. The poem does move toward what I would call a culmination, not an architect tonic or structural climax, but a kind of emotional climax. And this happens in the next to last section, section nine a and is predicated on the assertion of innocence at the beginning of section eight. And I should say in case I don't have time to do justice to it at the end, uh, that in section 10, the whole thing falls apart. We discard the whole thing. Uh, and it all becomes fragmentary and the musical creations become trivial. Uh, and we got an ending that is completely unsatisfactory to those of us who love resonant rhetorical endings. It's just not like that. And we can't look in Stevens for that kind of ending. The term innocence is another term like imagination that has to be thought of in it's Steve Benzion sense.

Speaker 2:          42:03          Cool.

Speaker 3:          42:07          The opposite of innocence or Stevens is either guilt or malice. Uh, now you probably know, you may, you may know that the origin of the word innocence, the root Latin root of the word innocence is a Latin verb meaning to harm. No, Kara. So in no sense literally is on harming nus.

Speaker 2:          42:34          The

Speaker 3:          42:36          of affirmation of innocence that comes to the speaker in section eight arises in a sense from all that is gone before. That is from the myth making of the early sections. Because as we think back on them, it's obvious that Stevens is overarching myths, is great. Cosmic myths, the mother, the father, the celestial imagination that imagines the whole world and the passage of the Zodiac. Uh, none of that has anything to do with revealed religion or particularly with the Christianity that we, most of us know so much about. As we think back, it's obvious that there's nothing in them about a benevolent God, a God who watches over us, a god who comforts us and who will reward us if we were virtuous. There's nothing about that. The imagination with the capitalized, the cosmic imagination is as grim as it is benevolent.

Speaker 3:          43:41          The world is as grim as it is benevolent. We have the benevolence of summer, but always after it, the darkening of autumn and the grimness and cold of winter and humanly we have the change from youth to the midst of life, to finally the coming of death and that possibility that inevitability is faced at the end of the poem. So what is innocent here is the world. The world is innocent. It means us no harm. It is not malicious. It's if there's No God who benevolently watches over us. There's also no god who judges us well who can signs us to damnation. So we can live in the world in the state of innocence without what Steven's eloquently calls. And I hope you'll check it out again after this. The enigma of the guilty dream. Christianity, we don't understand it. It's a riddle. It's the guilty dream, but it's a dream. Uh, like all of the dreams the world operates in personally, it means us no harm.

Speaker 3:          45:05          Now I'm going to read toward the end of section eight. So then these lights, these lights are the Aurora Borealis, which he's referred to by the phrase these lights several times in the poem. These lights are not a spell of light, a saying out of a cloud, but innocence and innocence of the earth and no fault sign or symbol of malice that we partake thereof lie down like children in this holiness as if awake we lay in the quiet of sleep. I haven't time to go on. But in section nine, Stephen's picks up on this and says we were as Danes and Denmark all day long, hail hearted, Lansman we were brothers. And here we have the play hamlet again. Uh, as you remember in hamlet, there's something rotten in the state of Denmark and here the world is Denmark and there's something wholesome in the state of Denmark.

Speaker 3:          46:07          And what does wholesome is us and the world and the beauty of the world, even though that beauty eventually, uh, gives way to darkness and cold shall we be found hanging in the trees next spring. This is toward the end of section nine. And people interpret this differently and I think the word hanging is misleading, but I read it as meaning are we going to come back in the spring as the leaves come back in the spring and we're not. Human life is a single trajectory, has a single spring, summer and winter and loss in such a world is permanent. But in this world we have the splendor of the world. If we can simply see it, if we can allow ourselves to see it without preconceptions and we can see the stars putting on their glittering belts. And this reminds me of the Constellation or Ryan, uh, which has a glittering belt and a dagger hanging from it.

Speaker 3:          47:13          They throw around their shoulders, cloaks that flash like a great shadows, last embellishment, but now suddenly there's a change. There's a drop in the rhetoric to the utmost simplicity of language. The last tercet three part three line stanza of section nine. It may come tomorrow in the simplest word, almost as part of innocence almost as the tenderest and the truest part. And it, I'm quite certain his death and hamlet if speaks memorable and extremely simple words. When he is about to die, he's about to fight a duel and which is going to be poisoned. And Horatio, his friend is concerned and fears his death. And hamlet says, Tosh, it's nothing. Uh, if it be not today, it will be tomorrow. And who'd been out tomorrow? It will be today. And if it'd be not now, it will come. And that I think is what is being echoed in a sense here.

Speaker 3:          48:22          It may come tomorrow. And the simplest word, this is almost as a part of innocence almost as the tenderest at truest park. Well, I can say only a few words about section 10 as I say, everything goes to hell. And section 10, all the great concepts are discarded. But in section 10, we do return to the concept of happiness in Steven's, uh, we, our humanity is and unhappy people in a happy world. That is to say we live in a world in which there is splendor and vitality and the sun is like a jungle tuft of feathers and like an animal. I, but we're unhappy because we liked the faculty of imagination as the EU does in the poem, the cosmic imagination meditates the whole thing, the history of humanity, all of our fates. And at the end of the very end of the poem, the mother reappears and degraded form as a Harridan, which means a kind of an ugly, untidy old crone and a haggling of wind and weather. The splendors of the Aurora have come to that buy these lights, like a blaze of summary Straw in winters snick and that's the last metaphor for the Aurora borealis. Winter's nick is the solstice, the coming of con Capricorn, the Constellation. And the Auroras are like a blaze of Straw in the midst of all that, not a very grand image, but for Stevens, this is what we have. And this is enough. And I think in a poem like the rowers of autumn, he managed to convince us at least temporarily, but it is enough.

Speaker 2:          50:17          Thank you.
