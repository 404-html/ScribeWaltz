Speaker 1:          00:00          Um, I was, uh, wanting to carry over more, uh, Williams today. Uh, poor Williams. He only got a day like, like Langston Hughes, but it's hard to give everybody their day. Um, uh, and I think on reflection, I, I'd rather, uh, give to full lectures to Marianne Moore because, uh, first of all, she's a difficult poet. Uh, Oh, good. You're saying, as opposed to all these other people, uh, she's, uh, she's difficult in a different way. Uh, and, uh, in some way she doesn't seem difficult, uh, as you, as you get started, but she's, she's idiosyncratic. Um, and, um, I'd like to give her, um, uh, a chance to, um, get your attention and, uh, give you a chance to learn how to read her. Uh, it also strikes me that I haven't read a lot of women poets in this course. How have we, uh, we've read HD, uh, but that's really about it so far.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Um, the, uh, giants of modern poetry, they're men, uh, Yates, Elliot and company. Um, uh, more has a claim to stature. Uh, like there's, uh, I think she is a, uh, a remarkable poet. Um, and one who interestingly, I think has had as much or perhaps even more, um, practical influence and affect, uh, over the development of poetry since, uh, modernism as much or more than any of the poets we've been reading. Uh, the general question of, um, uh, the position of women and of women poets in modern poetry is interesting and important and important context for thinking about more women in the, uh, uh, modernist literary culture that we've been, uh, studying are identified very frequently with a popular and genteel forms of writing and taste. Think about Hart Crane complaining, uh, to Harriet Monroe, the editor of Poetry magazine as if she's just to square to get it.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Uh, this was, this is not an unusual attitude. Uh, women are associated to a degree with political writing, uh, the periods, certain kinds of experimental writing. Uh, and also, uh, above all with the, with the legacy of the 19th century poets tests, uh, James Joyce said the wasteland ended the idea of poetry for ladies, this is its achievement. Uh, poor ladies. Uh, well, um, I, I, you maybe get the idea, um, uh, in Joyce's comment that, uh, here was a, a poem that a broke with, uh, a 19th century culture of poetry, uh, that was in certain ways feminized, uh, at least as a imagined, uh, here by Joyce and certainly by other modern poet. Um, at the same time, um, you can think about the very rich and complicated role of women in, uh, the wasteland in order to, uh, get some sense of the complexity of the position of, of women in modern poetry, uh, in general.

Speaker 1:          04:00          And think of the ways in which Elliot as a poet draws on female speakers and female voices. And you might say, even aspires, uh, to sound like I'm his older, uh, or, uh, fill a male, uh, or, um, well, one of his own inventions in the fire sermon in general. Uh, you could say that the modern poets we've been reading, uh, aggressively and self consciously, uh, uh, masculinize poetry in particular by trying to disassociate a poetry from what is commercial, uh, polite, soft, dreamy, a ideal leisured, uh, all qualities and attitudes, gendered in their imagination, uh, and instead to connect poetry to what is technically rigorous, advanced, learned, unsentimental, uh, uh, hard, uh, and often hard work, uh, terms that are again, clearly gendered. A HD in her own distinctive way is also doing this, taking part in this, uh, modern poetry, wanted to make poetry culturally central and powerful, uh, to reposition it, to, uh, achieve for it.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Uh, the power to define and describe culture. And this was very often, as I'm suggesting a played out in very gendered terms, uh, trying to, uh, claim for poetry, um, uh, kind of, um, uh, set of capacities that were, um, uh, strongly gendered in these poets imaginations. Uh, at the same time, this as I am saying is conflicted in complicated and we need only think of Elliot's case, but you could look back to a Yates, his relationship to women speakers, uh, his own complicated set of identifications with them. Uh, and so on. Uh, how does Marianne Moore fit in this? Uh, what did it mean for her to be a modern poet and a woman? Uh, these are our questions that, um, I'll take up today. Uh, first of all, addressing this question specifically of, of, uh, well what did it mean to write from the position of a woman for more and I, and, and then I, I want to go on and talk about more, um, as an American poet, a witch.

Speaker 1:          06:48          She was self consciously, uh, and then, uh, to, uh, begin to talk about more as a nature poet, uh, which she also was, uh, let's, let's get started by, uh, looking at, um, well, uh, one of her earliest, uh, publications poem that, uh, like, uh, many of the other important early poems by these poets appeared in poetry magazine. Uh, this time, I think in 1919. I'm not sure. I'll, I'll check the date. I'm talking about the poem called a grave. Uh, on page four 40. It's a great poem. Uh, and, uh, it's a, it's a poem that announces a speaker that sounds like no one else. Uh, and sounds like certainly no one we have been reading. Um, think about, uh, the seafarer. Another poem. In fact, the sea. How did that sound? Bitter breast cares have I abided a nine the night and, uh, you remember pounds a sonorous and even perhaps ponderous, a heroic, a Anglo Saxon alliterative a meter, which I talked about as in pounds case, a deliberate and interesting evasion of I am big pentameter norms, uh, blank verse as a kind of a model for heroic speech.

Speaker 1:          08:22          Well, so is this, but it sounds nothing like that. It's on the other end of the spectrum, right? It sounds like what pros in certain ways, uh, a remarkable elevated prose, but pros, pros that uses words like consciousness, volition. However, when was the last po last time you saw a poem said, however, uh, it's, uh, it really, uh, announces a, a speaker who is using kind of expository language. Uh, there are latinate words, uh, uh, there's obviously no meter and rhyme. Uh, at the same time, uh, there is a, uh, developed and as almost always in more intricate formal design and idiosyncratic formal design that is operating in the pump, but almost secretly, um, what's it look like on the page? A lot of long lines, right? Um, a lot of long lines, some of which run over well. Uh, this like other more poems is a poem structured around counting syllables per line, uh, and counting.

Speaker 1:          09:50          In fact, number of lines. This is not a kind of a formal organization that you hear and it's even difficult to see, but it's an operative one for her. And it's one of the ways in which she organizes her verse. Uh, it's as if, you know, more has in some sense set up her own rules, clung to them, and kept them secret. She doesn't always keep them secrets. Sometimes they're quite conspicuous and, and, and, uh, uh, even, uh, you know, flashy and certain poems and their designs. But here it's quite in conspicuous. What you have is a poem that is made up of two 11 line groups, uh, to 11 lines stands as or paragraphs each beginning with a short seven syllable line man looking into the sea for their bones have not lasted. This is a kind of a pattern that structures the poem, uh, in all these ways that I'm describing the syllable count, the expository writing, the, uh, latinate a diction, the, uh, self conscious pro pros like nature of the, uh, uh, language, although semi-colons, um, this is, uh, poetry that has distanced itself from, um, traditions of song, uh, and certainly from 19th century, uh, traditions of versification.

Speaker 1:          11:23          Um, the form of the poem is, is again, not something you see or even hear necessarily. It's there, uh, almost as a kind of absence. Now there's also a wonderfully, a certain combativeness more, it's a combative and pugnacious poet. Uh, you, uh, again, may not see this immediately, uh, because of the poems impersonality uh, the way in which it seems to present itself. And, um, uh, the often intricate, um, uh, forms of, of Syntax and, and, and uh, or oblique approach. But she is a fighter. And this poem is really, uh, uh, uh, uh, kind of, uh, fighting, uh, that we're, we're seeing, uh, the poem begins in irritation. It begins as a complaint, a complaint that's addressed to whom to man, man, looking into the sea. A man suggests, well, maybe humankind. You think about the people on the shore and frost poem, neither out far nor deep, who were standing there looking out at the, at the water.

Speaker 1:          12:47          Uh, well, um, uh, more might be addressing them. Uh, but I think there's a more specific in particular, uh, man, uh, that is the, uh, um, uh, irritant that sets the poem going, uh, uh, a man, a figure of a man who like a romantic poet has arrogated to himself the position to, you know, taking the view, you know, stand like a, the figure in a Caspar David Friedrich painting. And, uh, you know, uh, gaze into the sublime. Uh, meanwhile more is somewhere else. Uh, where is she? Well, uh, she's somewhere behind him, uh, because he's blocked her view, man, looking into the sea, taking the view from those who have as much right to it is you have to yourself. Well, it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing. She says, uh, trying to, uh, uh, make sense of this.

Speaker 1:          13:51          Um, more, uh, has, uh, a couple comments here that, that, uh, describe the origins of this poem. Uh, it's not the first quotation on your handout. She says, uh, as for a grave, uh, it has a significance apart from the literal origin. But here's the literal origin. Uh, it was a man who placed himself between my mother and me and the surf. We were watching from the Middle Ledge of rocks on Monhegan island after the storm. Don't be annoyed. My mother said, it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing. Uh, it is, uh, you know, important that however more was annoyed, she was annoyed into poetry, you could say. Uh, and she took her mother with her. Uh, you know, uh, the palm is really written from the perspective of a daughter and mother, uh, and a daughter with an intimate relationship to her mother who, um, uh, absorbs here and very often elsewhere in her poetry, uh, actual quotations from.

Speaker 1:          14:59          But even more importantly, a style of speech and attitude, uh, associated with her mother who talks a lot like Dr. Samuel Johnson or some other, uh, 18th century, uh, uh, a figure and moralist like that. Uh, Mrs. Moore, uh, someone that Marianne, uh, uh, always identified with herself. Um, it's significant here that more is using quotation from her mother and not acknowledging it, uh, in any particular way, uh, as if the two women had, you know, one voice and one perspective, uh, the man that blocks their point of view, uh, and you know, blocks their point of view. You could say in many senses they're, you know, literal point of view of the water. But also, uh, in the point of view, he takes, uh, in effect, ignores and suppresses. There's, uh, he is standing in the posture, as I suggested, a kind of conventional romantic visionary, uh, staring into the sea emblem of infinity.

Speaker 1:          16:11          Uh, well, it might be hard crane, right? Uh, uh, writing at Melville's tomb a, although crane wouldn't write that poem for a few more years. Uh, and, and when he did, incidentally, he sent it to Marianne Moore, who was then the editor of the dial, who sends it back and rejected it. Um, uh, Morris, a poem, uh, is, uh, in fact, as I suggested, an early poem of hers and an Early Act of self definition, uh, that's quite a important, uh, in, in both the impersonality of the point of view. And yet the insistent, um, uh, individuality of that, that point of view. Um, Maura's poems are like this. They seem impersonal, and yet they're at the same time, deeply personal and deeply, um, uh, individual. Uh, here she celebrates the power of the sea to resist the imposition of the observers will, uh, or, uh, the will of the sailor a or a seafarer.

Speaker 1:          17:16          Uh, uh, you know, and again, we can think of a deceased or pounds seafair. Uh, you know, the, the sea is a well, the sea is, uh, uh, the sea is a collector quick to return a repeat purchase. Look, I, if you want to take possession of the sea in some way, well, don't think you can do that because this is a grander force than you, and it will take you up, uh, and drown you. Uh, which is what, uh, the poem, um, uh, it goes on to describe, uh, the sea has here the forest that it does, uh, in, uh, other, uh, great poems by more like the fish or sojourn in the whale. It seems to stand for death. Uh, it is, uh, a grave. Uh, it is a grave in which you could say a certain idea of romantic. And I think specifically male subjectivity is overcome and buried, shown its limits.

Speaker 1:          18:24          Uh, in this poem, the human, uh, uh, imagined. Finally, as something that twists and turns in the depths, uh, is converted by natural forces into a part of the natural world that it sought through the man's perspective to dominate more, sent this poem, uh, to pound. These poets are always sending their poems to pound. Uh, he responded with admiration in that second quotation there. He says, thank God, even though you are a woman, I think you can be trusted not to pour out a flood in the manner of dear Amy Lowell and Edgar Lee Masters, who though not a woman, was a, uh, sentimental regionalist, uh, and, and not, you know, uh, an international modernist, uh, pound is approving of more here. Uh, he, he, uh, approves that she does not Gush. Uh, she, she does not emote. Uh, she has not written a sentimental poem. In fact, in certain way, she's written an anti sentimental poem.

Speaker 1:          19:40          Um, I think it's important that, uh, more a rhetorical choices have prevented her from doing so. Uh, the, the poem has the kind of formal self-discipline it does. Uh, again, these are, these are, uh, aspects of, of restraint in the poetry. More is dry. Uh, in all respects, uh, at the same time, uh, these are, these are modernist values, uh, you know, uh, values, uh, that that pound would describe in his image, just manifesto and elsewhere. Um, at the same time more gets her dryness not by disavowing femininity or suppressing it or, or attacking it, uh, as one of her peers might've, uh, she does it rather specifically in this act of challenging man. Uh, let me look with you at the letter that, um, more wrote to, um, pounds, uh, uh, in response, um, that, um, um, acts as a kind of now letter of introduction.

Speaker 1:          21:03          Uh, and it has a lot of interesting things in it, and it's probably a good introduction to who she is for us to, uh, she says, uh, um, I was born in 1887 and brought up in the home of my grandfather clergymen of the Presbyterian church. She comes from a Christian and God fearing home. Uh, I am Irish by descent, and that's part of where some of the combativeness comes from, possibly scotch also, but purely Celtic. Uh, was graduated from Brynmore where she knew and befriended HD. Uh, taught shorthand. Typewriting. Uh, she's worked for a living, uh, in 1916 my mother Mary Warner more and I left a home and a Carlisle to be with, uh, her brother, a chaplain, a of the battleship Rhode Island. There's, there's a lot of Christianity and the family. Uh, she says, and then she's living with her mother in New York.

Speaker 1:          22:09          And indeed she would spend the rest of her life living with her mother in New York, in Greenwich Village and in Brooklyn, in a small apartment. Contrary to your impression, I am all together blonde and have red hair. Uh, pound had asked, uh, uh, whether she was Ethiopian after he read the poem Black Earth, read black earth and think, decide whether the, whether Marion war isn't Ethiopian. Uh, this is important. She says, any verse that I have written has been an arrangement of stanzas. Each stanza being an exact duplicate of every other stanza. This is not always true, but she claims it is. I have occasionally been at pains to make an arrangement of lines and rhymes that I like repeat itself. But the form of the original stands of anything I've written has been a matter of expediency hit upon as being approximately suitable to the subject matter, the resemblance of my progress to your beginnings as an accident.

Speaker 1:          23:18          I didn't, I wasn't influenced by you pound when I started writing syllabic verse because pound had experimented with this himself. Uh, there's, there's a couple ideas here that are important. Um, uh, first of all that, um, more identifies as it were, two moments of creativity, uh, involved in the making of her poems. One is a moment of spontaneity and expediency in which lines almost like some kind of, um, uh, you know, channeled speech, uh, arrive in a certain form and then she makes that form in it's contingency in accidental illness, uh, repeat itself. Uh, she goes on and, uh, uh, in other words, what came by chance, she repeats through will, uh, through discipline. Um, this is a significant, uh, and it's related to, uh, uh, kind of, um, uh, well to her originality of form. Uh, which is something at once, something, uh, that as it were, comes to her naturally and that she, um, uh, builds on self consciously and through, um, a kind of rigorous self discipline.

Speaker 1:          24:41          She says then I do not appear, she meant I don't appear in literary periodicals. You can't find my poems anywhere. Uh, but there's a, um, but the line itself is wonderfully suggestive and simple. The, the sentence I do not appear. Uh, and in fact, uh, more does not appear very much in her poems. Um, she is interestingly, um, uh, backgrounded or uh, even invisible, uh, in her palms in the ways that she is in a grave. Um, and then she says, I grow less and less desirous of being published, produce less and have a strong feeling for letting alone what little I do produce. Uh, and uh, then she continues to capitalize. The first word of every line is rather slavish as they do in 19th century poetry. And I have substituted small letters for capitals in the closed versions of the two pumps that you have.

Speaker 1:          25:45          This is, this is another sort of distinctive, formal choice, more mix not to capitalize her first lines, something Williams does to a, in a graveyard. She now goes on now talking about the poem, a grave, uh, graves better than a graveyard. Don't you think? Uh, the change that I have made is to the end of the line, the very end of the poem. Um, uh, as you suggest, and for the sake of symmetry, a, I've altered the arrangement of lines in the proceedings stances. I realized that by writing consciousness and volition, this is, this is the order of the words that pound had proposed. At the end of that poem, emphasis, emphasis is obtained, which is sacrificed by retaining the order which I have. That is Moore's order, volition and then consciousness. And I'm willing to make the change, though I prefer the original order, which in fact, ultimately she kept, uh, let's look at the end of the poem again.

Speaker 1:          26:55          Uh, the sea looks, uh, well, uh, I'll read from line 20 pound said, well, that ending it doesn't quite do it. Why aren't you switch consciousness and volition? Uh, with what implication, uh, that to, uh, that, that somehow volition is more important than consciousness, uh, that it's the last thing to go. Uh, and the most dramatic thing to lose more however insists, no, that's not the case. It's the other way around. Consciousness is more important than volition. In fact, that's really what this whole poem is about. You could say a pound, uh, wanted the emphasis to, uh, take Moore's word that comes with stressing volition as most important. And in fact, volition is nothing but a kind of expression of emphasis. Uh, she says no consciousness is more important. And as she does, she emphasizes it. Uh, she introduces another kind of emphasis, one associated, not specifically, uh, with volition so much as, uh, the, uh, drama and power of consciousness, which she insists on here.

Speaker 1:          28:20          Um, although Moore's a poem could be in fact rat as, as a kind of a rebuke in advance to Hart Crane, uh, in his poem, uh, at Melville's tomb. Uh, more in fact, uh, got to know, and like crane in the 20s, uh, sometimes acting as his editor. Uh, when he sent poems to the dial for publication, she turned back at Melville's tomb. She accepted other poems. One poem she accepted the Wine Menagerie, uh, was a poem, um, in, um, uh, quatrains, uh, she accepted it and then converted the poem into free verse, uh, in reduced it by half its size. Uh, crane accepted it, uh, uh, accepted this publication along with $10, uh, which he needed. Uh, but both, uh, both, uh, crane and more, uh, like Williams, uh, were, uh, I think self consciously American poets, uh, and their Americanness, uh, is important to how they define themselves as modern poets. Uh, and there is really in all of them a certain kind of combative cultural nationalism, a which has a aesthetic, uh, and, uh, uh, ethical, um, um, uh, implications. Uh, as an example, uh, let's turn a page back and look at the poem. England.

Speaker 1:          29:59          Uh, okay. Um, the poem begins here as a series of national characatures. Uh, and then, uh, eventually, uh, uh, it will, uh, move from these characatures, uh, which suggest ways of life and also aesthetic dispositions, ways of doing and thinking about art. I think she will move from that to talk about America. Uh, and, uh, what is American, uh, and, uh, this is, you could say her, her real subject here. And then she will go on and, and describe, uh, uh, America. Uh, she will go on and contrast everything that she has just caricature, uh, in a, in a polite, but essentially negative way in each of those cases with, uh, with the American, uh, and specifically, um, with American speech, uh, and, uh, American English. In other words, just because Americans who say Sam or cam a sound like that instead of som or calm, that doesn't mean they're stupid or that the rest of America is.

Speaker 1:          31:14          In other words, if you don't think you can get poetry in America, you haven't looked. It's a wonderful poem. It's a defense of America, uh, and, uh, American creativity, uh, American language. Uh, it is, uh, an attack on Euro centric cultural snobs. Uh, at the same time, a more is not only or merely adding America as one among other nations. Rather, uh, America is the locality where this principle of hers is honored, uh, a place that incorporates many other places, many other cultures, uh, many other ways of feeling and thinking and speaking. This principle, the idea that inspiration has never been confined to one locality to one place, uh, affirms a kind of art, uh, that is not only a matter of high culture, but that is also vernacular, a regional heterogeneous, popular and includes in it all kinds of materials. And you remember a quotation I, uh, uh, pointed to in the first day of class when I quoted from, uh, Moore's poem and she was talking about all the things that should go in poetry and even, uh, uh, business documents in school books.

Speaker 1:          32:46          Well, America is a, a place where you can put those things in poems. Uh, this is, this is, uh, a proud, uh, also a comical, a principle. It's a democratic principle for more, uh, is it maybe also a feminist? One. Uh, I think so. Uh, in so far as more defines what is American, uh, as specifically, uh, in distinctively, uh, a non hierarchical point of view, uh, that is, uh, not so much a woman's point of view, so much as a point of view that accommodates that of a woman, uh, among others within a multiplicity of human perspectives. And in fact, nonhuman perspectives, uh, she's serious about including this cats and dogs.

Speaker 1:          33:43          Why is the poem called England? Uh, by incorporating, uh, the, the title into the first line of the poem poem more makes it seem accidental. Uh, the Di, the device, uh, for grounds, uh, Morris concision and practicality. Why waste any extra words on the title? A pound wants you to use no word that does not contribute to the presentation. Okay. Uh, then, uh, we'll make the title part of the presentation to, uh, the gesture is also a of a piece, I think with more distrust of hierarchy itself. Uh, she says in effect, the title is not, uh, uh, more important than the rest of the poem. It doesn't stand outside it or above it. Uh, it's just part of it. Uh, just as more founded slavish, uh, and probably pretentious to capitalize the first word of every line of verse. Uh, she wants, uh, to, uh, in that sense give dignity to the lower case.

Speaker 1:          34:53          Two to non capital letters at the same time more is very wildly and clever. Uh, England really is important here. Uh, that is, it's not merely the first nation in an arbitrarily arrange list. Uh, she's defending America and American English, uh, specifically against the noted superiority of England and English literature where of course, pound Eliot Frost and others had gone to establish themselves as poets. Uh, and, and to this extent, she's saying that the, the title is, uh, uh, not so important that a, it stands above the poem. England not so important, uh, that it stands over and above America. Uh, and, and in this sense, the title in fact turns out to be important and to give us important information, uh, because she's out here to make England less important. Uh, and to deny it, it's pride of place. Well, uh, we've got just a few minutes left to start. Uh, a long, uh, difficult, uh, and truly marvelous poem called an octopus that exemplifies more as a nature poet, um, and exemplifies, uh, many of the distinctive features of her writing. Uh, again, uh, this is on four 41. Um, the, uh, title of the poem is the first line.

Speaker 1:          36:38          Uh, we might think that, uh, this is going to be a poem about an octopus. Uh, well, not exactly a in effect. The, the, uh, uh, title is a, is a kind of riddle that the, uh, poem will go on and explain and expand on. It's a poem about Mount Rainier, uh, Mount Rainier where we're more went, uh, with her brother John in 1922, that same year that, uh, Joyce published Ulysses and, uh, Elliot ended the idea of poetry for ladies in the wasteland. Uh, the poem involves a kind of a essential contradiction, which it works through, uh, in complex ways. On the one hand, the mountain that, um, more calls an octopus that she's writing about here, uh, is something that is exactly other, it's outside the poet. It's, it's out there like the sea in, in a a grave. Uh, it's objectified. It's something more has to stand apart from perhaps try to conquer in the form of climbing it or conquer in the form of representing it in her writing.

Speaker 1:          38:03          And yet in the course of the poem, the, uh, mountain and it's glacier, which is really the octopus that she's talking about, um, uh, is something that more identifies herself with, uh, that, uh, comes to look like more in certain ways. Uh, it comes to be identified with the force of her art. So it's both kind of version of herself and it's a version of something other to, um, the palm is filled with an extraordinary and bewildering detail that evokes the natural world as, uh, one of, uh, extraordinary and bewildering detail. Um, at the same time, it combines and creates a fantastic collage of quotation from a wild variety of sources. Um, it's hard to know where to start and stop in this poem when its parts are, uh, it's a, a question that in a, in a sense more is asking about the mountain itself.

Speaker 1:          39:21          Um, there's in general a kind of analogy, uh, throughout, uh, the palm, uh, between the mountain and the woman who admires it, uh, whose mind itself can seem octopus like and reaches out in these long a tentacle like lines to grasp the world, make it her own, a, freeze it in poetic language. Uh, even while she's insisting on the, the, the wonderful otherness of the world. Um, I won't, I won't, um, uh, start reading now at the end of class, but let me say a couple of further things about the poem and ask you to reread it, uh, and, um, uh, and to, um, knowing that it's hard, um, reread it more than once and maybe not continuously. It's a very hard palm to read continuously. Uh, be sure to read the last paragraph of it carefully. That begins on four 44. Um, let me say something before we stop about quotation.

Speaker 1:          40:34          You remember, uh, that the sea in a grave, uh, mocked, uh, the, uh, uh, um, uh, rapacious collector, uh, more herself was a great collector. Uh, she collected, among other things, quotations, uh, she in grosses them. She, uh, uh, gathers them to her. Uh, she, uh, um, uh, you know, masters, uh, her reading, uh, she brings them into this poem, uh, in, as I say, a kind of a collage, a, it gives the palm mcchain of, um, well a very strange poly vocality. There's many, many voices here. Uh, think of the wasteland well more, more rivals it in this poem. Uh, many voices that again, democratically allow for you could say multiple perspectives, uh, multiple kinds of material, uh, unlike the wasteland. Uh, uh, more is not, I'm quoting a only high art sources by and large. Well Elliot has his popular culture too, but we know that it's, uh, it's pretty much a high culture pump.

Speaker 1:          41:55          Well more is making her poem out of magazines, out of a pamphlet from the national parks portfolio, uh, through her reading and Reskin, uh, and uh, many other sources. Uh, and it treats those various texts. Uh, you could say non hierarchically without a kind of regard to generic valuations. She doesn't play off high and low as Elliot does in a game of chess, for example. Uh, it makes the sources of poetic language and a poetry continuous with ordinary life. Uh, her activities of reading. Uh, and at the same time, it makes a more as inspiration, deeply personal, uh, because who else? But Marianne Moore would have read all this stuff or just these things, um, like pound, uh, a kind of visionary scholar, uh, who, who found his, his, uh, muse in a, in a translated homer, uh, more, uh, knowing that, that, that literary inspiration is not confined to any locality, finds it all over the place in her reading. Uh, but again, what she's reading is something different from Elliot and pound. And I'll say more about that next time.
