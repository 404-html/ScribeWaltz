Speaker 1:          00:12          Wh Auden,

Speaker 1:          00:17          western [inaudible]. Uh, there really is no more dramatic, uh, a contrast in this course, I think, uh, then then to go from late Stephens to early on, uh, in Stephens is a boring Oh, uh, Oh, 20 years before. Um, uh, uh, I'm, um, goes on writing, uh, to his death in 1973. Uh, so his career is somewhat later, uh, then Stevens, but again, uh, we're doing something a little complicated. We're moving from, uh, Stevens, his poems of the late, uh, excuse me, late 1940 [inaudible] early 1950s now to, uh, odd and, uh, and his early career, uh, including poems are written in the very late 1920s in the 1930s. And we'll, we'll get up to, uh, uh, the start of World War Two by the end of class. Uh, so in one sense we're going back in time back in literary history, back and a cultural history, uh, moving from the 1950s, from, uh, this postwar moment in which, uh, Steven's is riding his late palms to, uh, an earlier phase. Uh, at the same time, uh, we are also, however, moving forward in a sense in literary history, uh, moving forward, uh, to a, a poetry that, uh, is distinctly, uh, and, uh, very asley a poetry that comes after modernism. Uh, and, and to that extent that we could think of as post modernist, uh, it is, uh, well what do we mean by that and what do, what do I mean,

Speaker 2:          02:18          uh,

Speaker 1:          02:21          with Stevens in mind,

Speaker 1:          02:25          there are no giants and Auden, uh, their, uh, everything is a life size. Uh, poems don't take the place of mountains. Uh, rather they, you could say take place among them. And in mountains figure, interestingly in, uh, uh, Auden's poetry and a number of places, uh, in Arden, there is no new knowledge of reality to be had. Uh, in fact, there's only a old wisdom that nobody wants to face. The, the modernism turns on a kind of, uh, access, uh, you could say a modernism as wasteland or as bridge, uh, uh, state of cultural decay in crisis, or if promise, uh, and, uh, celebration, uh, pound Eliot on one side, a crane, Stevens on the other well oddness beyond these debates, they don't matter much to him. Uh, he is, uh, in a sense beyond, uh, the nostalgia of, of the one side. And he's also, uh, quite, uh, uh, self consciously beyond, uh, the romantic exaltation of the other, uh, on, uh, is, uh, uh, a British poet.

Speaker 1:          04:02          Uh, he writes out of the distinctly British tradition a tradition in which, uh, well tradition itself is in a sense taken for granted. It's something that they're accessible, uh, part of the poets, uh, repertoire that needed to be either struggle for or against, uh, industrial capitalism. Hart Crane is, is all excited about this stuff. Uh, it's an old thing in the north of England. Um, uh, and, and, uh, Auden's early poems take place in, in a, um, a landscape of, uh, uh, now, uh, fading, uh, and century old, uh, industry, uh, early on. Uh, later on. Um, these are our, our, uh, characters, uh, uh, as well that are important to the history of ans reception. There's been a tendency to see his career is coming in to have a divided by, uh, his immigration, uh, to, um, the United States. Uh, and, uh, uh, the very end of 1938, um, uh, a British Auden and then, uh, in American on, uh, both Auden's, uh, you could say have a distinct characters.

Speaker 1:          05:48          Uh, early on, early on, uh, a, a poet, a born in the city of York, uh, the son of a doctor, uh, interested in natural science, uh, and in scientific ways of knowing, uh, a poet for whom science, uh, was not an enemy, but rather a kind of tool, uh, a point of view or perspective, uh, expressed importantly, uh, for a, uh, early on in, uh, uh, the work of Freud, uh, the work of Freud, but also the work of Marx. Uh, the early on is, is not an Orthodox Marxist and certainly not a communist party member. Uh, but Marxism is important to him. Uh, it's part of a worldview. Uh, it's worked into his sense of the world as a, uh, seen, uh, where social classes compete and struggle with each other. Uh, and where the important choices to be made are, uh, uh, moral ones.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Um, uh, moral ones that, uh, enter into our political choices. Uh, it's also, uh, a, uh, uh, uh, uh, the case in Auden's early poetry that, um, that he tends to conceive of the world and a kind of us and them, uh, construction. Uh, there's a, a sense in the early poems of, uh, extreme privacy, uh, and the privacy of address, uh, the way in which the poet speaks to us. Uh, the way in which he conceives his point of view. Um, these early poems conceive a kind of, uh, you could say cooter re audience, uh, who are, um, uh, um, Auden's, uh, intellectual, a leftist, a largely gay friends, uh, at Oxford where he's, uh, uh, riding his earliest poems. Uh, homosexuality is an important context, uh, for, um, uh, this early Odden and, and, uh, his ways of imagining himself and talking to us, uh, uh, Auden's, um, uh, odd and comes with a kind of a embattled, uh, uh, necessarily secretive, uh, and, and, uh, uh, self protective, uh, investment in, in intimate relationships. There there's something that have to be, uh, fought for, um, um, they are prized, uh, and they, um, uh, uh, are something that must be protected, uh, from, um, the intrusions of, uh, other hostile, uh, or disapproving eyes. Um,

Speaker 2:          09:04          uh,

Speaker 1:          09:05          yeah. Well, let's, let's look at an early poem here. Uh, this is, um, uh, in your, um, all right. Yes. Packet.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:26          From the very first coming down, it's, it's, uh, called, uh, I'll, uh, I'll, I'll show you some, some photos first before getting into poem. This is, uh, this is one I like a of the Oxford Auden. Um, uh, a, a sensitive boy, uh, with the, uh, um, um, interesting legend that he has, uh, uh, applied to himself here. Probably in retrospect, the cerebral life would pay. He said it was going to be a, he was going to make it work to be an intellectual. Um, this is, uh, another one, uh, uh, on, uh, the, the, the rakish a young on, uh, uh, this one also with, um, a, a, a kind of a legend on top, uh, uh, you know, Adam's hand where he calls himself Utopian youth, grown old Italian, uh, as in fact, this was a certain kind of trajectory. He would live, uh, starting, uh, as a kind of Utopian youth. And then, you know, later, uh, learning how to relax and have a good time in Italy. Um, the, uh, uh, let's see here.

Speaker 2:          10:53          Yeah, I want to, um,

Speaker 1:          10:57          great. I've got my slides somewhat backwards. So this is, um, uh, Auden's poems. His first book, uh, I believe it's 1930. Uh, they're written in a while. He's a student at Oxford and, uh, um, excuse me, um, includes, uh, poems that are this one that I'll discuss in a moment, but it's worth throwing them on the page. Uh, they're laid out without titles. Again, I'm somewhat as, um, uh, Williams. His early poems are presented. Uh, they are, um, uh, uh, sat here almost sort of secretively, uh, I'd like to say without that, um, public introduction of a title, uh, and well as I am suggesting of some degree of self protection and, um, a reticence are, uh, important qualities and in fact, themes of this early poetry. Uh, let, let's take a look at this poem that, uh, I've got up on the, uh, screen, uh, right now, uh, which is, uh, called from the very first coming down.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Uh, that's the first line of the poem and it's, um, uh, generally known that way. Um, from the very first coming down into a new valley with a frown already we're, we're listening to a polity rhymes, uh, because of the sun. And the last way you certainly remain, uh, there's a, you hear there's an eye, the palm is a kind of letter. Uh, and in fact, a kind of love letter. Uh, today I crouching behind the sheep pen and this is that northern landscape that, that uh, uh, Auden comes from. A I crouching behind a sheep pen, heard travel across a sudden bird cry out against the storm. And found the years Arca Completed Round and loves Warren Circuit. Re begun endless with no dissenting turn shall see, shall pass as we have seen the swallow on the tile springs green preliminary shiver past a solitary truck, the last shunting in the autumn. And so on.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Your letter comes speaking is you speaking of much, but not to come. The letter comes, uh, in a sense, uh, from an intimate of friend, perhaps a lover, uh, uh, saying much in yet, uh, were given no content to it. Uh, it's a veiled in that sense, uh, it speaking of much, but much that is not to come. It seems, uh, it, it's very content and promises it seems withheld. Uh, then there's this further stanza nor speech is close nor fingers numb if love not seldom has received an unjust answer was deceived. This, this early on is, is, has this highly compressed syntax, uh, that requires you to kind of put the sentences together and fill in parts that seemed to have been, uh, occluded, uh, in the poets, uh, compressing a of language. Um, again, uh, uh, an almost veiled form of speech. Uh, odd and says I decent with the seasons move different or with a different love is a sense that the love that he, that animates him is a different love.

Speaker 1:          15:14          It sets him apart nor he doesn't question over much the nod, the stone smile of this country. God that never was more reticent, always afraid to say more than it meant. Uh, there's an intimacy that the poem establishes here, uh, with the you, uh, and with us as readers, um, that, uh, suggests a kind of implied shared knowledge that the poem nonetheless does not openly declare a and doesn't specify, but rather remains reticent about. And we're invited into that reticence, uh, as well as the poets scruple, uh, expressed here as, uh, the wisdom of that country, God, which it's hard to know exactly how we're supposed to interpret that, whether that's, uh, uh, actual figure or a kind of a stone in the landscape that, that the poet is animating in this way. But in any case, seeing that, that figure that country God as emblematic of a, uh, a reticence, uh, that scruples, not to say more than it meant, uh, in other words, uh, there's, well, you, you could compare this to Marianne Moore's investment in restraint, a very closely related, uh, uh, in, in its, um, moral, uh, valence is, um, the idea here, uh, is, is one that's crucial in Ogden, uh, throughout his career.

Speaker 1:          17:02          Uh, that is the poet wishes to master his intentions as a speaker. He does not wish to say more than he means, and he means to say what he means, uh, and to insist on, um, uh, meaning what he says. This is, uh, this is a long way from, its very different from Wallace Stevens is a lavish, uh, forms of play. His, uh, uh, interest in, um, uh, in exactness, uh, or, uh, uh, poems that might resist the intelligence almost successfully. Uh, odd wants very much to say what he means. And he wants us to, uh, be able to, to grasp that, um, this, uh, uh, well on conceives of poetry and of language generally as a sphere of moral action, uh, in which truth is always at stake. Uh, where, uh, the poet specific, uh, office is to control and use language in a kind of a responsible, uh, and, uh, honest way.

Speaker 1:          18:28          Um, this is a poet wants to be honest. Uh, poets have not always wished this. Uh, uh, you can, you can think about Hart Crane, uh, saying, uh, sleep, death, desire, hasten while they are true. Uh, in other words, a crane's, uh, investment, uh, willing investment in what he recognizes as a illusion, uh, or, or, um, you know, a kind of temporary truth. Uh, Arden is a rather, uh, uh, morally bound to a responsible for what he says. Uh, he's concerned, uh, in this sense, uh, with the limits of poetry, uh, with, uh, saying only what's meant. Um, again, uh, a connection should be drawn to a Marion Moore who, who share something with a odd in this way. Uh, you remember her long poem, um, uh, poetry. Uh, I too dislike it. Uh, uh, there must be something important beyond all this fiddle. Uh, and yet, uh, you know, after reading it with a con perfect content for it, when discovers, uh, nonetheless, uh, a place for the genuine, uh, she says, or something very close to that.

Speaker 1:          19:53          Um, well that's the beginning in, um, uh, Maura's case, uh, of a very long, uh, an extravagant poem, which over the course of her career, uh, as she returned to it, uh, and sought to tell the truth in her poem and, and, uh, to, uh, insist on a what was genuine, uh, she eventually, uh, cut, uh, to only those lines, uh, more, uh, was as a poet, a rigorous, uh, self reviser, um, who, um, you know, cuts out, uh, pieces, uh, of her poems who cuts out individual poems from her body of work. Uh, so was Aaden Aaden, uh, uh, importantly, um, uh, revised his poems, uh, sometimes, uh, uh, on multiple occasions, uh, uh, always, uh, as, uh, he collected them and return to them in later, uh, uh, volumes. There are a couple important, um, uh, examples of this, uh, including the pumps, Spain, uh, on, uh, page 791, um, uh, a poem that Auden wrote,

Speaker 2:          21:22          uh,

Speaker 1:          21:22          in response to, uh, the Anti Fascist struggle, uh, in the Spanish civil war, uh, which he participated in a, and it is, uh, a, uh, uh, a, a poem that, um, Complex Lee, uh, and yet nonetheless, uh, strongly, uh, comes to affirm the, um, uh, uh, priority of, uh, making, um, um, political commitments over a and above, um, uh, it appears, um, uh, individual moral discriminations, uh, and, uh, other, uh, forms of, um, uh, individual commitment. Uh, and there are ideas expressed in this, a poem that became an anthem and one of, uh, Auden's most, most famous, uh, uh, poems of the 30s. Uh, well, let me give you just a few lines from it. Uh, and, um, uh, page seven, 93,

Speaker 2:          22:38          um, uh,

Speaker 1:          22:44          stirring us to March, uh, uh, odd, uh, says, uh, tomorrow, perhaps the future, uh, tomorrow, the rediscovery of Romantic love, uh, uh, uh, and so on. But today,

Speaker 2:          23:03          okay.

Speaker 1:          23:03          On Line 93, the deliberate increase in the chances of death, even the conscious acceptance of guilt in the necessary murder. Today, the expanding of powers on the flat of femoral pamphlet and the boring meeting he's calling us to do the work of revolution and postpone, um, uh, as a goal, uh, the rediscovery of a romantic love and other Utopian projects, uh, Auden would, would come to, uh, find the morality of this poem, um, objectionable, uh, and uh, uh, to repudiate the notion that we should ever accept a guilt in the necessary murder, uh, that rather any murder would be necessary, uh, in order to advance a cause and, uh, expressing his own self. Censure cut the palm out of his, his work. And if you buy Auden's collected, uh, poems edited by as executor a Edward Mendelson, you will find that this poem is not in there.

Speaker 1:          24:09          Uh, there are other, uh, examples. Um, I'll, um, uh, of of dramatic self revision. Uh, let me just point to one more, uh, that is famous, um, in the pumps. September 1st, 1939, again, one of Auden's most celebrated and circulated poems. Uh, he, uh, has, uh, in, uh, the next to last stanza, uh, these, um, assertions on page eight oh three. All I have, this is a poem occasion by the beginning of the Second World War, uh, it, um, positions the poet, uh, in a dive, uh, in Manhattan drinking, uh, with others. Uh, he's reflecting on, um, the European catastrophe now underway. He says, all I have is a voice to undo the folded lie, the romantic lie in the brain of the sensual man in the street and the lie of authority whose buildings grope the sky. There is no such thing as the state, and no one exists alone.

Speaker 1:          25:26          Hunger allows no choice to the citizen or the police. We must love one another. We're die, uh, as, uh, uh, you are note below. Uh, uh, registers a on a later attempted to revise this line, which struck him as, uh, in fact he called it incurably dishonest, uh, and, uh, uh, he, he revised it a first with what, uh, seem to him, uh, a, a more truthful claim. We must love one another and die because we're going to have to die in any case. Uh, and that, uh, uh, eventually, uh, he gave up on altogether, uh, and cut, uh, the entire stands. Uh, uh, these, uh, are examples of Auden a applying a kind of stringent moral, a self examination to the language that he uses a in. It's, uh, uh, um, a crucial part, not only of the history of his work and other, it's what he did with it, but what of course we use doing in it, uh, which was, uh, attempting to speak, uh, in a truthful way, uh, that he could take responsibility for, uh, and yet, which led him repeatedly to, um, uh, forms of rhetoric that he would mistrust, uh, and later, uh, abandoned.

Speaker 1:          26:56          Uh, all of this is consistent with the ways in which Auden reconceived the modern poets role. Auden writes against Vat, heck, romantic inspiration. Uh, he, uh, sees the modern poet as a kind of rationalist, uh, a rationalist, especially skilled in the techniques of poetry of language use, uh, as expressed, uh, specifically, uh, in technical mastery of verse form and Genre.

Speaker 1:          27:41          Auden, uh, um, uh, reclaims a following pound Anglo Saxon alliterative meter. Uh, he, uh, rights in popular ballad forms, all kinds of song forms, many kinds of rhyme and meter. Uh, he, he takes over, uh, you could say, uh, uh, uh, song forms from the British music call, which is something like Vaudeville. Uh, he, um, produces intricate stands, AIC patterns, um, that we might find in metaphysical poetry. He, he produces ornate syllabic poems, not unlike Marianne Moore's. Sometimes he, uh, uh, influentially, uh, revives the province Saul forms of the Cistina, uh, and the Kenzo Ne. Uh, and other, uh, um, troubadour a forms. Uh, if, uh, uh, your, your poetry writing teachers have made you write sestinas you have odd and to thank for this, uh, as well as much else. Um, there is, uh, in these various acts of appropriation and reclaiming of averse forms, a kind of, um, no nostalgia, uh, rather, uh, there's a sense that all of these forms are simply available.

Speaker 1:          29:20          They should be part of a poet's tool kit. Uh, and, and this is, I'm also part of, uh, what is, um, well Auden's, uh, presentation of himself as a kind of expert, uh, as a poet with expertise, with expertise in the language. And all of this is part of, in his early poetry, what you would have to call his precocious adultness. Uh, his knowingness, uh, which is again, connected to his will to tell the truth, uh, uh, uh, to tell the truth unclouded by sentiment. Uh, the, the, uh, the early on and the odd that we see in those photographs, he's remarkably cool, uh, in all senses. Uh, this is a cool poet. Uh, uh, James Merrill, a poet, um, uh, who was a friend of Arden's, uh, and, and, uh, uh, influenced by him and, and, uh, many ways once remarked, uh, that, um, all of the Auden's poems were written on paper on which the tears had dried. Uh, and, uh, that's an evocative idea. Uh, it's important, first of all, uh, that yes, those tiers have dried. Uh, but it's also important that there were tears, uh, and both of these, uh, our, our properties of, of the palms and they make on a special kind of love poet. Uh, let's look at, uh, the early palm. Uh, this lunar beauty, uh, which is, uh, on seven 87,

Speaker 2:          31:15          uh, yeah,

Speaker 1:          31:19          this lunar beauty has no history is complete in early. If beauty later bear any feature, it had a lover and is another, this like a dream, this love that I experienced and right up and out of keeps other time. It's lunar and day time is the loss of this for time is inches. And the heart's changes where ghost has haunted, lost and wanted.

Speaker 2:          32:00          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          32:00          but this was never a ghost endeavor nor finished. This was ghosted ease until it passed. Love shall not near the sweetness here. North sorrow take his endless look. Uh, contrast this poem, uh, two closely related palm heart cranes voyages, uh, palm of extravagant, uh, rhetoric. Uh, here. Uh, uh, Arden is not writing. I ambig pentameter. He's writing. What is the meter here? Demeter, uh, there are two beats line. You can't have a line that's much shorter and have it be align or a meter. Uh, it, it's really the innocence, the smallest, uh, measure can a meter can sustain. There is in the poem a kind of formal rhetoric reticence, uh, and what is proclaimed as endless here is not love but sorrow. A sorrows look, uh, and, and sorrow is personified. They're in the position of the poet, uh, looking at the beloved already in a sense, looking back at him, uh, a lunar beauty. Let's turn a few pages forward to seven 90 and read another, uh, of Auden's love poms, um, closely related. Lay your sleeping head. My love human on my faithless arm. Time and fevers burn away. Individual beauty from thoughtful children and the grave proves the child of femoral. But in my arms till break of day, let the living creature lie mortal guilty. But to me the entirely beautiful

Speaker 1:          34:14          certainty fidelity on the stroke of midnight pass.

Speaker 2:          34:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:19          They always do. There were bound to like vibrations of a bell and fashionable. Madmen raised their pedantic boring cry. Every farthing of the cost. All the dreaded cards foretell shall be paid. But from this night, not a whisper, not a thought, not a kiss, nor look, be lost. You're going to have to pay for it. But here it is and it is now. And to be celebrated, beauty, midnight vision dies. Let the winds of dawn that blow softly round you're dreaming head such a day of sweetness, show I am knocking heart, may bless. Find the mortal world enough. Nunes of dryness. See you fed by the involuntary powers. Knights of insult, let you pass watched by every human love here again, love is seen in the secularizing light of certain future betrayal and loss. Uh, to be living here is to be mortal and guilty. Uh, to love is to be sure that you will be faithless, uh, that is to love fully, fully, uh, and so to know love and beauty entirely and in their entirety is, uh, to know them in the knowledge of time, uh, to know precisely that loves passing, uh, time here is not so much a kind of emblem of human inconstancy, uh, but rather have something like natural law, uh, to which everyone is subject.

Speaker 1:          36:31          Uh, this is the theme of the, uh, very great poem written in the popular ballot form, uh, with, uh, this title and Odense collected palms as I walked out one evening on seven 93. Uh, yeah, as I walked out one evening walking down Bristol Street, the crowds upon the pavement, we're fields of harvest week and down by the [inaudible] River, I heard a lover sing under an arch of the railway. And here is his song. Love has no ending. I'll love you dear. I love you till China and Africa meat and the river jumps over the mountain and salmon singing the street. I'll love you til the ocean is folded and hung up to dry. And the seven stars go squawking like geese about the sky. The year she'll run like rabbits free in my arms. I hold the flower of the ages and the first love of the world.

Speaker 2:          37:45          Okay,

Speaker 1:          37:46          have you ever said that? And someone said that to you.

Speaker 2:          37:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:53          But all the clocks in the city began to were in time and they say, oh, let not time to see view. You cannot conquer time in the boroughs of the nightmare. We're justice. Naked is time. Watches from the window and coughs when you would kiss in headaches and, and worry vaguely. Life leaks away and time. We'll have his fancy tomorrow or today into many. A Green Valley drifts. The appalling snow time breaks the threaded dances and the divers. Brilliant bow. Oh, plunge your hands in water. Plunge them in up to the wrist. Stare, stare in the base and in wonder what you've missed. The glacier knocks in the cupboard, the desert size and the bed and the crack and the tea cup opens a lane to the land of the dead where the beggars raffle, the bank notes and the giant isn't chanting to Jack. And the lily white boy is a roar and Jill goes down on our back, oh, look, look in the mirror. Go look in your distress. Life remains a blessing. Although you cannot bless, oh, stand, stand at the window as the tiers scald and start. You shall love your crooked neighbor with your crooked heart.

Speaker 1:          39:39          It was late, late in the evening. The lovers, they were gone. The clocks had ceased. Their timing and the deep river ran on a, this is a ballad, uh, on choice of it suggests, uh, uh, that the song form is conveying popular common wisdom. Something we all know. Uh, it's expressing truth as a kind of commonplace, uh, that is shared. Like the tune itself. Uh, truth is not an elite knowledge. It's something that's out there, uh, in the street and it touches all of us, uh, in common. Uh, there are here in the palm, um, two distinct voices in quotation marks, first the lovers, and then the voice of time of the clocks, uh, the lover. When he speaks. Well, the poem seems to say seems to acknowledge he's lying even if he doesn't know it or mean it. And yet the poem still allows him his truth, his say, uh, what it does really is it framed his truth with this other larger truth, which is times truth uttered by the clocks and the clocks speak from the point of view of disenchantment. The lover cannot wash his hands. Uh, uh, the palm gives us a kind of image of primary sinfulness. Again, how different from Steven's, uh, uh, ordinary life here is, uh, haunted by disrupted by elemental forces. Uh, the glacier knocks in the cupboard.

Speaker 1:          41:50          The domestic includes tragic and uncanny dimensions. Uh, they return like repressed parts of the psyche in the palm, uh, and still, uh, there is a kind of constellation in view in that ambiguous promise or command that you and I will love each other are, are crooked hearts will meet. Uh, there's a sense in which people are bound to each other precisely, uh, by the circumstances that the poem describes in, by the crookedness of their hearts, uh, at the end. Then, uh, the lovers and the clocks are all gone, both, uh, and the river runs on. There's that last stanza, uh, poetry in Auden, uh, speaks on behalf of a necessity, a necessity that frames what we do and think a necessity that determines the circumstances within which we make our moral choices. Uh, in this way. Auden like bishop who will, will read next week, uh, is a poet, a constantly drawing our attention to matters of perspective, uh, how things are seeing how things are framed, what the context of any given, uh, uh, point of view, uh, or utterance or action is, uh, what is true and what is right from one point of view may not be from another.

Speaker 1:          43:41          And this is, this is part of the principle by which often comes to in fact revise, uh, and, uh, make, uh, decisions about his, his own work. Uh, that involves censoring, um, his, uh, uh, his, uh, his own language. Uh, the, the great poem, uh, about this, uh, theme, uh, that is, uh, the, uh, way in which our knowledge and action is a determined and bounded by the perspectives, uh, uh, in which it is viewed in which it takes place. The great poem on this theme is a music day. Bows are, um, is, uh, also a poem that we'll have to, um, uh, wait to talk about it until Monday when we will, uh, talk about it, uh, in connection with the almost contemporaneous poem in memory of WB Yeats.
