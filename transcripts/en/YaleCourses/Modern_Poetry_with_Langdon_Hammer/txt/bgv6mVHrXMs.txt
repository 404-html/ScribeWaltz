Speaker 1:          00:01          Frost was his born in, in 1879, I think, uh, Hart Crane and 1899 representing almost another generation from frost. Uh, Auden was born in 1906, uh, bishop in 1911. Uh, she, she's the latest, the youngest, uh, in our syllabus, you know, almost, uh, almost two generations a distant from, from Robert Frost. Uh, when I was a freshman at Yale in 1976 in April, um, uh, Elizabeth Bishop came to read it, you know, she, um, uh, she's in a sense, you know, part of a, uh, a part of our world in a way that the, uh, uh, poets that we've been reading really aren't quite, she was good friends with, uh, uh, John Hollander. Uh, Penelope, Lauren's on our faculty, Sandy McClatchy and others. Uh, she, uh, filled the art gallery, Lecture Hall, uh, you know, 400 people. Um, uh, and this is at a moment, interestingly, when she was not yet at the height of her fame, uh, she, uh, she would, uh, uh, become by the end of the century, a figure as prominent as often read and widely read and esteemed, uh, as any of the poets we've been reading, uh, which is, uh, a remarkable, uh, event in literary culture because, uh, bishop would have seemed to herself and to others, uh, through the course of most of her career, uh, as an interesting poet, uh, but as, uh, uh, but not as a major figure a inch.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Surely she was herself uncomfortable with that kind of stature. Uh, she was, I think it's fair to say excruciating by public, uh, occasions, including this one that I'm referring to. Listen to her read. I think there, there are some recordings of her on, um, uh, the, uh, center for language study. A website, uh, bishop has a, a kind of, um, uh, exaggeratedly ordinary voice, uh, in the sense of very private voice that she was willing to, uh, put on stage, uh, but always, only uncomfortably. So, uh, in this particular reading I'm remembering, uh, she, uh, she had read for about 20 minutes and then, uh, uh, uh, looked across the stage with these 400 people in of her, uh, at her hosts a Penelope Lawrence. Is that enough penny? Uh, she said, uh, and of course people wanted a lot more and a lot more of her, uh, but she was reluctant to give it a and uncomfortable giving it.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Um, bishop in a sense, uh, belongs to, um, poetry after modern poetry, poetry after modernism. And you know, uh, in September I'm going to give a lecture course, uh, on poetry after 1950 and we'll start with bishop and pay a lot more attention to her than we have room to do in this course. But, uh, bishop belongs to, uh, in, uh, any history of, uh, modern poetry. Uh, and she provides a con I think an important end point, um, to the work that we've been doing together. Uh, she provides a, in a sense, a kind of a extension of, of, um, a certain strains of, of modern poetry and a, and also at the same time, a kind of critique of them. Uh, Bishop went to Vassar, uh, and, uh, she, um, uh, was, uh, on the literary magazine there. Uh, and, uh, in 1929, I think, uh, she interviewed the, uh, important guests, uh, on the campus.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Tsl, yet, uh, you, you, I would have liked to have been in the room. Uh, she, she wrote, um, uh, well I guess what I want to highlight is the fact that what bishop was in college reading Eliot and having Elliot visit, uh, uh, when, uh, she's being, when she's really forming herself as a writer, uh, uh, she wrote a paper for one of her courses called dimensions of the novel. Uh, and, uh, this essay, um, involved a reading of it Elliot's essay tradition in the individual talent, which you've read in which we've talked about. Uh, bishop liked it. She was interested in it, uh, in her, uh, account, uh, of the way in which she uses Elliot. Uh, uh, she, um, uh, accents certain aspects, uh, of his ideas and, and downplays others. Let me quote from that essay. Uh, she says this is on your handout, a constant process of adjustment. And that's Elliot's word adjustment, uh, is going on about the past. Every ingredient dropped into it from the present must the whole, you remember Elliot writing about that in tradition and there was little talent where he talks about how the new work, uh, sh reshapes everything that's gone before. Now, what Mr Elliot says about the sequence of works of art, uh, in a tradition in history, and this is bishops extension of Elliot's idea, seems to be equally true of the sequence of events or even of pages or paragraphs in a novel.

Speaker 1:          06:31          But I know of no novel that makes use of this constant readjustment among the members of any sequence. So what bishops doing is applying Elliot's idea of, of sequence in tradition to the way in which a literary work might itself unfold. That is where every, uh, as it were, new moment, uh, in a novel here, she's talking about a novel, uh, affects a kind of readjustment of what's gone on before. Uh, it is as she's imagining it, um, a literary form in which there is a kind of continual, um, reorientation required by both reader and writer. Uh, she, um, uh, uh, takes over specifically that that phrase constant readjustment, uh, uh, identifies this as a kind of a poetics if you will. Uh, this is really a, an important idea in modern poetry generally. And, and you could, you could look at Elliot's own poetry in, for example, Prufrock, uh, as exemplifying something of what bishop is describing that is a, a poem that unfolds disclosing at every point, new principles of order, uh, and perspective.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Uh, it's an idea that that, uh, uh, is, is in that sense central to modern poetry, but bishop takes it and she pushes it in her own work much further. Uh, she creates in her poetry a radically relative point of view. Uh, that is adjusted to a kind of metamorphic and decentered world as she sees it. A, a world that is living in change. Uh, that phrase, uh, you, you might remember from the very end of a primitive, like an orb. A Stevens is great late poem. Uh, and bishop is in many ways a Stevens Indian poet, a poet of, of change, constant change, uh, but significantly in bishop's imagination. As in Odense, there are no Steve NZ and giants. No, no. Uh, major man, no large men reading, uh, the poet in bishop's poetry describes the world rather than creates it. Uh, the, the, the poet is not like God, uh, as, uh, the poet is in Steven's.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Yeah, the poet is much more like an ordinary person, a woman on stage, uh, in a skirt, uh, uh, speaking, uh, uncomfortably if he like to a large audience in an ordinary voice. Her poetry is in fact full of ordinary people. Uh, and this links her to frost. Uh, there are, well, generally a few, uh, uh, oh, uh, oh, emblematic or architectural figures such as you find in Yates or, or in Morris poetry or often, uh, for that matter in Auden's, uh, there is in bishop a really know sublime, uh, no, um, no [inaudible], uh, assent, uh, out of the foul rag and bone shop of the heart. Uh, there's no cranium verticality, uh, no, uh, uh, you know, Icarus like a scent of the sky. Instead, uh, bishops, poetics of description are what I would call a kind of horizontal poetics, uh, that moves laterally, that is earthbound and is concerned with in a sense, this is her primary recurrent trope mapping the world, uh, giving an account of the earth surface. Uh, uh, it's a perceptual poetics that she's concerned with, uh, something she calls geography or sometimes travel. The, uh, poem that really inaugurate bishops, uh, mature writing, uh, and that she placed first in her, uh, first, uh, volume of poetry north and south, uh, and that subsequently it's placed first in all, uh, collected volumes of her poems is the poem called the map. Uh, it's a kind of preface to or work, uh, and it's an inevitable place to start, uh, thinking about her. Uh, so let's look at it together.

Speaker 1:          11:50          Uh, poem written in, um, uh, I believe, uh, at least begun a new years eve. Uh, 1933, uh, as Bishop, um, uh, left college. Maybe you seniors, we'll write your own map next year. Um, she, uh, uh, didn't collect it in a book until 1946 a which has her, her first book publication, uh, like Steven's like frost. Uh, she's, uh, uh, slow to, uh, gather her her first poems. The poem begins with a, a marvelous, uh, uh, limpid clarity land lies in water. It has shadowed green shadows, or are they shallows at its edges, showing the line of long seaweed ledges where weeds hang to the simple blue from green, or does the land leaned down to lift the seat from under drawing. It unperturbed around itself along the Fine Tan Sandy Shelf is the land tugging at the sea from under, it's a deceptively declarative flat voice, a voice of description.

Speaker 1:          13:28          Uh, it is interestingly impersonal and intimate at once. Uh, it's as if, uh, uh, we were so close to her, she need not introduce herself. We are invited to look over her shoulder with her at the map. Uh, she doesn't, as I say, introduce herself or her subject really here. Uh, she just starts, uh, the poem represents itself as happening now, uh, as if it were recording the mind in action. A process, an action of perception. Uh, the poem was gathered first for publication by Marianne Moore, who was a bishop's friend and mentor, uh, described a friendship described in, uh, bishops long, beautiful, funny memoir efforts of affection that I asked you to read when we were reading more. Uh, an essay that tells you a lot about more, but also tells you a lot about bishop, uh, more, uh, as her mentor gathered this. And three, two, excuse me, two other poems.

Speaker 1:          14:45          Uh, and, um, uh, had it published in a volume in which an older poet, a younger, uh, as a, uh, teacher or mentor, uh, would, uh, present a protege, uh, more says about bishops pumps. A number of interesting things I've sampled. Uh, just these sentences on your handout. Some authors do not muse within themselves, but by contrast, bishop does, they, they, those other authors think like the vegetable shredder, which cuts into the life of thing. Ms. Bishop is not one of these friendly, intensive machines. Yet the rational considering quality in her work is its strength. The rational considering quality, assisted by unworthiness, uncontested intentional and the Nis phrases that only Mary and could have produced. Uh, the flicker of impedance, the natural unforced ending, uh, these are are, are important, uh, qualities of, of bishops writing. Um, uh, although to, um, highlight them is to risk of sort of misperception.

Speaker 1:          16:06          That is if bishop presents herself as a kind of rational considering intelligence in these poems. Um, what she very rapidly uncovers, uh, is um, uh, fantasy, uh, and uh, the fantastic, uh, or fabulous or metaphorical, uh, just so her poetry of precip perception and description rather than, um, uh, uh, giving us a kind of poetics of objectivity that we might associate with pound and images. And, uh, very quickly, uh, turns back on the perceiving subject to ask questions about the process of perception itself into suddenly become a poetry, very much about subjectivity. Uh, you can see this going on already, uh, in, um, uh, the lines that I've quoted here, uh, uh, bishop no sooner says one thing. Uh, then, uh, she elaborates it, uh, or questions that, uh, shadows or are they shallows? She says, uh, she is formulated one idea and then she asks a question about it.

Speaker 1:          17:25          And then a further question about that, uh, this is, uh, uh, uh, very much, uh, in image a poetics of a mind in action, a mind thinking, uh, that is the, the drama, uh, that bishop shares with us. Uh, in another, um, uh, early, uh, statement this in a, um, a letter to a poet Donald Stanford. She quotes, uh, a literary critic on Baroque that is a 17th century prose which she liked. Uh, and, and this quotation is also on your handout. Uh, there, that is the writers of Brooke Pros. Their purpose was to portray not a thought, but in mind thinking they knew that an idea is separated from the act of experiencing. It is not the idea that was experienced. The ardor of its conception in the mind. That's my misprint isn't necessary. Part of its truth. The order of the conception in the mind is, uh, what bishop wants.

Speaker 1:          18:39          Uh, ardor that's an important word. It suggests a passion, a certain amount of heat, uh, emotion and heart. Um, in bishop's case, this ardor is communicated sometimes through the deceptively, uh, cool manner of self interrogation. Uh, and in particular through the grammatical form of the question, uh, here, uh, in this very first paragraph of her poetry, uh, bishop is asking questions. Uh, there's a kind of level of clarity and detail in her observations, uh, that makes what she's looking at. Interestingly, unstable and uncertain. She turns back on it, ask questions about it. You could contrast, uh, uh, bishops questions with Yates is great rhetorical questions. Uh, a, uh, a, a form that we, we, uh, uh, stressed in, in reading later in the swan and other, uh, late Yates poems. Uh, in general, uh, thinking about, uh, bishops relationship to Yates, you could say that romance quest, which is this, you know, essential structure that's, uh, uh, behind all of Yates as poetry romance quest has come down in bishop to the act of asking questions, uh, raising questions, uh, here in this poem, uh, and very frequently and other bishop poems question specifically about boundaries, about the way in which we categorize a and frame the world, uh, how we, uh, draw lines, uh, and, uh, separate and connect things at the same time.

Speaker 1:          20:45          Uh, as we do, one thing seems to turn into, uh, another, uh, opposites interact, uh, uh, opposites are involved. Uh, and notice the, the pair of opposites that she's, uh, stressing here. Land and water. These are our primary categories that are poetry centers itself. On, over and over again. Bishop is a poet of the seashore. Uh, there are, uh, uh, poems, uh, throughout her career that station themselves on the beach. Uh, in particular, uh, a place of, uh, um, unstable, uh, uncertain, dynamic boundary. Uh, you can see the same kind of play of a similarity and difference, uh, between terms in bishop's poetry on a formal level already working here in this first stands, uh, uh, it is rhymed poetry isn't it? Uh, but what an interesting set of rhymes. Uh, green edges ledges green, uh, under itself shelf under, uh, these are our rhymes were uh, uh, it seems as though words are a little too close together.

Speaker 1:          22:15          If they're repeated green or maybe a little too far apart, uh, in the second stanza, then, uh, the rhyme scheme gives way entirely. This is, and this is like bishop to set up one pattern and then drop it. The shadow of Newfoundland lies flat and still Labradors yellow where the Mooney Eskimo has oiled it. We can stroke these lovely bays under a glass if they were expected to blossom or as if to provide a clean cage for invisible fish. The names of seashore towns run out to see the names of cities cross the neighboring mountains. The printer here experiencing the same excitement as when emotion too far exceeds its cause.

Speaker 2:          23:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:10          These peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger, like women feeling for the smoothness of yard goods.

Speaker 2:          23:22          Then

Speaker 1:          23:23          the rhyme scheme returns. Uh, and again, it's a peculiar one that includes, uh, not just a rhyme, but a repetition of, of, uh, particular words. Mapped waters, she says are more quiet than the land is lending. The late the waves, excuse me, lending the land, their waves own con formation in Norway's hair runs south and agitation profiles, investigate the sea where land is,

Speaker 1:          23:59          are they assigned or Ken, the country's pick their colors. What suits the character or the native waters. Best typography displays. No favorites. North's as near as west, more delicate than the historians are. The map makers colors. Uh, it's a, a poetry like aspects of Yeats, like aspects of Moore's, uh, that presents itself with a, uh, a kind of, um, resolute, uh, uh, um, clarity and simplicity of lucidity, of, of, um, uh, language that sometimes seems to feel, uh, like pros. Uh, there is a lyric power here, uh, but it's got app, um, through, uh, uh, language, uh, again, um, uh, close to that of ordinary life as bishop, uh, observes the boundaries that she's talking about here, the sea and the shore. She's also concerned with another set of opposed terms in ones that will follow her throughout her poetry. And that is the difference between the real and representation and the ways in which representation that which is represented can take on a certain kind of reality itself. Uh, as, uh, she fancifully allows, uh, the, um, uh, forms of the map to do here. Uh, the map really becomes a world and, uh, not only a representation of it and the poet plunges really imaginatively into it

Speaker 1:          26:09          takes us with her and she does a entering the versions of life that it suggests to her.

Speaker 2:          26:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:18          In that third stanza there though, as she returns to that peculiar rhyme scheme, there's a certain kind of, um, uh, holding back, a gathering of her intelligence, uh, and reflection on the process, uh, that she's been engaged in. What emerges there is a kind of key idea. The one I've already mentioned, geography or topography here. Uh, geography, topography, they display no favorites. They represent a, a poetics, uh, uh, that is non hierarchical in its orientation. And again, this is the link to more, uh, bishop is interested in a point of view that takes no sides, uh, except to suggest to insist on the relativity of all cognitive categories north as near as west. It always is, right? Uh, that is, it's as near to the perceiver whose perspective is constantly shifting, constantly readjusted. Uh, I talked about perspectivism in, in Arden. Uh, well, uh, bishop, uh, has, um, uh, has a hold of the same idea a and we'll make it even more central, make it more thematically central to her work.

Speaker 1:          27:52          Then even on, uh, uh, the, um, um, opposition that she ends with a, is the one between the historian and the map maker. Uh, she presents herself here clearly on the side of the mapmaker one whose colors, colors of rhetoric, uh, are more delicate then the historians. And on the side of the historian, who could we place perhaps Yates, perhaps pound, perhaps Elliot, uh, certainly, uh, uh, bishops. Great Contemporary Robert Lowell, uh, bishop presents herself as, uh, engaged in a poetics of geography and of map making, uh, that is more delicate than that of the historian in that word delicacy. Uh, there is certainly, um, uh, some, um, uh, uh, implication, uh, of gender, um, the opposition between the map maker in the historian, well, it would be too simple to, uh, uh, call it an opposition between a woman and a man. Uh, and yet, um, uh, gendered terms, our, our, our, uh, uh, they're in bishops language. I think, uh, this poem, uh, as I suggested is composed in 1933, uh, after, uh, bishop has, has left Vassar, has, uh, made friends with more, uh, who, uh, uh, will be a central figure in her life. Uh, if in some sense, emotion

Speaker 2:          29:51          might, uh,

Speaker 1:          29:53          exceed its cause, uh, might lead bishop to get carried away. Uh, there were lots of reasons why this might be so, uh, bishop,

Speaker 2:          30:08          uh,

Speaker 1:          30:10          grew up, uh, at first, uh, in Nova Scotia.

Speaker 2:          30:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:15          Uh, she is a Canadian poet as much as an American pot poet, uh, uh, of uncertain national identity. You might say, uh, her father died when I believe she was five. Uh, her mother, uh, in grief, um, went mad, uh, and was, uh, institutionalized, uh, and bishop was separated from her so that she grew up very much as I'm an orphan,

Speaker 2:          30:46          okay.

Speaker 1:          30:47          Uh, much has been made of her biography. Um, I wouldn't encourage you to, um, because, uh, bishop herself, uh, treats it, um, uh, as a, uh, an important frame resonance for her poetry, but not as a rule a as its subject. Uh, there is, I think simply the important point to be made that, uh, here is a poet who grew up, uh, with, uh, certain primary sense of dislocation and disorientation in an acute sense of divided identity, uh, uh, biographical facts that in a sense lead us very quickly, uh, into the ethical and cognitive problems that, that are central to, um, uh, bishops work. And, and, and I think, uh, to this problem in particular,

Speaker 2:          31:47          how do you

Speaker 1:          31:48          hold yourself together?

Speaker 2:          31:51          Uh, it's, it's a, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          31:54          it's an important one, a and one that we all in various ways struggle with, uh, bishop fines, various ways to raise that question, to figure it and explore it. Uh, one early amusing, uh, and suggestive, uh, instance, uh, is the poem called the gentlemen of Shalott. Uh, and I'd like to look at that with you to, um, uh, get a little more sense of bishops poetics and some, uh, uh, sense of her early self conception as a poet. Uh, remember the idea that she's taken from Elliott, she wants imagine a kind of writing, uh, that would include time in it. That would include change in it, uh, in which the organization of the whole would be constantly subject to readjustment. Uh, a text

Speaker 1:          32:55          that would incorporate flux, uh, a text that would be determined locally rather than by some, uh, global, uh, and, uh, general perspective. Uh, the, I think, um, unstable orders of a poem like Prufrock are important for bishop and that Prufrock is in fact a figure behind, uh, this one of bishops. The gentlemen of Shalott a bishop's character is a kind of dandy, like Prufrock. Um, bishop is also at the same time playing with Tennyson. Uh, and his poem, the Lady of Shalott, a kind of gender switch has, has occurred, uh, in bishop's poem. Uh, what does it mean? Uh, well, I'll leave you to ponder it. Uh, but I think that one way to understand her, her joke here, uh, I'm not going to write about the lady of Shalott. I'm going to write about the gentlemen of Shallot. Uh, uh, one way to understand her joke here, uh, is to suggest that this poem is in part about what it means for bishop to be a woman poet. Uh, and it implies that, uh, that meant for her a certain kind of gender switch, a sex change, uh, and one that might, uh, introduce a certain amount of stress, uh, as well as comedy. Uh, well, uh, let's, uh, uh, let's listen to some of it, uh, which eyes his eye,

Speaker 1:          34:38          which limb lies next to the mirror.

Speaker 1:          34:42          Her joke is that the gentleman of Shalott, like the Lady of Shalott, it's fixated on a mirror, but the mirror that, uh, uh, is, um, uh, in place here is one that, uh, as she'll describe it goes down the body splits. This figure creates a kind of divided figure, uh, which limb lies next. The Mirror for neither is clearer nor a different color than the other, nor meets a stranger in this arrangement of leg, in leg and arm. And so on. To his mind, it's the indication of a mirrored reflection. Somewhere along the line of what we call the spine, he felt in modesty his person was half looking glass for why should he be doubled? The glass miss stretched down his middle or rather down the edge. But he's in doubt as to which sides in or out of the mirror. There's little margin for error, but there's no proof either.

Speaker 1:          35:56          And if half his heads reflected, thought he thinks might be effected, uh, this is poetry that presents itself as light verse. Uh, in that way it's again, like much of early Aaden. Uh, and yet it is a poem that is secretly very serious. Uh, the, uh, uh, well, much of the lightness as well as the seriousness of the poem, uh, depends on its formal organization. Uh, these lines are well, aren't they? About half as long as, uh, a normative line of poetry and they're rhymed. Uh, but they're rhymed and in a most interesting and playful way. In fact, the poem has a lot of play in it. Uh, the pleasure that it gives is a one of a certain mild exhilaration and uncertainty of a pattern that includes, and that in fact tolerates or even generates dramatic change in line length and surprising rhymes. Uh, the gentleman is in a sense trying to hold himself together.

Speaker 1:          37:11          Uh, the idea is repeated by the poet trying to hold her lines together, uh, in rhymed couplets. Uh, bishop is in general, a very interesting poet, technically, uh, here as elsewhere. How relaxed, how unpretentiously a casual, uh, uh, how disorienting Lee casual, even the voices, uh, there isn't here or elsewhere in bishop frosts. Tension between speech and meter, uh, rather, as in this case, each keeps getting adjusted to the other. Uh, it's important. There's almost no blank verse. No, I am back pentameter in Bishop. She, uh, the canonical heroic meter doesn't appear here, uh, accept I think possibly in, in one or two examples. There are in Bishop, uh, free verse poems. There's meter and rhyme. Uh, there are often a poem poems that move in and out of these forms much as the map begins in rhyme, moves out of rhyme and returns to rhyme.

Speaker 1:          38:28          Uh, the poems don't seek more is highly idiosyncratic, crafted formal, uh, uh, instead, bishops practice is probably closest to Arden's who's got a form for every occasion form for every purpose. But Auden's forms are always in a sense, preset drawn from an existing repertoire. What is right for this occasion, a ballad. I will do a ballot, a assessed Dena, um, uh, Ella Jaic quatrains, uh, et cetera. Uh, that's, uh, the way in which Auden presents himself, uh, and od adheres strictly to his forms. Uh, uh, and he uses those forums to shape and interpret the occasions of his writing. In bishop's case, it's really just the other way around. Uh, what she does is, uh, uh, all to her forms under the pressure of the occasions of her writing her purpose and subject. Nothing in Bishop is preset. Everything is provisional. Uh, in the process of being remade, uh, uh, in a process of constant readjustment, uh, on a technical level as well as on the perceptual level, uh, that I began by talking about, um, this is, uh, uh, a vision really of what the world is like and how writing might, uh, respond to it.

Speaker 1:          40:03          All of these things are going on in this little poem. Um, uh, the, the gentleman of a Shallot, uh, and, and, uh, with, uh, a sense of, of comedy. If the glass slips, he's in a fix only one leg, et cetera. But while it stays put

Speaker 1:          40:24          so long as we accept this provisional arrangement, he can walk and run and his hands can clasp one another. The uncertainty, he says he finds exhilarating. He loves. And here's that phrase from the essay on on Elliot, that sense of constant readjustment. He wishes to be quoted as saying at present half is enough, a kind of motto that Bishop might have adopted to let's look, uh, uh, at, uh, another version of this figure. Um, a, uh, uh, this time not a person, uh, but, uh, a creature. Uh, and uh, I mean specifically the Sandpiper, uh, who, uh, uh, appears, uh, in, uh, a much later book,

Speaker 3:          41:20          uh,

Speaker 1:          41:21          questions of travel, uh, from, uh, a book written largely in the 1950s and early 1960s. Sandpiper is on page one 31.

Speaker 1:          41:34          Uh, again, uh, it is a poem that takes place on the shore instead of the gentleman of Shalott, uh, uh, in his, uh, um, a fussy way, uh, and yet practical way, um, uh, getting along in the world, we are introduced to a finicky bird. The roaring alongside he takes for granted. And that every so often the world is bound to shake. He runs, he runs to the south finical, awkward in a sense of controlled panic. A student of Blake, uh, another poem that is stationed on a shifting boundary. The boundary of the tide, uh, bishop is engaged here in a kind of playful, active, uh, revision of the Visionary Innocence celebrated by William Blake. Uh, I, uh, a quote the lines on your handout that, that a bishop is referring to, to see a world in a grain of sand. This is the beginning of auguries of innocence in heaven, in a wildflower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.

Speaker 1:          43:02          Uh, well, uh, here bishop is sort of playfully thing. Uh, well what kind of figure is, is really Blakey and what kind of figure wants to see the world in a grain of sand? Well, a Sandpiper, uh, looking for his food. The beach hisses like fat on his left, a sheet of interrupting water comes and goes and glazes over his dark and brittle feet. He runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes watching rather. And this is again bishop correcting her proceeding by correcting her perception, watching rather the spaces of sand between them where no detail too small. And again, the Sandpiper like the poet is focused on detail. The Atlantic drains rapidly backwards and downwards as he runs. He stares at the dragging grains. The world is a mist and then the world is vast. In my newt and clear, the tide is higher or lower. He couldn't tell you which north as near as west, his beak is focused. He is preoccupied looking for something, something something poor bird. He is obsessed. The millions of grains are black, white, Tan and gray mixed with quartz grains, rose and

Speaker 1:          44:36          the poem Zone Structure Shifts, uh, interestingly, uh, in terms of its, uh, line lanes, uh, uh, and uh, bishops ways of using in jam or end stopped lines. Uh, the world is well, uh, uh, the world is a place of vast forces, a of roaring of missed, uh, and yet it's also a minute, uh, and clear all of these things at once or in succession. Uh, the bird's perspective, uh, uh, can't tell us whether the tide is higher or lower. Uh, because he is as it were in the picture. He's always wherever it is. Uh, it is, uh, a position again, of constant readjustment.

Speaker 1:          45:34          What is he looking for? Something, something, something, uh, uh, calculatedly vague word, a word that we see frost using in for once then something. Uh, instead of moving here towards generalization, the palm moves towards more detail towards the list, a series finally of colors, simply, uh, uh, in a sense bishop moves away from the black and white to other shades, uh, uh, shades that involve combinations of colors. Uh, the, uh, uh, the question is really how can the world be seen serially? How can it be be made? How can it be seen as a series of perceptions and yet able to cohere? Uh, this is, this is a fundamental question of, of bishops poetry. It is, as it were, the compliments of the question. How can you hold yourself together? Well, how can you hold the world together? How can you hold the world that you perceive together? Uh, bishops. A great poem on this subject, uh, is the travel poem over 2000 illustrations and a complete concordance, which I promise to talk about on Monday.
