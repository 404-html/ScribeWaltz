Speaker 1:          00:12          I imagine that you all have images of Robert Frost and actual images in your mind. Uh, when you, uh, when you, when you think of this, this poet, he's a familiar face in American literature, uh, and I gathered some of them that seemed representative, uh, here, here is, this is frost and old age as an American barred from a magazine. Uh, this is, this is the frost that you probably know as if he were born with white hair, right? Uh, and, uh, uh, kind of, uh, well, kindly, uh, and, uh, monumental, uh, and yet approachable a figure, uh, that, uh, is familiar from American school rooms. Uh, here's a, another image of that Same Guy, Robert Frost, painted by Grandma Cox, uh, uh, reminding us of, of frost as a kind of linked to 19th century life, uh, to, uh, to rural Vermont. Uh, another, uh, another image of froth.

Speaker 1:          01:19          This one from the time it's just a little story. Uh, President Hails Bond with Frost. That president would be John F. Kennedy, uh, on TV. He extols poet who calls new frontier, age of poetry and power. Uh, and perhaps you have seen images of, of frost reading his poem, the gift outright at Kennedy's inauguration. Uh, it was a kind of powerful moment in American culture where, uh, the president allied himself with poetry, uh, in this way, uh, oh, more pictures. This is, you know, Frost with grandchildren, frost with his pet calves. He was kind to animals. Uh, uh, and if farmer, uh, this one I like, this is frost with a stick, uh, uh, for us or the branch. You can think about that. Uh, when you read Birches, uh, this is, uh, uh, you know, a frost boyish even in age, uh, for us, uh, who also likes to play and even who looks just a little bit, don't you think malevolent?

Speaker 1:          02:37          Uh, all of these images would seem to make for us, not a modern poet at all, not a modern poet in the sense that Elliot and pound established that is difficult poet in ways that I suggested last Wednesday, a poet resistant to ordinary language and common frames of Reference, uh, formerly innovative, disorienting or Bain metropolitan, I think of 19th century art as, as being horizontal. Uh, and, and, you know, stretched out, uh, uh, like a, a agricultural life in New England. Uh, and modernism is all about verticality. Uh, from a certain angle. This is the Stieglitz, uh, picture city of ambition. I showed you last, uh, last Wednesday, uh, another pairing, uh, this, this, uh, wonderful, uh, landscape by Martin Johnson heed and we could contrast it with, uh, these images of Brooklyn Bridge by Walker Evans, where even underneath the bridge, the bridge seems to, you know, a, a, a, a figure of crossing, uh, themes here to rise up, uh, and out of, um, uh, the, uh, the city and the river. Uh, this is, this is frost. Before he had white hair, a frost at, at 18, uh, which is I, I believe, uh, uh, 1892 or so,

Speaker 2:          04:16          uh,

Speaker 1:          04:18          boyish. And his, his first book, uh, is, is entitled a boys will, uh, uh, Boys Will Robert Frost. This is a cover of the first edition that you can go over to a key and see when you, when you open it up and look at the table of contents, you see, uh, titles of poems. Uh, and underneath those titles are little legends. Uh, and Moralization, uh, into my own title, uh, Legend. The youth is persuaded that he will be rather more than less himself. We're having forsworn the world, uh, or, uh, storm fear. He is afraid of his own isolation. Uh, uh, these, uh, these are our, our poems. In other words that, uh, uh, you know, come with, with little labels to tell you what they mean and what they're about

Speaker 2:          05:14          bout, uh,

Speaker 1:          05:19          modernism in Elliot and pound is in, in some ways is, is founded on expatriation on, on, on a kind of internationalism. Frost's poetry seems resolutely American or, uh, at any rate it seems to be there is in fact a another frost, a modern and modernist frost, a a frost that is in fact as international, uh, as pound. And Elliot, uh, who began his career, in fact, uh, beside them as a London ex patriot. This is, uh, this, this is more of a table of contents. You can see how it's laid out. Uh, this is, this is the frost who published that book. Uh, this is frost at 39, uh, frost. In a suit made by a London Taylor, uh, in London. Uh, and when we go to the title page of a boys, will we see that, uh, this, uh, New England poet publishes his first book, in fact, in London, uh, in 1913, uh, they're a new Oxford Street, interesting north of Boston.

Speaker 1:          06:38          Uh, a a great a book that follows a boys will, uh, uh, is, uh, it's, you know, is a, is a title that locates these poems in a specific place in, uh, northern New England. Uh, it to, uh, is published in London, uh, this time, uh, on Bloomsbury street. You don't really think of frost as part of Bloomsbury, do you? Uh, but there he is publishing his book, uh, in that place. Just like Prufrock, uh, also published I'm Bloomsbury Street, uh, this in 1917, uh, north of Boston in 1915, uh, you remember that table of contents page I showed you a moment ago with the titles and the moralization that a frost has, her boys will well, Uhm, here's the, here's the, the modernist table of contents of, of Prufrock. And of course you and we know, well, what would the legend for the love song of j l for Prufrock be?

Speaker 1:          07:48          He wanders around in a melancholy way quoting hamlet for, well, no, it, it, it, it, uh, uh, Elliot didn't do that. Uh, when we look at the table of contents of this book, which is north of Boston, well, it looks a lot like Elliot's, uh, those, those little tags that seem to explain the poetry, uh, have disappeared. And instead we simply have the titles of these very great poems mending wall, the death of the hired man, the mountain, uh, home burial. Uh, there's something, uh, in, in, uh, Elliot's the presentation of Elliot's work and indeed in the work itself that is a fronting resistant, uh, impersonal, uh, and the topography, the presentation of the book, uh, is part of that. Um, it, it's, it's part of, uh, Elliot's whole aesthetic, uh, but, uh, north of Boston. Well, you know, uh, when we start looking at these two books together, it seems to share some of the properties of Elliot's book. Uh, and indeed the poems that we find when we, um, opened that book, uh, also have, have things in common with Elliot's. The other frost, uh, not the simple, uh, familiar monumental frost. But the frost who is a modernist poet who begins writing in London, uh, is really quite as cosmopolitan, quite as learned, uh, as, as pounds and Elliot at this moment. Uh, and yet he uses his learning, uh, differently. He uses it very often by concealing it. In fact, well,

Speaker 1:          09:42          let me turn from

Speaker 1:          09:48          pictures to text on your handout today. The handout number two. Uh, we have, uh, well there's several quotations from a frosts letters. And, uh, let's look at the, the first one first, uh, for us says, uh, at the time that he's publishing a boys will, uh, to a friend. Uh, you mustn't take me too seriously. If I now proceed to brag a bit about my exploits as a poet. There was one qualifying fact always to bear in mind. There is a kind of success called of esteem and butters. No parsnips. Uh, it means a success with the critical few who are supposed to know, but really to arrive where I can stand on my legs as a poet and nothing else.

Speaker 1:          10:38          I must get outside that circle to the general reader who buys books and they're thousands. I may not be able to do that. I believe in doing it. Don't you doubt me there? I want to be a poet for all sorts and kinds. I could never make a merit of being caviar to the crowd the way my quasi friend pound does. I want to reach out and would, if I were a thing, I could do it. If it were a thing I could do by taking thought. Well, frost wishes to be so subtle as to seem all together obvious. It's not just that he seems obvious, but it's really subtle. Rather, his subtlety shows itself in his deliberate concealment of it, in the ways in which he masks himself and obviousness the problems that that Frost's poetry poses for us as, as readers are not problems of reference.

Speaker 1:          11:40          Uh, they can't be solved by footnotes. Compare the footnotes in the frost poems to the footnotes, uh, in, in the Norton that you find next to, uh, Elliot or, or Palms and the problems that frost poses are problems of interpretation, uh, problems that provoke you to ask not what does he mean exactly, uh, but how does he mean that, uh, is he joking or is he serious? Is there something on his mind that he's not saying the wonder of frost is, is really in his tone, his way of saying things without saying them in so many words. Now, uh, this guy, all of his, uh, because that's what it entails. This guile is something temperamental. I think it came naturally to him, but it also reflects a specific literary situation. The popular old fashioned frost in the elite modern frost. These roles point to a division in the audiences for poetry that emerges clearly in this period.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Uh, the, the frost to, uh, writes a familiar crafted lyric that would have been easily recognizable as poetry. Uh, and, and that we could give a little tag to after its title. Uh, well, contrast this with, um, uh, the poet of the wasteland, uh, say, uh, whose work, uh, would not have been recognizable to, uh, uh, many readers as poetry, uh, and indeed was not a PA. On one level, frost was spoke for and to, uh, in audience trained by the genteel poetry of late 19th century America readers who loved Longfellow, uh, the fireside poets, poets who published in Victorian popular magazines and wrote those guilt embossed books that, uh, cultured families kept behind glass bookcases and that you can still find at tag sales on a New England Greens. That's the obvious frost, the one that the subtle frost in many ways constructed, uh, aiming all the time, not at a general reader at all, but at an elite reader of the new tiny circulation little magazines where, uh, the work of Elliot Williams', Steven's Moore and others were first published.

Speaker 1:          14:21          Those magazines I showed you last week. Magazines like Broome or blast or a rogue or the criterion a frost. There's duplicity in Frost's poetry. Uh, and there's, uh, there's a certain doubleness in the, uh, um, uh, figured that he projects, uh, as a poet, uh, I like to think of his obsession with double meanings, which he has as, as a, as a way of responding to a division in culture between popular in elite readers, uh, uh, division that he saw as expressive of, um, uh, uh, division in American culture between well, money in esteem business and art. Uh, in that quotation I, I read for you a few moments ago, a frost opposes two kinds of success, one of esteem, uh, that success with the critical few that butter's no parsnips. You can see he brings in the kind of folksy term to, uh, well to what, to um, a disdain that kind of, uh, success or put it in its place.

Speaker 1:          15:38          And on the other hand, a success with the general reader who buys books in their thousands, uh, frost, one at both. The opposition is between poetry that makes money and poetry that precisely because it is good poetry is modern poetry defines it does not, uh, notice that the latter kind of poetry, the good kind that butter's note. No parsnips a is associated here with frost, quasi friend pound instead of butter pound rights caviar. Uh, but you know, it kind of a European thing, right? Uh, caviar, uh, by contrast a frost as declaring his ambition to reach out to a large audience. Uh, it is for frost, a frankly economic ambition by becoming a poet for all sorts in kines frost, intense as he says to arrive where I can stand on my legs as a poet and nothing else. Uh, this is this ambition for a career, but it's also a desire for personal autonomy for frost.

Speaker 1:          16:51          Poetry is invested with a, with a longing for autonomy and in well both simple and complex sense. Census. He wants to use poetry to stand on his own two legs. He sees it specifically. And this is important as a form of work that will allow him to be self sufficient. And self-determining frost was born in 1874 into a working family. Uh, his father's death when frost was a boy represented among other things in economic crisis for his family. Cross gluing was erratic. This is impressive. He dropped out of both Dartmouth and Harvard, uh, and he did so, uh, to take laboring jobs, uh, each time enacting a conflict between intellectual life and manual labor that would be a persistent and central theme of his poetry. He worked at all sorts of jobs, uh, in factories, a mill on a newspaper. He was a school teacher.

Speaker 1:          18:02          Uh, and of course he was a farmer too. Uh, when his grandfather gave him a farm to work, which he did for 10 years in Derry, New Hampshire. Uh, it's in fact at the end of this period that frost moved himself and his family to England, uh, in a last ditch bid to make literary contacts and advance his career as a poet. It was first in England that frost publish the books that established his reputation as the pasture poet of New England, a poet whose authority seemed to rest on his being rooted in his region once he returned to New England in 1916 after north of Boston success followed on success. Poetry was a way for frost out of manual labor, but it was also a form of work for frost that was opposed to manual labor. It was an escape from it, a way of transcending it, but also, uh, in many ways allied to it valuable because it could be a form of productive labor.

Speaker 1:          19:15          Something he could use to butter is parsnips. Uh, these concerns that I'm laying out all inform his poetry. Uh, they, they structure frosts work as a poet and his ongoing inquiry into that work. Frost poems perform a kind of phenomenology of work, of labor. They say what it is like to work at something in so doing, uh, they are always also brooding on what it is like to read and write poems. Uh, this is the case with mowing a, which is in your packet from Ras. Uh, and, uh, uh, is an example of one of these frosty and poems about work.

Speaker 1:          20:10          Let me read it for you. There was never a sound beside the wood but one and that was my long side whispering to the ground. What was it? It whispered. I knew not well myself. Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun, something perhaps about the lack of sound. And that was why I whispered and did not speak. It was no dream of the gift of idle hours or easy gold at the hand of Fay or Elf. Anything more than the truth would have seemed to week to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows, not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers, Pale, orchesis and scared a bright green snake. The fact is the sweetest dream that Labor knows my long side whispered and left the hey to make.

Speaker 1:          21:26          This is a, uh, a monologue by, uh, a worker, a mower, a, it is a sonnet to, to sort of song of song of a worker. Uh, notice that frost is interested at once in the presence of a sound, the sound of a solitary worker, uh, or to be more precise the sound of the tool of the worker. The sound is the sign of his work. And it raises a specifically a interpretive question. What is the message of the work that the man does? What does it, what is it saying and what is its meaning? What was it? It whispered.

Speaker 1:          22:29          The side is one of many tools in frost. I asked you to pay it tension to two tools in his, his poetry as you read it over the weekend to work in frost is to use a tool, tools mediate the worker's relation to the world. Uh, it's what the worker uses to do things and to make things. Things are not made up in frost, uh, not made up in the sense of imagined called up out of thin air like fairies and elves. Instead, things in frost are, are made in the sense of constructed. There are the products of specific acts, the acts of, of a worker. I think of of other tools in those poems. Uh, there's the, the spade in home burial, uh, the spade that's used to bury the couple's little child. I'll talk more about that palm next time. There's the, uh, the ladder to heaven in after apple picking a, it's a ladder, you know, uh, use to, um, uh, send the tree kind of tool of a scent that's kind of tool for getting fruit.

Speaker 1:          23:52          Uh, and then there's the terrible chainsaw and out out, uh, in mowing the size makes a sound as it cuts. Uh, and that sound is delicate. It's a, it's quiet, it whispers, but cutting is something fearful and forceful. It's a kind of controlled violence. Uh, frost takes it for granted that we will remember that the side as a conventional image for time, which harvests all of us to death, time and death. Uh, these are the forces that the, uh, worker works against, uh, and tries to Marshall, uh, in, in, uh, the process of working his will in the world to make his way in it, to earn his living, to stand on his own two feet.

Speaker 1:          24:51          But these, these forces are not something that, uh, the man, uh, controls, uh, as a, as a simple extension of himself, tools in frost are tricky. You have to learn how to use them. They have in frost to kind of, uh, independent objective existence. Uh, remember out, out this is, if you look on page two 13, and your, your Norton, uh, well I'll, I'll read from the middle of the, the poem. A boy is out, uh, sawing. Uh, his sister stood beside them. The group, he's not alone. He's with others in her apron to tell them supper at the word, the saw as if to prove saws, knew what supper meant, leaped out at the boy's hand or seem to leap. He must have given the hand. However it was neither refuse the meeting, but the hand, the boys first outcry was a rueful laugh as he swung toward them holding up the hand.

Speaker 1:          26:00          Half an appeal, but half as if to keep the life from spilling. Then the boy saw all, since he was old enough to know big boy doing a man's work though a child at heart, he saw all spoiled. Don't let them cut my hand off the doctor when he comes. Don't let them sister. So, but the hand was already gone and the boy dies. Uh, it's, it's, uh, an extraordinarily powerful poem, uh, this saw rather than whispering it's snarls and rattles, uh, ultimately it takes the life, the worker, it reminds the worker that, uh, uh, it has the power of death, the force that the worker only access accesses through the tool. Although a frost tools give the worker a way to impose his will on the world. The tool is part of the object world and it declares here brutally and cruelly that the workers will, is limited and subject to the tools he uses in mowing.

Speaker 1:          27:21          The palms lines are like sweeps of the size as it lays down rows of swale. Fros wants us to think about that. He wants us to see the, the road. The harvest had rose as being like lines of verse. It's an ancient, uh, association, uh, from classical poetry. The word Swale is interesting. You hear in it, the s and the w, uh, the two key sounds of this poem, uh, which are the sounds of the whispering Saif frost loves verbal sounds, uh, and he loves to play with their metaphorical associations. He invites us to hear the sweep of the size in those s sounds themselves, I think. And maybe even to hear the workers huff and puff, uh, his rhythmic exhalation in the Wus which alternate and interact with those ss, the whisper of the side. Then this is what the poem is all about.

Speaker 1:          28:33          The whisper is not. Frost specifies a dream of the gift of idle hours. Poetry is not, that is to say a leisure class activity for us. This is writing against the romantic idea that poetry is written in, repose received passively as inspiration. Poetry in frost is action, uh, not a matter as, as Wordsworth would say, of emotion recollected in tranquility. Frost is also here specifically writing against the early poetry of Yates, which you'll read next week. Uh, poetry that that finds reality exactly in dream and then has plenty of fairies and elves in it. A fraud. A frost is not after easy gold, but rather hard earned wages.

Speaker 1:          29:29          A dream. Uh, here. Frost implies that it is something. Dream is something more than the truth. He has that, that anything more than the truth would have seem too weak to the earnest love that laid the swale and rose. Uh, that's an interesting phrase. More than the truth. Why not less? Why isn't dream less than the truth? Uh, frost has made a suggestive choice of words. Truth is something less than dream in frost. Truth is life sized. Uh, to get down to it, you have to cut away what is not true. What is inflated beside the point, uh, excess ornament. The truth is something that you get down to. Uh, the truth is a reduction, a simplification. It is what is fit for the earnest love that is working for truth. Love. This is a crucial word in frost. You don't think of frost as a, as a love poet.

Speaker 1:          30:44          Uh, there are lot of ponds in frost, uh, uh, and yet, um, uh, even apart from those, there are many poems that use that word love often in a crucial places in the poems. Uh, in fact, love and desire are really at the center of Frost's poetry. Uh, so far I've been stressing a kind of anti romantic side of frost, uh, uh, how he seems to be saying nothing but the facts please. But the fact he says in that next to last line is the sweetest dream of labor and it is earnest love that is doing this. Cutting labor loves labor dreams. When we look carefully at this poem, in fact, the distinction that frost seems to make between fact and dream starts to give way.

Speaker 1:          31:52          Let me go back to the sound of this work. What was it? It whispered note fros use of words like something and perhaps, uh, these are words you are not supposed to use. And in poems or, or, or even writing about poems, uh, in frost, there is here this, uh, uh, explicit, deliberate, calculated vagueness, a withholding of certainty that allows a range of possible meanings to be entertained, held open. It's a, it's a rhetorical and conceptual move that I think is analogous to the whispering of the size. What I mean is, is that, uh, this tool doesn't speak loudly, it whispers, uh, and you have to lean forward to hear it. The same is true with the poem with any frost poem, uh, except that line 13 seems to violate that it seems to violate that principle. The fact is the sweetest dream that Labor knows well here. Frostings to be spelling things out, making a declaration, making a statement, saying what the fact is, uh, in theming to celebrate the literal, uh, the fact is the sweetest stream that Labor knows.

Speaker 1:          33:23          Importantly though, that's not the last thing. The poem says, what difference would it make? Had Frost as he could have, I suppose, have reversed the order of lines 13 and 14. Line 13 stands out as if almost as if out of the poem, uh, as if out of time, as a, as a kind of fact or truth, a fixed principle, a that is stated in the kind of eternal present. The fact is like no other sentence in this poem had frost decided to end the poem there. Uh, he would have said or seem to be saying, this is what it's all about. It would, it would be like one of those morals, uh, following the, the, the titles of his pump. But in fact, he doesn't end there. Uh, he doesn't make so clear a declaration. Line 14 returns us to the work of mowing my long side, the whispered and left the hay to make returns us to the work of mowing and the work of reading, uh, an interpretation in deciphering the poem ends with an image of process and not have product, uh, an image of the process of labor.

Speaker 1:          34:47          The implication is that it is the same way for the poet who lays the s, uh, his words in, in rows, uh, in those, those, that rose of swale that are his lines of verse the Hay. That is well, what the payoff, uh, what the poem is all about, what mowing is all about. Uh, the hay isn't handed over to you. Uh, it's rather left to make a, that's a rich phrase. What frost gives you here in elsewhere is a poetry that leaves its meanings to make all the time. Frost poetry is engaged in, uh, construing constructing, constituting facts, which means it doesn't give us the truth as if it were a product, a fashioned object. Rather. It gives us a, a process, an act of fashioning, an act that is involved with dreams and desire and with love. Facts are, are made and not found in, in Frost's poetry of work.

Speaker 1:          36:02          And this is to say that the process by which facts are made is, uh, well, it's like work in is therefore, um, well it's something daily, ordinary, ongoing. And for these reasons in completable, uh, it's something that we have to do over and over again that is making up the world. Poetry is a response to the daily necessity of getting the world right. Steven said that, but frost could have said it to a meeting in frost poems, uh, as in the world that they evoke a, it has to be interpreted every day. It has to be in that sense worked for again and again.

Speaker 2:          36:56          Well,

Speaker 1:          37:00          let me use this poem as a, as a way into now talking about sound and more actual, more, more literal ways, uh, in Frost's poetry. Uh, and to begin with you to think a little bit about meter, uh, in fact and what frost does with it. Uh, let me go back to the handout where we've got more passages from, for us letters. Uh, and, uh, in particular what for us has to say about something he calls the sound of sense,

Speaker 1:          37:46          although he says in that first quotation that, well, he doesn't like to brag. I alone have English writers have consciously set myself to make music out of what I may call the sound of. Since this is an ambitious guy, uh, now it is possible to have sense without the sound of sense as much prose that is supposed to pass muster but makes very dull reading and the sound of sensor that sense as an Alice in wonderland, which makes anything but dull reading. This is a wonderful metaphor, the best place to get the abstract sound of census from voices behind a door that cuts off the words you understand what frost meantime that he's, he wants us to think about how we could understand what people are saying without, uh, taking in the words that they're using simply a by catching the tones and rhythms of their exchanges. The sound of sense. Then you get that it is the abstract vitality of our speech. It is pure sound, pure form one who concerns himself with it more than the subject is an artist. But remember, we're still talking merely of the raw material of poetry and ear and an appetite for these sounds of sense is the first qualification of a writer, be it of prose or verse. But if one is to be a poet, he must learn to get cadences by skillfully breaking the sounds of sense with all their irregularity of accent.

Speaker 2:          39:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:36          Across the regular beat of the meter verse in which there is nothing but the beat of the meter furnished by the accents of the polysyllabic words we call dog role versus not that neither is the, is it the sound of sense alone? It is the resultant from those two.

Speaker 1:          39:59          There are only two or three meters that are worth anything. Uh, we depend for a variety on the infinite play of accents in the sound of sense. Fros sound, sound of sense. Uh, the abstract vitality of our speech. It has to do exactly with how people say what they say. These are our, uh, dimensions of communication that I've been identifying in mowing with the whisper of the side. That is a tone of meaning or a way of meaning. Uh, the sound of sense, it represents a common, common vernacular. Elements of speech. The sounds of sense are all part of language in use, uh, which people are using to do things with. But for us, justice, uh, poetry is not only that, it's something more, it's the sound of senses. He says broken. And that's another interesting metaphor. It's broken. He says skillfully across the beat of the meter.

Speaker 1:          41:08          A meter is something regular. It's a fixed scheme. It's inflexible as frost conceives of it. Here, the speaking voice by contrast is something idiosyncratic. Your regular particular, uh, ms second quotation or rather the last on the page with the second one about the subject. Um, for us says, my versification seems to bother people more than I should have expected because he seemed to ears tutored in 19th century norms to have a kind of, uh, a rough and irregular, uh, um, metric, I suppose because I've been so long accustomed to thinking of it in my own private way. It is as simple as this. There are the very regular preestablished accent and measure of blank first blank first. That is, and I'll explain it, uh, unrivaled. I ambig pentameter and there are the very irregular accent in measure of speaking intonation. I am never more pleased than when I can get these into strained relations for us wants to create a sound effect of strained relation in his poetry, uh, where a strained relation between speech and meet her.

Speaker 1:          42:39          I like to, and again, the same word. I like to drag and break the intonation across the meter as waves first comb and then break stumbling on the shingle. And now I'm writing a poem. It seems, uh, that's all he says, but it's no mere figure of speech though one can make figures enough about it. Uh, and in fact, uh, you can see for us doing that in his poetry very often, uh, strained relation, this tension between speech and pattern, uh, suggest the tension between all sorts of contending forces in frost, the vernacular and the literary, the concrete and the abstract flux fixity the individual will and material fact, the special sound of Frost poems, uh, results from the tensions between these pairs of opposing forces as they are embodied in his language.

Speaker 1:          43:44          To approach this, uh, you'll need to know a little bit about meter. Uh, in fact, uh, a rough grasp on traditional English meter is, is essential to frost. And it's also important to other poets. We'll read to Stevens, say, uh, or to crane or to Auden or bishop. Uh, obviously these are, these are our, our poets, uh, uh, who, who work, uh, usually in, in, uh, quite traditional meters. And yet it's also important, uh, for reading pound and for reading Eliot and for reading more, uh, who sound the way they do, uh, partly because they make a point of not writing Pentameter, the meter that frost often, but not always chooses. Uh, how many, uh, of, you know what I am? The pentameter is don't be shy. Let's see, I sat with, uh, okay. Um, I'm going to spend a little bit of time at the beginning of class next time, uh, talking about it and, and, uh, working with you a little bit.

Speaker 1:          44:58          Uh, as we, uh, uh, read, um, uh, frost in particular, we can, we can use the palm birches, uh, to, to do that. Uh, don't be distressed if you're unfamiliar with it. Uh, um, knowing, uh, what, uh, I ambit pentameter is, is not a, uh, a gift of birth, but rather, uh, something that comes through a little bit of practice, which means you have to work at it a little bit. Uh, and I will, in order to enable you to do that, uh, give you, uh, a well, or I actually asked that the tfs in section two, a handout, a meter exercise that you can do for next week, um, when, uh, when you leave today, uh, I would like to, uh, collect, uh, cards just to figure out how many of us there are. Um, and, uh, as I say on Wednesday, uh, between the online, um, registration, uh, and, um, uh, are, um, uh, work on it in a class, we should be able to get our sections ordered. So see you on Wednesday.
