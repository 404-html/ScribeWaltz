Speaker 1:          00:12          Talking about pounding and the Cantos last week I was talking about translation a lot. Uh, in the case of Elliot, uh, I'll be talking about quotation, a related but different practice. Uh, and one that we'll see again, uh, in Marianne Moore, uh, impounds case, there is, uh, a wish in poetry for immediacy for some kind of seemingly natural language. Pound doesn't want and doesn't use quotation marks just as he doesn't use footnotes. If you, um, if you look at pound in any of the, uh, additions of his work from the Cantos, uh, uh, backward, you will find that the high, uh, uh, you will find that the, uh, uh, the poems are presented without notes, without any kind of apparatus, without any kind of help. Uh, that's because I think, um, pound once to in some sense give you a kind of, he doesn't want to get in your way in any sense.

Speaker 1:          01:39          He wants you to have a kind of immediate experience of the writing that he's, uh, uh, presenting, uh, even, uh, uh, when it comes in the form of quotation. Uh, but as I suggested a for, for Pan, that sort of central practice, uh, is one of, uh, translation, which he also describes as transmitting the, the impulse. Uh, I and I, I spoke, uh, last time as if the impulse meant, uh, the motive or the emotion, uh, in, uh, a piece of writing. I think that pound also had a kind of scientific or technical sense of that, that process of transmitting the impulse, uh, and that what he wants to do is, uh, carry, uh, you want, he wants writing to carry energy. Uh, he wants it to carry a kind of pulse, uh, and he wants to give you a kind of direct access to this. Uh, the, uh, contrast with Elliot is a striking, I think, uh, instead of, uh, translation, you find an Elliot more often quotation, quotation, um, uh, which implies a certain relation to the literary past, just as pounds practices of translation imply in relation to tradition. I think about the difference between these, these forums, translation and quotation. It's a way to understand the differences between Elliot and pound, uh, and through them, uh, to think about modern Po, at least two of modern poetry is possible. Relations to the literature of the past.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Remember too, that modern poetry, uh, and that's, that's a word or a phrase that Elliot and Pam both used, that modern poetry is a specifically historical category. Uh, it's, you know, it's a historical way of naming what it is. A, you could contrast this with the, uh, romantic poetry, say, um, or images him. Um, yeah, which are names or labels that identify, um, a Oh, uh, uh, something more like, um, a, an aesthetic project or a, a, a, um, uh, uh, a tendency, uh, here, uh, to call a modern poetry modern is to choose as it's defining quality, uh, its position in history. It's a place, uh, in literary history and it does place modern poetry in history. Ambiguously is modern poetry is, it is, it's modernness, uh, an index of, um, the way it extends the past or is it rather modern because it breaks with the past?

Speaker 1:          05:02          Does modern mean some kind of renewal and continuity? Uh, or more does it, uh, does it mean rupture a translation in quotation suggest? Uh, well, as I say, different relations to the past pound aims to make it new, uh, itself. I suggested a translated phrase from the, the ancient Chinese pound. In doing this aims to carry culture forward, uh, to, uh, you know, handed over to us as a kind of, uh, living in immediate thing. Uh, the past is, is renewable, uh, in translation. It is a communicable that that's part of the premise of, of translation. Um, for pound. The past is something that can be reembody lead, uh, continually a needs to be reembody. We'd continually over and over again in new forms in this sense, uh, translation envisions a past that is metamorphic, uh, and, and mobile, uh, and durable. Uh, it, you know, it's something that is always essentially itself.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Uh, it's something that you know, is capable of being carried forward. Uh, and, and you can, you'd think about pounds, um, voyagers who's seafarers, a deceased or the seafarer poet, uh, as being, um, well agents or, or, uh, uh, representatives of acts of translation they embody. Um, uh, the action of carrying something across, journeying in quotation, however, uh, the past is something to be preserved, which is different, uh, preserved, uh, or maybe mocked, uh, in the sense of mocked in the sense of copied or parodied quotation seems to imply to possible relations to the past. When you think about it, deference to the past, deference to what has been said or some kind of violation of it, uh, when you quote someone, uh, especially maybe your parents or a teacher, uh, well, what are you doing? Uh, probably, uh, you mean, uh, either to honor them, uh, or to mock them, right.

Speaker 1:          07:44          Uh, to, uh, uh, uh, in a sense, defer to their authority or to take it away, to empty it out. Both of these are our possible, uh, uh, empty it out by parroting it, uh, treating it as if it were merely iterable and formulaic. Uh, and therefore, uh, without substance, uh, Elliot quotations, uh, teeter a ambiguously a between these two options. And sometimes you may feel he's doing the one thing and sometimes you may feel he's doing the other, that is somehow deferring to the past. And honoring it, or he's doing something quite subversive, uh, something periodic, uh, and, and in pound, I don't think there's any of that ambiguity ever. Uh, it's a very striking a contrast. If you listen to a pound online, uh, you, you hear a voice, uh, that is a fierce, uh, in melodramatic, uh, and, um, uh, in earnest, uh, you listened to Elliot, you, you hear another voice, uh, entirely, uh, one dry diffident hard to place tonally.

Speaker 1:          09:07          Uh, this has all worked into the poetry, uh, in our encounters with it on the page. Um, again, you might contrast the heroic figures that you meet in pound, uh, whether they're Odysseus or, um, uh, troubadour poet, um, or, um, one of the political leaders that pound a fastens on. These are men of will and willpower and action. These are the people that attract pounds, admiration, and imagination. Who Do you meet in Elliot j Alfred Prufrock, uh, this figure of, uh, extraordinary in decisiveness. Uh, and, uh, um, uh, indeterminate will, uh, someone who's diffident. Um, well, Prufrock is surely aversion of Elliot, uh, and, and, uh, we encounter in Elliot generally some of the problems that Prufrock, uh, raises for us, um, through his, um, uh, meandering, uh, mode of speech, uh, and difficult to place tone. Let's, um, let's look at some pictures of Elliot.

Speaker 1:          10:36          Um, maybe my favorite one, uh, especially since we're going to be thinking about and talking about a Elliot's age, uh, in how he, how he projects himself. This is, uh, this is Tom at eight. Uh, he, he was born in Saint Louis, the only major British poet born in Saint Louis. Uh, in 1888, uh, he went to Harvard. Um, uh, this was a, uh, uh, not a surprise, uh, and a, a and a sense of family mission. Um, uh, he spent his summers, uh, importantly in Massachusetts, uh, and on the coast of Massachusetts, the, uh, north shore of Boston and these places return and recur in his poetry, uh, as a graduate student at Harvard. Uh, in 1910, he IX patriated to, uh, Europe.

Speaker 1:          11:46          Let's, this is Elliot. In 1910, 1911, he's, he had studied philosophy at Harvard. Um, and he went on to study philosophy at Cambridge with Bertrand Russell a. He wrote his master's thesis on Fh Bradley. Uh, that's an association I'll say more about when we get to the wasteland. Uh, in 1915, he met and married Vivian. Hey, would, uh, a, a charismatic and volatile English woman. Uh, this romance produced for Elliot kind of dramatic conflict with his family over his wish to marry her, uh, his, uh, wish to take up residence in, in England. And, uh, behind all of this and with all of this, his sense of vocation is desire to become, to establish himself as a poet and man of letters rather than the more easily to be approved. Uh, career of a professor and scholar, uh, that he had seemed to have been made for a pound was a Elliot's, uh, older friend and mentor.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Uh, very quickly, uh, upon there, a meeting in Europe and pound, uh, always putting his fingers in everything, uh, wrote, uh, quite an extraordinary letter to Elliot's father. Uh, and I've got that on the, uh, your handout in the top page, a little quotation from it. Uh, it says, it says a lot about pounds and says something about Elliot to, uh, this is, uh, a letter in which, um, uh, pound felt the need to probably with some encouragement, but probably also some embarrassment, uh, from Elliott felt the need to, um, defend Elliot's, uh, expatriation, uh, to the family patriarch and a pound says as to his Elliot's coming to London. Well, anything else is a waste of time and energy. No one in London cares a hang what is written in America, uh, after getting an American audience and man has to begin all over again.

Speaker 1:          14:17          If he plans for an international hearing and who wouldn't plan for an international hearing? Uh, he, he even begins at a disadvantage. London likes discovering her own gods. Again, in alliterate career, mediocrity is worse than useless either. A man goes into go the whole hog, uh, or he had better take to selling soap and gents furnishings. You can, is this the right way to write Mr Elliot? I don't know. He must've felt so, uh, the situation has been very well summed up in the sentence. Henry James stayed in Paris and red [inaudible] and flo bear. Mr Howell's returned to America and read Henry James and then, and then, uh, he, he says in the, in another, uh, important sentence, a literary man's income depends very much and how rigidly he insists on doing exactly what he himself wants to do. It's interesting, uh, the idea is that by establishing some kind of independence from, uh, tastes in a literary market, Elliot will in fact come to establish his position in that literary market and his ability in fact, to create taste.

Speaker 1:          15:42          Uh, and, and so in fact, he did a, at this early point in Elliot's career, there is a kind of, um, important conflict between conformity and revolt, a conformity, uh, to, uh, his parents wishes social expectations were revolt from them. Uh, which is also, I think another way to describe the tension between two different senses or were aspects of quotation. A pound wants Elliot's father to see that his son's revolt is okay. Uh, because in fact, he's also going to conform. He's going to conform to a certain ideal of tradition to professional standards. Uh, he's going to, um, uh, he's not just going to have a wild time. Uh, he's going to work hard, uh, and, and do what a literary man, uh, should do a Elliot, uh, you'll see, uh, takes up these themes in different terms, but a related ways in tradition, in the individual talent, which I'll talk about later.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Uh, like pound, uh, Elliot we'll see, wants to ally himself with tradition. I wants to ally himself with tradition over against their Lieber, uh, Amy lol and Amy Chism, uh, and uh, at the same time, um, his relation to tradition, even from very early on what's potentially subversive and his poetry was very new and disturbing. Now, there are all sorts of interesting things and buying a key, uh, including here. Here he is again, the offer of proof fraud, including PSLE. It's waistcoat hds death mask. I showed you last time. Here's, here's the, uh, Elliot's waistcoat. Um, I like this, uh, as an object, uh, as, as part of, um, uh, the literary archive. We have, uh, also, uh, well it's interesting, isn't it? It's a, it's a piece of Elliot's costume. Costume was very important for Tsla. I think it's also a potentially a kind of emblem of quotation in his work, uh, is Elliot taking on the past and the or of propriety in order to parody it or empower himself.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Uh, these are, these are questions we might ask even about the waistcoat. Uh, is it, uh, is it some kind of disguise? Is it, uh, uh, is it, um, uh, a, um, costume through which he, um, uh, conforms to social forms and expectations? Uh, or is it again, something he puts on? Uh, all of these questions are at, uh, for me, the center of Elliot's interest in, in, in power, uh, and, and also I think, uh, some of the lasting power that he, uh, exerts, um, uh, in schools, uh, and for students. I will, um, I will confess that my high school yearbook carries a quotation from Tsl, yet in fact, from the love song of j Alfred Prufrock, which I won't, uh, identify for you. Uh, and as I think about that, why I cared about Elliot, uh, when I was 17 or so, um, I mean, not that I don't now to, uh, uh, when I think about that, it seems to me that I'm, his special combination of ambition and aggression, uh, expressed as it is very often by young people, uh, through parody or satire or diffidence was powerful for me too as a young person.

Speaker 1:          20:11          Uh, all of this is, is I'm on display in, in Elliot's great poem, the love Song of J. Dot. Alfred Prufrock or just what I'll concentrate on today. Um, um, Prufrock is, uh, a poem composed, uh, initially at Harvard and carried with something Elliot carried along with him, uh, in the years, uh, after, uh, a poem created out of pages and pages of drafts, which Elliot kept adding to a and going back over and, and recombining and recomposing them somewhat like his repetitive and wayward speaker. Uh, you, you, you can find, um, uh, early versions of the poem, uh, in, um, uh, a book of, uh, uh, Elliot's, uh, uh, early, uh, and otherwise on collected work that Christopher ricks edited a few years ago called the inventions of the march hare. It's a very interesting book. Uh, and you can see Elliot, uh, exploring different ways to write this poem, uh, which hung around for a long time.

Speaker 1:          21:36          Uh, it was eventually published in 1915 in poetry magazine, uh, and in this way, just like mowing a, just like a Yates is the fishermen, uh, which also appeared there. Then, uh, also, uh, a poem we'll get to in a couple of weeks, Marianne Morris, a grave, uh, and, and some of the images, pumps we discussed last week. All of these, uh, appearing thanks to pound, uh, in poetry magazine. Uh, the poem became the title of Elliot's first volume. Uh, interestingly, this is the cover of the book. Um, uh, it leaves off or the, um, uh, it leaves off the full title, which was Prufrock and other observations, uh, which is an interesting title. Uh, first of all is Prufrock and observation. Uh, that's, Elliot was treating this character as if he were an observation. You could think about what that might imply. Uh, and then think about that word observations.

Speaker 1:          22:44          Uh, it suggests something seen of course, as well as some kind of a speculation. Um, uh, it's also, um, uh, a way of defining and presenting Elliot's pumps. He doesn't say Prufrock and other poems he says Prufrock and other observations, uh, in, in observations is in fact, uh, then, uh, a word that, that Marianne Moore would use to title her first book of poems a few years later. Uh, on that cover, uh, we see Elliott's name and Prufrock's, uh, in some kind of a alteration, uh, alternation rather, uh, Prufrock being a little bit bigger than TSL yet. Uh, but I'm raising for us graphically the simple question, what is the relationship between these two? Uh, uh, are they, uh, yeah, uh, the one man created the other thing, uh, Prufrock uh, are they the same thing? How different are they?

Speaker 1:          23:54          Uh, here, um, uh, the, uh, uh, interior of the book. Uh, you can see, although, well you can't see, but if you get a better look at this online, you will see, uh, that this book, which is in buying a key, uh, it has a signature on it. Wu Steven's, uh, and why? Uh, October 17th, 1917. So this is, this was Stephen's copy, uh, at which he as he was a young man wandering around the streets of New York, uh, picked up, uh, and, and kept. Um, it was, uh, like a frosts early, uh, work published in London in 1917 now, um, in, in Bloomsbury by the egoist pressed. Uh, and there's the table of contents. Um, the, uh, first and long poem, uh, included in the volume being the love song of j Alfred Prufrock. Well, what do we expect from a poem that calls itself that the love Song of J. Dot.

Speaker 1:          25:07          Alfred Prufrock. Uh, first of all, what do we expect from this genre? The love Song, a love song. What is a love song? What is it love song? Like, presumably it would be a romantic poem. Uh, even a poem about romance. Uh, uh, what we get is perhaps something more like a parody of a romantic palm, uh, and something much stranger. Uh, this is going to be familiar to very many of you. Let us go. Then you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky, like a patient, he theorized upon a table, let us go through certain half deserted streets, the muttering retreats of restless nights and one night cheap hotels and sought us restaurants with oyster shells, streets that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent to lead you to an overwhelming question. Oh, do not ask, what is it? Let us go and make our visit in the room. The women come and go. Talking of Michelangelo

Speaker 2:          26:28          cool meter. Uh,

Speaker 1:          26:35          it's a topic we've, we've raised before. It isn't, uh, I am the pentameter. Um, the, uh, it's notably importantly not I ambit pentameter. Uh, instead, uh, you are introduced to another kind of rhythm of speech, which you can work at to scan a, but without even going into any detail about it, I think we can describe that rhythm is Languid, uh, as open to variation, uh, as, um, including hesitancy and sometimes abruptness. Uh, it is, uh, a way of speaking that is interrupted often, uh, is, uh, alternately, um, uh, voluble, uh, and nervous, uh, the, um, uh, the poems, initial disc continuity's of rhythm and pattern and image introduce us to, um, really a new kind of structure in poetry that would include, um, well, uh, kind of, um, uh, almost, uh, almost a principle that anytime you establish a pattern, you must quickly break it.

Speaker 1:          28:11          Uh, let us go. Then you and I, when the evening is spread out against the sky, sounds like this character is going to speak in couplets like a patient ether rised upon a table. Where did that come from? Uh, uh, let us, you know, we could supply another third line. Uh, uh, uh, uh, that would be a very different, I think, um, immediately we are invited to, um, well, uh, realistically conjure, um, a prone, uh, patient, um, uh, someone, uh, someone sick, uh, and being attended to and ether rised unconscious, uh, uh, an objectified, uh, uh, upon a table. Uh, if, if, um, we felt as though we were going to be in, um, a romantic crepuscular atmosphere, uh, we are suddenly confronted with an image quite disturbing, uh, and ugly and note that it doesn't rhyme. Uh, there, I suppose you could, you could connect table to hotels and shells below.

Speaker 1:          29:32          Um, but, uh, it's not, uh, a strong connection and, um, there has been, uh, no, um, uh, preparation for it before. Uh, so immediately we are given an image, uh, and, uh, a rhyme decision if you like, uh, that complicates any kind of sense of a pattern that we might have predicted from the first two lines. That rhythm. Um, well, um, uh, the contrast to a Nim big poem, uh, is, is strong and should be emphasized. And I want to draw your attention to, um, uh, an example that would have been in the ears of Elliot's listeners. Uh, and that is a, the Elliot's listeners Elliot's readers, that is, um, uh, the end of a Tennyson's Ulysses, um, a poem well known in the 19th century, the long day wanes. The slow moon climbs the deep moans round with many voices. I quote it too because, uh, Elliot love this passage and it returns in his late poetry, uh, in, um, uh, interesting echoes come my friends.

Speaker 1:          30:52          Tis Not too late to seek a newer world. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down. It may be we shall touch the happy isles and see the Great Achilles whom we knew though much is taken, much abides. And though we are not now that strength, which in old days moved earth and heaven were older, that which we are, we are one equal temper of heroic hearts made weak by time and fate, but strong in will to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield. Where uh, echoing I think, uh, Milton's, Satan, uh, the, uh, the blank verse suddenly, you know, becomes a kind of heroic medium of the will. Uh, well the contrast is important, uh, with the poetry that Elliot is presenting to us, uh, because here, uh, the question of the speakers will, is so much at issue and his manner of speech is so different from the example that Tennyson gives us a Tennyson specifically in this dramatic monologue as in others, uh, of, uh, his, uh, erv or other important 19th century examples introduces us to a dramatic speaker who has a kind of coherent character, uh, and, and, uh, um, uh, who's unity of character, if you like, uh, is allied to the unity of the verse form itself.

Speaker 1:          32:28          Elliot gives us something very different. Uh, he creates in frog, I would say not a character, rather, he creates something more like a consciousness. Uh, he creates a, uh, a fragmentary consciousness, uh, that rises and falls, uh, take shape and disperses before us. John Stuart Mill said, uh, in, in, uh, memorable, uh, uh, passage that poetry lyric poetry is what he was thinking of is overheard speech, overheard speech. Well, and you can think, uh, if you have some sense of, uh, the romantic poetry of Wordsworth, uh, or, or, um, uh, Coleridge as examples before you have of what mill had in mind, the way in which in those poems we listened in on, um, uh, uh, soliloquies, ing, uh, poets, thoughts, listening to Prufrock is much less like listening to someone speak on the street or on the stage, uh, than it is like closing your eyes and remembering, uh, or inventing voices in your mind.

Speaker 1:          34:06          Elliot is creating a kind of overheard inner speech. Uh, he's, he's, uh, he's letting us listen in on a mind, uh, that we don't see whole. We don't feel whole. Uh, we only get parts of it, uh, fluctuation. Uh, this is the, this is the medium and the rhythm, uh, that, uh, we, we entered when we entered the poem. Uh, there is, uh, as I was already suggesting, no overarching pattern for the poems verse form. Um, I think this is probably true for, uh, other, uh, dimensions of organization, uh, as well. Um, there are rather, uh, in this poem what I would call a kind of set of unfolding local systems of organization. Um, there are, uh, couplets. We see couplets in that first paragraph, but then they're not systematically pursued. Um, instead what you get in the poem or a lot of loose ends, uh, pauses a bits and pieces of language, a language that is almost always full of quotations, which your editor will give you, uh, the source for some of them. Uh, what we have then in the poem as he moved through it as though it's a lot of shifting improvised orders, uh, this formal instability in the palm is related to, and it constructs a special sort of speaker, a one who is performing for us, uh, his, his thoughts, his thoughts, uh, experienced as a set of routines or rifts or acts. Uh, and they come and go without a very definite aim or conclusion.

Speaker 1:          36:32          Looking at the cover of, of Prufrock, I asked you to think about the relationship between Prufrock and ts. Eliot, uh, you think you can think about, uh, Prufrock the name itself, Jay Alfred Prufrock, almost a kind of parody of t s Elliott. Um, the, the name suggests a kind of upper class, uh, English or Anglo file person. Uh, those formal initials are, are, uh, uh, pretentious in a way. Um, I think it's proper to think of Prufrock as in some sense a kind of comic figure, a almost like a cartoon or a caricature or device. Um, on one level a, he is a kind of parody of a romantic singer. Uh, he is bourgeois. He is intellectualizing, uh, he's incapable of grasping and expressing what we expect from a love song that is strong emotion. Uh, the poem can be seen to as a, as a kind of critique of romantic egotism and, uh, of the Wordsworthian ideal of, of expression. This is, uh, something that, uh, Elliot a theorizes polemically, uh, in his essay, uh, tradition and the individual talent. Uh, and in fact, why don't we look there for a few minutes to get more sense of a Elliot's ideas. Uh, nine 46 at the back of your book there. Uh,

Speaker 1:          38:32          he says, I'm quoting Wordsworth in the preface to lyrical ballads. We must believe that emotion recollected in tranquility is an exam, is an inexact formula for it as neither emotion nor recollection, nor without distortion of meaning tranquility that you get in in Eliot poem. At least it is a concentration and a new thing resulting from the concentration of a very great number of experiences, which to the practical inactive person would not seem to be experienced as it all. It is the concentration which does not happen consciously or of deliberation. Uh, these experiences are not recollected.

Speaker 2:          39:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:17          And they finally United in an atmosphere which is tranquil only and that it is a passive attending upon the event.

Speaker 1:          39:26          There's a, Eliot is trying to describe poetry here as having a kind of generating a kind of experience in and of itself that is distinct from any kind of recollected experience. Uh, and it is curiously impersonal as he imagines that. And he continues and there's a great deal in the writing of poetry, which must be conscious and deliberate. In fact, the bad poet is usually unconscious where he ought to be conscious and conscious where he ought to be unconscious. We know what he means. Uh, both errors tend to make him personal and am now Tsla. It will say poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion. It is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But of course, only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from these things. Uh, which is a extraordinary kind of Coda to this, uh, polemical passage.

Speaker 2:          40:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:36          Ah, and, and revealing of course, uh, the, the way in which Elliot, even as he's polemicizing against a romantic poetry that would be too personal, uh, is deeply invested in, uh, the personal, uh, and personality, uh, and conflicted about it. Uh, I've been, uh, talking about ambiguity in Elliot. Um, uh, well we can speak of ambivalence, uh, this essay a retains even while it is critiquing a certain romantic story of, of creation. Uh, and we could say something similar about Elliot's Love Song Prufrock, uh, is a kind of pretext or a device through which Elliot can speak of himself. Uh, Prufrock becomes a way of writing the self when to Elliot. It no longer seems plausible to write as oneself as a Wordsworth had felt it to be. You can think of Prufrock as a, as a kind of mask behind which you hear a young poet asking questions about himself and his art. A list, the poems, questions there. Prufrock asks questions throughout. Uh, do you recall them? They are. Do I dare? Do I dare disturb the universe? So how should I presume? And how should I begin? Shall I say? He says that pretty often. Shall I say this? Shall I say that daring presuming beginning, what shall I say? These are, are they not an ambitious young poets? Questions about how to write poetry.

Speaker 1:          42:41          The question is, why should beginning be something that you really have to dare? Uh, what does that imply? Uh, why should it be frightening? Why should it give you pause in y if these are a young man's questions as I'm suggesting, does Prufrock seem as old as old and weary as he does? In fact, how old do you think he is? I don't know. Uh, ask yourselves that question. Uh, ask yourselves what evidence you would have for one answer. Another. Uh, it's hard to pinpoint his age. Prufrock is, isn't he a kind of old young man or young old man?

Speaker 1:          43:39          Uh, he is cautious and aggressive at the same time. Uh, old and young. These paradoxes I think point to Elliot's sense of his place, his own place in literary history, in some sense of what it meant to be modern for Elliot. Uh, Prufrock is burdened by the question of how to begin in dd begins exactly by deferring beginning a by failing to come to the point by putting it off, by delaying. Because by implication, beginning is indeed something threatening, something that must be dared. But this only makes sense if Prufrock really does want to disturb the universe or at least the system of culture as he found it. It only makes sense of beginning really does require disturbing things. Uh, the implication is that the universe is already complete without Prufrock, without Tsa, Elliot and anything that he might do or say, you can extend this to Elliot's idea of culture. Uh, and in particular to his sense of the literary past, uh, you see the idea in tradition, in the individual talent, uh, uh, nine 42, nine 43, he speaks of a, towards the bottom of the page on nine 42, uh, tradition as a kind of ideal order of monuments.

Speaker 1:          45:22          Tradition is in some sense, well, it's monumental and it's already complete as he imagines it to add to it, to enter, it would be to change it to disturb it. Uh, in fact, Elliot evolves here a quite ingenious and complicated argument for how the new could indeed be introduced to a tradition conceived in the terms I just described. Elliot says, uh, on the bottom of the page about, uh, the, uh, any, any new poet, the necessity that he shall conform. And there's that word conform. Think of the waistcoat, the necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere and remain put together is not one sided. This was quite an extraordinary argument. He's saying it's not only necessary for a new poet too, in a sense, conform to tradition.

Speaker 1:          46:31          What happens when a new work of art is created as something that's happened simultaneously to all the works of art, which proceeded it. Something which happens simultaneously to all the works of art, which proceeded it. This is quite a claim. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new, the really new work of art among them. The existing orders complete before the new work arrives for order to present, persist after the Super Vientiane of novelty. Novelty comes as something that supervenes it has force, it's a leopard and the temple. The whole existing order must be if ever so slightly altered. And so the relations, proportions values of each work of art toward the whole a readjusted and this is conformity between the old and the new. It's, uh, uh, here Elliot is, is struggling with, with an idea of tradition as something that is static and, and fully, uh, uh, present in and of itself a sense of the new as something that is revolutionary, uh, and that threatens tradition or is threatened by it. How can he bring them into alignment? Well, through this very complicated process, uh, that he describes, which, uh, gives the modern, gives the new, um,

Speaker 2:          48:02          okay,

Speaker 1:          48:02          an extraordinary power to make us see and in fact to realign the relations among all the works of the past.

Speaker 2:          48:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          48:16          And this is, uh, uh, as I say, quite an extraordinary power. Uh, the implication is the new poet must in some sense rest authority from all those who have come before through a kind of imaginative and rhetorical violence, uh, kind of, uh, insurrection in, in the temple of culture. Prufrock's sense of age, uh, expresses for him a feeling of relatedness and anxiety that he's already a run out of time is very youth. The fact that it's the only just now starting makes him old, uh, to presume would be to reverse this order, to dare to come before and to claim priority, uh, for his own work. Uh, as I say these sentences, I sound a whole lot like Harold bloom, uh, as, uh, uh, he, uh, describes, uh, the, uh, uh, mission of any, uh, poet in his work on the anxiety of influence. And that is because a Bloom's work is a deeply indebted precisely to Elliot and to tradition and the individual talent. But these are questions, uh, I'll say a little bit more about, um, uh, next time, uh, as we, uh, uh, finish discussing Elliott's a love song and, uh, begin to, uh, talk about the wasteland.
