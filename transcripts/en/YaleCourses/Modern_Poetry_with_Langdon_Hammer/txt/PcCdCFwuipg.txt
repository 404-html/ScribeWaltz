Speaker 1:          00:01          We talked, let me talk to him Monday about Frost's, uh, idea of the sound of sense. Uh, and uh, vernacular, uh, speech forms, uh, his, his wish to put these intention or as he put it, strained relations, uh, with metrical pattern. Uh, the primary metrical pattern in frost a is the primary metrical pattern in English poetry, which is to say blank verse, uh, or unrivaled I abic pentameter. Well, a meter, what is meter a meter is, uh, it's a scheme for organizing verse four, organizing, um, lines of verse. Uh, it's a scheme that, uh, in English counts, accents or stresses per line, uh, and then arranges them in a pattern. Um, ordinarily in accentual syllabic verse, which is what we're reading, uh, more often than not in English poetry, the accents are arranged in relation to unaccented syllables, creating a kind of limited array of, of standard units.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Uh, the most standard of these as the I am the I am is, is a simple pattern of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed one, a boat about, uh, address a coat. These are all simple. I am Vick phrases that you hear in our language all the time. If you, if you repeat a boat three times a boat, a boat, a boat, you have trinity. I am Vic [inaudible] a three. I am in a row. Uh, if you do it four times, you've got a Ted transmitter, uh, uh, more common meter, uh, in English. And if you repeat them five times, you have pentameter, uh, accent. Uh, what is an accent? Um, for some of you, this will seem self evident. For others, uh, it'll seem like a great puzzle. Um, uh, what constitutes an accident? When you, what, what, what, what, uh, what does an accent in a given English word?

Speaker 1:          02:43          In fact, uh, linguists often argue about this subject and it's a, it's a complicated, uh, one, um, accent is something somewhat difficult to define and categorize. Uh, don't worry about. Uh, poetry is not interested in, in, uh, expert debate, uh, at all. Uh, and it, it converts the, the, you know, big spectrum of possible degrees of accent, uh, into those two simple categories, stressed and unstressed syllables. Uh, so, uh, if you're unsure about the medical definition of a line because it's hard to discriminate between levels of stress as will almost certainly be the case, remember that, uh, more often than not, uh, the context takes over, uh, and the regular beat of a meter rules and perhaps promotes an accent, uh, in, uh, a phrase that might not otherwise seem to have one to you. Let's, uh, illustrate these, these general points by uh, uh, just reading together and trying to hear the beginning of a Robert Frost poem birches on, on page two 11. And the, the Norton,

Speaker 1:          04:15          this is an example of blank verse and that is, uh, always to be blank for us always perhaps confusingly to be district a distinguished from free verse blank verse is unrivaled I amic Pentameter free verse is non metrical poetry. Another thing all together. This is blank verse. It's the language of Shakespeare. It's a language of Milton. When I see birches Ben to left and right across the lines of straight or dark or trees, I like to think some boys been swinging them well. Um, for me when I try to make sense of the meter of given lines, uh, I think it's useful to try to settle, to start those syllables that seem most clearly stressed, uh, to, you know, identify where there, there isn't a question, uh, and uh, use that then as a structure from which to interpret the rest of the lines. So why don't we do that together? Uh, just looking at this first, first line when I see birches Ben to left and right when I see birches Ben to left and right when I see birches bend to the left and right, and sometimes it's not good to repeat it too often, then you start to become unhinged. Uh, let, let, let's, uh, let's, let's see if we can't identify those syllables that well, we all are going to agree on, uh, we're, we're, where's the first accident that you really want to say? That's an accent. I birches bend. Okay. Speak Up. What's left, right debate there. Uh, everybody, when I propose, uh, another, uh, another stress in that line,

Speaker 2:          06:26          yes.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Uh, there's a stress on when and see, hmm, okay. Well, what if I had the phrase, I see what, uh, what would be stressed in that phrase? I see.

Speaker 2:          06:43          Si

Speaker 1:          06:46          that's true. Um, when I see birches Ben to left and right, I think I would want to scan that, that, uh, line, uh, as, as a bit of an odd beginning, uh, I think that word see is, deserves the, the, uh, the accent there. Uh, and so it's, um, the, the first first unit of the sound isn't quite normative. Uh, it takes frost a little sweep to get going when I see birches Ben to left and right. But by the time we finished the end of that line, we are really right in the middle of very regular I ambit pentameter. When I see birches Ben to left and right across the lines of straighter, darker trees. I like to think some boys been swinging them across the line of straight, darker trees. Let's, let's do the lines of straight or darker trees. Let's do that line.

Speaker 1:          07:41          Uh, accents here. Cross lines. Straight trees. Yeah. I, that one's pretty simple. Uh, thank you for us. You, you, you have, you know, delivered, uh, this, this, this, uh, to us. Uh, and as is not often the case, uh, every, excuse me as is not seldom the case in frost. There's almost a kind of metaphorical play between what he's describing. Uh, and uh, the sounds with which he is doing the describing here, the uh, uh, this image of, of uh, aligns of trees and the uh, metrical regularity of that, um, uh, verse that describes them. I like to think some boys been swinging them. I like to think some boys been swinging them. Yeah. What about this line?

Speaker 2:          08:42          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:42          I like to think some boys been swinging them.

Speaker 2:          08:49          That word swinging gives a nice swing to the, it's into the I am. Anyone said Amen.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Uh, the, the point is that a swing has some interesting swinging effect. Um, yeah. I'm not sure how to describe that exactly. Um, uh, yeah, we want, we want to put a stress on swing. Uh, what other words in that line? I'm sorry. Think good. Like, Yup. I like is like, I see, I like to think some boys swing them. Yeah. This too is, is it utterly regular? I am big pentameter line, uh, unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable, five in a row, and yet think about the qualities of sound that are so different between, across the lines of straight or darker trees. And I like to think some boys been swinging them. Uh, the, what frost is interested in is the what really ultimate, uh, a variety of, of uh, sounds that he is able to reduce, uh, as that metrical pattern, uh, comes into some kind of a tension with a English sentence sounds as he calls.

Speaker 1:          10:19          And, uh, and uh, with the, the effect that each of frost lines of I am big pentameter has, has different qualities even when they're utterly regular. Uh, and there are in frost often, uh, some variations. Uh, this is something I'd like you to practice, uh, uh, I'd like you to, to think about, be conscious of and it's something we can return to a, it's not something I expect you to necessarily master or, um, uh, or, or, uh, become advanced, uh, in, um, uh, um, uh, you were, you were, um, expertise. Uh, but it is a dimension of the poetry that's absolutely essential to what it is and to what your doing. When you read a and you hear, uh, that voice speaking. And so I'd like you to work on attuning yourself to it. Uh, what can you do with sound as interpreters? How do we start to fund you?

Speaker 1:          11:23          Make a connection between what we hear and what things mean? Well, uh, in frost case, as I'm suggesting, there's often very skillful in complex, uh, uh, imitation going on between for us sounds. Uh, and what he's imaging or describing are the actions and events and a palm that's the case, a marvelously in this poem. Um, uh, and it, and I'd be happy to talk about, uh, um, particular examples with, with any of you who'd like to work through it. Um, but, uh, the point I want to make about it is as much more general and we don't have to look at, uh, a particular cases to make it a, this is a poem about bending and breaking or not breaking, uh, forms, uh, forms the material, givens of the world. Uh, it's a poem in fact about strained relation, uh, uh, in, in a kind of play, uh, that, uh, frost, uh, is, is exploring, uh, and that strange relation that he's a, that the boy, uh, achieves as he learns how to play, uh, with these trees.

Speaker 1:          12:47          Well, uh, that's a version of what we hear in the poem when we hear the forms of strange relation between, um, uh, frost dynamic speech sounds and the metrical pattern of his writing. Uh, the kinetic activity of the form of the poem in other words, uh, is something that's like, but it's also itself for Frost, an instance of the relations of force and counter force, desire and gravity, uh, that the poem is describing the meter has, in other words, uh, in relation to his individual sentence sounds, uh, some of the flexibility and also resistance that those trees have in relation to the boy, uh, using them to swing, to swing, to go up and down, to come and go safely. Uh, these are primal forms of play. Uh, if you, if you like, uh, that suggest forms of poetic activity. Also spiritual activity, uh, frosts, ways of using language in short, our, our, like our, our versions of, uh, the boys' way of using the trees. Let's, let's look at the poem together. I'll read it.

Speaker 1:          14:17          I like to think some boys been swinging them but swinging doesn't bend them down to stay as ice storms do. Frost is going to counter pose the boys swinging to uh, the natural forces, uh, imaged in the ice storm. Often. You must have seen them loaded with Isis. Sunny winter morning after a rain, they'd click upon themselves as the breeze rises and turn many colors as the stor cracks and crazes there a namel soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells shattering and avalanching on the snow crest, such heaps of broken glass to sweep away. You'd think the inner dome of Heaven had fallen. They are dragged to the withered brack and by the load and they seem not to break the ones they are bowed so low for long, they never write themselves. You may see their trunks arching in the woods years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair before them, over their heads to dry in the sun.

Speaker 1:          15:39          But I was going to say when truth broke in with all her matter of fact about the ice storm, I should prefer to have some boy bend them as he went out and in to fetch the cows. Some boy too far from town to learn baseball who's only play was what he found himself summer or winter and could play alone one by one. He subdued his father's trees by writing them down over and over again until he took the stiffness out of them and not one but hung limp. Not One was left for him to conquer. He learned all there was to learn about not launching out too soon and so not carrying the tree away clear to the ground. He always kept his poise to the top branches, climbing carefully with the same pains you use to fill a cup up to the brim and even above the brim. Then he flung out where it feet first with a swish kicking his way down through the air to the ground.

Speaker 1:          16:58          So as I once myself a swinger of Birches, and so I dream of going back to be, it's when I'm weary of considerations in life is too much like a pathless would wear. Your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs broken across it. And one eye is weeping from a twigs having lashed across it open. I'd like to get away from Earth a while and then come back to it and begin over. May know fate willfully misunderstand me and half grant what I wish and snatched me away and not to return earth, the right place for love. I don't know where it's likely to go better. I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree and climb black branches up a snow white trunk toward heaven until the tree could bear no more, but dipped it's top and set me down again. That would be good. Both going and coming back. One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

Speaker 1:          18:08          So think about the birches as a tool, another tool. But this time of tool for play, uh, a tool for playing alone as in mowing a frost is writing about solitude in essential loneliness. The boys solitude is like the mowers. Who's absent? Well, other children. Uh, the other character that's mentioned in the poem is the boy's father who's trees. They are the property owner who also is absent. It's his absence that leaves the boy alone to his own devices. Uh, we might think of him not simply as, uh, the, the, uh, farm or who holds the deed to those Birch's, but as maybe God the father who created them, uh, and is likewise absent or invisible in the solitude, the solitude, uh, that absence. Um, the boy uses the tree to work his will playfully this time. He's not really a worker, uh, to work his will on the world.

Speaker 1:          19:35          And the boy uses the trees to do two things, right, to go up or go out and come back to return. Uh, this activity in, in a wonderful homely way is a version of romance quest. It's an image of a cent toward heaven, uh, from which, uh, the boy returns. Uh, he's able to rise to, to transcend the limits of his own body and station. Uh, at the same time, it's dangerous. It's dangerous to want to get away from Earth Awhile, uh, to get your feet entirely off the ground. Uh, what might happen to you? Uh, uh, well, uh, to put too much pressure on any tool is to risk breaking it, uh, breaking down, maybe a crashing, coming back to earth like ICARUS. Uh, the, uh, overreach here, the poet after, uh, is, is subject to gravity in frost to the force of the earth that checks it's a counterweight to frost, romantic longing, the skill and the play that for us just talking about a depends on being able to use a tool, in this case, the tree emblematic of the world in its sturdy but also delicate materiality to use the tool to return safely to the ground, to get your feet back on the ground for earth's the right place for love for us as, uh, it's love that makes the boy climb as it made the mower work.

Speaker 1:          21:31          Remember, but who was talking about love? It's a, uh, frost is so fly. Uh, he, he, he brings it up as if we know that this is what he's been talking about all the time. Uh, uh, notice in fact, the cleverness of, of all this discourse in the poem, notice the freedom that he exercises, uh, in unfolding what feels like an improvisitory monologue, uh, in which he makes you race to keep up with him, uh, as he, uh, follows as semi hidden logic that he treats as self evident. Uh, notice that final colloquial phrase to go. He repeats it twice. I don't know where it's love is likely to go better. And then I'd like to go by climbing a tree, a wonderful phrase to go, uh, meaning want a variety of things, uh, uh, to go in the sense of, uh, uh, to make, uh, to make something work out, to make it go, uh, to journey, to choose how to live, uh, to go to the limit, uh, where the tool can bear no more.

Speaker 1:          22:50          Uh, yeah. And, and, and people use that phrase to mean to die, don't they? Uh, you know, we've talked about, I'd like to go in this way. All those resonances in those two words. Uh, on Monday I stressed that poetry was for frost, always a mode of work. Uh, and that work was for him a model of poetic activity with mowing. Uh, as the example I said that in frost meaning is always something made. Uh, something that works on and works for frosts, modernity, consistent that the idea that a truth is something that's concrete and contingent, uh, not a metaphysical matter, uh, not an ideal principle. And then it's something that's only available in the act of deriving it, constructing it. A, an act that is ordinary, that's in completable, uh, and therefore necessarily always, uh, to be, uh, repeated, uh, an ongoing task. It's something you have to get up and do every day.

Speaker 1:          24:11          Uh, frost is a, is a kind of materialist, uh, by which I mean, he calls attention to the circumstances of imagination. It's limits and conditions. Uh, poetry is in frost, uh, an encounter between fact and desire. What we want. And what is, uh, tools in frost, uh, are an image of the enabling and defining conditions, uh, of imagination. And they include in the, the work of poetry, uh, itself, um, uh, all sorts of tools. Uh, all the, um, uh, technology of language, uh, and the technology in particular of verse, uh, including, uh, importantly meter, uh, the relation between the, the speech sounds and the metrical frame of a poem, uh, such as birches. Uh, it's like the relation, as I'm saying, between the boy and the Birches, uh, in other words, meter is something for us, knows how to use. It's a, it's a material force that his rhetoric challenges and relies on a, gives him a means of getting off the ground, uh, and a means of always getting back to it too.

Speaker 1:          25:35          Uh, and that's another kind of doubleness and frost. I talked about doubleness last time. Uh, um, think in, in birches of, of really the extraordinary, uh, play of, of, of language, uh, the freedom of association, the metaphorical invention, uh, all of which is being played off of the strict demands of the meter at every moment. It's part of the energy and force of the poem. Uh, the, the work of poetry in frost that the really the high drama of, uh, the wheel at work in the world. Uh, it's something that we can actually hear in his poetry, in the expertly explored tensions between speech and meter in that meter too. We're hearing, we're hearing some of frost modernity. Uh, let me say more about what I mean.

Speaker 1:          26:36          Uh, let me say more about what I mean by approaching, uh, the question of his modernness as modernity. Uh, uh, from the point of view of his subjects. Last time I showed you the, uh, his second book and it's, it's a, it's covering north of Boston. Uh, the title of that book published in 1914 and the one that more than any other, uh, made him famous, locates his subjects in a specific geography. Uh, it's important for thinking about frost place in modern poetry. Uh, Boston, well, it was the capital of 19th century American literature and culture, uh, a named synonymous eventually with gentility, uh, puritanism, uh, uh, old American money and style. Uh, exactly. Uh, in other words, everything modernism was attacking. So, uh, where do you go to write modern poetry? Well, anywhere but, but Boston, uh, pound, uh, and Elliot, uh, importantly go to London, Paris.

Speaker 1:          27:47          There's the New York of crane, uh, of Moore Stephens too, but frost says differently. Uh, he alone moves poetry north of Boston. Uh, to do this is to, uh, reverse the, the social direction, which everyone else is going to reverse the direction of American modernization, which is evacuating rural New England, uh, uh, sending its workers to the cities, uh, uh, in the, uh, new industrial economy. If you can think about cranes, images of, of the Brooklyn Bridge in this course, and then compare frosts, uh, image of the woodpile that abandoned woodpile that some worker has left, uh, in the, the poem called the woodpile. Uh, these are in a sense complimentary images of, uh, the modern in a America, uh, frost when he goes north of Boston, uh, goes back to the country, goes in a sense the opposite direction, uh, that, uh, America is going, he goes in a sense, in an anti modern direction.

Speaker 1:          28:59          Uh, maybe even in some sense, in a reactionary, a direction, at least in relation to other poets, ideas of progress and innovation, this move roots Frost's poetry of work in the lives of rural workers. Uh, people who have to sustain and entertain themselves, uh, uh, often on their own or alone. Uh, what these people have to work with are, are the tools that have been passed down to them or sometimes that they have invented. Uh, the, the, uh, the poverty of the people for us writes about is important. It makes them materialists two or realists like frost. Uh, they are, uh, acutely conscious of the circumstances in which they live their lives, uh, and they suffer, uh, they rage. Uh, they're, they're new England. Uh, importantly is not an ideal pastoral place. The heart of north of Boston is a series of dramatic monologues and dialogues, uh, speeches in conversations for people who really had never spoken, were never spoken very much in modern, excuse me, in American poetry before.

Speaker 1:          30:20          And, uh, who in frost speak in a holy, distinctive way, uh, that is in Frost's combination of colloquial sentence, sound and unrivaled. I ambig pentameter a blank. First, it is the heroic language of Shakespeare, Milton of Wordsworth. Uh, the death of the hired man home burial servant to servants. The fear. These are, these are, are our are, uh, poems in which a frost is, uh, giving, um, New England workers. The, the, the language, uh, of the great English poets. Uh, I've been stressing for us solitude, well, uh, all the, uh, uh, people frost writes about are in some sense alone, uh, often alone together. Uh, they share solitude, uh, uh, solitary to in their relation to each other. Uh, frost. Uh, as a narrator in these great poems I'm describing a frames his peoples, uh, words minimally with few bits of narrative information. He just, uh, through plunges you into their speech, into their lives.

Speaker 1:          31:34          And, uh, you have to, you have to in a sense work to, uh, uh, get into their character to be able to keep track of who is, uh, speaking. Let's, um, look at, uh, w what is for me the most gripping, uh, example, uh, in this, of this kind of poem, home burial on page two oh four, um, giving us a little introduction, a little framing, uh, and no consoling closure really, uh, where the moral might come in another pot. Uh, frost creates a kind of uncomfortable intimacy for us with his character's, uh, were, were, were, were, were challenged by them, were brought up close to them. Uh, look at, uh, home burial here. He saw her from the bottom of the stairs before she saw him. And, and that's a kind of emblematic moment in frost where one person is in a sense seeing another without being seen. She was staring down, looking back over her shoulder at some fear. She took a doubtful step and then undid it to raise herself and look again. He spoke, advancing toward her. What is it you see from up there? Always for, I want to know

Speaker 1:          33:02          this is, this is another important frost in motivation for, I want to know, uh, here a desire expressed between two people, a husband and a wife. She turned and sank upon our skirts at that as if collapsing and her face changed from terrified to dull. He said to gain time. And isn't that an interesting phrase to gain time? What is it you see mounting until she coward under him for he is fearful or fearsome? I will find out now. You must tell me dear. She in her place refused him any help with the least stiffening of her neck and silence. She let him look sure that he wouldn't see blind creature in a while. He didn't see, but at last team murmured. Oh, and again. Oh, what is it? What she said, just that I see you don't, she challenged. Tell me what it is. Put it into words. What does he see? Well, the wonder is I didn't see it once and that is the grave that he has made for their child. Uh, in those blocks of speech, there's, there's, uh, importantly there. There's, there's white space around what they have to say. It's almost a way of, uh, inviting us to visualize the separation of these two people as they speak. And as we read, we have to fill in the nature of their relationship. Uh, here, well,

Speaker 1:          35:14          people are locked into themselves in frost and in their points of view. Um, here, the issue in this palm is grief. How the mother and father each express how they deal with, uh, the death of their child, uh, simply where and how they stand in relation to each other. They speak is important. The woman, the mother wishes to, can't help herself from trying to hold onto the dead child and she's caught looking behind her, uh, as if towards the past. Um, which is also frankly a wish to escape her husband, uh, who is a frightening for us to escape his will. I think, uh, his will, his force, these are his ways, his resources for responding to death. Uh, uh, the woman's, uh, objection as the poem and, uh, is summed up by his choice, the father's choice to bury the child himself. Uh, he responds to this grievous loss privately by taking it on himself, by seeking to master it himself.

Speaker 1:          36:43          And specifically as a worker in the grim tool, if you like a of his, uh, morning, uh, his, his spade, uh, his, um, uh, his, uh, the shovel he uses to do, uh, the, the uh, uh, burying on, on page two oh six, um, she says, uh, um, uh, well, there you go. Sneering now, uh, and he says, I'm not, I'm not, you make me angry. I'll come down to you. God, what a woman. And it's come to this, a man can't speak of his own child. That's dead. You can't speak because you don't know how to speak. She says, if you had feelings, you, that Doug with your own hand, how could you, his little grave, I saw you from their very window. They're making the gravel leap and leap in air leap up like that, like that and land so lightly enroll back down the amount, the mound beside the hole.

Speaker 1:          37:57          I thought, who is that man? I didn't know you. Well, the father in home burial is a, is a worker, a worker there in those lines are reduced to this tool that he's using, uh, almost, uh, mechanically. That makes the, uh, uh, dirt leap, um, uh, kind of desperate mechanism that's trying to take control of the world and failing, uh, as he, uh, uh, well she says to him in this chills her, I can repeat the very words you were saying. Three foggy mornings in one rainy day will rot the best birch fence. A man can build, think of it, talk like that at such a time. But in fact, in his own way, he's talking about his inability to, uh, keep his child alive there, uh, in, in a kind of metaphorical way. Um, uh, speaking of his failure to build a fence to last, uh, in a drives his wife ultimately, uh, disgusted by him away, uh, fearing him well.

Speaker 1:          39:12          Home burial is, is a poem about the limits of work. Uh, the inability of the worker to bring a knowable world, a safe world into being there is in frost. Uh, no god, no transcendental source of guidance or constellation. Nothing out there in the world, but the material conditions of our circumstances, uh, over and over again, and frost poems, uh, you see, you see speakers, you see the poet himself, uh, wanting to know and wanting to know means a pressing towards some revelation towards, uh, some, uh, um, a sense of the meaning of things. Uh, uh, search for some kind of a presence behind the way things are. Uh, that is the subject of the great sonnet design, uh, uh, also in a very different mood. Uh, the poem for once, then something, uh, it's also the subject of, uh, neither out far nor in deep, uh, which, um, uh, I asked you to read for today and is on to 20.

Speaker 1:          40:31          Um, I won't, I won't read it since we're running a little short of time. Uh, the, uh, people on the shore that frost describes, they're looking at to see, they're watching for something. Uh, but is there anything to watch for? Is there any, anything uh, coming, uh, uh, no, it doesn't appear so, uh, but as he asks a, at the end, when was that ever a bar to any watch? They keep, uh, in these poems, um, well when frost does give us images of God or some informing presence, that presence is imagine negatively, uh, uh, to be, uh, uh, well, uh, as a kind of malevolence perhaps, uh, to be inferred from the arbitrariness and, and cruelness of nature's destructive force of the conditions of life, of the people frost is describing.

Speaker 1:          41:48          So, uh, if in in frost, you, you can't look to God for it, uh, what kind of, uh, what kind of hope can be, uh, offered? How can you save your soul? This is a question for us is interested in, uh, in his own ways. Uh, he's interested in redemption, uh, important word for Stevens to, uh, conclude. Let me look quickly with you at at two great late poems. Uh, one on two 22, uh, is called provide, provide, well, I'll read, I'll read this. The witch that came, the withered hag to wash the steps with Pale and rag was once the beauty Abishag the picture pride of Hollywood, too many, far from great and good for you to doubt the likelihood die early and avoid the fate. Or if predestined to die late, make up your mind to die and state, make the whole stock, exchange your own if need be occupied the throne where nobody can call you crone. Some have relied on what they knew others on being simply true, what worked for them might work for you. No memory of having starred atones for later disregard or keeps the end from being hard, better to go down dignified with boughten friendship at your side than none at all. Provide, provide and in some recordings for us then says or somebody will provide for you.

Speaker 1:          43:50          It's a, it's a very funny poem. Uh, and you've got triplet rhymes there to make sure you know that frost is, is joking and it feels like light verse but of course, what are we laughing at? Uh, uh, public achievement, moral stature. They're of no use. Uh, the end is hard and it's going to be hard no matter how you come to it. So you better look out for number one. This is, this is good old fashioned American wisdom. Uh, what is scathing about it, uh, is that frost gives up all justification for self interest. Uh, there's no for it except self interest itself. Uh, and then for us as even that won't work, uh, the choice is a terrifying one of no friendship and boughten friendship, uh, which really isn't a friendship at all. Uh, in short, uh, the only thing to do in life is to provide and provide is just what you cannot ever adequately do as the husband in home burial knows.

Speaker 1:          44:58          This is a poem written in the depth of the depression and also at the height of frost fame. Uh, and, uh, the, uh, you, you could see that kind of grim refusal to apologize for boughten friendship, uh, as a kind of well as a kind of apology, a for his own popular success. Well, let me conclude by just pointing to another poem. Uh, a late poem, uh, directive, a poem published in 1947 a, it's on the page following, uh, a poem published after the Second World War, uh, written, uh, written about the postwar world. Uh, it begins by in a sense a rehearsing or taking us back to frosts own, um, initial move north of Boston back out of all this now too much for us back in a time made simple by the loss of detail, burn, dissolved and broken off like graveyard, marble sculpture in the weather.

Speaker 1:          46:11          There's a house that is no more a house, and that is where he's going to take us in the poem. You can see that house, uh, as uh, uh, in a sense, um, a version of the home in home burial. Uh, the, uh, the fraud, the frost describes it here. Uh, you know, movingly as uh, well an image of a home that has lost a of a home that has failed, um, and, and yet frosts, uh, attention is drawn, uh, interestingly to a play house, uh, that is part of that household. Uh, he says, uh, in the middle of the poem on two 25, first, there's the children's house of make believe some shattered dishes underneath the pine, the play things in the play house of the children week for what little things could make them glad. And then for the house that is no more a house. And so on.

Speaker 1:          47:19          At the end of the poem here, uh, frost gives us however, in a kind of alternative to this image of the failure of the home and the failure of, um, uh, the workers life, uh, in, um, our own imaginative access to a spring, a source, uh, above, um, above the house. That was the water of the House that nurtured it. That was, it's, uh, um, refreshment. He says, your destination in your destinies, a brook that was the water of the house cold as a spring is yet so near its source, too lofty and original to rage. I have kept hidden in the instep arch of an old cedar at the Waterside, a broken drinking goblet, like the grail under a spell. So the wrong ones can't find it. So can't get saved as saint marks as they mustn't in there. He sounds like a child, doesn't he?

Speaker 1:          48:31          I stole the goblet from the children's play house. Here are your waters in your watering place. Drink and be whole again beyond confusion. Uh, there the, the, uh, goblet, the, uh, um, uh, the tool that frost comes to, uh, is a, uh, it's a tool from romance quest. It's the grail. Uh, it's, it's, uh, the, uh, uh, a cup of the last supper. Uh, but what is it? It's in fact, a broken goblet from the children's play house. Frost returns us there too early sources of imagination in a children's play. Uh, and it gives us at least imaginatively, uh, in this shared journey with him, uh, access to a kind of primal, we're freshmen, uh, what he calls our waters and our watering place. Uh, it's a, it's a disillusioned and self consciously ironic promise of salvation, of wholeness, uh, but it's still a promise. Uh, and it's a promise of the powers of imagination and of poetry and of poetry made out of play and a child's play. Well, that's a good place to stop. Uh, next week, uh, we will, um, uh, go to work on William Butler. Yeats.
