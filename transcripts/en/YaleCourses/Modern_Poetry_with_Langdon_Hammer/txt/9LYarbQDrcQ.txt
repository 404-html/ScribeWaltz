Speaker 1:          00:01          First dates lecture, I was talking about a Yates is early development and, and stylistic transformation. Uh, over the course of roughly a 20, 25 year period. Yates has a long career, you know, really beginning, uh, uh, in the, uh, you know, late 19th century. And when, when we, the, the poems that matter the most to us today, um, are those that he starts publishing around 1915, uh, uh, in 1914, uh, and, and later, uh, but, uh, you know, that he's in really the middle of his, his, um, uh, uh, literary career at that point. Um, I, I suggested in looking at that early development, um, that, uh, uh, well Yates is, is seen as a kind of representative figure who somehow, uh, moves out of, um, uh, symbolism, uh, out of, uh, kind of, uh, uh, ordinate aestheticism towards a kind of heroic realism. Um, but I, I insisted instead that in fact the, the, the way though to understand that development is really a transition from one set of symbols to another.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Um, uh, as exemplified by the, the movement between, uh, uh, Angus and the fishermen in, in Yates is a early work, um, uh, the, uh, little poem, a coat, a that poem about that stylistic transformation, um, about the, the enterprise of walking naked. Uh, well, uh, it's, it's a poem that that reminds us that Yates is development was as he understood it, conditioned by his relationship to his audience. A Yates I said wanted to speak for and to the Irish people, uh, as well as, uh, to explain, uh, uh, Ireland and Irishness to an English speaking world, uh, abroad. At the same time, uh, even as he has a kind of intense, uh, identification with the Irish people, uh, he also in that little poem and, and other pumps fears being betrayed by the crowd, uh, fears being sold cheap, uh, complains of, of, uh, uh, complains of his reception.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Last time I, uh, alluded to Yates is involvement in the Abbey Theater, uh, beginning in 1904. This is an important phase of his career. When with the help of Lady Augusta Gregory, uh, and John Singh, uh, Yates, uh, tries to establish an Irish national drama, uh, sings, play the playboy of the Western world, which you may know, uh, it was set in the Aran Islands, uh, in western Ireland. Uh, this was a kind of turning point in the movement under misunderstood, uh, as a, as a satire on the Irish peasant tree. A Yates is a production of the play, uh, led to riots in 1909. And this is one of the, uh, uh, events. Uh, I think that Yates is a thinking about in the fishermen when he speaks of great art, beaten down, uh, the audience that Yates, uh, disdains and turns away from in the teens, uh, is, uh, importantly, uh, uh, middle class urban audience. Um, and, and that, that attitude of is, uh, it's, it's a motif. Uh, we find, uh, in other poets that we'll read and, uh, uh, I'd like you to, to, um, um, note it, uh, an attitude that we'll see in pound, uh, in Elliot in, in different ways.

Speaker 1:          04:34          The displacement of, uh, aristocratic and peasant cultures by, uh, an urban, uh, Bruges Z, uh, by that bat, the Dublin theater going audience, the, the, uh, the people at the center of a new, uh, uh, uh, Mongrel, uh, modern culture. Uh, well these are the people that Joyce depicts. So memorably, uh, in the daily life of Leopold bloom, uh, Yates is a very different writer and has a different relation to the world of Joyce's. Ulysses, for example, a Yates has a, has a kind of hostility towards this, uh, ascendant, uh, middleclass world in a hostility that you can view as a kind of anti modernism. Uh, and we're anti modernness, uh, that is again, an important component in Yates, uh, or, or maybe the right way to say it would be that Yates, his sense of his own modernity of what it means for him to be modern, uh, emerges in, in, um, a defiance of, uh, certain, uh, uh, new, uh, uh, social formations. Uh, and also through a fantasy, I say, uh, identification with the aristocracy and with the peasantry, uh, with these cultures rooted in a rural Irish Society of the past like pound, uh, like Elliot, uh, from a political and a social point of view, you could say that Yates is a reactionary modernist, uh, turning away from the ascendant social forms of the present towards a idealized past.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Or rather you could say, Yates seems to want to do this, seems to want to turn away from the present. Uh, expresses the desire to, in fact, however, uh, Yates, his eyes remain really fixed in the kind of horror and fascination on the, a cataclysmic events of his time on the political life of his time in which he is himself. Very much involved. Uh, Yates is in fact a, a far less nostalgic thinker then either Elliot or pound, at least as I understand the, uh, the, the stance that I'm, I'm trying to describe, which is a kind of ambivalent and complicated one, uh, emerges a powerfully, uh, in, in the Palm Easter 1916, uh, uh, on page one oh five. And in this book, and I'd like to spend some time with that with you. Easter 1916, uh, the subject of this poem is the Easter Uprising.

Speaker 2:          08:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:05          The Irish Republican challenge to English domination that briefly established an Irish state that led by Patrick, uh, Pierce, uh, who, uh, along with, uh, in fact, all but one of the leaders of the insurrection was executed. Uh, these events have, uh, you know, still have a kind of central and powerful place in, in modern IRS consciousness. If you, you'd go to Dublin and you enter the post office, the one of the important scenes of the, uh, rebellion, uh, you, you find great a wall paintings of scenes from, uh, from the, the rising, uh, almost, you know, stations of the cross. Um, uh, the, uh, uh, well Dublin is an interesting place to be with this poem and mine, uh, partly because you, you realize, uh, when you were there that that it's the city center is a small one. Uh, and that, um, well Yates has houses, was not far from uh, the post office.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Uh, and, uh, the um, uh, world that he's writing about a is something, uh, very, uh, intimate and familiar, uh, of which he is a part a. And that is in fact one of the important points of departure for this poem. He says, I have met them at close of day coming with vivid faces from counter or desk among gray, 18th century houses, Dublin, them being the revolutionaries I have passed with a nod of the head or polite meaningless words or I've lingered a while and said polite, meaningless words and thought before I had done of a mocking tail or a jibe to please a companion around the fire at the club. Being certain that they in I but lived where motley is worn all changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty is born motley signifying their Irishness as if Yates and, and these men and women.

Speaker 1:          10:46          He speaks of shared only their Irishness. In the second stroph fee of this poem, he proceeds to talk about to isolate individuals, uh, particular, uh, figures, uh, of the revolt, which, uh, uh, your, uh, editor identifies at the bottom of the page that woman's days were spent in ignorant goodwill. Her nights in argument until her voice grew shrill. What voice more sweet than hers. When young and beautiful she rode to Harriers. This man had kept a school in Rhode, our winged horse, this other, his helper and friend was coming into his force. He might've won fame in the end. So sensitive is nature seemed so daring and sweet is thought. This other man I had dreamed a drunk and vainglorious loud. He had done most bitter wrong to some who were near my heart mud gun, yet I number him in the song. He too has resigned his part.

Speaker 1:          12:03          He in the casual comedy, he too has been changed in his turn, transformed utterly a terrible beauty is born gates. This is describing his interaction with uh, uh, and his distance from, uh, purse, uh, and the others in that first stanza. And then in the second he's saying something like, uh, I used to see these people all the time. Uh, I was proud, however, I kept myself apart from them. I felt we had nothing in common but motley, uh, our Irishness. But all that is changed by events. They have become political martyrs to the future Irish state. And I am obliged to remember and honor them in my poetry. Even those I disdained my poetry, uh, which, well, the dedication to which had defined Yates's difference from them up till now. The poems, extraordinary refrain, a terrible beauty is born.

Speaker 1:          13:36          Uh, it returns in the poem like, uh, uh, like a chorus, uh, like the voice of some kind of abstract and impersonal chorus. Uh, and it, it, um, suggests a, almost a strangely impersonal event. Something that happens, uh, without agents making it happen. A terrible beauty is born a passive construction. Uh, take the first part of the refrain first all changed, changed, utterly, all changed, changed utterly. I think they've really three strong metrical accents in a row there. Uh, by all that three letter word, uh, highly [inaudible] word and word Yates loves to use. You'll see, you'll see him, uh, use it often. Yates means all of all of those people, all the people I've been describing, he also means my relation to them, the way I kept myself apart from them. Uh, he also means all, uh, everything plain and simple awe in the sense of everyone and everything, all conveying a kind of apocalyptic apical event.

Speaker 1:          15:24          That wonderful pile up of stress in that line all changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty is born. Another two, two strong, three beat lines in a row, they become a kind of, well, what a bell ringing in the poem, uh, peeling, uh, and, and, uh, uh, uh, announcing the coming of the birth of a new and terrible age. How can something be changed utterly? Uh, it's, it's how can, how can something be changed utterly? Uh, it doesn't that mean destroyed, uh, to be entirely changed. Uh, Yates is, is talking about an event that has brought forth a destruction, a destruction of the world before the Easter uprising. And Easter is an important resonance here. Obviously a Easter, another moment, uh, of death and transfiguration, Trans Trans Formation, uh, here. Uh, this destruction brings forth a new order, a new form of life that Yates cause terrible beauty. Uh, this may be the most memorable, uh, sentence in modern poetry. A terrible beauty is born. I said that, that Yates looks on, uh, uh, the modern, uh, with a sense of both the whore and, and a fascination of, of compulsion. Uh, almost, uh, well, uh, it's a terrible beauty. He sees that, that that draws him. Uh, in this way he sees the specifically the passion of the Revolutionaries Act. Any fines that beautiful Yates aestheticizes their political action. He finds beauty in it.

Speaker 1:          17:41          It seems even, or especially because it is terror filled when the change, uh, that it enacts is utter, uh, which is to say, ah,

Speaker 2:          17:56          a change. That means blood

Speaker 1:          18:04          define bloody events. Beautiful. What do you think about that? How do you, how do, how do you describe the, the, uh, the politics, uh, if he like, uh, of, of such a position? Uh, well, how does the gates stand in relation to the events he's describing? Easter 1916, equivocates, uh, like that phrase, terrible beauty. Uh, the palm is full of contradictions of contradictory feelings. It takes the side of the nationalists. It also makes the ante nationalists the English or pro English or unionist case. It sees the dead as heroic martyrs. Uh, it also sees them as, uh, uh, ideologues, uh, as a, uh, as a Stoney hearted, uh, um, uh, uh, political activists, uh, it sees the dead as lovers to, uh, it sees them as dreamers. A Yates looks at them with pity, with admiration, with scorn. Uh, he speaks of them as a mother would have her children. Uh, all of these attitudes and others to are, are, uh, are held in suspension in the palm. And, uh, you can hear them together. Uh, Yates moving from one to another, uh, with Oh, uh, uh, uh, incredible speed and agility in that final straw fee of the poem. On the, the next

Speaker 2:          20:07          Paige,

Speaker 1:          20:11          listen to, uh, to how quickly Yates modulators from one, one feeling, uh, one image, uh, to another in these really very short, a quick three beat lines. Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart. Oh, when may it suffice? That is heaven's part our part to murmur. Name upon name as a mother named her child when sleep at last has come limbs that had run wild. What is it? But nightfall, no, no, no, not night, but death was it needless death after all for England may keep faith for all that has done and said, we know their dream enough to know they dreamed in our dead in what if excess of love bewildered them till they died. I write it out in a verse, Mcdonough and Mcbride and Connolly and Pearse now and in time to be whatever green is worn are changed, changed utterly. A terrible beauty is born.

Speaker 1:          21:36          This is really moving poetry. Uh, you know, remarkably so. Uh, and that may be the most important fact about it. Uh, when Yeats aestheticizes the political, uh, he makes it moving, uh, moving in the literal sense of, uh, I think emotionally engaging in Cathartic, uh, he can specifically converts the political into tragic action, tragic action, which as spectators, uh, the poet and the reader, ourselves, uh, are meant to be passionately and imaginatively engaged. Uh, which is also to say implicated through hates his poem. Uh, Easter 1916 goes on, happening, uh, happening, uh, in a sense, uh, uh, in and, and, and, and even to us, the poem makes us see the political as a space of passion and of contradictions like art. Uh, and it requires us to understand history, not in moral terms, uh, such as good and evil, but rather in aesthetic terms, a pity and terror.

Speaker 1:          23:04          These become crucial terms. Uh, the terms that, uh, Aristotle in his poetics used to define tragedy. Uh, when the, when the bombs went off in, in London last year, uh, I thought about, Yay, it's, and, and, and, and, uh, what he might have thought or written about this as I, as I said last time when I showed you that letter to pound his, uh, uh, Yates is, um, London apartment, uh, is essentially across the street from where the number 30 bus blew up. Uh, and interestingly, um, strangely make of it what you will, the man who, uh, uh, detonated that a bomb, uh, as I understand it, uh, had studied the aids, uh, at school and in leads. Uh, there's a, there's a way in which he hates his poetry of this period, uh, goes on resonating in, in, uh, the world we're, we're living in Yates's Yates.

Speaker 1:          24:15          His sense of his own implication in, in history, uh, well it's something that we see in the, uh, intensive stylistic transformations that his writing undergoes a part of the resonance and power of that famous refrain, a terrible beauty is born. Uh, is that this beauty is being born not only in the world, but in Yates is poetry. Uh, something remarkable is happening, uh, to, uh, the poet, uh, and to, uh, his, his language. At the same time a Yates is saying, even simply on one level, I will write differently. Henceforth, I must, uh, Yates is stylistic. Changes in this way, are coordinated with respond to the historical changes he witnesses and participates in, uh, in particular, uh, uh, coordinated with the violent, uh, emergence of, uh, through civil war of, of the Irish state, which Yates would serve as a senator, uh, in the 1920s.

Speaker 1:          25:25          Yates in this period makes and remakes his work out of passion, uh, sort of as he images to malt in the breast, uh, uh, a, uh, uh, to Molt from which new modes of poetry, new modes of self knowledge, uh, emerge for Yates. Yates is poetry is full of images of birth, uh, and he tends to represent birth as an explosion, a bursting forth, a bursting forth of, of energy, uh, or presence, uh, in some sense that can't be contained or constrained in existing forms. Uh, I'll say, I'll say more about this next time with reference to Yates is late poetry. Uh, what I want to stress now is that Yates sees passion at work. Uh, in the same way in history. Uh, powerful superhuman forces emerge from or invade a human actors and change. Uh, one consequence of this view is that for Yates, a history starts to look like a palm, uh, or, uh, it starts to conform to laws of poetic imagination or of tragedy, if you like,

Speaker 3:          27:01          uh, of myth. Uh, it, uh, well, uh,

Speaker 1:          27:08          in the Easter rising,

Speaker 3:          27:11          uh,

Speaker 1:          27:13          purse and the other's for Yates, uh, invoke, uh, as, as they, the revolutionaries themselves deliberately and rhetorically did, uh, invoke ancient Irish heroes, uh, uh, purse, uh, is seen as in Yates, as poetry and in popular lore as Hoolan as a kind of Avatar of, of, uh, um, uh, you know, the, uh, um, uh, mythic Irish hero, uh, at the same time, uh, as the superhuman enters these historical characters in this way, uh, there's also, uh, well, um, uh, um, an energy that you would have to call subhuman, uh, be steel. Uh, that does, uh, as well. Uh, in his late poem, the statutes, which you don't have, Yeats says,

Speaker 3:          28:12          um, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          28:16          what, uh, when, when, um, uh, Paris, uh, summoned Coolin to his side, what stopped through the post office as if, uh, the revolutionaries action, um, uh, brought forth at once, uh, the presence of a legendary hero and a beast that might, uh, be stocking, uh, through his, his embodiment in his presence. Yates saw history in symbolic and mystical terms. Uh, this is a poet who, with his wife, practiced automatic writing, who believed that the dead spoke through the living this, this a cult. Yates is, is a genuinely and wonderfully strange thinker. Uh, he elaborated a systematic, a account of mind in history. Uh, and as I said last time talking about the song of Wandering Angus, uh, and, and Yates is interest in Alchemy, which was developed. Uh, it isn't in fact necessary for you to grasp. Yates is system which you'd have to go to his, a book called a vision, uh, to begin to do.

Speaker 1:          29:37          It doesn't necessary, uh, for you to grasp is a cultism in order to, uh, read his poetry. Uh, well, uh, Yeats said that the, the voices that he communicated with a on the other side gave him a metaphors for poetry. This is what they, this is what they deliver him. Uh, they also gave him, as he put it, stylistic arrangements of experience. Uh, this, the, the cult gives Yates aesthetic forms for understanding, um, individual psychology and historical event. This is, I think, uh, how we need to understand, uh, the, uh, the various, a cult symbols, uh, in, in, uh, another great, uh, poem, uh, from this phase in his career. A little bit further on the second coming, uh, on page one 11.

Speaker 2:          30:47          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          30:57          Uh, turning and turning in the widening gyre. The Falcon cannot hear the falconer. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. The blood dimmed tide is loosed in everywhere. The ceremony of innocence is drowned. The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand. Surely the second coming, is it hand? The second coming? Hardly are those words out. When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi troubles my site, somewhere in sands of the desert, a shape with lion body and the head of a man, a gaze blank. And Pinellas as the sun is moving, it's slow thighs while all about it. Real shadows of the indignant desert birds, the darkness drops again. But now I know the 20 centuries of stony sleep, we're vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle and what rough beast, its hour come round at last slouches towards Bethlehem to be born.

Speaker 1:          32:28          Another poem of birth. Uh, notice how very casual Yates is in that second stair OFI how self consciously fantastic and speculative he is. He doesn't insist that the apocalypse is at hand only that some revelation is, uh, in fact, uh, this poem's power, uh, lies I think in it's, uh, not only its inability, but it's unwillingness to specify the content of that revelation. Yates suggests that we think of this historical moment as the second coming, but this is not the return of Jesus that Christianity prophesizes Yates sees the second coming as an image, as a myth and idea, a metaphor, a certain stylistic arrangement of experience. It comes out of what he calls spiritus. Mundi. Okay. Semi technical term a Yates is name for something like the collective unconscious of all peoples. A kind of repertoire of, of archetypes, uh, from which the symbols that we use to understand the world derive, uh, it is, uh, um, this, uh, this is, well, this is really I think a, um, a radical if not heretical idea for the national poet of a Christian people.

Speaker 1:          34:00          Uh, Yates is saying that Christianity is only one symbolic order among others. It has a history. Uh, it is now passing away as it once came into being. And he's also saying that the birth of Christ in Bethlehem was a nightmare for the world. It altered the world that it changed utterly. It change that Yates sees as the end now of the Christian ear and not its fulfillment. There's isn't there to the disturbing suggestion that Christ himself was a rough beast. Uh, Yates developed this idea or develops another version of it in a somewhat earlier pump. Uh, that's interesting in relation to this one. And let's, let's turn back and look at it. Uh, on page one of three, uh, that the Madge I, um, uh, again, visionary poem, uh, where Yates is saying, ah, I see, I see in my mind's eye, this is the action of the poem takes place in Yates is imagination.

Speaker 1:          35:14          Now, as at all times, I can see in the mind's eye in there, stiff, painted, close, the Pale, unsatisfied ones appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky with all their ancient faces like rain, beaten stones in all their Helms of silver hovering side by side, and all their eyes still fixed. Hoping to find once more being by calvary's turbulence unsatisfied. The uncontrollable mystery on the beast steel floor, the Madge I hear are again, a, an image, a kind of visionary symbol, uh, an image available in the mind's eye at all times. Uh, they are unsatisfied by calvaries turbulence, Calvary's turbulence. Uh, remarkable phrase, uh, unsatisfied by the scene of Christian martyrdom, uh, because they recognize that history is cyclical, uh, and that the cycle that they saw coming to being can only be completed by another such birth, uh, not by Christ's death and resurrection. Notice here how, um, uh, Yates images.

Speaker 2:          36:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:53          What does that, the core of Christ's birth? Uh, it is an uncontrollable mystery on the beast steel floor on the floor, uh, on the bottom, uh, on the ground, uh, where the animals dwell. Uh, okay. The second coming, uh, it seems is a, is, um, as Yates imagines that I kind of similarly unclear controllable mystery and the, the, uh, the energy, uh, the, the new presence that it releases into the world, uh, is, uh, is that of a beast. The, uh, the divine enters the human in these poems of Yates, uh, through the beast steel. It's a powerful and disturbing idea. Uh, there's a, uh, another very powerful and disturbing poem, uh, that literalize as this idea. Uh, and that is later. And the Swan on page one 18, a, a, a poem that is a sonnet though. It doesn't quite look like it at first. Uh, a mythological poem, uh, that seeks to give a mythological image two or for the kinds of

Speaker 2:          38:46          okay.

Speaker 1:          38:48          Epical and apocalyptic historical change that, uh, Yates is living through, uh, in the 1920s in Ireland. Uh, it's a, it's a, in certain ways it's a, it's a beautiful palm and a grotesque one. Uh, at the same time, uh, a sudden blow the great wings beating still above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed by the dark webs her nape caught in his bill. He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. How can those terrified vague fingers push the feathered glory from her loosening thighs? And how can body laid in that white rush but feel the strange heart beating where it lies a shutter in the loins, in genders there, the broken wall, the burning roof and tower and Agamemnon dead being so caught up, so mastered by the blood of the air. Did she put on his knowledge with his power before the indifferent beak could let her drop

Speaker 1:          40:26          history? What makes history happen is imaged here in the form of the rape of the human by the divine in the form of a beast. The form of a Swan, the myth that Yates takes up is a of Zeus is rape of, of the maiden later, uh, whom he attacks, uh, as a swan. Uh, the offspring that the rape in gender, uh, includes Helen, the terrible beauty for whom the Trojan war was fought. Uh, also quite Clytemnestra, uh, the wife of the Greek Lord Agamemnon, whom Clayton Nestra murders on his return from Troy. Uh, those future events, our, our, uh, our, our glimpsed in the, in the, the, uh, [inaudible] of this poem and the final six lines, uh, they are in a sense a compressed and imaged and contained in the rape itself. Uh, there's a, there's a kind of radical foreshortening of, of temporal experience at a what a Yates images as the orgasmic union of the divine and human.

Speaker 1:          42:02          A shutter in the lines, uh, bringing about the sack of Troy, uh, the murder of the king. Uh, all of that future contained in this, uh, generative ambiguous violence, uh, in the presence that the poem describe the present that the poem describes, uh, in effect in the, that middle part of the poem, uh, Yates collapses creation and destruction, uh, suggesting that the same beast steel energy flows through both of these acts, uh, here, a divine force reduces to brute power, uh, in somewhat the same way as it does in the match. I, and the second coming, uh, one result of this is Yates is this is interesting. His, his lack of interest, uh, in the God, this isn't a poem about Zeus. It's not a poem about the Swan. Uh, he doesn't name the Swan, uh, just as he doesn't name the rough beast, uh, in, in the second coming, uh, what the swan thinks or feels or intense. It doesn't matter. Uh, the swan is really only a force and Yates is concerned, is rather with the human experience of that force. Uh, which is again, another manifestation of terrible beauty. Uh, Yates explores that experience, uh, which is an experience of suffering here and a violation, uh, through a series of rhetorical questions, uh, which are a crucial poetic device for Yates.

Speaker 1:          43:56          Yates is a poet who asks questions, questions, well, they're different. Even rhetorical questions are different, aren't they? From statements of fact. They're more like, uh, propositions like speculations, uh, that were asked to test through empathic identification with, in this case, uh, the poem subject Lita, uh, uh, this, this is, this is what the form of the question invites I think, uh, in eastern 1916, I talked about Yates as partial complicated identification with the suffering martyrs, uh, of that poem. Uh, well that identification here is reimagined and we're invited into it too. Troublingly I think, uh, the frightening, uh, experience that Yates evokes here is the imposition of the divine on the human, uh, helpless breast on breast. Uh, it's a, that's a wonderful phrase. The repetition of breast links them, uh, makes us see them together side by side, one on top of the other. It even, I think, identifies the divine and the human makes them hard to tell apart a binds them. Uh, even while we are being confronted with their difference, uh, lead leader feels the beating of the swans heart. And that heart is strange to her. That simple, powerful word, the poems. A great final question, uh, concerns that perception. Did she put on his knowledge with his power? Did she know the heart she felt or could she only feel it?

Speaker 1:          46:01          What difference would it make between those two things, between knowing that heart and merely feeling it? Uh, it's the difference between, uh, knowing, uh, history, understanding its patterns and motivating forces, its causes, intentions, and merely feeling it merely suffering it, uh, serving as its instrument or vessel in object to be dropped when it's no longer useful, uh, to know history, to be able to, to put on the God's knowledge with his power would be to have access to histories meaning, uh, and therefore it to be more than merely subject to it, subject to it's capricious and, and, uh, violating, uh, forces. Uh, Bill Gates doesn't answer the question. Does he? Uh, well, uh, why not? Probably because there isn't an answer. Uh, the further implication is I think that, um, whether or not we can have access to historical knowledge, the only path to such knowledge is through submission to it's the steel or brute power, which is a kind of shattering experience in this poem. Uh, well on, on Monday, we'll, we'll look at some of the figures in Yates is late poems, uh, who represent a kind of knowledge to be had through, uh, an experience of well violation, uh, or of shattering power, uh, characters such as the mad old men, uh, or, uh, uh, crazy. Jane, uh, in the eights is late poems.
