Speaker 1:          00:12          The bridge. Uh, in order to get to the bridge, I want to go back and just say a few more things about, uh, voyages and about crane, uh, in general, uh, in, uh, Crane's letter to, um, the distressed editor of poetry magazine, Harriet Monroe, uh, that pros, uh, uh, selection included in the, the back of your book crane defense, his palm app, Melville's tomb, and, uh, specifically defends, uh, well, uh, what he calls his, uh, recourse to the logic of metaphor. Um, what, what does the logic of metaphor mean for crane? Well, um, he, um, distinguishes a, his criteria for Monroe's on page nine 68. Uh, you know, he says, my palm may well be a elliptical and actually obscure, but in your criticism, uh, you've stated your objections in terms that allow me the privilege of claiming your ideas and ideals as theoretically, at least quite outside the issues of my own aspirations.

Speaker 1:          01:33          And he says, to put it more plainly, as a poet, I may very possibly be more interested in the so called illogical impingements of the connotations of, well, that's a misprint. I, it should be words on the consciousness and their combinations and interplay in metaphor in this basis. Then I am interested in the preservation of their logically rigid significations. Uh, crane is talking here about, um, well, uh, putting a kind of priority in his poetry on connotation a over denotation. Uh, he's interested in the ways words relate to and through other words, uh, before or in addition to the ways in which they relate to, uh, the things of the world in this sense. Uh, crane, uh, well introduces us to a sense of poetry as, um, as a linguistic environment that, uh, uh, is constructed through words, uh, relating among themselves, uh, in ways that play upon our, um, uh, imagination systems of association, uh, that in, in effect our contribution to, uh, complete the thought, uh, all of which supposes and seeks a kind of special intimacy with us as readers, um, gives us a work to do.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Um, I suggested that the sea is a kind of figure or metaphor in cranes work for this linguistic space. Um, an imaginative space to which we are summoned in a poem like App Melville's Tomb. Uh, he's because he's concerned with specifically, um, how messages are transported, um, with, uh, the, uh, um, uh, well what he calls the dice have drowned men's bones. Um, you can understand the, the, uh, the poem is an allergy for Melville. Uh, it's also a about reading Melville, uh, and getting his message, uh, that is reaching back into the past and becoming for Melville, the kind of reader that crane himself seeks a as he describes it, uh, in, um, uh, his letter to Monroe. Uh, in talking about voyages to, I suggested that the, our voyage is three rather. The third section of the poem, I, I suggested that the image of infinite con sang Gwyneth was a impart an image of this linguistic mixing and promiscuity that crane is interested in, uh, in, in poetry in this poem. Uh, the mixing of words in poetry is analogized to the mixing of, uh, body of bodies of lovers.

Speaker 1:          04:56          Love here is also like death, uh, because it's a shattering experience, uh, through which, uh, the self is remade a and changed, um, with and through another, uh, this is a process of transformation. Uh, it's one that crane costs Trans member meant, um, which is, uh, a way of evoking, not so much a sharing of identity, but rather some kind of exchange of it, uh, which is an experience of the self changed, uh, and the self redeemed, uh, in, in cranes eyes. This is exactly what the wasteland, um, uh, contemplates and draws back from, uh, doesn't, uh, embrace turns away from it's what in Crane, uh, love promises. It's what poetry song promises. Uh, the, uh, the space of the palm, which is, uh, like as crane imagines that, uh, a space of love is set apart from ordinary life. Um, you, you, uh, uh, Mike, uh, contrast the kind of song and singing, uh, that you find in this palm with Elliot's Love Song for Prufrock, uh, crane recovers in this poem, a kind of heroic blank first, uh, the medium of heroic drama, uh, and uses it for the speech of a poet lover who celebrates the power of sound to make its own sense through the affirming force of desire.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Uh, he imagines this again, as a kind of resurrection of some kind. What do you, what he talks about is what has to happen after the wasteland. Uh, in this sense, a crane is talking about some kind of passage through death. Uh, and you can understand that death as cranes, admission as I suggested last time of the, um, uh, illusory nature of, um, uh, rhetoric, uh, of, um, of love, a itself of the power of a desire which, uh, crane is always realistic about you. You could say, um, the poem voyages, uh, treats its theme is really the triumph of desire, uh, even in defeat. Uh, that's also, uh, the, the, um, the theme of that Melville's tomb and it's the grand theme of the bridge. The bridge is cranes. Great Poem, uh, about America. Uh, we'll, uh, let me

Speaker 2:          08:03          bring up a picture of him. This is a, this is crane in 1927 or 28. It's an unclear exactly when the photo was taken by Walker Evans, a great American photographer and cranes friend on top of 'em, one 10, Columbia Heights where crane lived, uh, in view of Manhattan.

Speaker 1:          08:27          And, uh, the bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge, the bridge is cranes. A great poem about America or about the idea of American. I'll say more about what that means in a moment. Uh, and it's a reply, uh, self consciously. So, uh, to the wasteland. Uh, I suggested that the shortness of the wasteland was a, in some ways, um, uh, kind of argument against epic, uh, in the modern world, uh, uh, argument, uh, about the impossibility of epic vision in a culture which lacks a shared myths, shared symbols, a against this, this lack a crane proposes, uh, the bridge, uh, the Brooklyn Bridge as a kind of central organizing symbol, uh, for modern culture. Um,

Speaker 2:          09:30          the, uh, uh, this, this is a picture of the bridge being built, um, uh, in the 19th century. Uh, it's important that as crane, uh, looks at the bridge, uh, as a, as a modern symbol that we remember that it wasn't built in 1920 when I've, I've forgotten now the, the year in which it is a, but it was a, at least, I think 60 years old at this point. And you can see when, um, uh, Roebling bridge, uh, was first created. There's no Manhattan skyline

Speaker 1:          09:59          for it to reach to a, when crane, um, um, turns to the bridge as a symbol of the modern, he's already looking back to an earlier vision of the modern, uh, if you like. Uh, and in doing so, he is, uh, joining many other American artists. This is a photograph, uh, by a Walker Evans, uh, who, who took,

Speaker 2:          10:26          uh, many images, uh, of the, uh, the bridge, um,

Speaker 1:          10:30          with its cables and a Gothic Arches, all of which play into crane's palms and complex ways. Uh, this is

Speaker 2:          10:41          the, the very great poem, one of many Pa poem painting, uh, by, uh, uh, Joseph Stella that, uh, appears in the Yale Gallery, a fantastic work, uh, one that crane hadn't seen actually when he began, uh, the bridge, but which in all sorts of ways, um, uh, is, is, uh,

Speaker 1:          11:05          Moni us with, with his vision, including, um, the ways in which, uh, the, uh, sublime vision, uh,

Speaker 2:          11:14          that it offers, uh, includes, uh, darkness. Uh, and, and I would have to say, ah, okay,

Speaker 1:          11:23          uh, perhaps, uh, a frightening or, or, um, um, sinister elements. Um,

Speaker 2:          11:31          it is a, also importantly, a moment in American art when artists like a Stella, uh, like

Speaker 1:          11:42          a crane or interested, uh, here's a Joseph Marin,

Speaker 2:          11:46          uh, uh, with another image. This one painted from the bridge, uh, are in

Speaker 1:          11:54          which artists are creating a kind of an idiom that involves, includes abstraction, uh, shows us, uh, images of the world in realist representation that are being transformed into, uh, something, uh, semi abstract and symbolic. A crane is, is very much involved in the same kind of, uh, activity as these artists. These are more images, uh, uh, from Evans. Uh, these of course shot from underneath the bridge and, and showing it, uh, uh, as a kind of abstract, uh, form a rising, uh, into, uh, uh, the New York skyline. Um, this is, uh, this is the title page of, of cranes a poem as it appeared in the, uh, uh, black son, uh, addition a limited edition, uh, in Paris in 1930. Uh, it's, uh, uh, first publication followed shortly thereafter by publication in New York Crane took the Brooklyn Bridge, uh, as, um, as a kind of symbol of a structure.

Speaker 1:          13:22          The structure of spiritual action as he understood it. Underpinning American history, it seemed to him to embody an idea that he saw variously embodied in American history. Uh, for crane. American history is a series of new world visions, uh, all of them, uh, versions or avatars of what he also calls it Lantis. Uh, the city sunk beneath the waves in platonic Nif, uh, that promises to return, uh, in return us to some kind of redeemed community. Uh, Atlanta says cranes name for a kind of promised relation to the world. Uh, that's been a glimpse but also lost a to aim at Atlantis, uh, as the poem does. And as crane says, American history does, uh, is to go interestingly, confusingly, simultaneously into the past and into the future, uh, to rescue or recover something from history promised for the future, uh, in to bring that future into being crane understands, uh, the mythic work of the poem, his poem, a as a kind of act of

Speaker 2:          14:51          a one that has this kind of chronological mission of going back into the past and forward into the future. The title page here. Uh, you can't make it out, but it's, uh, in, um, uh, uh, clear in your anthology carries a, an epigraph from the book of Job, uh, from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it. Uh, the, the, um, um, epigraph from job introduces these two motions as being essential to a crane's imagination in the poem that is going to and fro back and forth. And by going up and down, uh, you can see, uh, these two motions, uh, in fact, um, uh, easily, uh, visual izable in the form of the bridge itself, which drives, it's pylons that into the river, uh, and rises up in these gothic structures in order to carry, uh, people back and forth across the river.

Speaker 2:          16:02          Uh, the, uh, epigraph is also a kind of joke, uh, because crane wrote this poem, a like job tramping around, uh, across, uh, the, uh, the northeast, uh, from, uh, one apartment or House to another, uh, or one couch, uh, to uh, another, uh, and uh, wrote it in Europe, uh, and uh, California, uh, and elsewhere. Um, him self crane, being, um, uh, um, without, um, uh, secure, uh, station, uh, in, in, um, uh, the poem, uh, in the, the writing of the poem, a crane's, um, interest in the poem, uh, in, uh, Hobos, uh, and marginals, uh, of a, of many kinds, uh, as well as with pioneers and other kinds of travelers, uh, all, um, represent, um, uh, figures, uh, of spiritual questers who are, um, in a sense without a station in life, but rather in motion as, um, uh, crane himself was the, um, this is the table of contents of the poem.

Speaker 2:          17:31          Uh, it's helpful I think to, uh, uh, look at it because it's confusing. Um, it, it, uh, the poem consists in this, uh, pro, um, which I'll, I'll talk about in a few moments. Uh, when crane actually dedicates as long poem actually dedicates as poem to the Brooklyn Bridge is if you could dedicate a poem to the bridge to an object, uh, a first section called Ave Maria, which is spoken by Columbus, Columbus, not on his way to the new world, but rather on his way back. Uh, he speaks to us, uh, on his way back. Uh, and it introduces the theme of, uh, carrying the message or the vision forward into the future. Um, the question of, you know, how to retrieve or recover, um, uh, the, uh, the vision of the new world, uh, is initially introduced there. Uh, then there's a section called Pow Hatton's daughter, uh, which refers to Pocahontas, uh, invokes, um, a, a, um, a vision of the American continent, uh, through a series of poems.

Speaker 2:          18:51          Uh, the Harbord Dance Van Winkle, uh, the, the river, the dance in Indiana, uh, which all, uh, explore various moments in the history of, um, the, uh, um, uh, um, conquering of the continent. Uh, there's a section called cutty Sark, uh, which, um, uh, introduces us to a, um, um, a drunken, a visionary, a sailor in a bar, uh, on a sand street, uh, in Lower Manhattan. Uh, that figure it seems to metamorphose, uh, into, uh, well Whitman in the, a section for Cape Hatteras in a sense, the center of the poem, a Cape Hatteras, uh, is concerned with, um, the invention of flight. Uh, and, uh, uh, at links a Whitman, um, to, um, uh, well, really a, the whole history of, uh, American, uh, invention. Uh, there are, uh, a series of songs called three songs. Um, uh, another section called Quaker hill, uh, evoking, um, in 1920s, um, uh, New York suburb, a really or, or Connecticut Hills, uh, which, um, uh, brings us up to the present, uh, as does the poem, uh, the tunnel, the tunnel being that most closely based on the wasteland, uh, and describing a kind of infernal journey through the New York subways. Uh, and then finally, um,

Speaker 1:          20:48          uh, Atlantis, uh, a kind of a visionary, uh, rhapsody that invokes the, uh, uh, object of quest that the poem is concerned with. Uh, the poem as a, in this way charts various journeys, a westward and eastward, uh, back and forth in time. Um, discovery means nothing without the relaying of the vision and the kind of carrying it forward. Um, the bridge is a concerned with in these various sections with a series of, of, um, well a series of symbols, symbols that are very frequently vehicles or transports, uh, from, uh, Columbus's ship to, uh, the subway to the Wright brothers, uh, airplanes, uh, transport. Uh, this is in the sense, the grand theme of the bridge. Uh, the root meaning of metaphor is to carry something over to transport it. A crane is, is, uh, um, for crane metaphor is as central, um, a concept, inactivity, uh, as translation is for pound.

Speaker 1:          22:13          But in a crane, the emphasis is on imaginative transformation. That's really what a metaphor has to offer. Uh, the central symbol of the bridge. The bridge itself, you could understand as a, as a metaphor for metaphor, a metaphor for a primary human capacity. Uh, uh, the capacity to posit an object of desire, frosted eyes. There were that lifted altars, uh, to posit an object of desire that expands the horizon of the real, what's possible. Uh, and in so doing a violates a existing systems of cognition and projects the vision of a new world. Uh, this also means that the poem is constantly producing new symbols for this activity. New Metaphors, uh, Crane said at a, in one letter of the bridge in becoming a ship, a world, a woman, a tremendous harp as it finally does, seems really to have a career. Uh, and so it does, um, this is, um, again, the Black Sun edition, which I recommend that you go to buy Nikki. And look, it's one of the most beautiful books. Uh, I know, uh, it's a great big book with these, uh, big margins, uh, and, uh, read, um, uh, headings. Uh, let's look at the pro. Um, uh, as both an introduction to the poem and as a, a kind of a summary, uh, in, in miniature of it's a intentions, uh, claims procedures.

Speaker 1:          24:03          How many dawn's chill from his rippling rest the seagulls wings shall dip and pivot him shedding white rings of tumult building high over the chain, Bay waters, liberty. Then with inviolate curve, for sake our eyes as apparitional, as sales that cross some page of figures to be filed away till elevators drop us from our day. And the poem begins with another, a resurrection of some kind in this case, not a seal rising from the water to a gaze toward paradise, but rather a seagull, uh, rising as many times before, how many dawn's chill from his rippling rest. Uh, and this, this seagull becomes a kind of, um, uh, image of a cent, uh, and, and flight, uh, uh, the, the, I guess, uh, um, uh, it, it is an initial image of transport. Uh, the bird sheds white rings of tumult, uh, and there's that word from voyage is three.

Speaker 1:          25:22          You remember him where death if shed presumes no carnage, but the single change here, uh, again, there's an action of shedding as the bird throws off the darkness of the night and rises, uh, building hi, uh, then disappears. The vision vanishes. We're in the world of work. Uh, we are in the office spaces of lower Manhattan till elevators drop us from our day. And if we've just gone up, now we go down again. I think of cinemas, panoramic slights with multitudes bent towards some flashing scene. Never disclosed, but hasten to again for told two other eyes. On the same screen. Uh, the movie theater, the movie theater is a new machine of transport, uh, in the 20s. A kind of mass entertainment that cranes poem will in a sense, try to rival and provide, uh, a, uh, uh, complementary, uh, uh, way of, uh, imagining a collective vision, uh, anyone he offers.

Speaker 1:          26:34          Next is the bridge, uh, which he, uh, addresses in this Archaic Language, uh, archaic and intimate language as if, uh, Brooklyn Bridge could have a subjectivity and the, he says across the harbor silver paste, as if the light on the bridge, uh, um, we're being seen as a kind of movement that the bridge was itself involved in, uh, as though the son took step of the yet left some motion ever unspent in Nice stride, implicitly thy freedom staying the, uh, this is, uh, this is a wild kind of address to, uh, architecture, uh, as if the bridge were animate, uh, with the power of motion, uh, and as if it had a kind of motion that was w fountain, like, and could not be exhausted, then suddenly were given another, uh, vision.

Speaker 1:          27:40          Uh, the, um, uh, the threat of suicide suddenly rises up in the poem out of some subway scuttle cell or loft, a bedlam. Mites speeds to thy parapets tilting their momently shrill shirt ballooning adjust falls from the speechless caravan. Uh, the possibility of failure seems dialectically to be written into this poem's grant, uh, ambition. Uh, it's, it's, um, uh, it's wish for a assent and, and redemption, uh, crane, uh, turns then, uh, two, uh, images of, of the, uh, of the, of the bridge in, uh, the New York skyline down wall from girder into street noon leaks, a rip tooth of the skies, a settling all afternoon the cloud flown Derek's turn thigh cables breathe the North Atlantic still as if it were a kind of ship. Uh, I, I don't know about you, but I, I, uh, am thrilled every time I read a crane's, um, uh, language, uh, of evoking the, uh, the kind of sensual power, uh, of, uh, New York architecture.

Speaker 1:          29:15          Oh, harp and alter of the fury fused. How could mirror toil align? I quiring strings. It's the bridges harp and alter instrument of music and site of worship. Terrific threshold of the profits. Pledge Prayer of pariah and the lovers cry again. The traffic lights that Skim, Nice unfractionated idiom, immaculate sigh of stars beating thy path, condense Aternity. And we have seen night lifted in nine arms under the eye shadow by the peers. I waited only in darkness. Is Eye shadow clear the city's fiery parcels all undone already. Snow submerges in Iron Year. Oh, sleepless is the river under the vaulting. The see the prayer dreaming Saad. Suddenly the bridge crosses the Atlantic. It crosses, uh, the, uh, American continent unto us lowliest and now it's a kind of divinity that he beseeches to descend and of the curb ship of the bridge itself seen as a kind of vehicle of a curved ship.

Speaker 1:          30:41          Lend a myth to God. Uh, the poem, the poem means to, uh, incorporate, uh, the threat of failure and the threat of death, uh, and move beyond it, uh, much as it aims to incorporate, um, the wastelands despair and move beyond it. Uh, it is, uh, kind of just a kind of prayer, a kind of pledge that belongs to lover or pariah. Um, these are our speech acts that, um, our models for the kind of poem that you're reading, uh, the intention is to somehow create from a series of fragments a hole that would be an unfractionated idiom as crane calls it, which would be a kind of pure and redeemed language. Uh, there's that phrase in the last stanza of the curve ship, meaning, uh, both derived from the bridge. Uh, I think an in partaking of it, uh, he asks the Bridge to lend a myth to God land, you know, to land is, is to, uh, give, knowing it will be given back.

Speaker 1:          32:19          Uh, this is not a permanent, uh, name for God. It is not the one symbol for God. It is only a one in an ongoing series of acts of naming, which are all acts of metaphor, uh, which are all acts by which, uh, something from the past is joined to the future. Something far as joined with something near out of some kind of spiritual need or vision. Well, the poem was, uh, begun, uh, crane. Like this idea both ends at once. Just the way you build a bridge, uh, by writing the poem and by writing a Atlantis and gradually, uh, over time, uh, moving towards, uh, the middle. Um, the, um, this is, uh, the final section, uh, Atlantis. In fact, why don't we turn there for a moment? Uh, this, this is this kind of splendid, outrageous, um, uh, Shelly in a lyric speech, uh, through the bound cable strands, the arching path upward veering with light, the flight of strings.

Speaker 1:          33:30          And you can image now, uh, in your minds that great Stella painting, um, over in the gallery, uh, taught miles of shuttling moonlights syncopate the whispered rush telepathy of wires up the index of night granted and steel transparent meshes fleck lists the gleaming staves sibling voices, flicker wavering Lee stream as though a god. We're issue of the strings here. Uh, at the end of the poem, a crane imagines a kind of a cent, uh, through the structure of the bridge, which becomes a grand musical instrument, a harp. Um, the, uh, uh, visionary, uh, appears here, uh, in fragmentary ways as in line 25 where a sheerly the eyes like seagulls stung with rhyme, uh, slipped and propelled by glistening fins of light. A crane talks here about the eyes moving up, uh, through this structure. Uh, like the seagull that we saw in the first line of the poem.

Speaker 1:          34:48          Um, the, the, the object of desire, the, the, uh, uh, uh, version of paradise crane offers us. Is there an in line 42 or so, uh, where he talks about the bridge as vision of the voyage bridge lifting night to Cyclorama mic. It should be a crest of deepest day, uh, oh choir translating time into what multitudinous verb, the suns and synergy of waters ever fuse as if somehow the sun and water on the space of the, uh, bridge and beneath it a created what crane calls a multitudinous verb recast and myriad syllables, some of cafe. That's of course Columbus's goal cafe. Um, oh, love thy White Pervasive Paradigm. It's also a vision of love. Um, here, um, crane gives us a kind of vision of the word, the multitudinous verb as what his poem, uh, draws its a energy from and what it moves towards.

Speaker 1:          36:05          A, it is not a Christian word. Uh, importantly, uh, it is, it is I think a a name for, for a creative process that accessed in and through our powers of language. The word in cranes pump, uh, is secular and historical, uh, but yet it unfolds from what he calls an ever presence beyond time. A towards which the poem is, is questing. Uh, it is, uh, uh, creativity or kind of power of world making a that's embodied in our language crane is imagining a post Christian religion, uh, for which America provides iconography and myths. Uh, the poem is it an encyclopedia of America and places in American culture, uh, popular culture, uh, in, in, uh, in burlesque, in national winter garden in the river in Virginia. There's slang, jazz advertising. All of that worked into the poem. Uh, the palm combines I kind of popular storybook history of figures like Rip Van Winkle and, uh, the most challenging abstract modernist poetics. At the same time. Uh, every line is, is loaded with, uh, symbols and reference linking up to other lines in the same way. Uh, in the same way crane is suggesting that every moment in American history links up with others, uh, and with the larger structure of action, uh, of which it is part a crane's poem is therefore, uh, I think, uh, at once knowingly naive and hyper sophisticated, uh, both of these, uh, things at once.

Speaker 1:          38:05          Um, crane composed the poem, uh, through the funding with the funding of Otto Kahn, a businessman, philanthropist, uh, and he explains his outline of the poem, uh, at, um, uh, still a relatively early period of composition in that letter to Otto Kahn that I included for you last time. Um, he, uh, uh, well I'll just, uh, I'll, I'll refer to it. Um, uh, briefly, uh, the, um, uh, keeping mind that table of contents. I, I showed you before, there's a kind of story of American history told in large, uh, or in, in the poem in which crane moves from Columbus to, uh, the, uh, um, the section called Po, Po Hatton's daughter, uh, where the theme is the betrayal of the land, uh, in the conquest of the continent. Uh, in the middle, uh, in, in Cape Hatteras, uh, when crane is, is writing about a invention and technology, uh, in American culture, his theme is also the civil war and World War One.

Speaker 1:          39:26          Uh, again, a kind of a betrayal of vision by which technology becomes a means to kill. Uh, in, um, his letter to con, uh, he talks about having a section on John Brown that would take up the topic of slavery. Uh, this section was never written, but there are traces of it you find in the section called the river. Uh, in each of these sections, uh, crane turns to, uh, and, and looks to, um, um, uh, again, hobos marginal figures who are, uh, emblems of lost promise who, um, uh, seem to represent possibilities, uh, included in but also marginalized by, uh, American history, American culture. You can understand these figures such as the sailor that you meet and cutty Sark as versions of the authors to whom crane appeals throughout through illusion and epigraph. Melville, uh, Dickinson, a Po in the tunnel, uh, crane reaches back to these authors canonical for us, Co authors that you study, but that were, uh, uh, largely left out of accounts of American literary history in the 1920s who themselves appeared to be marginals. Um, these, uh, these are our versions of a kind of, um, uh, community that crane wants to recover and carry forward, uh, for the, uh, creative promise that they seem to embody. Well, um, let me, um,

Speaker 3:          41:17          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:17          Just point to, uh, the poems. Let's say a two different endings. Um, the, uh,

Speaker 3:          41:29          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:31          History of the composition of the poem is different from the uh, uh, sequence, uh, that you read. Uh, because crane began at both ends. Uh, the end of the poem is really a, in one sense, the middle. Uh, when Crane Completes Cape Hatteras at last, after, um, uh, struggling, uh, with this section, uh, for a couple years, um, he, um, uh, completes, uh, the span of the bridge in one, uh, particular, uh, uh, image one, 1 cents. And that's, uh, towards the end of the section on six 36. Uh, and he, he invokes a in quotes, Whitman, Whitman, again, a, uh, here, seen as a kind of a marginal, uh, who is a recovered for American culture through the poems, uh, imaginative act. Um, Whitman is addressed, recorders, ages, hence that's a quote from, from Whitman's Calamus poems, uh, recorders ages. Hence, yes, they shall hear in their own veins on canceled thy Shore Tread Whitman, uh, and read the by the oral, the halo round.

Speaker 1:          42:50          I head of pasture shine. Panis Angelica, a bread of angels. Uh, here, uh, uh, Whitman's, um, Whitman becomes a kind of figure for, um, uh, a kind of secular communion. Yes, Walt afoot again and onward without halt. Not soon, nor suddenly know, never to let go my hand in yours, Walt Whitman. So, uh, that is, that's a kind of a moment when in this hand clasp, uh, a certain, um, uh, aspiration of the poem, uh, is completed, uh, and, and a connection, uh, to, uh, the past is a achieved, uh, in assertive. The conclusion of the poem that we find in, um, uh, uh, at the end of Atlantis, uh, is, is another, uh, vision. Uh, and I'll conclude with that. Um, it's, I think, uh, something to be contrasted with this triumphant and reassuring, um, um, conclusion that a Cape Hatteras offers, uh, here.

Speaker 1:          44:05          Well, here are the last to sublime stanza of the poem migrations that must needs void memory inventions that cobblestone the heart unspeakable bow bridge to the Oh, love the, I pardon for this history, widest flower. Oh, answer of all anemone. Now while the pedal, the sun's about as hold, oh, thou whose radio and stuff inherit me. It Lantis hold dye floating singer late here, Atlantis is brought into being with, uh, the singer himself on the verge of drowning I floating singer. And then finally, uh, uh, crane dedicates himself to this, uh, vision, which he calls ever presence. So to design ever presence beyond time, like spears in sanguine of one tolling star that bleeds infinity the or fix strings. Now the cables of the bridge have become the strings of Orpheus is liar. Say Dariel. Phalynx is leap and converge. And again, you can see the structure of the bridge image there.

Speaker 1:          45:24          One Song, one bridge of fire, is it cafe now pity steeps the grass and rainbows ring the serpent with the eagles in the leaves whispers and Tiffany in Azure swing. The poem ends, uh, with this question. Is it cafe Columbus's question, uh, an error, a mistake. Uh, it is the nature of the object of desire to be misnamed, uh, precisely because it has no one name. Uh, and even in this a error, this kind of a defeat, um, there is for crane, uh, in affirming of the scope of desire precisely through its failure to be contained by a single reference. Well, we'll stop now. Um, and, uh, I know you have done your work and, and gathered a, a, a, a note a wheel, um, collect these, uh, and, um, uh, put together our own annotated version of the poem.
