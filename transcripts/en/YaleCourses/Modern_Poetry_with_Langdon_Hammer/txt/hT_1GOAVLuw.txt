Speaker 1:          00:13          Langston hughes is our subject today. Let, let's start with a poem. You probably know a, it's on page six, 87. It's really the poem,

Speaker 2:          00:33          uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34          for which he uses perhaps most known and was first known. Uh, he, uh, composed at when he was 18 years old. Uh, it, uh, is the Negro speaks of rivers. Uh, you can see that it's dedicated to w e B Dubois. Dubois was the, uh, uh, important, uh, uh, leader and, uh, uh, speaker who was the editor of the magazine, the crisis, uh, which published this poem, uh, and, and the crisis, uh, had a circulation of 100,000 readers, a at least, if not more, uh, and uh, uh, isn't that way, you know, quite a debut to have. And it, it put Hughes immediately in a political magazine in a race magazine. Uh, and in some ways in a, in a popular magazine, not a one of the little magazines of modernism.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:38          I've known rivers. I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. My soul has grown deep like the rivers. I bathed the knee, the Euphrates, when dawns were young, I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep. I looked upon the Nile and raise the pyramids above it. I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen it's money. Bosom turned all golden in the sunset.

Speaker 1:          02:26          I've known rivers, ancient Dusky rivers. My soul has grown deep like the rivers. He's a speaker, is a, uh, particular ISED voice. And I, uh, at the same time that he is a general one, uh, the Negro, the Negro speaks as well, well speaks of and for, uh, people, uh, as a representative figure, uh, like Hart Crane, a Hughes returns to Walt Whitman, uh, Walt Whitman, uh, in his, uh, ambition to speak of and for America, uh, at the same time, uh, unlike crane Hughes takes on Whitman's versification, uh, he, uh, Whitman's ways of making a line. Uh, his free verse is, uh, uh, uh, uh, paratactic style in which things are listed as opposed to cranes, crumpled and condensed quite trains stands as a here. The, uh, the relation, uh, between the particular and the general, between the individual and a type a is one of the pumps subjects.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Uh, it is a poem about knowledge, about identity and about history to what the eye nose is. Rivers. Uh, we learned just a few things about those rivers. They are ancient as the world. They are primordial, they are even, it seems prior to the human in the sense prior to human blood, which conventionally is a way of representing race, of speaking about race. So the rivers are older, it seems than any race. Uh, and yet, uh, they're also, uh, an image of, um, of, um, of racial blood, uh, and, and, uh, flowing, uh, Hughes's is he's writing about a universal from a particular point of view. Uh, the flowing of rivers is like the flowing of blood in the poem. And to know them is to know what is under or inside particular racial experience at the deepest level. Uh, in this sense we might paraphrase that that title, um, uh, the Negro speaks of human life and history, uh, as the Negro has known it.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Uh, it's a poem concerned with human life, uh, in history, the very most general terms of experience from the particular perspective of the Black Speaker. Uh, and from the perspective of black experience as the poem goes on, uh, the rivers are named and the in localized, in, in history, the Euphrates origin of civilization and the side of the Jewish captivity in Babylon, the Congo evoking Africa and its people, the Nile side of the Pyramids, those, the arc type Typo, human monuments, a fixed in place and, and, and pointed to the sky. And in that sense, uh, counter post to the flowing river, uh, being the Negro here means knowing all of these places. Uh, the palm begins interestingly in the perfect present tense, uh, I've known, I've known my soul has grown. Uh, this is an interesting tense that evokes simultaneously, uh, the past and the present suggests a co past carried over and into the present.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Then in that third stanza of the poem shifts into the simple past. I bathed, I built, I looked, I heard, uh, the Mississippi, the line about the Mississippi continues this pattern, but then in the middle of the line breaks out of it. I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen it's muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset. Uh, there, there's a way in which the story of, of Lincoln and the freeing of the slaves that he was, gets to at that point, uh, it seems to, uh, well break out of the particular and, and then, uh, reach into this, uh, perfect, uh, present tense, uh, to, uh, evoke some kind of ongoing, um, experience moving from the past to the present again. And then, uh, the poem, uh, goes back into, uh, that, um, that perfect, uh, presence.

Speaker 1:          07:53          Uh, there's a sense of a past action that is ongoing and active, uh, present, uh, in the poem. Uh, the rivers, they are deep, dark dusky. Uh, they also at this pivotal moment in the poem turn Golden, uh, the poem projects, a view of black history in which to be black means simultaneously to be the product of black experience across history at particular moments, uh, uh, uh, particular moments, particular times, and also involved in the deepest, uh, trans historical meanings of the human. Uh, the journey that the poem, uh, describes links different times and places, uh, and ultimately, uh, white and black. When Lincoln, uh, America's white present president goes down to New Orleans, uh, and resolves to end slavery. Uh, this was a remarkable poem, uh, by, uh, uh, a young man to two, right. Uh, it's, uh, uh, not, not living here. Let me hold off this, that interesting photo for a second. Uh, this is a, um, a picture of Hughes, uh, at, uh, still, uh, in the, uh, mid twenties when his work was just being read for the first time. Uh, it's a remarkable poem, I think for a young poet to begin with. Uh, you could compare it to other, uh, early, uh, um, sort of inaugurating or initiating poems that we've talked about such as cranes, legend, uh, or the love song of J. Dot. Alfred Prufrock, uh, uh, and other, other sort of entries into poetry.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Uh, we could compare its vision of the past two to that which we find in perhaps pound or, or Elliott, which leads me to this general question of how do we place Langston Hughes a in this course, uh, in more generally, uh, how do we, uh, uh, position the black language and experience in his work, uh, in the general context of modern poetry? Where else, where else in this course does the Negro speak? Uh, uh, have you seen black people or heard black voices, uh, in other poems? Um, blackness figures, uh, in frost, interestingly, a as a kind of charged symbolic color, but, uh, in a very generalized way that isn't linked immediately to race. Although it certainly could be seen to in certain contexts. You could say the same thing. I think about Steven's a, although you do in Steven's encounter certain black figures, including the word nigger in one poem, uh, there's, uh, there's no question though that, uh, in, in Steven's a in frost, uh, the poetry, uh, doesn't aspire to, uh, doesn't pretend to, uh, represent the experience of African Americans.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Uh, Marianne Moore, whom we'll read, uh, soon. Uh, it has a poem called black earth. Uh, when Ezra Pound Reddit, uh, he wrote to her and asked since he didn't know he had never met her, was she Ethiopian? Uh, this is a truly a crazy, uh, question. Uh, but an interesting one, uh, in this poem, uh, more, uh, speaks, uh, about an elephant. And, uh, and, and from the point of view, if an elephant in ways that might seem to possibly speak for black people, but only on the level of fable or allegory, a crane comes closer. Uh, if you turn back a few pages, uh, to in your anthology to the crane section, the first poem, uh, in, uh, that selection, it's called black tambourine. Uh, that's on six oh seven. Uh, that poem describes, uh, again, a kind of symbolic, a generalized type of the black man as a figure trapped and what crane called a mid kingdom, uh, in the popular imagination, the mid kingdom between man and beast, uh, uh, crane sees the, the, the black entertainer, uh, as a, as a kind of figure of the artist.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Something like his traps is wanderers. Uh, Charlie Chaplin, a crane had initially intended to include, uh, uh, in, in the bridge a section that was to be a dramatic monologue spoken by a Negro Porter, uh, on a train, uh, that, uh, plan fell away. Uh, but there are, uh, still, um, uh, traces of that intention in his section of the poem called the river, uh, which, uh, uh, tries to evoke aspects of, of, uh, black experience, uh, to integrate jazz blues spirituals into a crane's poetry. Um, and, and make them part of the history that the bridge tills a crane, uh, might have had as one model for the inclusion of a African American expressive forms. Surprisingly, perhaps Elliott, uh, when oh ho that a Shakespearian rag, when that breaks into the wasteland, uh, jazz, uh, and, uh, a distinctively African American form also enters a Elliot's poem. Uh, Elliot was writing, however, from, uh, the, uh, uh, point of view of white Europe, uh, and blacks tend not to figure in his poetry a except perhaps as figures of otherness.

Speaker 1:          14:23          Uh, those, uh, perhaps hooded hordes that swarm, uh, across the plains in the wasteland, uh, by Nikki includes in its answer a pound papers. Uh, an interesting selection of poems published with, um, Elliot's Juvenalian not so long ago. Um, uh, selection of, of, uh, uh, poems that circulated between pounds and Elliot and certain other friends, which are a obscene racist, uh, limericks, uh, that Eliot wrote a about King Bolo and his big black bastard queen. Uh, this is too, is part of Elliot's Irv though not part of the public form of it. Uh, and it's, uh, important, uh, uh, information, uh, about at least one way right in which, um, black life figured in the high modernist, uh, um, uh, imagination of Elliot and others. Um, here's that photo. I, uh, started to show him a moment ago, I suppose. Uh, he uses the only, um, modernist poet who begins as a bus boy.

Speaker 1:          15:36          Uh, this is, uh, this is a photo from 1925, uh, taking it the Wardman Park Hotel, uh, for, um, newspaper, uh, uh, story about Hughes. A Hughes had been, it seems discovered by the poet Vachel Lindsay at lunch, uh, when, uh, Hughes there. So the anecdote goes, presented his poems to Lindsay and Lindsay, uh, taken with them, went on to read them that a night at a reading Lindsay was giving. Uh, of course, uh, uh, this was all carefully orchestrated by Hughes if he's a bus boy. He has also a poet and once, and he's really in a sense almost in costume there, uh, imposing for the newspaper photos. But it's a, it's an interesting and, uh, important, uh, uh, image of the, uh, uh, man Hughes was a, as he began to write poems like the Negro speaks of rivers. Uh, if white poetry, uh, turns away from African American people in their experience in modernism, a Hughes also himself, uh, intended to, uh, turn away from white poetry, uh, the Negro artist and the racial mountain. That prose piece, I've asked you to read a, at the end of your anthology on nine 64. Uh, it makes this argument very forcefully.

Speaker 1:          17:12          Uh, it begins by, um, uh, huge contracting, uh, his own intention, uh, as an artist, uh, with that of, uh, one of the most promising of the young Negro poets who, um, as a Hughes interprets his ambition, uh, uh, wants to be like a white poet. Uh, and in that sense, we'd like to be quite a Hughes is a writing here, uh, about Countee Cullen, uh, a, uh, uh, rival artists whose work you can sample on page seven, 27, uh, and, uh, following in your anthology, um, Hughes wants to get out of the curious condition, uh, of wanting to, uh, write white, so to speak, uh, by redefining what it would mean to sing, uh, in, in poetry on nine 65. He, he, uh, uh, juxtaposes two to black audiences. One a what he calls a self styled high class Negroes, uh, that represent a bourgeois, um, uh, norms or the aspiration to them, uh, and that seek, uh, what he was called Nordic culture.

Speaker 1:          18:51          Uh, and he contrast them rather to, uh, another, uh, expression of, of black life with which he identifies himself. Uh, these are the low down folks, the so called common element and they are the majority. He writes, may the Lord be praised the people who have their nip of gin on Saturday nights and they're not too important to themselves or the community or to welfare or to learned to watch the lazy world go round. They live on seventh street and Washington or State Street in Chicago, and they do not particularly care whether they're like white folks or anybody else. There joy runs bang into ecstasy, their religions source to a shout work maybe a little today, rest a little tomorrow, play awhile thinking while, oh, let's dance. These common people are not afraid of spirituals as for a long time. They're more intellectual. Brethren were were, and jazz is their child.

Speaker 1:          19:54          Uh, and he continues, uh, he juxtaposes ecstasy shouting jazz, uh, against what he calls here. American standardizations, uh, uh, they, they furnish a wealth of colorful, distinctive material for any artists because they still hold their individuality, their individuality in the face of American standard and standardizations. And perhaps these common people will give to the world. It's truly great Negro artists, the one who was not afraid to be himself in which I Langston Hughes aspire to be. Um, these are important statements. Uh, they a show, um, uh, Hughes's ambitions. They show him positioning himself in relation to another African American writer, uh, other, uh, African American, um, uh, audiences, uh, for, for culture, uh, in making the move, uh, that he is doing here. Uh, move it. That's really deeply, uh, uh, influential in American literature and poetry, which as a whole descends from Hughes rather than from county colon.

Speaker 1:          21:13          Uh, he uses still, however, doing something similar after all, uh, to the other modern poets. We've been reading in this course and I want to suggest some of the continuity's between Hughes. Uh, and, uh, these other writers, uh, like Yates, uh, for example, Hughes wanted to be a representative figure to speak for, uh, people. Uh, and we speak of, um, uh, the Irish renaissance just as we speak of the Harlem Renaissance, uh, of which, um, Hughes was a central figure, like Williams, uh, like more like crane and like frost. Uh, also, uh, he was, was very conscious of being an American poet, um, uh, issuing a European examples, uh, for the most part, uh, and seeking to bring into poetry lives in language that had not been seen previously as poetic material. Uh, at the same time, uh, like pound. And like Elliot Hughes was interested in a long historical view, uh, and he makes links between people of different times and places in a, what was a global vision for Hughes of history.

Speaker 1:          22:45          Uh, like crane, uh, he was published his first book, uh, in 1926, the weary blues, uh, like crane, uh, Hughes's, uh, you, you could call him a second generation modernist. He's, um, uh, you know, consciously coming after a figures like, uh, Elliot and pound, uh, uh, Yates and frost for that manner. Uh, this book to, uh, is published by Canape. Alfred cannot a publisher of Wallace Stevens, his first book harmonium, uh, so crane, I'm, excuse me. So he uses in that way very much part of the same New York poetry world in which well, uh, uh, um, Stephens and, um, crane, uh, and others are appearing like frost. A Hughes wanted to get a vernacular speech into poetry, uh, in like frost. Um, Hughes for the most part, did not write for little magazines, but rather popular ones. As I was suggesting, a, in fact, both frost and Hughes went on to make a living in poetry and they have a kind of national fame, uh, a general readership, uh, that really none of our other poets did.

Speaker 1:          24:12          Uh, like pound, uh, like Yates in the teens. Uh, Hughes is, uh, uh, is interested in what he calls a naked style, uh, uh, kind of, uh, aesthetic aesthetic. Uh, like the other poets. Um, we've been reading, he uses the city poet, he's a metropolitan poet. Uh, any styles himself as we've just seen against, uh, middleclass tastes in norms and expectations and importantly, like the other modern, it's, uh, he finds no consolation in traditional religion. Uh, even well. He sometimes works with spirituals, uh, and, and often invokes a Christian motifs in his poetry, uh, in all these ways he uses is I think, helpful to read at this point in the semester, partly because a hits affinities with the other moderns once you start to recognize them, uh, help us to see a kind of whole picture. But then, uh, just having said that, uh, we have to, uh, we have to start talking about Hughes's difference.

Speaker 1:          25:34          Uh, if he is an American poet, uh, he is just as importantly an African American poet. Uh, if he is, uh, an internationalist like pound and Elliot, uh, he's interested in the international struggle of the worker and the oppressed racist. Uh, he's, this is a, this is Hughes writing about a journey to Cuba that he made. Uh, he, uh, traveled, uh, particularly in the 30s. Frequently as a, as a kind of a representative of black Americans, uh, sponsored by, um, left groups, uh, and traveled to, uh, uh, well Soviet Russia, uh, among other places. If Hughes's style is, is stripped down and naked, uh, it is, uh, used to describe a people who have been stripped of dignity and identity. If he's a city pot, uh, he is not a poet of the village, uh, or of London. Uh, but rather of Harlem, uh, and, uh, if, if God has withdrawn from the world of fuses poems, uh, God has, has a, uh, has left people not to Ellie odic, uh, despair and a epistemological anxiety, uh, but rather to rape and murder.

Speaker 1:          27:18          Uh, you might remember the, the last presidential election. Do you remember that? Uh, uh, John Kerry, uh, always in search of a theme, which he never quite found, uh, seized for a little while on, uh, the phrase let America be America again. Sounds good. Uh, it's the title of a poem by Langston Hughes, which, uh, carry, uh, also made note of, um, uh, when he referred to that, uh, um, when he, when he quoted Hughes, um, which, uh, was resonant, uh, which, uh, uh, sounded a good and all sorts of ways, uh, and which had the added advantage of, uh, letting carry, uh, a quote, a black writer. Uh, but then, uh, as you, if you remember, this will also remember, uh, pundits, uh, quickly pointed out that, uh, this was, uh, not, uh, a poem, a nostalgic for a golden era of democracy, uh, but rather a protest poem, uh, about the inequities of American history.

Speaker 1:          28:28          And it was written by a leftist who, uh, um, uh, had ties to the communist party. Uh, whoops. Uh, this is, uh, this is Langston Hughes, that's a Russian script on the left. And he was, he was in the middle, uh, surrounded by a variety of comrades, uh, in, in Russia in the 30s. And, and, uh, uh, last, uh, this was not a what John Kerry wanted to project a, or here is Hughes with two, uh, Soviet soldiers. Uh, also from the 30s, he was as much photographed, uh, in many different roles and, uh, public, uh, scenes. Uh, and there's a vast archive of his papers at, by Niki from which these images come. Uh, although, uh, he uses, uh, uh, reputation is, is a little bit like frosts, uh, in, in having this, this general readership. You know, he's, he's a, he's a poet. You, you probably read even in elementary school, uh, he poses all sorts of political problems that frost does not, uh, well, uh, here is, he was with somebody else, uh, someone more acceptable to be photographed with a WC handy.

Speaker 1:          29:52          Uh, in some ways the father of the blues as he's, uh, uh, called, uh, and, uh, a, a close friend of, of Hughes's. Uh, let me talk about Hughes and the blues. Here's an image of a illustration of Hughes's poem to blue by the African American artists, Jacob Lawrence, uh, Hughes from the weary blues forward. Um, frequently, um, presents his poems as a forms of music, uh, as allied to, um, as, uh, identified with as perhaps metaphorical versions of, uh, African American forms particularly. But not only the blues, uh, later in his career, his readings, but sometimes be accompanied by music, uh, in his best blues homes. A Hughes is, um, here's this not, um, it's not trying to write words for music, I don't think, but rather, uh, is trying to write poems, uh, uh, that, uh, allude to, uh, and, and, um, uh, let us here in in metaphorical ways the musical traditions, uh, which they are drawn on and the culture and experience from which they come. A Hughes, uh, at his most powerful uses musical forms, popular musical forms for effects of compression, uh, and to develop really complex ironies often through repetition, uh, uh, usually built out of the three part structures of the blues. Let's look, uh, at the palm song for dark girl on six 91.

Speaker 2:          32:12          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          32:13          it is like many of Hughes, his poems. Uh,

Speaker 1:          32:24          it's a simple poem in it structure, uh, and yet, uh, that simplicity, uh, conveys a real verbal, uh, complexity. Uh, and the poem in its popular mode nevertheless invites a kind of close reading, uh, that we give to, uh, uh, that's demanded by a modernist poetry that presents itself as, um, uh, compressed images, stick difficult, uh, and so on. Uh, well let's, uh, let's look at it way down south in Dixie. Break the heart of me. They hung my black young lover to a crossroads tree way down south in Dixie, bruised body, high in air. I asked for the white Lord Jesus. What was the use of prayer?

Speaker 2:          33:33          Okay,

Speaker 1:          33:34          way down south in Dixie break, the heart of me love is a naked shadow on a gnarled and naked tree.

Speaker 2:          33:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:49          This is a song for a dark girl, uh, suggesting, um, uh, at once, uh, words for her to sing a dramatic monologue, uh, and also for in the sense of a kind of a homage or tribute to her, she is dark, uh, as in, uh, other Hughes poems. Uh, the word here seems to mean black. Uh, also darkened, uh, abused, grieving, shadowed. It's all held there in that simple word. Uh, way down south in Dixie, uh, align from the minstrel refrain. A, it's borrowed here in adapted a Dixie is a kind of shorthand name for a system and history of oppression in this poem. Uh, and, and the, the very, uh, jauntiness and pride of, uh, a, uh, a colloquial name like Dixie is, is played off of here, the melancholy and in grief of the context and that phrase way down that seems innocuous to but isn't it resonant as you, uh, as it is repeated in, as we feel our way into the poem, uh, it's formulaic, but it suggests that we're going, that this poem happens somewhere deep in Dark, somewhere a way down, uh, somewhere in the heart, in the heart, this system of oppression, but also, uh, as it will turn out in the heart of, uh, me as the poem develops it.

Speaker 1:          35:48          Uh, here, the, the, the, the mere phrase way down south in Dixie. Uh, and the, the mention of that name, calling up the tune, a summons, a, a kind of a history of, uh, oppression that would occlude the kind of story that Hughes wants to bring forward. A until here. Um, the minstrel phrase is taken up by here, a speaker who suffers, who is oppressed by this system of oppression. Uh, and she uses it to make her own music. Uh, as another huge pumps. Repetition.

Speaker 1:          36:33          The use of the reframe, uh, uh, makes everything that happens seem inevitable. It evokes here a repeated, uh, actions. Uh, it, uh, a kind of history of repeated acts, uh, in general, uh, in the case of refrains, uh, we, we, uh, they, they function in a variety of ways. A refrain that comes last in a verse unit, uh, would seem to convey the idea that, well, somehow things always end this way. Uh, here what we have is an instance of what we would call Anaphora. That is a refrain used to, uh, initiate, uh, a, uh, uh, a unit of verse. Uh, and the refrain is the, the first line of these stanzas. Uh, and it seems to suggest to the story always. This kind of story always begins the same way, way down in Dixie. This is the way into everything that's experienced in who, the poem, everything that's said, the parenthesis that comes then a repeated in the second line of each of these stanzas functions in an interesting way.

Speaker 1:          37:57          Uh, it suggests, I think that what is being said in them, uh, it's a kind of aside, uh, or some kind of interior reflection or Soliloquy, uh, perhaps a, a voice that must be kept inside. Does that first phrase break the heart of me? Uh, referred to the girl, uh, to her lynched lover. Uh, we're to the poet reflecting on both. Uh, probably answer is all three, uh, held to gather in a system of identification. Uh, that phrase, the heart of me is resonant. Uh, it is, uh, what holds these three together? A kind of shared heart. A, it refers to the heart, meaning emotion feeling, probably pride. Uh, but the phrase also suggests simply the center. Uh, the heart of me, uh, myself, my identity, uh, they, they hung my black young lover to a crossroads tree. They is superbly vague, uh, impersonal, plural, formulaic, dehumanized, a evoking a mob, a generalized body.

Speaker 1:          39:26          Then there's that phrase, the crossroads tree. There are a lot of suggestions in it. First of all, it evokes the tree of the Cross, Christ cross. Uh, then, uh, the cross is also a figure for, uh, I think the intersection of white and black as it is and the in the little poem called Cross, uh, on the page before you could a consult that, uh, and then the crossroads is, uh, it's one of the central recurrent scenes of the blues. It's, it's where Robert Johnson, uh, uh, the, uh, blues man was said to have made his pact with the devil. Uh, it is the place where choices are made, uh, where crisis occurs in a wandering and, and displaced life. Uh, that second verse, way down South in Dixie, bruised body, high and air. I asked the white Lord Jesus, what was the use of prayer?

Speaker 1:          40:31          Uh, now the parenthesis holds in it a kind of brutal image, something horrifying that must be set off slightly. Uh, the body is bruised. It shows the marks of beating of suffering, uh, in advance of murder. Uh, it's lifted high in air, not an honor or tribute, uh, rather to be lifted in this way is to lose all agency, uh, to be made lifeless. Uh, all of this presented as a kind of syntactic fragment in the poem, uh, not yet integrated into the poem, so to speak, wart it may be, and to not yet integrated into consciousness. Uh, the final verse, we'll go back to it, uh, in, in interpret that that image here, Jesus is quite a in a sense of pure untouched, redeemed, uh, but also because he is a, it seems a representative of white culture, a kind of mediator girl, uh, would seek to, uh, address, uh, the girl doesn't pray to him, but rather asks a question, a question about the use of prayer and, uh, Jesus notably doesn't answer.

Speaker 1:          41:50          Uh, in addition to, uh, repetition, um, a song form poems like this are made out of omission. Uh, and jumps from one stands up to another from one line to another. And one thing admitted here is any sense of Jesus's reply or perhaps the answer comes in the form of that final verse, uh, which repeats the first lines of the poem. Uh, this is the truth that it arises from and returns to. Uh, and it gives us a memorable image. Uh, the lover has become depersonalized and abstract, uh, merely a shadow. Uh, he is now though with his abstraction become love itself. The girls love perhaps Christ's love and love is a naked shadow on it. GNARLED and naked tree here, the repetition of naked, it's suggestive. It evokes the man's nakedness is helplessness and exposure. Uh, there's also a sense of revelation of coming to the naked truth. Uh, and this is something very different from the nakedness that Yates boasts of in his poems.

Speaker 1:          43:23          Uh, the blues is also about laughter. Uh, and uh, it is, uh, laughter that I guess I would like to, uh, and with, uh, while we have a few moments left, um, uh, laughter that, um, uh, comes out of, uh, the endurance of hardship. And suffering. Uh, this is a young youth laughing and here's a later one. Uh, and why don't we end with a later poem, uh, and that that's called life is fine. On six 99, 20 years, uh, after the poems I've been, uh, discussing it too, has a, uh, uh, a song form. Uh, and, and he, a blues singer speaking to us. I went down to the river and think of how many rivers appear in these poems. Uh, uh, I went down to the river, I sat down on the bank. I tried to think but couldn't. So I jumped in and sank. I came up once and hollered. I came up twice and cried. If that water hadn't been so cold, I might have sunk and died. But it was cold in that water. It was cold.

Speaker 1:          44:58          Suicide is contemplated and tried. Uh, uh, not quite a, because when the, uh, uh, uh, singer gets on top of the building, he decides, but it was high up there. It was high. And he's not about to jump. Since I'm still here living, I guess I will live on, I could have died for love, but for living, I was born not for love because that would mean dying. You may hear me Holler. You may see me cry, but I'll be dogged sweet baby. If you're going to see me die, life is fine. Fine as wine life is fine. Well, I think rather than say anything else, uh, I'll uh, stop right on time. Uh, and, uh, uh, promised to return on Wednesday to talk about William Carlos Williams.
