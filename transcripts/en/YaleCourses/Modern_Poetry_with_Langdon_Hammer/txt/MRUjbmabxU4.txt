Speaker 1:          00:01          On Monday. I will. Well, I, you know, I left, uh, I left off talking about this, this, um, which we call it, um, uh, exciting and dramatic, uh, ambivalence that one finds in the early Elliot, uh, that, uh, uh, expresses itself in his relationship to literary tradition. Uh, where on the one hand, um, he, uh, presents himself as a, a, a truly subversive and aggressive, um, uh, entrant into a literary tradition. Uh, someone who's really going to shake it up and transform it. And on the other hand, uh, as someone who is a traditionalist who is going to, um, uh, speak with deference and seek as he uses the word, he uses this conformity, uh, with the past. Somehow both these things are going on at the same time and in relationship to each other. Uh, there's, um, well in, in Prufrock itself, uh, uh, is a poem I think preoccupied, uh, with this kind of ambivalence, uh, that I'm describing.

Speaker 1:          01:26          Um, on the one hand, it is a, um, uh, a poem that introduces us to a speaker who lacks will, uh, and who, uh, seems, uh, timorous and timid, uh, and who hesitates before action. Uh, on the other hand, uh, he is a speaker who says to us, uh, there will be a time to murder and create a, as if creating and murdering, uh, were in fact, uh, in some relation. Um, and Mike go on at the same time. Uh, and in fact, if one does have some sense of creativity as involving a kind of aggression or even murderousness when might hesitate before, right. Um, these, these, uh, psychological, uh, dimensions that I'm describing, um, uh, have well a Friday in an oedipal, uh, dimensions that I think are, are readily apparent. Um, how is it possible for Elliot to claim the Authority of past literature, uh, without, uh, at the same time, um, either destroying it or, uh, utterly, uh, submitting himself to it?

Speaker 1:          02:53          Uh, this, this problem expresses, I think Elliot [inaudible] relation to the past. Uh, and, and is expressed as I was suggesting last time in the ambiguous use of quotation that seems to hover between some kind of a deferential honoring of the literature of the past and something much more provocative, uh, and often parodic. Uh, and you can think of the many different texts that, uh, Prufrock, uh, alludes to and borrows only some of which are traced in your footnotes. In fact, there's a great many more, um, excuse me. Uh, you, you, you find in, in your footnotes, uh, uh, that there are quotations from Marvell, uh, from the Bible, from Dante, from 12th night. Uh, well, there's that opening quotation, uh, from, uh, from Dante, from the Gospels, uh, to, um, Prufrock's world weary, Miss, uh, you know, he's, you know, for, I have known them all, uh, already known them all, uh, as a understood in the poetic context.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Um, uh, this, this seems to well express his sense of belatedness and, and of the everything having in some sense, Ben done already. Um, yeah. Uh, in, in, again for ADN or oedipal terms, terms that Harold bloom would develop as a reader of Elliot in his own criticism. Very influentially. Uh, you can, you can put the problem, uh, this way. Uh, how can Elliot come to write in the father's place without killing it, uh, or being overwhelmed by him, uh, in his confrontation with the past, neither he Elliot nor the past, uh, must be destroyed, uh, or the game's over, uh, Elliot there by swerves. You could say, I'll turn the actively, uh, from each of these except unacceptable alternatives, uh, in that kind of a back and forth in this you feel in Prufrock's delegations and wanderings, uh, you, um, see it, uh, throughout Eliot's early career in his funny mixture of all on guard, ism and traditionalism cause he's, he's both those things.

Speaker 1:          05:31          Uh, I've been describing this in psychological terms. We could also think about it in social terms and I think it's important to do so. Uh, this, this oedipal drama that I'm describing is also a social drama, uh, in important ways. Uh, here's a question. How, how does a young American, because that's what he was, uh, how does a young American go and win a place in English literary culture, Insert himself in a tradition that includes Shakespeare. Milton Tennyson were Wordsworth insert himself not only as a member of that tradition, but as a central explainer of it, uh, and, and tastemaker, which is in fact what Elliot would become. Uh, last time I pointed out that Elliot's, uh, expatriation is going from the US to London was a rejection not only of a America and American miss, uh, but, uh, in particular, uh, a rejection of his father and his father who died while he was abroad.

Speaker 1:          06:51          Um, uh, and there was a certain amount of question about would Elliot a return in time to see his father before he died? Um, in a very short time in London, Elliot becomes more English than the English. It's a strange and marvelous, uh, if fascinating, uh, uh, development, he learns or creates a certain style of Englishness that he then goes on to teach to the English themselves. Uh, this is what a Williams William Carlos Williams and, and in fact other American writers despised about Elliot, uh, that he was the, uh, not just the angle of file, uh, that, that he was, but the, uh, um, well the, the true English authority, uh, that he became a, he made himself without any previous standing, any connections really, uh, in, in London or an English culture. Uh, he made himself a central cultural authority, uh, which became in a very short time, almost synonymous with tradition itself. This is an amazing and remarkable achievement and an important cultural event.

Speaker 1:          08:10          The thing is that, uh, the tradition that Elliot expounded was something to a large degree. He invented, uh, Elliot is not as, he is often seen, I think the defender of a social order, uh, uh, that was passing away. And sometimes Yates represents himself that way. Uh, rather, uh, Elliot is the representative of a new class, uh, a, um, uh, a new class opposing itself to the traditional social authority of, uh, money. Uh, and a blood aristocracy, uh, makes its claim for social authority on the basis of knowledge, technical knowledge and expertise above all, a kind of professional class, uh, into which you two are being educated. Um, uh, largely through the modern university, uh, Elliot's, uh, tradition, uh, that he, um, that I'm saying he invented or created, described, defined. Uh, he made it out of the education he had received at Harvard, uh, be also importantly made it outside of the classroom, uh, impart in the school of Ezra pound.

Speaker 1:          09:42          Um, uh, who, uh, you might remember from last week. Specifically. Also when he expatriates leaves behind the Volvo, the, the people, uh, and, uh, sees himself as entering into some kind of a timeless, a tradition that he identifies pound does with the spirits of irony and destiny. That's his, his phrase, uh, to describe the great writers of the past. Elliott also enters this, this kind of semi imaginary community of tradition. Uh, Elliot sense of tradition is established a impart through, uh, his quotations in illusions, uh, in his poetry. Uh, impart and importantly, and I'll talk more about it today through his criticism, uh, this, this kind of tradition with which, uh, Elliot ally's and himself, you could say bank rolls, everything he does legitimize it as, and this authorizes give sanction and precedent, uh, to what was Elliot's strange new poetry, uh, for us. Do you remember?

Speaker 1:          10:51          Uh, as he says, goes to market, uh, so he could stand on his own two feet? Well, uh, Elliot went to tradition, uh, to establish his autonomy. Uh, and, and, uh, tradition allows him, uh, to well, to stand apart both from the genteel audiences that, um, uh, pound resisted that frost in certain ways courted, uh, and also allows Elliot to stand apart from the avant garde, uh, which he has a kind of, um, ambiguous relationship to, um, allows them to stand apart. You could say from the audiences of both a magazine like the Atlantic or Harper's on the one hand and on the other hand, uh, a magazine like the little review or blast even where he did appear, uh, or were broom, uh, some of those magazines I showed you in the first week, uh, Elliot's own magazine, which becomes an important vehicle for his work and his ideas and his authority and his presence and literary culture.

Speaker 1:          12:02          His magazine was, and go back and look at, uh, look at its cover, uh, in, in the images for the first week. His magazine was the criterion, a magazine that had a kind of semi official look, uh, and, and represents the kind of fantasy of I think of a kind of institutional and universal authority. Well, uh, how do you go about inventing tradition in order to do so, Elliot had to, uh, had to demonstrate that the received existing tradition, it was a false one. The metaphysical poets is the, the great and, and, uh, peculiar in many ways essay in which, uh, Elliot a undertakes this work in a very influential, a forum. And I'd like to look at with you for a few minutes. Um, it starts, uh, nine 50 at the back of your book a and goes to nine 53. Uh, this was, this was a book review.

Speaker 1:          13:09          This is one of the great book reviews. And the history of English, uh, uh, criticism. Uh, Elliot was reviewing an anthology of the metaphysical poets, uh, that is, uh, poets have a wit. Uh, in particular of the, uh, largely, uh, of the 17th century, uh, including, um, uh, poets, uh, like done, um, who's a reputation. Uh, Elliot did a great deal to establish in the century, uh, lip in the process of reviewing this anthology. Elliot comes up with a whole, uh, alternative theory, uh, oral alternative history of English literature, uh, and, and, uh, certain key poetic, uh, propositions and statements. Let me just emphasize a few of them for you. You'll see how, how, um, uh, the account of literary history, uh, and Elliot's own ideas of poetics are all kind of mixed up. Uh, uh, and so you have to consider them together. And nine 51, uh, he has, uh, he has quoted, I'm done.

Speaker 1:          14:27          And then he's quoted a Tennyson a and w and the idea is that done is good. Tennyson is bad. Now, uh, he will, he will continue and say the difference is not a simple difference of degree between poets. It's something that happened to the mind of England between the time of done or alert Lord Har Herbert of Char Bray and the time of Tennyson and Browning. It's the difference between the intellectual poet that's a good kind of poet and the reflective poet bad, uh, Tennyson and Browning our poets. And they think, but they do not feel their thought as immediately as the odor of a rose.

Speaker 1:          15:14          A thought to done was inexperience. It modified his sensibility. Uh, evidently, uh, he felt his thought as immediately as essentially as the odor of arose. When a poet's mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience. The ordinary man's experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary, maybe quite a bit like Prufrock's. You would think, uh, the ladder falls in love or read Spinosa and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking in the mind of the poet. However, these experiences are constantly forming new holes. Well, uh, you can, you can see they're a little recipe for, uh, for an Auden poem. And excuse me, well maybe for non pump, but for an Eliot poem, it's a poem about falling in love reading Spinosa and listening to the typewriter. Well, somebody cooks something.

Speaker 1:          16:25          Uh, we may express the differences by the following theory and note that we, uh, you know, Elliot has this, we, that you just have to bow before I'm going to use is it a or join him, I guess. Uh, the poets of the 17th Century, the successors of the dramatists of the 16th possessed a mechanism of sensibility which could devour. And that's an interesting word. Any kind of experience they are simple, artificial difficult, are fantastic as their predecessors were. No, uh, last, no more than Dante, uh, in the 17th century. However, a dissociation of sensibility set in from which we have never recovered. And this, uh, what does he mean? He means fought and feeling have somehow come apart. And this dissociation as is natural, was aggravated by the influence of the two most powerful poets of the century, Milton and Dryden. And then he goes on to complain about Milton and Dryden, and then follow the, um, uh, um, uh, romantic, a inheritance of, of Melton and Dryden.

Speaker 1:          17:37          In the next paragraph, uh, he says the sentimental age began early in the 18th century and continued, wouldn't you like in your own essays to be able to give this kind of rapid fire summary of, of, uh, literary history. The poet's revolted against the Raffia, some native, the descriptive, they fought and felt by fits unbalanced. They reflected in one or two passages of Shelley's triumph of life. In the second Hyperion of Keats, uh, there are traces of a struggle towards a unification of sensibility, but Keats and Shelley died, and Tennyson and Browning ruminated [inaudible] amazing literary criticism. Uh, well, uh, here is, here is quite, uh, an extraordinary, uh, account of, of, um, English. Uh, literary history, uh, Elliot is proposing this, it's quite a strange, uh, an interesting claim, which for a long time, uh, I might add a really was persuasive and became a kind of orthodoxy, uh, among, um, uh, readers of English poetry. And that is that the metaphysical poets

Speaker 2:          19:00          okay.

Speaker 1:          19:00          For centuries viewed as an anomaly in the history of English poetry.

Speaker 2:          19:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:08          Uh, because of their, uh, extreme intellectual reality, uh, their, um, uh, their poetry of wit, um, that this anomaly in English literary tradition actually represents,

Speaker 2:          19:28          yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:28          Uh, central values, uh, in literature that were lost through what Elliot views as an eccentric and a Barent tradition, which is in fact that which descends from Milton, uh, uh, and, and runs through the Romantics and Victorians. Uh, Samuel Johnson in the 18th century, uh, uh, influentially complained to the metaphysical poets that, um, they yoked the most heterogeneous ideas together by violence. This is Johnson's phrase. In other words, they were forced and willful and they put things together in a kind of a violent and, um, uh, artificial way. Elliot is flipping that around and he says, only the metaphysical poets United Thought and feeling. Uh, and it's, uh, these other poets that are, uh, that have been a deficient and, and, and uh, uh, marginal to, uh, the, uh, main mission of, um, uh, English poetry and that they are symptomatic of some derangement in the mind England, uh, that he calls a dissociation of Sensibility, which somehow set in in the 17th century or so.

Speaker 1:          20:56          All of this, this whole sort of, uh, account of, of how English history, English literary history developed all of this in this essay suddenly without any preparation turns into a defense of modern poetry, uh, or you might say a defensive Elliot's poetry. Uh, he says, um, without, as I say really any preparation, uh, on the bottom of nine 52, it is not a permanent necessity that poets should be interested in philosophy as I was or as I am, uh, or in any other subject. We, and there's that we again, uh, can only say that it appears likely that poets in our civilization as it existed present must be difficult. Our civilization. He continues, comprehends great variety and complexity and this variety and complexity playing upon a refined sensibility such as mine must produce various and complex results. The poet, and now he's, he's now he's telling, telling us what poets must do.

Speaker 1:          22:10          The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more elusive, more indirect in order to force to dislocate if necessary language into his meaning. And then he will go on to, uh, a quote, um, uh, French poetry, modern French poetry, uh, uh, to demonstrate as he feels it, uh, the continuity between a modern verse and the metaphysical well, uh, here, excuse me, Elliot is saying, first of all, uh, that the character of modern poetry and again for which we must read his poetry a is simply a reflection of the forces playing upon it, the variety and complexity of our civilization. Uh, in that formulation, the poet seems almost passive, doesn't meet, um, uh, and, and, uh, passive and, um, like a kind of a receptor that is naturally and necessarily producing the kind of strange poetry that Eliot writes. Then, uh, before that, uh, ideas really, uh, some kin Elliot gives us another view of what the poet, uh, is doing.

Speaker 1:          23:37          Uh, the poet, uh, is not in fact passive, but rather he's forcing, he is dislocating language into his meaning. It's such an odd phrase to dislocate language into your meaning. Uh, it, it suggests a poet is not merely producing language, but moving it from one place to another. Um, the question that we might ask though, standing back a of the metaphysical is this is a question that we could ask of Elliot's poetry that is, does this poetry that Elliot's talking about put things together or take them apart. Uh, has it, does it represent some kind of synthesis or rather some kind of, uh, violent derangement? Uh, is it a mirror of a various and complex civilization? Is it in that sense memetic realist or is it rather expressionistic a willful, uh, a kind of, um, uh, subjective, uh, uh, and, um, uh, highly personal expression in which the poet is purposefully a actively dislocating and, and deforming, uh, language?

Speaker 1:          25:09          Uh, is it in, in the, in the sense of poetry that is a, uh, a kind of necessary and inevitable expression of the age or, uh, is it perverse and eccentric? Uh, an arbitrary assertion of authorial will. Uh, these are, these are questions that, um, uh, Elliot's own work, as I say, raises. Uh, and that, that, um, are part of the history of his reception. Uh, Elliot in his account of the men of physicals and then in his defense of his own kind of poetry, uh, seems, I think to equivocate to a degree between these alternatives. Uh, equivocation is again, the key rhetoric, uh, of Prufrock, uh, and, and of Eliot's early poetry, um, uh, of Prufrock's temporizing and his delays and his going back and forth. Let me say just a couple more things about Prufrock in the light of what I've just been quoting from you, quoting for you, from, um, the metaphysical poets, uh, Prufrock has a kind of ambiguous relation to the past, uh, and specifically to, uh, the past of English Romanticism.

Speaker 1:          26:46          Uh, the poem is simultaneously a deconstruction and critique of the romantic ideals and values of, uh, originality of expressiveness. And, uh, it is also a highly original and expressive reworking of those ideals. A, it's a, it's a kind of anti romantic poem that is an extension of romanticism. Unlike the conventional love song, this one comes from the head rather than the heart. Uh, or, uh, you could say really from that opening quotation from Dante on, it comes from, comes out of many other texts. Uh, I think there's a kind of suggestion or implication in the poem that, um, uh, what people claim is original and primary, uh, is always in some sense already scripted that consciousness. Uh, the way our minds work is linguistic that we think and feel through language with language. Uh, and through a kind of collage network of verbal associations, uh, made out of texts and phrases from, uh, not only literary tradition of course, but, uh, the whole spectrum of everyday life.

Speaker 1:          28:29          Uh, original speech, heroic action, the will unmediated desire. These ideals are all rejected and Prufrock, uh, parodied, uh, subjected to irony, discontinuity. They're seen as romantic illusions, uh, cliches, but the poem is not merely a parody of them or maybe through parody, it does something else. It is of course, in its own way, uh, quite as daring and disturbing a poem disturbing to the universe of poetry at least, uh, as Annie, uh, as any modern poem. Uh, and I think you can see it as ineffective, a new kind of love song, uh, one in which the withdrawing of desire from a, an object are our consciousness of our own desires, subject them to reflection, but at the same time sustain them, uh, and, and revoice them through reflection. You could say that what the palm does is to intellectualize, longing and, uh, behind that it makes of the modern skeptic and intellectual, a new kind of romantic hero. What does proof we're hoc want ultimately? Uh, what does he mean when he says, no, that's not what I meant at all? Well, it's hard to say exactly, uh, but the palm does, uh, conclude, uh, and as it does, it gives us a kind of answer, I think. Ah, why don't we look at the end of it? That's, um, four 66.

Speaker 2:          30:34          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:35          I grow old. I grow old. I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I saw where white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing each to each. You see here, uh, Prufrock has moved into these rhyming tercets he says, uh, quite simply and definitively. I do not think that they will sing to me. I have seen them riding seaward on the waves coming. The white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and black. And as he describes this, there is a kind of heightening of conventional, a lyric language with that alliteration. And with those images we have lingered in the chambers of the C by c girls wreathed with seaweed, red and brown till human voices wake us and we drown.

Speaker 1:          31:55          It's hard to interpret. I think the, the end of this poem precisely. Uh, I think that, uh, Prufrock has really no clarified, no specified desire except maybe to hear the mermaids. I do not think that they will think to me, I want them to, he seems to be saying, uh, in a sense. I think you could say he wants romantic singing. He wants to hear it. Perhaps he wants to be able to join in it himself, which is a wish for lyric inspiration, isn't it? Uh, he doesn't want to make love to these mermaids. Uh, he wants to hear them. Uh, he wants to linger with them to have access to their element, uh, and to that extent to be among them and even like them. Uh, it is a wish for specifically freedom from human voices, which I take to be the endless overheard inner voices, uh, in which the quoted repetitive speech that makes up his consciousness consists, and in this sense, uh, it's a wish for a renewal of romantic enchantment, which he knows is impossible, uh, and which he also knows, I think is a wish as old as Kate's is owed to a Nightingale.

Speaker 1:          33:34          And this is a poem, ultimately very much in that cutesy and tradition, the wasteland. Let's begin at the end. Let's begin at the end. On page four 86, the wasteland is a palm. That it comes in five parts. The fifth section, I think it's the longest, uh, it's called what the thunder said. It reaches a kind of climax when, when the poem, uh, renders the voice of the thunder in the landscape of the wasteland. We are waiting for water. We're waiting for everything that water would represent and a funder promises that, uh, that water. Um, and um, it also importantly represents a kind of speech, a speech that comes out of nature. Something that the thunder says has all kinds of a mythological resonance, uh, you might even view as, um,

Speaker 2:          35:22          okay,

Speaker 1:          35:24          the Voice of myth itself, uh, here able to be given, uh, a voice and a hearing, uh, in the poem what the thunder says as Duh, Duh, uh, primary syllable. Uh, there is a note, um, uh, uh, explaining this, I'm coming to us, um, from your editor and from Elliott. Uh, it is the, uh, first phoneme that becomes part of the instruction, the series of instructions, data dyad, vom Dumb Yata a translated as give sympathize control, uh, with the fee. When the thunder speaks. This is what it has to say. It gives us these instructions. Um, and four 10, I'll, I'll just focus on one of these imperatives. Duh. Dyad Balm.

Speaker 1:          36:47          I have heard the key turning the door once in turn, once only we think of the key each in his prison. Thinking of the key each confirms a prison only at nightfall. Ethereal rumors, revive for a moment of broken Corey Alaina's Da Dum, Yada. And then the boat responded. Gayley to the hand expert with sale and or the sea was calm. Your heart. And there's this interesting switch of 10th would have responded. Gaily when invited, beating obedient to controlling hands. Well, Dyad Balm is a translated here, uh, as sympathize. Uh, the poem is in many ways concerned with sympathy as essential value, a central action in human life. The lines that, that they introduce.

Speaker 1:          37:55          Describe the condition that's sympathy. Would redress or, or enter into a, in a some kind of healing way. Uh, I have heard the key turn in the door once in turn, once only. Well Elliott, uh, when he produced not the first version of this poem and uh, uh, the criterion, um, his own magazine when it first was published, but rather a when it appeared in the United States added footnotes or rather in notes to the palm. And, um, the end notes we have here are, are worth contemplating a in a sense, Elliot's notes are kind of extension of the poem. Part of the poem. Uh, these lines bear the note, uh, for uh, and below I heard them nailing shut the door of the horrible tower. The speaker of those lines that Elliot is alluding to, half quoting a is Dante is count [inaudible] in the 33rd Canto of the fair enough, uh, the trader who Galeano tells Dante that his enemies imprisoned him in his children in a tower to die of starvation. And of course, Google Lino would eat his children.

Speaker 1:          39:27          Uh, Elliot continues, he gives us, he gives us that little fragment from Dante. And then he says also Fh, Bradley appearance and reality. Page three 46, it's w when he writes like that, it's like wearing that a waistcoat like kind of pose. Uh, in this case, the pose of a scholar pedant Bradley says, my external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my feelings. In either case, my experience falls within my own circle. A circle closed on the outside and with all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others, which surround it in brief regard of as an existence which appears in a soul. The whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.

Speaker 1:          40:32          Elliot, uh, uh, work done. Bradley, uh, for his, uh, uh, thesis, the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul. Well, uh, I don't know that there is any key to the wasteland, but if there is a key to the wasteland, it's this key in these lines which lead us to Bradley and Bradley's view of what consciousness is like. Consciousness, uh, is a condition in which we are locked into our own, I think linguistic representations of reality without, um, a, uh, uh, a common language to share them. Uh, how can a common world be created out of radically private experience? Well, this is, I think the, the central question that, uh, the wasteland is, is meditating on, uh, responding to, uh, it's one of the central questions in modern poetry. Let's, um, we won't get too far in the poem today. We'll have to conclude our discussion, uh, on Monday. But, uh, let's, let's look at the beginning together to, um, simply to recall how this poetry operates, uh, and, and make some preliminary observations. Uh, this section, the first section is called the burial of the dead, uh, and refers to, uh, the, uh, uh, ritual in the Anglican Church, uh, as as described in the book of common prayer. Um, excuse me.

Speaker 1:          42:29          April is the cruelest month breeding lilacs out of a dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with Spring rain. Winter kept us warm, covering earth and forgetful, snow feeding a little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised US coming over the stern beggars day with a shower of rain. We stopped in the colonnade and went on and sunlight into the half carton and drank coffee and talked for an hour. Been Garkova, rousson stoneware, slew town, Deutsche. And when we were children staying at the arts dukes, my cousins, he took me out on a sled and I was frightened. He said, Marie Marie, hold on. Tight and down. We went in the mountains. There you feel free. I read much of the night and go south in the winter. It's extraordinary poetry. And one of the ways in which it is extraordinary is the, um, modulations. And where do we, where do we pinpoint the turning points between the initial, that Hick general voice of the poem and then that extremely personalized, uh, first person, uh, who will be Marie named, uh, uh, that way through that memory.

Speaker 1:          44:18          Um, uh, how do we get from April is the cruelest month two, I read much of the night and go south in the winter somehow. Um, there are a variety, uh, I think a range of voices, um, uh, here. Uh, and how Elliot moves from the one to the other is a question for us as readers. I think it also raises, uh, again, this sort of central problem that the poem is concerned and that is what is the relationship? How do we articulate the relationship between, uh, the general and the particular between, um, uh, experience that is generalizable and that which is a almost irreducibly private.

Speaker 1:          45:07          Uh, April is the cruelest month, uh, those, uh, wonderful lines. We all know, uh, well, um, the Palm Beach Gins with, uh, illusion that it hardly even needs to press to, uh, one that operated with his short as sort of the first line of the Canterbury Tales. Uh, it evokes to, uh, probably, uh, a Whitman's, uh, uh, when lilacs last in the door yard bloomed another April Elegy. Um, the poem begins by talking about the pain of awakened desire begins talking about the risk that, uh, the risk that comes with beginning and desiring Prufrock's themes. Here they are writ large. A desire it seems is painful because it breaks things open that are closed and shut.

Speaker 1:          46:12          Uh, it's also, it seems unsatisfiable all of these are to a degree conventional romantic toe point motifs where exactly Cletus the poem, uh, uh, modulating into personal memory. Well, maybe somewhere in that, that, uh, eighth line, some are surprised us. Uh, it starts out, uh, looking and feeling a lot like winter kept us warm. Uh, but, uh, now, uh, the, the, uh, the, uh, uh, memory will become highly particularized through quotation incidentally, uh, as your, your, um, um, note we'll explain. Um, the poem really moves into a kind of opaque set of, uh, personal associations, uh, when we were children staying at the arch dukes and so on. He took me out on a sled. Uh, these, these associations are meaningful and resonant and representative. I think to the extent that they have a generic quality that is, uh, not so much that they are our memories, but they're like memories. They're like personal memories and they're like personal memories in their, uh, in their very, um,

Speaker 1:          47:42          uh, the difficulty of translating and sharing them. Uh, there's, there's a kind of, uh, Marie, uh, has a kind of exemplary privacy, uh, about her and her, uh, memories, uh, and her sense of, uh, frustrated, frustrated, desire and longing. Um, there is, um, more that's important about this. First of the wasteland speakers. Uh, the, uh, well BIM guard kind of loosen, uh, is, is, uh, translated for us, uh, down below us. I'm not a Russian women at all. I come from Lithuania, therefore a true German, uh, the, uh, this, uh, who is whoever is saying that exactly whether it's Marie or someone else, uh, seems to be speaking

Speaker 2:          48:32          okay.

Speaker 1:          48:33          Uh, of a kind of, um, um, hybrid identity. It kind of, uh, a Mongrel or duress donated, uh, identity, uh, the,

Speaker 2:          48:46          yeah,

Speaker 1:          48:47          condition of

Speaker 1:          48:53          walked in sensibility and, and, uh, um, uh, difficult, uh, private, uh, emotion, uh, is from the very beginning of the poem associated with Metropolitan Culture, a culture where, uh, there are many languages, uh, speakers from many places, uh, and well to the, um, uh, uh, a culture where there are, as it were, a kind of cacophony of languages, uh, untranslated, uh, existing and competing side by side. This is a kind of linguistic environment, um, that, uh, the wasteland is made out of a, in is also in many ways about, uh, and is the, the, the real medium, uh, of, uh, experience in the poem. Well, uh, let me stop here. And, uh, we will go on trying to, uh, make sense of, uh, uh, this great modern poem on Monday.
