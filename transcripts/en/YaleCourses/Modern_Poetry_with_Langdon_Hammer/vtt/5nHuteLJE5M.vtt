WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.310
Uh,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.310
today I'm going to try to talk a little bit more about Elizabeth Bishop and I'm

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:11.730
also going to,
uh,
try to give some big perspectives,
uh,

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.000
on the poet's we've been reading and,
and also,
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.400
some ways of thinking about how they fit together.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.380
Um,
let's,
uh,
let's look at,

7
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:29.610
at Bishop's poem over 2000 illustrations and a complete concordance.

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.930
Uh,

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.930
the palm placed second in her second book called a cold spring published in

10
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.850
1955.
Uh,

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.250
the latest poems that we'll discuss in this course on,

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.340
on a Wednesday,
I talked about bishops,

13
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.940
poetics of geography or travel,
uh,
as,

14
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.340
as a horizontal poetics as opposed to the,
uh,

15
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.180
uh,
ascendant and sublime impulses,
uh,
in,

16
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.670
uh,
many of the poets that we have.
Um,

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.430
then examining this term,
uh,

18
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.060
this poetics is ultimately a poetry of Welsh shifting perspectives and local

19
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.120
perceptions.
Uh,

20
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.250
the question that it immediately poses is,

21
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.090
well,

22
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.090
how do we put these perceptions and he's points of view together.

23
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.870
Uh,
the,
I think,
uh,
exciting,
but also,

24
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.890
uh,
difficult,
uh,
textures of bishops,

25
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.270
Great Landscape Poems,
Florida,
Cape Breton,
uh,

26
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:49.710
at the fish houses.

27
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.270
A cold spring and others all pose this,
uh,

28
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.680
uh,
very clearly to us.
Uh,
this problem,
uh,

29
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.850
you might see the grains of sand that the sand Piper,
uh,

30
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.110
uh,
searches through,
uh,
in,

31
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.420
in that little poem Sandpiper as again,

32
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.240
exemplary of this problem.
And Bishop,
uh,

33
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.200
that is,
uh,
how do we hold on to organize,

34
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.850
uh,
find coherence in a world of a discreet and,

35
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.910
and shifting,
um,
uh,
phenomena.

36
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.030
This is the,
uh,
um,
really the,

37
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.400
the master problem,
uh,

38
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.050
that bishop addresses a very self consciously in this palm,
uh,

39
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:44.210
over 2000 illustrations in a complete concordance,
uh,

40
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.000
like the map.
It's a poem that,
that,
uh,

41
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.980
is in part about a representation.
Um,
she,

42
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.990
uh,
by implication begins the poem by referring to a book,

43
00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:02.991
presumably the one mentioned in the title over 2000 illustrations and a complete

44
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.960
concordance.
What kind of book is that?
Uh,
she doesn't specify,

45
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.170
but as the palm unfolds,
there's reason to believe it's a bible.

46
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.650
I think perhaps a Family Bible.
Uh,
she says,

47
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.680
thus should have been our travels serious engraver bubble.

48
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.250
Uh,
our travels,
our experience in the world,

49
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.980
our experience of geography,
uh,

50
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.460
our experience as geography should have been,

51
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.220
ought to be serious.

52
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.270
It ought to add up to something and not to be in grievable,

53
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.840
something that that might be bound in book form.
Uh,

54
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:45.550
the image of a book with illustrations and a complete concordance,

55
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.410
uh,
holds up in idea,
um,
that,

56
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.910
um,
word and image,
uh,

57
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.910
perhaps word and flesh,
uh,

58
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.210
representation and a experience might be bound together in a coherent unity.

59
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.020
Uh,
might be,
uh,
um,
uh,
shown to,
uh,

60
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.120
uh,
exist in,
in,
in concordance or in some kind of correspondence,

61
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.210
uh,

62
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.210
against this ideal or this model of things where illustration and text or are

63
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.560
bound together.
Uh,

64
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.730
bishop poses her own way,
word,
experience her travels,

65
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.580
which this poem will,
uh,
list,
uh,
uh,

66
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.130
record,
uh,
give us fragments of,
uh,

67
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:44.131
what the poem reveals to us is a world of discrete fragments,

68
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.740
uh,
parts that gain meaning if at all,
uh,

69
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.940
through their near adjacency,
uh,

70
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.500
or through the perceiver who holds them together,
uh,

71
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.960
holds them together through the quality of her attention,
uh,

72
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.830
and the sensibility behind it.
Uh,

73
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.730
a form of attention for bishop that is always pushing towards revelation,

74
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.670
uh,

75
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.670
seeking meaning something beyond surface detail but never quite arrives.

76
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:23.410
They're never in that sense,
arrives at a place of repose,

77
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.240
a or rest a or home.
Uh,

78
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.890
let me read the second paragraph,
which,
uh,

79
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.620
brilliantly represents,
uh,
the world,
uh,

80
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.070
brought into being by this,
uh,

81
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.670
poetics of geography entering the narrows at Saint John.

82
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.700
The touching bleed of goats reached our ship.

83
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.680
We glimpse them reddish,
leaping up the cliffs among the fog,

84
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.600
so weeds and butter and eggs.

85
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.400
And at Saint Peter's,
the wind blew in.
The Sun shone madly,

86
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.620
rapidly,
purposefully.

87
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.690
The Collegians mark marched in the lions criss crossing the great square with

88
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:07.360
black like ants.

89
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.560
The poem is composed almost of the fragments of a travel diary or bits of a

90
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.020
letter a.
And if you read bishops letter,

91
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:19.240
you will indeed find starvations,
uh,
like this,
uh,

92
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.280
on every page in Mexico,

93
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.770
the dead man lay and a blue arcade,

94
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.370
the dead volcanoes glistened like Easter Lilies,

95
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.280
the Juke box went on playing,
ah,

96
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.470
Olesko LEASCO and Volvulus there were beautiful poppy's splitting the mosaics.

97
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.480
The fat old guide made eyes

98
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.680
in Dingle Harbor and,
and we,
we jerk from one place to another,

99
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.860
uh,
with each sentence.
One Country,

100
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.480
a one spot on the map in dingle harbor,

101
00:06:56.481 --> 00:07:00.140
a golden length of evening.
The rotting hulks held up there,

102
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:01.700
dripping plush.

103
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.190
The English women poured tea informing us that the duchess was going to have a

104
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.024
baby.

105
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.980
And this is one of bishops provocative juxtapositions in the poem.

106
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.590
And in the brothels of Marrakech,

107
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:19.490
the little pock marked prostitutes balanced their tea trays on their heads and

108
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:24.491
did their belly dances flung themselves naked and giggling against our knees

109
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.660
asking for cigarettes.
It was somewhere near there.

110
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:32.090
I saw what frightened me most of all,

111
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.080
implying of course that all of these scenes had frightened her.

112
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.640
A holy grave,
not looking particularly holy.

113
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.160
One of a group under a Keyhole,

114
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.510
Archstone bowel Deakin open to every wind from the pink desert,

115
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.650
an open gritty marble trough carved solid with exhortation.

116
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.460
Yellowed as scattered cattle teeth half filled with dust,

117
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.100
not even the dust of the poor profit.

118
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:09.101
Panem who once lay there just dust in a smart Bernice cut.

119
00:08:10.841 --> 00:08:14.990
Dewar presumably their guide looked on amused.

120
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.470
Looking at these,
uh,
looking at this,
this series,
uh,
this,
uh,

121
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.580
this way bishops life seems to add up.
Uh,

122
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.560
she continues ref reflecting on the poem and on,

123
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.750
uh,
it's a structure.
Everything only connected by and,

124
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.770
and,
and
open the book.

125
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.520
And we're back to the book now.
That ideal form of,
uh,

126
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.770
representation in which text and image are bound.

127
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.430
The guilt rubs off the edges of the pages and pollinates the fingertips.

128
00:08:56.431 --> 00:09:01.431
Bishop wants us as in the map to what she wants to.

129
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.480
The book has something that can be held and touched.
Uh,
she said,

130
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.010
a marvelously tactile poet,

131
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.370
along with the unity of experience that it promises to give us,

132
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.170
is a sense of intimacy to,
uh,

133
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.440
with an object open the heavy book.
She says to us,

134
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.430
why couldn't we have seen this old Nativity while we were at it?

135
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.930
The dark ajar,

136
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.340
the rocks breaking with light and undisturbed and breathing flame,

137
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.563
colorless,

138
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.600
sparkless freely fed on Straw and load within a family with pets

139
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.450
and looked and looked.
Our infant site away.

140
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.590
The Nativity is the scene of the incarnation.
Uh,

141
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.720
that moment when the word is made flesh Christmas morning.

142
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.390
Uh,
that moment when the divine takes human form

143
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.460
and so,
uh,
becomes present in the world.

144
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:23.820
Uh,
this is specifically here as bishop imagines that a scene of revelation,

145
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:29.550
that wonderful phrase,
the dark jar as if the shadow,

146
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.870
we're a door and you could enter it,
uh,

147
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.990
the rocks breaking with light,

148
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.700
that which is solid opening.

149
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.950
What emerges is a flame,

150
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.680
a sign of spirit.

151
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.390
But notice how in this light,

152
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.090
the sacred is secularized.

153
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.600
My bishop finds there is not the holy family,

154
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:02.550
but a family with pets.

155
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.800
There is a nostalgia in here in this poem,

156
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.380
poignant and powerful that is in the style Jah,
uh,

157
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.560
not so much for the holy as for the family once constituted by their relation to

158
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:24.810
the holy
family with pets,

159
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:29.610
but also the family that gathered around the book to look at them.

160
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.640
Uh,
uh,
family gathered through religious practice,

161
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.340
uh,
who might then have looked and looked our infant site away,

162
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.080
uh,
in that,
uh,
looking is a,
uh,

163
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.270
expressed a kind of primal longing for community,

164
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:52.680
for human connection,

165
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.170
belonging expressed through looking importantly for bishop,

166
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.660
which is really what the poet is doing in the map.
I think,
uh,

167
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.670
in the way that she invites us into her act of looking in that poem.

168
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:13.500
Uh,
here,
Bishops Nostalgia is sad,
uh,

169
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.040
but also resigned.
Uh,

170
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.180
this negativity is a scene that can be remembered and looked at from afar,

171
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.230
but not entered into

172
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.060
as the belief system that it comes out of and,

173
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.530
and refers to.
It can be looked at from afar,

174
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.470
but not entered into
a bishop.

175
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:41.470
As several people remarked in section this week,
uh,

176
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.130
calls us back in lots of different ways to frost.

177
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.870
Frost is perhaps an unusual place to begin a course on modern poetry,

178
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.060
uh,
because remember him.
Uh,

179
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.940
he really is,
uh,
generally an exception,
uh,

180
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.200
to the metropolitan scene and inspiration of modern poetry.

181
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.110
Modern poetry is a poetry of the city,

182
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.600
of the metropolis of the world's city,

183
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.640
the place where the world's people's goods,
languages,

184
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.150
traditions,
and cultures are all accessible.

185
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.200
To use Marianne Moore's word from her poem,
New York,

186
00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.920
uh,
pound,
Eliot crane,

187
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.570
more Hughes,
even Williams and Stevens in there.

188
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:41.620
It's somewhat different ways are all poets of the metropolis.

189
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.800
Uh,
the sense of ambivalence about modernity in these poets,
uh,

190
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.801
isn't ambivalence in many ways about the city and what it promises and also what

191
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:58.390
it in many ways,
uh,
threatens us with their sense of,

192
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.740
uh,
experience.

193
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:04.741
Their visions of modernity and of modern forms of community are all located in

194
00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:06.100
expressed there.

195
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:12.700
Frost aggressively defines his work against that context.

196
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.220
Uh,
in doing this,

197
00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:19.930
he links his writing to 19th century American writing and art,

198
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.430
uh,
links his writing to rural culture,

199
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:29.620
which dominates the 19th century.
There is a,

200
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.950
an anti modern strain in frost just as there is in Yates,

201
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:39.040
uh,
and,
uh,
more complex Lee impound.

202
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.750
And in Elliot,

203
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.770
what's modern about frost is what has changed in the rural cultures that he

204
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:52.010
writes about.
Uh,
that is the collapse of farming economies,

205
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.570
uh,
in communities in the decay of 19th century Protestantism,

206
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.970
the white church and the village green.

207
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.950
You feel that loss in the terrific aloneness of frosts people.

208
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:13.460
The Great Poem Directive,
uh,
is about all of these things.

209
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.370
Uh,
Frost's poetry

210
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.120
struggles to incorporate the secular truth of modern science and,

211
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.030
uh,
to make poetry,
uh,

212
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.450
to make poetry like science,

213
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.620
a disenchanted knowledge in this way.

214
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.910
A frost has a lot in common with Ogden.
Uh,

215
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.270
and frost,
again,

216
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:46.271
like garden is fundamentally concerned with poetry as a form of knowledge,

217
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.010
a way to know the world
at the same time.
Uh,

218
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.840
poetry preserves for frost,
certain,
uh,
archaic,
uh,

219
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:01.990
primitive powers of enchantment powers associated with primitive motives,

220
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:08.710
childhood experience that make it a crucial alternative to science and

221
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:11.330
scientific knowing.

222
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.900
Think of the magic trick at the end of directive when a frost takes us to the

223
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:20.990
ruined house of 19th century culture,

224
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.370
the ruin farmhouse of home burial maybe in steals from the abandoned children's

225
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:29.780
playhouse,

226
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.780
a broken drinking goblet like the grail and uses it to invite us to drink from a

227
00:16:39.471 --> 00:16:43.460
primal source,
too lofty and original to rage that Spring

228
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.310
and in drinking to be whole again beyond confusion.

229
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.350
What are we drinking there?
Then at the end of frost poem,

230
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.730
this poem published the end of the Second World War were drinking kind of

231
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.440
elemental power,
uh,

232
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:08.530
that seems to fuse language and longing and imagination.

233
00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.810
Uh,
this is in frost,
a conscious rewriting,
I think,
uh,

234
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.930
partially even a send up as well as a competition with Elliot in the wasteland.

235
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.830
Uh,

236
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:26.830
and the grail myths that are one of the central motifs of that poem,

237
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:34.640
one of the central motifs that embody for Elliot,
uh,

238
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.240
a sense of the holy,
uh,
uh,
which is present.
However,

239
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.350
for Elliot,
uh,
only through literary illusion,

240
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.600
something fascinating but unavailable,
uh,

241
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.570
as actual experience,

242
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:58.170
something available only in a sense as quotation poetry,

243
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.430
uh,

244
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.200
in frost as an Elliot does the work religion no longer does.

245
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.970
Uh,
but notice how in Frost

246
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.760
indirective,
uh,

247
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.870
the belief that poetry asks from us is a belief in a fiction in make believe.

248
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.840
Uh,
and in this,
uh,

249
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.990
frost is a strangely and wonderfully and surprisingly,

250
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:29.991
perhaps fully the contemporary of Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane whose work,

251
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.580
uh,
proceeds from that same assumption.

252
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.140
Stephens is a wartime poem.

253
00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.430
Asides on the oboe,
uh,

254
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.560
begins the prologues are over.

255
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.550
It is a question now of final belief.

256
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.350
So say that final belief must be in a fiction.

257
00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.720
It is time to choose.

258
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:03.770
This is the theme of Stevens is wartime masterpiece notes towards a supreme

259
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:09.510
fiction.
I noticed the contradictory impulses in Stevens,

260
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:11.490
his title,
uh,
when,

261
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:15.090
when poetry takes the place of religion for Stevens,

262
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:18.000
it presents itself as a supreme fiction,
uh,

263
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.660
a total representation of the world and experience.

264
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.950
But we only have partial provisional access to that fiction.

265
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.540
What Steven's gives us as merely notes,

266
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.170
notes
something that Elizabeth Bishop might present us with.

267
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:43.260
Two.
Uh,
in this sense in Stephens,

268
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.620
the shift from religion to poetry is also a shift from total ization,

269
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.860
uh,
from system to contingency and incompletion,
uh,

270
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.900
to parts,
uh,
rather than,
uh,
a whole

271
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.360
for Stevens.
Uh,

272
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.640
the disappearance of the Christian God as the center of,

273
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.900
uh,
emotional and spiritual cultural life,
uh,

274
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.450
is essentially,
however a cause for celebration

275
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.760
in Elliot.
It's a cause for mourning,

276
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.190
mourning and anxiety,
uh,

277
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.910
distress
in Yates.

278
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.690
It's a cause of fascination in horror

279
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.050
in crane for the making of new myths,
new metaphors

280
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.640
he uses secular poems are Christ haunted,

281
00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.960
uh,
Christ in all of the,
uh,

282
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.300
iconography associated with him is a source of hope and also irony for black

283
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.850
culture and a reproach to the white world.

284
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.000
How do people,
how does culture find bearing,
uh,

285
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.420
in a world without divine sanction?

286
00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:19.210
This has played out,
played out as an ethical question,

287
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:24.010
a question about how to live and act rightly,
uh,
in more.

288
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.510
And then later in Bishop,
uh,
in general,
uh,

289
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.360
it is a less urgent question,
uh,

290
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.530
less central one in the later poets than in the earlier ones.

291
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.910
Things fall apart.
The center cannot hold.

292
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.420
Yeats says in the second coming eat bishop is a fundamentally at home in this

293
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:48.934
condition,

294
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.070
which is a condition of center lessness or homelessness.

295
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.700
She liked the phrase,
uh,

296
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.600
the world's an orphans home in more,

297
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.160
uh,
bishop is,
uh,

298
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.140
at home then with a certain kind of homelessness,

299
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:15.670
uh,

300
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:20.670
travel as her metaphor for the new mobility of consciousness,

301
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.940
uh,
in a world without a stable center.

302
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:32.010
Her poetry is written from the disc disturbingly and disorienting Lee de

303
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.230
centered point of view that we find already in those early poems of her as a

304
00:22:40.751 --> 00:22:44.860
point of view that takes for granted the absence of central authority that

305
00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:46.180
religion wants provided.

306
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.760
Remember in over 2000 and illustrations and a complete concordance that holy

307
00:22:51.761 --> 00:22:56.470
grave,
it's not even particularly holy.
She says,

308
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.050
uh,
the place of the sacred in bishop has been vacated.

309
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.250
Might poetry fill it.

310
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.580
This isn't a question bishop asks are as concerned with,
but it is,

311
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:17.581
is I've been suggesting an urgent one in many ways for the poets who proceeded

312
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:19.390
her,
uh,

313
00:23:19.391 --> 00:23:24.130
the poetry of the period 1910 through 1940 say,
uh,

314
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:29.260
really the,
the,
uh,
uh,
uh,
great phase of modern poetry.

315
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.050
Uh,
this period is,
is structured.

316
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.230
I think my two big questions,

317
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.550
how should poetry be written and

318
00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.750
what can it do?
What can it accomplish in the world?

319
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.520
In the first lecture,
uh,

320
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.740
I talked about these different impulses which are,
uh,

321
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.910
at once opposing but also I think related in interlocking,

322
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.530
uh,
I called one of them,
uh,

323
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.570
formal and inward turning an aesthetic,

324
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.250
uh,
the other rather outward turning,
uh,

325
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.970
concerned with the moral,
the political,
the social.

326
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.470
The first one tends to limit the definition of poetry to say what is particular

327
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.900
to this art to isolate what is essential to it.

328
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.990
The other works to extend poetry's scope,
uh,

329
00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:34.760
to give it an expanded role in culture in the world,
in our lives.

330
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.470
You see different versions of both of these impulses in the career trajectories

331
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:45.990
of HD and William Carlos Williams,
uh,

332
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.900
who begin as a masters of a certain kind of,

333
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.510
uh,
uh,

334
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.550
short poem and go on to create a epic poems,

335
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.940
uh,
of,
uh,
cultural sweep,

336
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.850
a hds being called trilogy.

337
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.400
Williams is Patterson,

338
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.220
but the poet who more than any embodies these,

339
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:18.110
these two,
uh,
impulses,
uh,
in the shape of his career,

340
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:20.900
his pound of course,
uh,
as I said,

341
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:25.040
the author of the shortest and the longest poem,
uh,
in modern poetry,

342
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.870
uh,
the,
uh,
exponent of images and,
and,
uh,

343
00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:34.871
the author of the cantos images and seems to want to get outside of history to

344
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:41.660
explore the sudden liberation from space limits and time limits.

345
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.720
Pan says in a kind of autonomous aesthetic experience,

346
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.080
the Cantos,
however,
our poem as pound called it,

347
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.950
including history upon,
uh,

348
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.760
of the greatest possible range and scope and ambitious

349
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.540
in images.
And there's an attempt to establish,
uh,

350
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.550
the primary poetic unit,
uh,
to cut away what is inessential,

351
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.410
uh,
uh,
to,
uh,
find,
uh,
what is true.

352
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:22.180
This is a kind of formal program that expresses a drive towards truth telling

353
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.240
and that we find in somewhat different terms in frost and Auden and more,

354
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.410
uh,

355
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:35.410
think of frost sense of fact versus in mowing the,

356
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:37.850
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

357
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.880
easy gold at the hand of fate or elf or a think of Yates is stylistic

358
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:49.260
transformation as expressed in that short poem,
a coat,
uh,

359
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.180
or the fishermen palms from 1915,

360
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:55.770
uh,

361
00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:00.770
think about Moore's and Auden's severe revisions,

362
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.800
uh,
of their work,
uh,

363
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.710
in each case involving cutting out poems or cutting away,

364
00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:10.220
uh,
many lines,
uh,

365
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.270
in order to arrive at what more called in poetry,
that poem,

366
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.930
subjected to severe revision,
the genuine,
uh,

367
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:22.230
these are all creative acts of,

368
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:27.450
I think you could say self limitation.
Uh,
and,
uh,

369
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.460
they are linked to the general recurrent theme in these poets.

370
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:34.590
Um,
uh,

371
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:39.650
in these poets in particular on more frost,

372
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:45.420
uh,
to the general theme of restraint or reticence.

373
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.770
The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence,
not in silence,

374
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:54.390
but restraint.
Uh,
remember Auden's stone,

375
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:57.060
God that never was more reticent,

376
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.030
always afraid to say more than he meant.

377
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.240
This impulse that I'm describing in modern poetry is also related to formal

378
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:13.220
experiments.
Uh,
uh,
with this restraint,
uh,
you,
you,

379
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:18.150
you see this worked into a Morris syllabics,
uh,

380
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.340
modern poetry in many ways,
uh,

381
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.520
seeks to restrain the singing voice in the lyric voice of romantic poetry as

382
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:34.680
received through 19th century poetry frosts vernacular,
uh,

383
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.480
uh,
his,
his,
his will to get the sound of sense into,
uh,

384
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:41.850
his poems,
uh,
functions in this way.

385
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.680
So does Hughes's vernacular his black speech,
uh,

386
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:47.790
think about,
uh,

387
00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.820
Elliot's syntactic and logical discontinuity and disjunctions,

388
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:56.320
uh,
the way they,
uh,
interrupt,
uh,

389
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:01.550
and and fragment a lyric utterance or think about pounds,

390
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:07.491
incorporation of blocks of pros as he did in the cantos.

391
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.570
Uh,

392
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.570
there is in all of these examples of tendency to define what is modern and

393
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.711
modern poetry by the incorporation of traditionally non poetic forms of speech

394
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:24.660
and language use.
And Moreover,
and importantly,

395
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.340
non traditional methods of organizing poetic language.

396
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.670
At the same time,
this impulse can be seen as a way not of of uh,
uh,

397
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.500
limiting or curtailing poetry's scope,
but rather the opposite,
expanding it,

398
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.560
expanding it to include,
uh,

399
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:47.610
even as more puts it schoolbooks and business documents making poetry available

400
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.090
for people and cultures and experience that had not previously been represented

401
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:55.924
in poetry.

402
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.420
Other modern poetry is experimental in a very different way.

403
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.050
I indeed in its,
uh,

404
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.410
a revival in recovery and incorporation of a historical poetic forms you could

405
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:18.271
understand a heart cranes were claiming of Elizabethan and um,

406
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.120
uh,
19th century,
uh,
uh,
forms of,
of uh,

407
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.600
or in a mental rhetoric,
uh,
and uh,

408
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.900
versification as exactly this kind of,
um,

409
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:36.280
a reclaiming of,
uh,
archaic materials.

410
00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.810
There's something similar going on in,
uh,
in pounds,

411
00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.250
in pounds recovery of province,
Sol and Anglo Saxon.

412
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.850
A verse forms is his revival of these,
uh,

413
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.940
forms pound and crane are both heroic poets.

414
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.970
Uh,
they answer that question,
what can poetry do?

415
00:30:57.971 --> 00:31:02.890
What can it affect and culture by saying simply everything.

416
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.120
Uh,
that's really the extraordinary,
uh,

417
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.890
presumption of their long poems.
The bridge and the Qantas,

418
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.720
they are very different poets.
Uh,
however,

419
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:21.730
in to some extent exposed,
exposed oposed figures,

420
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:27.130
although indeed,
uh,
their,
their,
their,
their,
uh,

421
00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:32.130
their claims for poetry make made them both,
uh,
uh,
exposed,
uh,

422
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.710
uh,
figures,
um,
in,
in,
uh,
uh,

423
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.120
poignant and complicated ways.
When I talk about the difference,

424
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:43.330
I'm thinking of pounds,
suspicion of rhetoric,
uh,

425
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.860
his suspicion of representation is kind of will or drive to get beyond these

426
00:31:47.861 --> 00:31:51.940
things,
uh,
versus cranes,
faith in rhetoric,
uh,

427
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.370
faith and rhetoric and imagination,
uh,

428
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:57.490
in their power to transform the world.
In a sense,

429
00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:00.220
you couldn't have two more different poets,

430
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:05.560
but both of these poets take poetry as a kind of metaphor,

431
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.320
uh,
as not only a metaphor,
but as the,

432
00:32:08.321 --> 00:32:13.321
as the salient instance of the creative impulse in history.

433
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.310
What makes history happen?
What makes,
uh,
action,

434
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.460
uh,
in history,
uh,

435
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.130
and they place poetry,
uh,

436
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:29.470
at the center of all that is most important that we do.

437
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:35.100
They both propose that poetry can fulfill the central mediating functions that

438
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.740
religion once did,

439
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.160
pound and crane become cautionary figures for later poets.
Uh,

440
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.780
to some extent,
Yates does too.
Uh,
that is,
uh,

441
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:55.810
figures who seem to show the limits of poetry precisely in their efforts to

442
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.800
expand them.
Uh,

443
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.250
this is one way we can understand a bishop's palm visits to Saint Elizabeth's on

444
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.990
page one 33,
uh,

445
00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:11.030
this is a poem that describes

446
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.023
<v 1>okay</v>

447
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.340
<v 0>bishops periodic visits to Ezra pound in Saint Elizabeth's hospital where pounds</v>

448
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.990
was,
uh,

449
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.070
institutionalized incarcerated,
uh,

450
00:33:26.071 --> 00:33:30.940
after his return to the United States on charges of treason.
Uh,

451
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:36.050
bishop was living in Washington as the poetry consultant to the Librarian of

452
00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:41.140
Congress,
and it befell her almost as an official duty to,
uh,

453
00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:45.150
visit pound a,
hear him talk and bring people to pounds.

454
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.130
Uh,
and it became the occasion for this poem,
uh,

455
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.150
built on the form of,
this is the House that Jack built.

456
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.220
This is the,
this is the poetry that Jack made.

457
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:04.110
This is the house of Betalin.
This is the man that lives in the house of Bedlam.

458
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.320
And this is the time of the tragic man that lives in the house of Bedlam.

459
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.420
And she continues adding each time,
adding and of course,
in bishops,

460
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.930
uh,
distinctive manner,
not only repeating,

461
00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:23.700
but revising the terms that she's given us.
Uh,
again,
uh,

462
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.960
you know,
a poetics of constant readjustment,
uh,

463
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.790
as the,
uh,
poem builds,
uh,

464
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.670
characters are included.

465
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.300
Not only a pound,

466
00:34:39.301 --> 00:34:42.990
but a pound represented as the man,

467
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:47.160
but also soldier,
a boy,
a Jew,

468
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.370
uh,
figures that are

469
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.340
<v 1>okay</v>

470
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:58.160
<v 0>versions of pound,
perhaps,
uh,
reaching a climax,
uh,</v>

471
00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:00.180
in the final stanza.

472
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.210
This is the soldier home from the war.

473
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.500
Perhaps that's pound in some sense.
Uh,

474
00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.700
these are the years in the walls and the door that shut on a boy,

475
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:16.890
the pats the floor to see if the world is round or flat.
Again,

476
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.170
bishop touching a map.

477
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.550
This is a Jew in a newspaper hat.

478
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:30.080
The dance is carefully down the wall ward walking the plank of a coffin board

479
00:35:30.271 --> 00:35:32.460
with the crazy sailor that shows us.
Watch the,

480
00:35:32.461 --> 00:35:36.840
tells the time of the wretched man who lives in the house of Bedlam.

481
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:43.380
It's a great poem.
Uh,
I spoke of audits and bishops.

482
00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:46.170
Perspectivism.
Uh,
here,

483
00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:51.171
bishop gives us multiple perspectives on pound and by extension on the social

484
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:57.030
and political ambitions of modernist poetry.
Pound is tragic,

485
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.650
talkative,
honored,
old,
brave,
cranky,
cruel.

486
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.050
And finally,
simply wretched.

487
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.160
A word that comes from the seafarer.

488
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.730
Arguably,
uh,

489
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.950
one strain of modern poetry ends here in 1950 in the madhouse.

490
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.600
In Bedlam.
Importantly,

491
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.630
though it is not that bishop stands apart from in a position to judge

492
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:34.560
pound
instead,
she is interestingly,

493
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:39.180
I think,
implicated in the scene.
Uh,

494
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.300
she must've enjoyed and by her choice of title calls attention to the irony that

495
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.510
pound is,
uh,

496
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:54.120
in a mad house that has the same name as Bishop,

497
00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.730
uh,
in Bishop's Great War palm roosters.

498
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:04.580
Uh,
there is a sense that,
uh,
to,
uh,

499
00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.060
oppose a conflict,
uh,

500
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.670
out in the world when must encounter conflict in oneself.

501
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:15.870
Uh,
here too.
Uh,
I think in multiple ways,

502
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:20.871
bishop implicates herself in the objects of her critique and satire.

503
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.240
Uh,
the child's verse form,
it's important,

504
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.810
uh,
bishop identifies with,

505
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:35.100
I think it's fair to say she's certainly interested in children throughout her

506
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.930
poetry.
Uh,
this interest points,

507
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:44.931
I think to bishop sense of herself as a minor poet that is,

508
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:51.420
um,
a map maker,
uh,
not a historian,

509
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:56.510
a poet who refuses to write the major culturally central aggressively,

510
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.050
uh,
uh,
ambitious poetry too,

511
00:38:01.051 --> 00:38:05.550
which modernism and above all the poetry of pound aspired,

512
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:11.850
uh,
Arden's perspectivism in music.

513
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:12.683
They are,

514
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.980
seems to position the poet and poetry similarly.

515
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.000
So it has that famous statement,
uh,

516
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.760
in the Yates Allergy for poetry makes nothing happen.

517
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.920
Uh,

518
00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.920
these poems mutate a bazaar in memory of WB Yeats read like rebukes to modern is

519
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:37.870
promethian ambitions.
It's a verticality.
Uh,

520
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.500
if you like,
uh,
rebukes to,

521
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:46.240
to Auden's own political poetry of the 1930s,

522
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.000
exemplified by a poem like Spain,
1937.
Uh,

523
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:53.080
but uh,

524
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:58.110
as I stressed odd and doesn't put a full stop on that sentence for poetry makes

525
00:38:58.271 --> 00:39:01.750
nothing happen.
Rather he punctuates it with a colon in,

526
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:05.520
continues it survives
a,

527
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:10.560
there is perhaps a double implication here either poetry does not have an effect

528
00:39:11.801 --> 00:39:12.251
in the world,

529
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:17.251
but still survives despite its lack of making something happen or it survives

530
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.460
because it makes nothing happen.

531
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.240
It is not a cause,
uh,

532
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:33.750
and it doesn't take up causes effectively what it does rather as odd and

533
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:39.520
represents it.
Here is creative space,

534
00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:44.730
a space of happening,
uh,
uh,
landscape,
uh,
uh,

535
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:49.630
a model of the world scene in the same time,
uh,
uh,

536
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.740
as a valley and a river,

537
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.720
the river that flows through it.

538
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.510
There's terrific power of affirmation,
uh,

539
00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.880
in this claim about poetry survival at the moment of the eight staff at the

540
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:09.010
moment,
uh,
of the,
uh,

541
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.690
onset of the Second World War when all the dogs of Europe Bark,

542
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.000
uh,
ultimately in Ogden,
uh,

543
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:22.150
poetry survives as a way of happening as he calls it.

544
00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:27.151
That is a way in the sense of both a method and a path,

545
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:31.450
uh,
and,
uh,
implicitly,
uh,

546
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.950
as I suggested talking about this poem earlier,

547
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:40.180
uh,
it's survives as a kind of open space,

548
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.130
a place to come into,
uh,
to,
uh,

549
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:48.870
collect in and gather in,
uh,
for us.
Uh,

550
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.820
and it is figured,
I think,
uh,
finally,

551
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:55.750
implicitly as a mouth,
uh,
uh,

552
00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.100
the human mouth open to speak,
uh,

553
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:04.750
old words and,
and new words to a poetry survives in,

554
00:41:04.751 --> 00:41:09.320
in my mouth,
uh,
and also in yours.
Uh,

555
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.930
which seems like a good last sentence too,
in this course with,

556
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.150
so thank you very much.

557
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:21.150
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
