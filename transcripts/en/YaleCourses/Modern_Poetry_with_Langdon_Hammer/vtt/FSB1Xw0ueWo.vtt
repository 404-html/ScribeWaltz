WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.190
Um,
I was,
uh,
wanting to carry over more,
uh,

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.090
Williams today.
Uh,
poor Williams.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.880
He only got a day like,
like Langston Hughes,

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:16.800
but it's hard to give everybody their day.
Um,
uh,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.040
and I think on reflection,
I,
I'd rather,
uh,

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
give to full lectures to Marianne Moore because,
uh,
first of all,

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:29.040
she's a difficult poet.
Uh,
Oh,
good.
You're saying,

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.230
as opposed to all these other people,
uh,
she's,
uh,

9
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.770
she's difficult in a different way.
Uh,
and,
uh,

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.050
in some way she doesn't seem difficult,
uh,
as you,
as you get started,
but she's,

11
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:46.340
she's idiosyncratic.
Um,
and,
um,

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.230
I'd like to give her,
um,
uh,

13
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.260
a chance to,
um,
get your attention and,

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.760
uh,
give you a chance to learn how to read her.
Uh,

15
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.160
it also strikes me that I haven't read a lot of women poets in this course.

16
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.960
How have we,
uh,
we've read HD,
uh,

17
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.880
but that's really about it so far.
Um,
the,

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.710
uh,
giants of modern poetry,
they're men,

19
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.130
uh,
Yates,
Elliot and company.
Um,

20
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.580
uh,
more has a claim to stature.
Uh,

21
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.830
like there's,
uh,
I think she is a,
uh,

22
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.190
a remarkable poet.
Um,
and one who interestingly,

23
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:42.230
I think has had as much or perhaps even more,
um,

24
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.730
practical influence and affect,
uh,

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.780
over the development of poetry since,
uh,

26
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.850
modernism as much or more than any of the poets we've been reading.

27
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.400
Uh,
the general question of,
um,
uh,

28
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
the position of women and of women poets in modern poetry is interesting and

29
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.150
important and important context for thinking about more

30
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.860
women in the,
uh,
uh,

31
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.110
modernist literary culture that we've been,
uh,

32
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.190
studying are identified very frequently with a popular and genteel forms of

33
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:29.640
writing
and taste.

34
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.320
Think about Hart Crane complaining,
uh,
to Harriet Monroe,

35
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.520
the editor of Poetry magazine as if she's just to square to get it.

36
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.050
Uh,
this was,
this is not an unusual attitude.

37
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.910
Uh,
women are associated to a degree with political writing,
uh,
the periods,

38
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:51.570
certain kinds of experimental writing.
Uh,

39
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.270
and also,
uh,
above all with the,

40
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.100
with the legacy of the 19th century poets tests,
uh,

41
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
James Joyce said the wasteland ended the idea of poetry for ladies,

42
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.970
this is its achievement.
Uh,
poor ladies.
Uh,

43
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.950
well,
um,
I,
I,
you maybe get the idea,
um,

44
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.790
uh,
in Joyce's comment that,
uh,
here was a,

45
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.490
a poem that a broke with,
uh,

46
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.660
a 19th century culture of poetry,
uh,

47
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.510
that was in certain ways feminized,
uh,
at least as a imagined,

48
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.290
uh,
here by Joyce and certainly by other modern poet.

49
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.090
Um,
at the same time,
um,

50
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
you can think about the very rich and complicated role of women in,

51
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.530
uh,
the wasteland in order to,
uh,

52
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.860
get some sense of the complexity of the position of,

53
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.220
of women in modern poetry,
uh,
in general.

54
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.390
And think of the ways in which Elliot as a poet draws on female speakers and

55
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:10.200
female voices.
And you might say,
even aspires,
uh,

56
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.950
to sound like I'm his older,
uh,
or,
uh,
fill a male,

57
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.050
uh,
or,
um,
well,
one of his own inventions in the fire sermon

58
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.620
in general.
Uh,
you could say that the modern poets we've been reading,
uh,

59
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:30.150
aggressively and self consciously,
uh,
uh,

60
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.220
masculinize poetry in particular by trying to disassociate a poetry from what is

61
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:42.280
commercial,
uh,
polite,

62
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.280
soft,
dreamy,
a ideal leisured,

63
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.090
uh,
all qualities and attitudes,

64
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.470
gendered in their imagination,
uh,

65
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.480
and instead to connect poetry to what is technically rigorous,

66
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.700
advanced,
learned,
unsentimental,
uh,
uh,

67
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.120
hard,
uh,
and often hard work,
uh,

68
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.850
terms that are again,
clearly gendered.

69
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.100
A HD in her own distinctive way is also doing this,

70
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.310
taking part in this,
uh,
modern poetry,

71
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.300
wanted to make poetry culturally central and powerful,
uh,

72
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.040
to reposition it,
to,
uh,
achieve for it.
Uh,

73
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:33.940
the power to define and describe culture.

74
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.280
And this was very often,

75
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:41.170
as I'm suggesting a played out in very gendered terms,

76
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.670
uh,
trying to,
uh,
claim for poetry,
um,
uh,

77
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:48.040
kind of,
um,
uh,
set of

78
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.570
capacities that were,
um,
uh,

79
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.860
strongly gendered in these poets imaginations.
Uh,
at the same time,

80
00:05:56.861 --> 00:06:01.861
this as I am saying is conflicted in complicated and we need only think of

81
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.450
Elliot's case,
but you could look back to a Yates,

82
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.210
his relationship to women speakers,
uh,

83
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:13.211
his own complicated set of identifications with them.

84
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.490
Uh,
and so on.
Uh,

85
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.110
how does Marianne Moore fit in this?
Uh,

86
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.990
what did it mean for her to be a modern poet and a woman?

87
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.850
Uh,
these are our questions that,
um,

88
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.540
I'll take up today.
Uh,
first of all,
addressing this question specifically of,

89
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:36.374
of,
uh,

90
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.660
well what did it mean to write from the position of a woman for more and I,
and,

91
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.610
and then I,
I want to go on and talk about more,
um,
as an American poet,

92
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.220
a witch.
She was self consciously,
uh,
and then,
uh,

93
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.170
to,
uh,
begin to talk about more as a nature poet,
uh,

94
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.070
which she also was,
uh,
let's,

95
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.150
let's get started by,
uh,
looking at,
um,
well,
uh,

96
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.140
one of her earliest,
uh,

97
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.540
publications poem that,
uh,
like,
uh,

98
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.550
many of the other important early poems by these poets appeared in poetry

99
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:21.350
magazine.
Uh,
this time,
I think in 1919.

100
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:25.910
I'm not sure.
I'll,
I'll check the date.
I'm talking about the poem called a grave.

101
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.890
Uh,
on page four 40.
It's a great poem.

102
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.770
Uh,
and,
uh,
it's a,

103
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.060
it's a poem that announces a speaker that sounds like no one else.

104
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.610
Uh,
and sounds like certainly no one we have been reading.

105
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.220
Um,
think about,
uh,
the seafarer.

106
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.460
Another poem.
In fact,
the sea.
How did that sound?

107
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:57.020
Bitter breast cares have I abided a nine the night and,

108
00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.770
uh,

109
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:02.770
you remember pounds a sonorous and even perhaps ponderous,

110
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.090
a heroic,
a Anglo Saxon alliterative a meter,

111
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.420
which I talked about as in pounds case,

112
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.480
a deliberate and interesting evasion of I am big pentameter norms,

113
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.190
uh,
blank verse as a kind of a model for heroic speech.

114
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.370
Well,
so is this,
but it sounds nothing like that.

115
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.410
It's on the other end of the spectrum,
right?

116
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.880
It sounds like what pros in certain ways,

117
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:37.310
uh,
a remarkable elevated prose,

118
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.470
but pros,
pros that uses words like consciousness,

119
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.010
volition.
However,

120
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.470
when was the last po last time you saw a poem said,
however,
uh,
it's,
uh,

121
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.480
it really,
uh,
announces a,

122
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.390
a speaker who is using kind of expository language.

123
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.510
Uh,
there are latinate words,
uh,

124
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.890
uh,
there's obviously no meter and rhyme.

125
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.610
Uh,
at the same time,
uh,
there is a,
uh,

126
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.600
developed and as almost always in more intricate formal design and idiosyncratic

127
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:28.290
formal design that is operating in the pump,
but almost secretly,

128
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.780
um,
what's it look like on the page?
A lot of long lines,

129
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:38.700
right?
Um,
a lot of long lines,
some of which run over well.

130
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.920
Uh,

131
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.920
this like other more poems is a poem structured around counting syllables per

132
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:52.530
line,
uh,
and counting.
In fact,
number of lines.

133
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.100
This is not a kind of a formal organization that you hear and it's even

134
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:02.820
difficult to see,
but it's an operative one for her.

135
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:07.520
And it's one of the ways in which she organizes her verse.
Uh,

136
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.420
it's as if,
you know,
more has in some sense set up her own rules,
clung to them,

137
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.380
and kept them secret.
She doesn't always keep them secrets.

138
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:21.300
Sometimes they're quite conspicuous and,
and,
and,
uh,
uh,
even,

139
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:24.510
uh,
you know,
flashy and certain poems and their designs.

140
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:26.910
But here it's quite in conspicuous.

141
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.800
What you have is a poem that is made up of two 11 line groups,

142
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.780
uh,

143
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.780
to 11 lines stands as or paragraphs each beginning with a short seven syllable

144
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:44.511
line man looking into the sea for their bones have not lasted.

145
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.040
This is a kind of a pattern that structures the poem,

146
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.110
uh,
in all these ways that I'm describing the syllable count,

147
00:10:55.111 --> 00:11:00.000
the expository writing,
the,
uh,
latinate a diction,

148
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:01.550
the,
uh,

149
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.090
self conscious pro pros like nature of the,
uh,

150
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.100
uh,
language,
although semi-colons,
um,
this is,

151
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.210
uh,
poetry that has distanced itself from,
um,

152
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.890
traditions of song,
uh,
and certainly from 19th century,

153
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.980
uh,
traditions of versification.
Um,

154
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.580
the form of the poem is,
is again,

155
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.170
not something you see or even hear necessarily.
It's there,
uh,

156
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.240
almost as a kind of absence.

157
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.860
Now there's also a wonderfully,

158
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.250
a certain combativeness more,

159
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.750
it's a combative and pugnacious poet.

160
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.400
Uh,
you,
uh,
again,
may not see this immediately,
uh,

161
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.880
because of the poems impersonality uh,

162
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.140
the way in which it seems to present itself.
And,
um,

163
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.500
uh,
the often intricate,
um,
uh,
forms of,

164
00:12:04.501 --> 00:12:08.470
of Syntax and,
and,
and uh,
or oblique approach.

165
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.330
But she is a fighter.
And this poem is really,
uh,

166
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.280
uh,
uh,
uh,
kind of,
uh,
fighting,
uh,
that we're,
we're seeing,

167
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.030
uh,
the poem begins in irritation.

168
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.120
It begins as a complaint,

169
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.350
a complaint that's addressed to whom to man,

170
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.750
man,
looking into the sea.

171
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.160
A man suggests,
well,

172
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.110
maybe humankind.

173
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.410
You think about the people on the shore and frost poem,

174
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:46.060
neither out far nor deep,
who were standing there looking out at the,

175
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:49.540
at the water.
Uh,
well,
um,
uh,

176
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.020
more might be addressing them.
Uh,

177
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.950
but I think there's a more specific in particular,

178
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.830
uh,
man,
uh,
that is the,
uh,
um,
uh,

179
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.420
irritant that sets the poem going,
uh,
uh,

180
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.031
a man,

181
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:12.031
a figure of a man who like a romantic poet has arrogated to himself the position

182
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:15.920
to,
you know,
taking the view,
you know,
stand like a,

183
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.350
the figure in a Caspar David Friedrich painting.
And,
uh,
you know,
uh,

184
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.440
gaze into the sublime.
Uh,

185
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.670
meanwhile more is somewhere else.

186
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.900
Uh,
where is she?
Well,
uh,
she's somewhere behind him,
uh,

187
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.880
because he's blocked her view,
man,

188
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.200
looking into the sea,

189
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:42.370
taking the view from those who have as much right to it is you have to yourself.

190
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.040
Well,
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing.
She says,
uh,

191
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.830
trying to,
uh,
uh,
make sense of this.
Um,
more,
uh,

192
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.680
has,
uh,
a couple comments here that,
that,
uh,

193
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.500
describe the origins of this poem.
Uh,

194
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:03.130
it's not the first quotation on your handout.
She says,
uh,

195
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.540
as for a grave,
uh,

196
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.370
it has a significance apart from the literal origin.

197
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:12.220
But here's the literal origin.
Uh,

198
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.440
it was a man who placed himself between my mother and me and the surf.

199
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:21.910
We were watching from the Middle Ledge of rocks on Monhegan island after the

200
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:25.210
storm.
Don't be annoyed.
My mother said,

201
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.370
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing.
Uh,
it is,

202
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:35.320
uh,
you know,
important that however more was annoyed,
she was annoyed into poetry,

203
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:39.730
you could say.
Uh,
and she took her mother with her.
Uh,

204
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.661
you know,
uh,

205
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:44.500
the palm is really written from the perspective of a daughter and mother,

206
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.701
uh,

207
00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:50.690
and a daughter with an intimate relationship to her mother who,
um,

208
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.330
uh,
absorbs here and very often elsewhere in her poetry,

209
00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.950
uh,
actual quotations from.
But even more importantly,

210
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.140
a style of speech and attitude,
uh,

211
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.160
associated with her mother who talks a lot like Dr. Samuel Johnson or some

212
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:13.520
other,
uh,
18th century,
uh,
uh,

213
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:18.350
a figure and moralist like that.
Uh,
Mrs. Moore,

214
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.960
uh,
someone that Marianne,
uh,
uh,

215
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.920
always identified with herself.
Um,

216
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:33.790
it's significant here that more is using quotation from her mother and not

217
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.960
acknowledging it,
uh,
in any particular way,
uh,
as if the two women had,

218
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.360
you know,
one voice and one perspective,
uh,

219
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.720
the man that blocks their point of view,
uh,
and you know,

220
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:50.540
blocks their point of view.
You could say in many senses they're,
you know,

221
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:55.400
literal point of view of the water.
But also,
uh,
in the point of view,

222
00:15:55.401 --> 00:16:00.170
he takes,
uh,
in effect,
ignores and suppresses.
There's,

223
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.460
uh,
he is standing in the posture,
as I suggested,

224
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.610
a kind of conventional romantic visionary,
uh,

225
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.520
staring into the sea emblem of infinity.
Uh,
well,
it might be hard crane,

226
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:17.720
right?
Uh,
uh,
writing at Melville's tomb a,

227
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.650
although crane wouldn't write that poem for a few more years.
Uh,
and,

228
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:25.190
and when he did,
incidentally,
he sent it to Marianne Moore,

229
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:29.040
who was then the editor of the dial,
who sends it back and rejected it.

230
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.880
Um,
uh,
Morris,
a poem,
uh,
is,
uh,
in fact,

231
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:39.350
as I suggested,
an early poem of hers and an Early Act of self definition,

232
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.330
uh,
that's quite a important,
uh,
in,

233
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.410
in both the impersonality of the point of view.

234
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:50.210
And yet the insistent,
um,
uh,
individuality of that,

235
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:55.180
that point of view.
Um,
Maura's poems are like this.
They seem impersonal,

236
00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:00.090
and yet they're at the same time,
deeply personal and deeply,
um,
uh,

237
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.480
individual.
Uh,

238
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.510
here she celebrates the power of the sea to resist the imposition of the

239
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:12.470
observers will,
uh,
or,
uh,

240
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.360
the will of the sailor a or a seafarer.
Uh,

241
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.940
uh,
you know,
and again,
we can think of a deceased or pounds seafair.

242
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.480
Uh,
you know,
the,
the sea is a well,
the sea is,

243
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.970
uh,
uh,

244
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.570
the sea is a collector quick to return a repeat purchase.
Look,

245
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.460
I,
if you want to take possession of the sea in some way,
well,

246
00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:43.580
don't think you can do that because this is a grander force than you,

247
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:48.560
and it will take you up,
uh,
and drown you.
Uh,
which is what,
uh,

248
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:53.170
the poem,
um,
uh,
it goes on to describe,
uh,

249
00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.320
the sea has here the forest that it does,
uh,
in,
uh,
other,
uh,

250
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.730
great poems by more like the fish or sojourn in the whale.

251
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.340
It seems to stand for death.
Uh,
it is,

252
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.980
uh,
a grave.
Uh,

253
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:15.981
it is a grave in which you could say a certain idea of romantic.

254
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:21.711
And I think specifically male subjectivity is overcome and buried,

255
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.300
shown its limits.
Uh,
in this poem,
the human,

256
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.860
uh,
uh,
imagined.
Finally,

257
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:35.820
as something that twists and turns in the depths,
uh,

258
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
is converted by natural forces into a part of the natural world that it sought

259
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.550
through the man's perspective to dominate

260
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.950
more,
sent this poem,
uh,
to pound.

261
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.760
These poets are always sending their poems to pound.
Uh,

262
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.740
he responded with admiration in that second quotation there.
He says,

263
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:04.710
thank God,
even though you are a woman,

264
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:10.310
I think you can be trusted not to pour out a flood in the manner of dear Amy

265
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.680
Lowell and Edgar Lee Masters,
who though not a woman,
was a,
uh,

266
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.440
sentimental regionalist,
uh,
and,
and not,
you know,
uh,

267
00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:22.800
an international modernist,
uh,

268
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.450
pound is approving of more here.
Uh,

269
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.890
he,
he,
uh,
approves that she does not Gush.
Uh,
she,

270
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:36.540
she does not emote.
Uh,
she has not written a sentimental poem.
In fact,

271
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:40.920
in certain way,
she's written an anti sentimental poem.
Um,

272
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.680
I think it's important that,
uh,

273
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.710
more a rhetorical choices have prevented her from doing so.

274
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.781
Uh,
the,

275
00:19:49.781 --> 00:19:54.781
the poem has the kind of formal self-discipline it does.

276
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.490
Uh,
again,
these are,
these are,
uh,
aspects of,

277
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:02.640
of restraint in the poetry.

278
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.830
More is dry.
Uh,
in all respects,

279
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.990
uh,
at the same time,
uh,
these are,

280
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.470
these are modernist values,
uh,
you know,
uh,
values,
uh,

281
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:21.030
that that pound would describe in his image,
just manifesto and elsewhere.

282
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.030
Um,
at the same time

283
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.640
more gets her dryness not by disavowing femininity or suppressing it or,

284
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:37.550
or attacking it,
uh,
as one of her peers might've,
uh,

285
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.090
she does it rather specifically in this act of challenging man.

286
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.250
Uh,
let me look with you at the letter that,
um,

287
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:52.440
more wrote to,
um,
pounds,
uh,
uh,

288
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.570
in response,
um,
that,
um,

289
00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.650
um,
acts as a kind of now letter of introduction.

290
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.670
Uh,
and it has a lot of interesting things in it,

291
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:10.600
and it's probably a good introduction to who she is for us to,

292
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.430
uh,
she says,
uh,
um,

293
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.260
I was born in 1887 and brought up in the home of my grandfather clergymen of the

294
00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:21.610
Presbyterian church.

295
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.320
She comes from a Christian and God fearing home.

296
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.010
Uh,
I am Irish by descent,

297
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.610
and that's part of where some of the combativeness comes from,

298
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.290
possibly scotch also,
but purely Celtic.
Uh,

299
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:42.340
was graduated from Brynmore where she knew and befriended HD.

300
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:48.100
Uh,
taught shorthand.
Typewriting.
Uh,
she's worked for a living,

301
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.330
uh,

302
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.330
in 1916 my mother Mary Warner more and I left a home and a Carlisle to be with,

303
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.060
uh,
her brother,
a chaplain,

304
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.300
a of the battleship Rhode Island.
There's,

305
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:04.330
there's a lot of Christianity and the family.

306
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.400
Uh,
she says,
and then she's living with her mother in New York.

307
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.030
And indeed she would spend the rest of her life living with her mother in New

308
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:17.290
York,
in Greenwich Village and in Brooklyn,
in a small apartment.

309
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:23.290
Contrary to your impression,
I am all together blonde and have red hair.

310
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.560
Uh,
pound had asked,
uh,
uh,

311
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.850
whether she was Ethiopian after he read the poem Black Earth,

312
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.560
read black earth and think,
decide whether the,

313
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:40.180
whether Marion war isn't Ethiopian.
Uh,
this is important.

314
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.980
She says,
any verse that I have written has been an arrangement of stanzas.

315
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.710
Each stanza being an exact duplicate of every other stanza.

316
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.330
This is not always true,
but she claims it is.

317
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.940
I have occasionally been at pains to make an arrangement of lines and rhymes

318
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:02.560
that I like repeat itself.

319
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.450
But the form of the original stands of anything I've written has been a matter

320
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:12.451
of expediency hit upon as being approximately suitable to the subject matter,

321
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.610
the resemblance of my progress to your beginnings as an accident.
I didn't,

322
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.840
I wasn't influenced by you pound when I started writing syllabic verse because

323
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:27.370
pound had experimented with this himself.
Uh,
there's,

324
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:31.300
there's a couple ideas here that are important.
Um,
uh,

325
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.320
first of all that,
um,
more identifies as it were,

326
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.560
two moments of creativity,
uh,

327
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.720
involved in the making of her poems.

328
00:23:40.721 --> 00:23:45.721
One is a moment of spontaneity and expediency in which lines almost like some

329
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:51.290
kind of,
um,
uh,
you know,
channeled speech,

330
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:51.890
uh,

331
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.890
arrive in a certain form and then she makes that form in it's contingency in

332
00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:02.940
accidental illness,
uh,
repeat itself.
Uh,

333
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.720
she goes on and,
uh,
uh,
in other words,

334
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.720
what came by chance,
she repeats through will,

335
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.180
uh,
through discipline.
Um,

336
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.980
this is a significant,
uh,
and it's related to,

337
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.090
uh,
uh,
kind of,
um,
uh,

338
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.750
well to her originality of form.
Uh,

339
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:30.890
which is something at once,
something,
uh,

340
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.570
that as it were,
comes to her naturally and that she,
um,
uh,

341
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.550
builds on self consciously and through,
um,

342
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.090
a kind of rigorous self discipline.

343
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.090
She says then I do not appear,

344
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:48.860
she meant I don't appear in literary periodicals.

345
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:52.940
You can't find my poems anywhere.
Uh,
but there's a,
um,

346
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.880
but the line itself is wonderfully suggestive and simple.
The,

347
00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.070
the sentence I do not appear.
Uh,
and in fact,
uh,

348
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.790
more does not appear very much in her poems.
Um,

349
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.700
she is interestingly,
um,
uh,
backgrounded or uh,

350
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.240
even invisible,
uh,

351
00:25:11.241 --> 00:25:15.200
in her palms in the ways that she is in a grave.

352
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.910
Um,
and then she says,
I grow less and less desirous of being published,

353
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.230
produce less and have a strong feeling for letting alone what little I do

354
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:28.670
produce.
Uh,
and uh,

355
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.570
then she continues to capitalize.

356
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:35.480
The first word of every line is rather slavish

357
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:39.260
as they do in 19th century poetry.

358
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.300
And I have substituted small letters for capitals in the closed versions of the

359
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:49.160
two pumps that you have.
This is,
this is another sort of distinctive,

360
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:50.120
formal choice,

361
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.740
more mix not to capitalize her first lines,

362
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.990
something Williams does to a,
in a graveyard.

363
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.500
She now goes on now talking about the poem,
a grave,
uh,

364
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.270
graves better than a graveyard.
Don't you think?
Uh,

365
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.550
the change that I have made is to the end of the line,
the very end of the poem.

366
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.200
Um,
uh,
as you suggest,
and for the sake of symmetry,
a,

367
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:21.110
I've altered the arrangement of lines in the proceedings stances.

368
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.130
I realized that by writing consciousness and volition,

369
00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.140
this is,
this is the order of the words that pound had proposed.

370
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:33.350
At the end of that poem,
emphasis,

371
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.330
emphasis is obtained,

372
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.840
which is sacrificed by retaining the order which I have.

373
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.460
That is Moore's order,
volition and then consciousness.

374
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.170
And I'm willing to make the change,
though I prefer the original order,

375
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.860
which in fact,
ultimately she kept,
uh,

376
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.090
let's look at the end of the poem again.
Uh,
the sea looks,

377
00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:01.620
uh,
well,
uh,
I'll read from line 20

378
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.230
pound said,
well,
that ending it doesn't quite do it.

379
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.180
Why aren't you switch consciousness and volition?
Uh,
with what implication,

380
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.530
uh,
that to,
uh,
that,

381
00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:18.730
that somehow volition is more important than consciousness,
uh,

382
00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.540
that it's the last thing to go.
Uh,

383
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:26.541
and the most dramatic thing to lose more however insists,

384
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.440
no,
that's not the case.
It's the other way around.

385
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.190
Consciousness is more important than volition.
In fact,

386
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.190
that's really what this whole poem is about.
You could say

387
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.430
a pound,
uh,

388
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.510
wanted the emphasis to,
uh,

389
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:51.170
take Moore's word that comes with stressing volition as most important.

390
00:27:51.271 --> 00:27:55.950
And in fact,
volition is nothing but a kind of expression of emphasis.
Uh,

391
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.420
she says no consciousness is more important.
And as she does,

392
00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.440
she emphasizes it.
Uh,

393
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:08.520
she introduces another kind of emphasis,
one associated,

394
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:13.080
not specifically,
uh,
with volition so much as,

395
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.430
uh,
the,
uh,
drama and power of consciousness,

396
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.320
which she insists on here.
Um,

397
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:29.030
although Moore's a poem could be in fact rat as,

398
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:34.950
as a kind of a rebuke in advance to Hart Crane,

399
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.890
uh,
in his poem,
uh,
at Melville's tomb.
Uh,
more in fact,

400
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.090
uh,
got to know,
and like crane in the 20s,
uh,

401
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:47.620
sometimes acting as his editor.
Uh,

402
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.640
when he sent poems to the dial for publication,

403
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.630
she turned back at Melville's tomb.
She accepted other poems.

404
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.910
One poem she accepted the Wine Menagerie,
uh,
was a poem,
um,
in,

405
00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:01.920
um,
uh,
quatrains,
uh,

406
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.260
she accepted it and then converted the poem into free verse,
uh,

407
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.170
in reduced it by half its size.
Uh,
crane accepted it,

408
00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.000
uh,
uh,
accepted this publication along with $10,
uh,

409
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:19.750
which he needed.
Uh,
but both,
uh,
both,
uh,

410
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.750
crane and more,
uh,
like Williams,
uh,
were,

411
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:29.700
uh,
I think self consciously American poets,
uh,

412
00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:31.620
and their Americanness,
uh,

413
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:36.000
is important to how they define themselves as modern poets.

414
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.070
Uh,
and there is really in all of them a certain kind of combative cultural

415
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.610
nationalism,
a which has a aesthetic,
uh,
and,
uh,

416
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:50.890
uh,
ethical,
um,
um,
uh,
implications.

417
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.960
Uh,
as an example,
uh,
let's turn a page back and look at the poem.

418
00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.360
England.
Uh,
okay.

419
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.140
Um,

420
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.140
the poem begins here as a series of national characatures.

421
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.380
Uh,
and then,
uh,
eventually,
uh,
uh,
it will,
uh,

422
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.720
move from these characatures,
uh,

423
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.740
which suggest ways of life and also aesthetic dispositions,

424
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.230
ways of doing and thinking about art.

425
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.150
I think she will move from that to talk about America.
Uh,
and,

426
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.160
uh,
what is American,
uh,
and,
uh,
this is,
you could say her,

427
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.540
her real subject here.

428
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.380
And then she will go on and,
and describe,
uh,
uh,
America.

429
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:46.300
Uh,
she will go on and contrast everything that she has just caricature,

430
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.030
uh,
in a,
in a polite,

431
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:53.470
but essentially negative way in each of those cases with,

432
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.310
uh,
with the American,
uh,
and specifically,
um,

433
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:01.930
with American speech,
uh,
and,
uh,
American English.

434
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.181
In other words,

435
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:09.181
just because Americans who say Sam or cam a sound like that instead of som or

436
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:13.270
calm,
that doesn't mean they're stupid or that the rest of America is.

437
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.530
In other words,
if you don't think you can get poetry in America,

438
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:21.730
you haven't looked.
It's a wonderful poem.

439
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.630
It's a defense of America,
uh,
and,
uh,

440
00:31:25.631 --> 00:31:30.220
American creativity,
uh,
American language.
Uh,

441
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:34.360
it is,
uh,
an attack on Euro centric cultural snobs.

442
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.390
Uh,
at the same time,

443
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.570
a more is not only or merely adding America as one among other nations.

444
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.050
Rather,
uh,

445
00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:52.051
America is the locality where this principle of hers is honored,

446
00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.500
uh,
a place that incorporates many other places,

447
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.070
many other cultures,
uh,

448
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.250
many other ways of feeling and thinking and speaking.

449
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.740
This principle,

450
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.710
the idea that inspiration has never been confined to one locality to one place,

451
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.840
uh,
affirms a kind of art,
uh,

452
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.960
that is not only a matter of high culture,
but that is also vernacular,

453
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.720
a regional heterogeneous,

454
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:28.350
popular and includes in it all kinds of materials.

455
00:32:28.481 --> 00:32:32.110
And you remember a quotation I,
uh,
uh,

456
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:38.070
pointed to in the first day of class when I quoted from,
uh,

457
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.020
Moore's poem and she was talking about all the things that should go in poetry

458
00:32:42.021 --> 00:32:46.580
and even,
uh,
uh,
business documents in school books.

459
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.960
Well,
America is a,
a place where you can put those things in poems.

460
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.990
Uh,
this is,
this is,
uh,
a proud,
uh,
also a comical,

461
00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:02.020
a principle.
It's a democratic principle for more,
uh,

462
00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.740
is it maybe also a feminist?
One.
Uh,

463
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.220
I think so.
Uh,

464
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.610
in so far as more defines what is American,
uh,

465
00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:17.210
as specifically,
uh,
in distinctively,
uh,

466
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.100
a non hierarchical point of view,
uh,
that is,
uh,

467
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.320
not so much a woman's point of view,

468
00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:29.570
so much as a point of view that accommodates that of a woman,

469
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:30.111
uh,

470
00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:35.111
among others within a multiplicity of human perspectives.

471
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.340
And in fact,
nonhuman perspectives,
uh,

472
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.450
she's serious about including this cats and dogs.

473
00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.170
Why is the poem called England?
Uh,

474
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.820
by incorporating,
uh,
the,

475
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:54.500
the title into the first line of the poem poem more makes it seem accidental.

476
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.180
Uh,
the Di,
the device,
uh,
for grounds,
uh,

477
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.600
Morris concision and practicality.

478
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:05.990
Why waste any extra words on the title?

479
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.150
A pound wants you to use no word that does not contribute to the presentation.

480
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.210
Okay.
Uh,
then,
uh,

481
00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.420
we'll make the title part of the presentation to,
uh,

482
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.550
the gesture is also a of a piece,

483
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.470
I think with more distrust of hierarchy itself.

484
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:32.180
Uh,
she says in effect,
the title is not,
uh,
uh,

485
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.370
more important than the rest of the poem.

486
00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:38.600
It doesn't stand outside it or above it.
Uh,
it's just part of it.

487
00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.840
Uh,
just as more founded slavish,
uh,

488
00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.330
and probably pretentious to capitalize the first word of every line of verse.

489
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:53.370
Uh,
she wants,
uh,
to,
uh,
in that sense give dignity to the lower case.

490
00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.610
Two to non capital letters

491
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.440
at the same time more is very wildly and clever.
Uh,

492
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.040
England really is important here.
Uh,
that is,

493
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:11.950
it's not merely the first nation in an arbitrarily arrange list.
Uh,

494
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.100
she's defending America and American English,
uh,

495
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:19.970
specifically against the noted superiority of England and English literature

496
00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:21.440
where of course,

497
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:26.441
pound Eliot Frost and others had gone to establish themselves as poets.

498
00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.420
Uh,
and,
and to this extent,
she's saying that the,
the title is,
uh,
uh,

499
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.560
not so important that a,
it stands above the poem.

500
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.400
England not so important,
uh,
that it stands over and above America.

501
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.040
Uh,
and,
and in this sense,

502
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:48.690
the title in fact turns out to be important and to give us important
information,

503
00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:53.520
uh,
because she's out here to make England less important.

504
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.470
Uh,
and to deny it,
it's pride of place.
Well,

505
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.260
uh,
we've got just a few minutes left to start.
Uh,

506
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.380
a long,
uh,
difficult,
uh,

507
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:12.410
and truly marvelous poem called an octopus that exemplifies more as a nature

508
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:20.550
poet,
um,
and

509
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.700
exemplifies,
uh,

510
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.560
many of the distinctive features of her writing.
Uh,

511
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:32.790
again,
uh,
this is on four 41.
Um,

512
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:36.510
the,
uh,
title of the poem is the first line.

513
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.320
Uh,
we might think that,
uh,
this is going to be a poem about an octopus.

514
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.480
Uh,
well,
not exactly a in effect.
The,

515
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.990
the,
uh,
uh,
title is a,
is a kind of riddle that the,
uh,

516
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.360
poem will go on and explain and expand on.

517
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.170
It's a poem about Mount Rainier,
uh,

518
00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.540
Mount Rainier where we're more went,
uh,

519
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.720
with her brother John in 1922,
that same year that,

520
00:37:09.721 --> 00:37:13.260
uh,
Joyce published Ulysses and,
uh,

521
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.220
Elliot ended the idea of poetry for ladies in the wasteland.

522
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.430
Uh,
the poem involves a kind of a essential contradiction,

523
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.960
which it works through,
uh,
in complex ways.

524
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.170
On the one hand,
the mountain that,
um,

525
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.880
more calls an octopus that she's writing about here,

526
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:41.430
uh,
is something that is exactly other,

527
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.080
it's outside the poet.
It's,
it's out there like the sea in,

528
00:37:46.081 --> 00:37:49.290
in a a grave.
Uh,
it's objectified.

529
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:54.291
It's something more has to stand apart from perhaps try to conquer in the form

530
00:37:56.971 --> 00:38:01.860
of climbing it or conquer in the form of representing it in her writing.

531
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.840
And yet in the course of the poem,
the,
uh,

532
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.850
mountain and it's glacier,
which is really the octopus that she's talking about,

533
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:17.340
um,
uh,
is something that more identifies herself with,

534
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.620
uh,
that,
uh,

535
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:23.820
comes to look like more in certain ways.
Uh,

536
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:29.100
it comes to be identified with the force of her art.

537
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:35.090
So it's both kind of version of herself and it's a version of something other

538
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.640
to,
um,

539
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.260
the palm is filled with an extraordinary and bewildering detail that evokes the

540
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:47.680
natural world as,
uh,

541
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.010
one of,
uh,
extraordinary and bewildering detail.
Um,

542
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.120
at the same time,

543
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:01.230
it combines and creates a fantastic collage of quotation from a wild variety of

544
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:08.080
sources.
Um,

545
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:13.420
it's hard to know where to start and stop in this poem when its parts are,

546
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.560
uh,
it's a,
a question that in a,

547
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:22.050
in a sense more is asking about the mountain itself.
Um,

548
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.070
there's in general a kind of analogy,
uh,
throughout,
uh,
the palm,
uh,

549
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.330
between the mountain and the woman who admires it,
uh,

550
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:35.430
whose mind itself can seem octopus like and reaches out in these long a tentacle

551
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:43.390
like lines to grasp the world,
make it her own,

552
00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:47.470
a,
freeze it in poetic language.
Uh,

553
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.480
even while she's insisting on the,
the,
the wonderful otherness of the world.

554
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.330
Um,
I won't,
I won't,
um,
uh,

555
00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.920
start reading now at the end of class,

556
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:04.921
but let me say a couple of further things about the poem and ask you to reread

557
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:09.820
it,
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
and to,
um,

558
00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.660
knowing that it's hard,
um,

559
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.400
reread it more than once and maybe not continuously.

560
00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:21.460
It's a very hard palm to read continuously.
Uh,

561
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.330
be sure to read the last paragraph of it carefully.

562
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:28.280
That begins on four 44.
Um,

563
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.830
let me say something before we stop about quotation.

564
00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:39.520
You remember,
uh,
that the sea in a grave,
uh,
mocked,

565
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.170
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
um,
uh,
rapacious collector,

566
00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.260
uh,
more herself was a great collector.
Uh,
she collected,

567
00:40:50.261 --> 00:40:55.240
among other things,
quotations,
uh,
she in grosses them.

568
00:40:55.241 --> 00:41:00.030
She,
uh,
uh,
gathers them to her.
Uh,
she,
uh,
um,

569
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.790
uh,
you know,
masters,
uh,
her reading,

570
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.460
uh,
she brings them into this poem,
uh,
in,
as I say,

571
00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:14.410
a kind of a collage,
a,
it gives the palm mcchain of,
um,

572
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:20.230
well a very strange poly vocality.
There's many,
many voices here.

573
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.150
Uh,
think of the wasteland well more,
more rivals it in this poem.

574
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.320
Uh,
many voices that again,

575
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.070
democratically allow for you could say multiple perspectives,

576
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.750
uh,
multiple kinds of material,
uh,

577
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.680
unlike the wasteland.
Uh,
uh,
more is not,

578
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.330
I'm quoting a only high art sources by and large.

579
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:51.680
Well Elliot has his popular culture too,

580
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.520
but we know that it's,
uh,
it's pretty much a high culture pump.

581
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.450
Well more is making her poem out of magazines,

582
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.430
out of a pamphlet from the national parks portfolio,

583
00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:09.110
uh,
through her reading and Reskin,
uh,
and uh,

584
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.190
many other sources.
Uh,

585
00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.970
and it treats those various texts.
Uh,

586
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:21.010
you could say non hierarchically without a kind of regard to generic valuations.

587
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:26.870
She doesn't play off high and low as Elliot does in a game of chess,

588
00:42:26.871 --> 00:42:28.550
for example.
Uh,

589
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.760
it makes the sources of poetic language and a poetry continuous with ordinary

590
00:42:35.601 --> 00:42:39.630
life.
Uh,
her activities of reading.
Uh,

591
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.820
and at the same time,

592
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.860
it makes a more as inspiration,

593
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:48.950
deeply personal,
uh,
because who else?

594
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:53.600
But Marianne Moore would have read all this stuff or just these things,

595
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:58.700
um,
like pound,
uh,

596
00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:03.150
a kind of visionary scholar,
uh,
who,
who found his,
his,
uh,

597
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.850
muse in a,
in a translated homer,
uh,
more,

598
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.770
uh,
knowing that,
that,

599
00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:13.820
that literary inspiration is not confined to any locality,

600
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:19.190
finds it all over the place in her reading.
Uh,
but again,

601
00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.790
what she's reading is something different from Elliot and pound.

602
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:25.430
And I'll say more about that next time.
