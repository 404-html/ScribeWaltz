1
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.530
This is a,
not only a course for English majors,

2
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.440
but for other majors to the poets we'll be reading.
Well,
they,
uh,

3
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.190
they knew about science,
music,
politics,
economics,

4
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.890
and they presume to talk about those things,
uh,

5
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.980
in their poetry and out of their poetry to,
uh,
my lectures,
uh,

6
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.420
are going to presume no special knowledge,
uh,
on your part.

7
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.730
Uh,
I,
uh,

8
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.180
I see this as a a course that's an introduction to the literature of a period,

9
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.430
uh,
to modern poetry.
Uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

10
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.160
we'll be studying several poets in some detail.
Um,
uh,

11
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.240
they,
uh,
presumption as well that they,
they all,
uh,

12
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.900
reward and,
and demand a certain amount of,
of close reading.
Uh,

13
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.410
at the same time,

14
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.440
I do mean to give you some sense of the period in which they're writing,

15
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.360
uh,
some sense of modernism as a,
as a field,

16
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.700
as one of the richest fields in,
in English language writing.

17
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.740
Uh,
finally though,
uh,
this really is a course in poetry,
uh,

18
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.420
plain and simple.
I mean,
to,
uh,

19
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.210
introduce you to particular poems,
uh,

20
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.890
to give you ways to possess them,
uh,
enjoy them.

21
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.200
Uh,
be,
uh,
puzzled or,
or frustrated by them to,
uh,

22
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.890
to learn something from them,
uh,

23
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.310
and to care about them and to carry them with you as you,

24
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.260
as you go forward,
uh,
after this class.
So,

25
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.820
uh,
that's a sense of what I want to,
uh,
accomplish in these lectures.

26
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.910
Uh,
it will mean reading a lot of poems,
uh,
in writing about them.
Some,

27
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.280
uh,
the syllabus,
you'll see notes,
that general topic of each lecture,

28
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.240
uh,
and the reading that I,
I want you to have done for that day.

29
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.820
Uh,
there's a midterm,
uh,
that will be a short answer test.

30
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.590
That's a intended to give you a chance to show how diligently you've been

31
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.480
reading and coming to class.
Uh,
the,
uh,
the final,
uh,

32
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.020
will include both,
uh,
a short answer component.

33
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.730
And then some essay questions.
There are two papers,

34
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.130
uh,
a shorter and a slightly longer one.
Uh,

35
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.740
the first paper is going to ask you to write about one short poem.
Uh,

36
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.780
the second we'll ask you to write about a two or more poems or poems,

37
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.520
perhaps by two authors or perhaps a poem.

38
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.640
And some other kind of text or image,

39
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.270
uh,
the,
uh,
teaching fellows in this course.
I'm lucky to work with you to,

40
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.980
uh,
they,
uh,
are trained in,
have had an interest in modern poetry.

41
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.170
Uh,
and,
and this is,
uh,
a,

42
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.170
a happy collaboration for me with them.
Uh,
as I say,

43
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.820
we'll start to get our discussion sections organized on Monday.

44
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.590
Uh,
and they should be set,
I hope by the Wednesday lecture next week.

45
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.510
I want you to come to lecture on time.
G,
while did today.
I started on time.

46
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.780
I don't always do that.
Uh,
but I'd like to,
uh,
and I can,
if you come,
uh,

47
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.420
at 1130 bring your books,
uh,

48
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.570
I'm going to be talking about the texts and I hope you'll have them open.

49
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.200
Uh,
and,

50
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.750
and of course you will come to your discussion sections in the same state of

51
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.520
joyful preparedness.
Uh,
and as I say,
the,

52
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.030
the syllabus is,
uh,

53
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.940
should be accessible on the class classes vitu server.
However,

54
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.270
I've had problems with that in the past and you should please let me know if

55
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:18.250
it's not.
Uh,
they are just two books for the course.
Uh,

56
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.640
they're both at labyrinth.
Uh,
one is,
uh,

57
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.670
the first volume of the Norton Anthology of modern and contemporary poetry.

58
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.180
Third Edition.
Uh,
it's edited by Johanne Ramezani,

59
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.890
formerly a teaching fellow in this course.
Uh,
there's also,
uh,

60
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.910
Elizabeth Bishop's collected poems.
Uh,

61
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.920
there will be a packet that you can order from Ras that's,
uh,

62
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.270
uh,
gathers a few supplementary readings.

63
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.400
Uh,
there will be the visual images that I'm going to talk about in lecture,
uh,

64
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.890
and then I will make accessible to you on the class of server.
Uh,

65
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.580
they're also,
uh,
audio recordings of,

66
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:07.430
of the poets that we will be reading that come from sterling.
Uh,

67
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.770
and,
and you can get to on the center for language study,
website,

68
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.530
all those things.
Uh,
uh,
we can,
uh,
talk about,
uh,

69
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.580
more as the semester develops.
Uh,

70
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.380
and I hope you will talk to me.
Uh,
you can do that on email.

71
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:29.110
You can do that,
uh,
in my office,
uh,

72
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:33.940
which is downstairs in the first floor of this building in a LC one oh nine,

73
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.920
uh,
you can catch me after lecture or,
or before.
Uh,

74
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.620
we can have lunch,
uh,
all sorts of,
um,
opportunities,
uh,

75
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.050
for talking and,
and,
uh,
I hope you'll take advantage of it.

76
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.233
Uh,

77
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.090
for Monday we're going to start talking about Robert Frost.
Uh,
and,

78
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480
and I'd like you to,
um,
uh,

79
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.700
pay special attention to his poem mowing in the Ras Packet,

80
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.250
uh,
and to his palm birches in the Norton.
Um,
as you read,

81
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.560
pay a special attention to images of tools,
work,

82
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.720
uh,
play,
uh,
read Frost's,
uh,

83
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.910
uh,
short poetic statement,
uh,
pros,

84
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:27.240
poetic statement,
uh,
in the,
in the Norton called,
uh,

85
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.790
the figure poem mix.
So,
uh,

86
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.380
the Norton Anthology,
this book,
uh,
this heavy book,

87
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.640
I ordered it as a,
as a way to,
um,
uh,

88
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.470
well reduce your expenses.
Here's just one big book to buy.

89
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.380
Uh,
it also provides needed annotation.
Uh,

90
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.290
modern poetry is in need of annotation.
Uh,
this,

91
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:59.120
this new addition of this old book,
um,
is,
is an excellent one.

92
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.910
You should read Johanne Ramezani's introduction,
uh,
read his pros notes.

93
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.870
Uh,
you know,

94
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.220
that preface his various selections.

95
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.410
Uh,
having said that,
uh,

96
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.280
there's really nothing so dead as a Norton Anthology,
uh,
you know,
uh,
or,
or,

97
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:23.870
or ponderous,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
uh,
you know,
I,

98
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:28.760
I do order it with a little,
uh,
um,
well some misgivings,

99
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.560
uh,
for that.
Uh,

100
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.450
the palms come to you abstracted from the contexts in which they were originally

101
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:40.100
produced a and read,
uh,
you know,
from,

102
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.810
from their place in a body of work,
in a book,
in a magazine,
uh,

103
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.050
uh,
in a life that,
uh,
uh,
produced,

104
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.600
uh,
the,
um,

105
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.490
in order to counteract the packaged in monumental form of,
of the Norton,

106
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.803
uh,

107
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.340
I will be using binary keys and sterling's resources,

108
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.550
uh,
using a PowerPoint,

109
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.720
a digitized files,
uh,
this whole,
uh,

110
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:14.760
allow me to project images,
uh,

111
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.310
in class and for you to look at them later,
uh,
at home,

112
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.660
uh,
there'll be files for not all,
but most of the poets that we,
uh,

113
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.030
discuss,
uh,

114
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:31.060
in the aim is to give you some sense through those images of modern poetry in

115
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:36.840
its historical material,
uh,

116
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.780
dimensions,
uh,
to,
to represent it as,
as something that was lived,
uh,

117
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.960
and in many ways is living now.

118
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.353
Now,
uh,

119
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:53.090
the poems that you'll be reading we'll be talking about did not,
of course,
oh,

120
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:57.060
eggs exist in the form that you find them.
Uh,

121
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.750
their first form was very often a manuscript.

122
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.670
Uh,
if you go to buy Nikki,
you can,
you can find a,

123
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:09.430
and we will go to binding.
[inaudible] those of you who want to come with me,
uh,

124
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.660
and,
and look at,
um,
uh,

125
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.850
manuscripts that were early versions of texts that you now find in the Norton

126
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.060
and other books,
uh,

127
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.120
when poems that had gone through their processes of revision and so forth and

128
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:32.790
came to publication,
they very often,
uh,
were published first,

129
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.850
uh,
not in book form,
certainly,
uh,

130
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:40.851
but rather in little magazines that are now more or less loss to us today,

131
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.130
but were in fact the,
uh,
essential vehicle for the creation of modern poetry.

132
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.650
Uh,
what is a little magazine?
Uh,
it is,
um,
well,

133
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.350
very often they were big,
uh,
you know,
uh,

134
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.790
begin in format and size.
Um,

135
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.700
they were little because their circulation was small.
Uh,

136
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.590
these were the funded on a shoe string,
uh,

137
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.950
magazines that,
uh,
uh,
rose up and,

138
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:15.180
and very frequently faded away just as quickly,
uh,

139
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:18.660
in the 1910 in 1920s.
Uh,

140
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:20.820
and that were in many cases,

141
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:25.650
the first avenue of publication for Steven's Elliot.
Uh,
more,

142
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.400
uh,
the poem poets that you will be reading in this class.

143
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.700
These magazines were

144
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.600
acutely aware of their differences from the popular literary magazines of the

145
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:43.050
19th century.
Uh,
general interest,

146
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.160
a popular magazines of the 20th century,
uh,

147
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.900
magazines with wide circulation,
polite audiences.

148
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:52.880
Uh,

149
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880
the little magazine was written to by address to new young writers and artists,

150
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.340
uh,
and they were determined to make trouble.
They,

151
00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:08.370
uh,
well the,
the,
uh,

152
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:14.290
nothing I think captures the nerve of,
uh,

153
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.350
these magazines like the cover of blast blast,

154
00:11:19.351 --> 00:11:21.030
which meant Kaboom,

155
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.480
a magazine as a kind of bomb,

156
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.030
a kind of bomb or maybe a curse.
Damn you blast.

157
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.190
Uh,
pound was one of the,
uh,
contributors,

158
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.480
uh,
Elliot's rhapsody on a windy night,

159
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.210
a period here in,
uh,
uh,
this number of the magazine,
uh,

160
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.960
from 1915
July,

161
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.650
1915 in the midst of the first World War,
uh,

162
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.450
rogue,
another also from 1915.

163
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.840
Notice the price 5 cents,
uh,

164
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.410
Steevens appeared here in this magazine.

165
00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.300
You could contrast the rogue Gish and fanciful,

166
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.830
uh,
uh,

167
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.860
clearly done by hand title of the magazine with that machine type blast.

168
00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.900
Uh,
uh,
both of these are,
are,
are mischievous,
oppositional,

169
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.670
uh,
magazines,
but with very different styles and attitudes.

170
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.560
<v 0>Here's another</v>

172
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.013
<v 1>room.</v>

173
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.400
<v 0>Uh,
this is a magazine just slightly later.
Uh,</v>

174
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.790
this is an issue of 1922.
Uh,

175
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.840
it's a cover by a fair [inaudible].

176
00:12:48.841 --> 00:12:52.160
J Hart Crane would appear here.

177
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.720
A broom broom meant to make a clean sweep of things,

178
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.300
a clean sweep of what had come before.
Uh,
it,
uh,

179
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.553
uh,

180
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:08.580
it also clearly meant to have fun doing it here.
Whoops,
let me,

181
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.100
uh,
I've gone too far.
This is the back of the magazine.
You can,

182
00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.530
I don't know how well you can make it out,
but there's a,

183
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.130
there's a little broom guy there with glasses,
uh,

184
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.120
playing air guitar with his broom.
Uh,
and,

185
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:27.680
and I guess this is meant to capture the spirit of the contributors.

186
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.940
Uh,
uh,
contrast that with

187
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.930
<v 1>all right.</v>

188
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.420
<v 0>And magazine that flashed their a moment ago.
The criterion,</v>

189
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.460
this is a long way from broom.
Uh,
this is October,
1922,

190
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.770
uh,
comes out just before Broome has created a,

191
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:54.280
here you've got a magazine that doesn't present itself as attacking anything.

192
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:59.200
At all,
uh,
but rather as what,
as setting the standard,
the criterion,

193
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.420
it looks official.
It doesn't,
it,
uh,
the editor is

194
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.660
ts Eliot.
Uh,
this is the first number of the magazine.

195
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:16.770
The magazine in many ways announced and facilitated Elliot's rise to a kind of

196
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:22.080
cultural authority as a tastemaker.
Uh,

197
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.680
and with it a certain ideas of modernism.
Uh,
this,
uh,

198
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.110
issue here October,

199
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.070
1922 includes the way slam by PSLE yet.
Uh,

200
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:35.770
it also includes a little bit further down the page,

201
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:40.771
a review an essay by Valerie Lara bow on a new novel by James Joyce called

202
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:42.994
Ulysses.

203
00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.343
<v 1>Uh,</v>

204
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.260
<v 0>that's some sense of the spectrum of,
of magazines that are,</v>

205
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:53.360
that are coming out all with,
with,
uh,
uh,

206
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.460
different roles to play in this culture,

207
00:14:55.461 --> 00:15:00.350
in that position there they're writers and poets and artists associated with

208
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:01.610
them in different ways.

209
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.360
Book publication can be just as interesting and it can tell us just as much

210
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.030
about modern poetry and his magazines.

211
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.820
This is the wind among the reeds,

212
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.920
author William Butler Yeats,
uh,

213
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:23.330
the year 1899 on the verge of the new century.

214
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.310
It's a beautiful book.
It's a book that wants to be beautiful,
uh,

215
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.870
that's happy to be beautiful.
Uh,
it's rich in color and texture.

216
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.130
Uh,
it's designed embossed guilt.
It's well self,

217
00:15:38.131 --> 00:15:42.170
consciously Irish,
Celtic.
Uh,
there,

218
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.260
there's a sense that you're supposed to leave the bookstore with it,

219
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:49.760
with a kind of talisman that you,
you have,
you have,
you have bought,
uh,

220
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.120
uh,
with,
uh,
with,
uh,
a Celtic charm.

221
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.530
Contrast
this book

222
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.480
Prufrock uh,
and other observations.

223
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:07.481
The subtitle left off here of the cover of ts Elliot's a great book published in

224
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:13.400
1917.
Mm.
This is a different,
different object,

225
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:17.930
isn't it?
Severe unsentimental dry.

226
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.670
Uh,
so much so as to be maybe even a little bit funny.
And you laughed,
right?

227
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.860
Uh,
and I think you're supposed to,
uh,
it's not entirely serious.

228
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:28.821
Uh,

229
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:33.821
even as it declares its seriousness if Yates is book was so explicitly Irish.

230
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.610
Look at this book.
Uh,

231
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.870
it has no observable nationality at all.
Does it?

232
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.910
A certain kind of,
well,
you might say,
ah,
impersonality uh,

233
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.920
it's rhetoric is so flat and unemotional.
Uh,

234
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.730
uh,
so overtly UN rhetorical,
uh,

235
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.440
it is in fact a very deliberate and self-conscious repudiation of that late

236
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:06.560
romantic aesthetic that Yates is early book.

237
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.680
And even the cover of that early book represents Prufrock isn't beautiful.

238
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.080
Uh,
in its author is not a bard.

239
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.910
Another book,
another book cover the weary blues by Langston Hughes.

240
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.110
1926,
uh,
unlike Prufrock,

241
00:17:27.111 --> 00:17:29.690
this one is full of color.
Uh,

242
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.200
and of course it is the work of a poet of color.
Uh,

243
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.840
the image presents the book not as a work of poetry at all,

244
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.910
uh,
but rather as a kind of music,
uh,
as,
as a book of Blues,
uh,

245
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.860
in it associates.
Uh,
it's poet singer with honkytonk piano,

246
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.300
not brooms,
Bohemian egg head air guitarist.
Uh,

247
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.680
but,
uh,
another kind of a vernacular,
uh,

248
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.530
another kind of,
um,
well celebration and,
and,
um,

249
00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.360
um,
uh,
another kind of music

250
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.780
makes us think about black artists playing for living in prohibition era,

251
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:17.700
back rooms.
Now,
poems,

252
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.700
uh,
like books

253
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.770
project an image of the poet who produces them,
uh,

254
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.980
while the poet is creating her or his poems.

255
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.250
The poet is also creating a poet,

256
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.340
a certain figure of the poet,

257
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.920
a public image of the poet.
And this is an evolving project,

258
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.720
a work in progress that's part of the work and part of the subject.

259
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:53.640
And part of what I will be talking about here,
let's look for example,

260
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:57.450
at a series of photos of Ezra pound

261
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.330
together,

262
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:05.330
they tell a kind of encapsulated history of this central fascinating,

263
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.270
problematic poets career.
Uh,

264
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.170
he begins as well as an aesthete.

265
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.790
This is 1913 pound and the London,
uh,

266
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.690
styling himself,
isn't he a,

267
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.660
after those renaissance artists and poets,
uh,

268
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.370
whom he would,
uh,
uh,
write about translate,
uh,

269
00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:34.371
in this period it could be a miniature worn by a province.

270
00:19:34.711 --> 00:19:38.610
Saul Damsel.
No.
Well,

271
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:45.050
here he is,
a little later pound after the war,
uh,
in a,

272
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.520
uh,
1923,
uh,

273
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.660
and I've sort of full flower of modernism.
Uh,

274
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:56.010
still a young man,
but he's got that cane.
Uh,
and uh,

275
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:00.900
uh,
he's in Paris,
uh,
where,
where,
uh,

276
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.540
uh,
he would meet,
uh,
Elliot and work on the wasteland with him.

277
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.200
Well,
fast forward 20 years,

278
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.540
this has pound pound accused of treason,

279
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.650
pound accused of treason by his country,
uh,

280
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:24.651
accused of treason as he tries to bend the world to his vision of it.

281
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.500
And he escapes trial only by reason of insanity when he is brought from Italy,

282
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.950
uh,
under charges of,
of having a maid,
broadcasts on Fascist Radio,

283
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.340
uh,
back to the United States after an ordeal in,
uh,

284
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.980
a cage in Piza where,

285
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.360
uh,
he,
uh,
poses for this photo,

286
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.390
uh,
as an intake photo,
uh,

287
00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.420
as he enters Saint Elizabeth Hospital for the insane in Washington.

288
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.860
In this final photo photo from 1971 back in Italy and Apollo well,

289
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:13.010
here's pound,
uh,
uh,
and,
uh,

290
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.710
presenting us with an image of something that would have seemed impossible when

291
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:21.730
he began,
which is an image of modernism grown old,
uh,

292
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.810
old and,
and,
and blasted.
No,
uh,

293
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.010
in many senses.
Contrast this,

294
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:31.290
this career,
uh,

295
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.460
encapsulated in those images with this one.

296
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.390
Who's this?
This is,
uh,
the author of Prufrock and peck.

297
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:42.790
This is the Harvard student who wrote Prufrock.

298
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.980
I mean that Eliot wrote Prufrock largely when,
uh,

299
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.200
still at Harvard.
And then in the years immediately following

300
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.260
sexy,
a little,
uh,
maybe,
uh,

301
00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:59.600
those full,
slightly parted lips,
uh,

302
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.780
that wind swept hair.
The,
the general j crew look,
uh,

303
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.560
notice the handkerchief,

304
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.570
uh,
here is the editor.
If,
uh,
a great editor,

305
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:19.840
a of the publisher,
a faber and Faber,

306
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:26.500
30 years later or more,
uh,
surrounded by books,

307
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.950
the cultural arbiter of the English speaking world,

308
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.230
Tsla at 60,
uh,
that hair is now slicked down,

309
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.310
uh,
their glasses between him and us.
Uh,

310
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.230
this is the young man who's become a monument.
Uh,

311
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.710
but really the costume is the same one,
right?
There's the handkerchief

312
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.620
pounds,

313
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.620
descent into infamy and insanity and indignity and Elliot's rise to the

314
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:59.350
extraordinary cultural power,
uh,

315
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.860
and prestige that he occupied.

316
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:05.710
And that is represented by this and many other photos.
Well,

317
00:23:05.711 --> 00:23:09.730
these are key stories in modern poetry.
And there interestingly interlocking,

318
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:11.810
just as their two lives were

319
00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.510
another modern poet.
This is,
this is an old woman called Marianne Moore,

320
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:26.030
uh,
who became a kind of civic icon,

321
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.810
uh,
who became a celebrity even,
uh,

322
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.350
as an eccentric New Yorker who wore,

323
00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:38.030
try cornered hats and went to baseball games and the zoo,
uh,

324
00:23:38.031 --> 00:23:42.200
and,
uh,
uh,
here,
uh,
appears in,
uh,

325
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.000
well her hair braided and wrapped around her a fanciful,

326
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.040
virginal,
kindly safely out of fashion,
uh,

327
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.130
full of,
of a kind of civic virtue.

328
00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.530
The embodiment of a certain kind of popular idea of poetry and you can't read

329
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:04.910
it,
but there's a kind of stamp of approval here from the governor Nelson

330
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.020
Rockefeller.
Uh,

331
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.180
think of how far away this is from Ezra pound in Saint Elizabeth's hospital.

332
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.490
This is another image of modern poetry,
but,
uh,

333
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.480
more hair was not always done up.
Uh,

334
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.810
this is the image of a child also named Marianne Moore with delicious prodigious

335
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:31.270
locks.
Uh,
it,
uh,
revealed,
uh,

336
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.410
maybe a little bit of the,
uh,

337
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.000
power and extravagance and glory that you feel,
uh,
in her poems,

338
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:43.001
but that she preferred a always to restrain and bind in control,

339
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:48.830
uh,
in,
uh,
extraordinary ways and not always to hide.

340
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.410
Uh,
one of the enduring works,
uh,

341
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.430
written in 1922,
uh,

342
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.710
the amazing year that the wasteland and Ulysses appeared in the criterion

343
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.290
started as publication.
One of those amazing works,

344
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.010
uh,
is Marianne Moore's poem called poetry.

345
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.870
You've got to a sample of it on your handout more,

346
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:16.190
uh,

347
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:21.190
who revised or pumps just the same way she ended up binding her hair,

348
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.170
uh,
republish this poem.

349
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.850
Eventually in short form a very short,
uh,

350
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.590
were three pages.
We were reduced to two sentences.

351
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.220
The first two sentences,
you see,
I too dislike it.

352
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.620
There are things important beyond all this fiddle reading it.

353
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.320
However,
with a perfect contempt for it,

354
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.480
one discovers in it after all,
a place for the genuine,

355
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.790
some of what she cut out of the poem,
uh,

356
00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:59.750
Co cut out of its later version a is a list of what she had in mind as the

357
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:04.730
genuine,
as examples of it,
uh,
which is the first quotation there,
uh,

358
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.320
again on your handout,
the bat holding on upside down,
uh,
and so on,

359
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.760
uh,
uh,
flee the baseball fan,
the status Titian,

360
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.360
nor is it valid to discriminate against business documents in school books.

361
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.240
All of these phenomenon are important.

362
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.540
The drive to include the world,
uh,
more omnivorous poems,

363
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.950
claim for poetry,
all the subjects that she mentions here,

364
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:36.710
and indeed many,
many more.

365
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:42.580
All these are new modern subjects because they represent dimensions,

366
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.200
experience formerly excluded from the elevated idealized discourse that is

367
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:54.840
poetry,
dimensions of experience,
excluded as prosaic,

368
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.880
more,
uh,
is quoting here,
uh,
in that phrase,

369
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:04.800
business documents in school books as she,
uh,
tells us from Tolstoy,

370
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.740
a prose writer.
Uh,

371
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:12.330
but she goes further than Tolstoy in her commitment to the seeming lean on

372
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:16.030
poetic.
She will not only include Tolstoy's pro,

373
00:27:16.031 --> 00:27:21.031
she will not even discriminate against business documents and school books.

374
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:22.620
Uh,

375
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.620
more exemplifies in this way a key aspect of modern poetry.

376
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:32.270
It's radical heterogeneity.
Uh,

377
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:37.310
its will to mix many kinds of materials and discourses,

378
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.750
uh,
to make poetry reach out from the,
uh,

379
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.500
uh,
rarefied in limited domain of the poetic to,
uh,

380
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.150
keep including more and more of the world.

381
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.470
The next quotation on your handout,
this is another example of this.

382
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.040
Uh,
I won't sing for you,
uh,
or,
or,

383
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.500
or give you my Italian,
uh,
but these,
these famous lines,
uh,

384
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:12.060
London Bridge is falling down,
falling down,
falling down,

385
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.163
and so on.

386
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.430
These come from the conclusion to the wasteland.

387
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:21.960
They,
uh,
they thrust together different,
uh,

388
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.090
different texts,
different languages,
writing from different historical periods,

389
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:31.890
all their compressed in that remarkable,
uh,
mad song.

390
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:33.960
That concludes the poem.

391
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.170
In the next quotation,

392
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.950
Elliott tells us that a various in complex civilization such as ours produces,

393
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:49.710
he says,
various and complex results,
uh,
as if inevitably,

394
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:55.050
uh,
lest we think that there's anything particularly forced or outlandish or

395
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:59.040
willful,
uh,
about his own.
Uh,
uh,

396
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.450
a remarkable poetry,
uh,

397
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:04.800
in Lyons such as those I just quoted for you.

398
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.840
Elliot was there in that essay on the metaphysical poets and I'm quoting from a

399
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:17.100
defending as necessary.
Uh,
what is the primary characteristic,

400
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:22.101
not only of his own poetry but really a modern poetry generally what is often

401
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:28.140
called it's difficulty,
whatever else it may be.

402
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.020
Everyone's always agreed that modern poetry is difficult.

403
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.400
You will probably to,
uh,

404
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.950
by difficult it is meant I think,

405
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.100
well first of all that is in some sense set apart from common speech as a

406
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:48.850
specialized and highly self conscious use of language.

407
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.660
Elliot would go further and say that there is no common form of modern speech

408
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:58.570
and that's the problem.
According to Elliot,

409
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.730
the modern world lacks a center.

410
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.790
I kind of set of collective beliefs and commitments,
uh,

411
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.680
that would enable communication between us.

412
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.620
Modernity for Elliot,
as for more,

413
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:15.430
as for pound is marked by a profusion of languages,

414
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.410
both national languages such as French or Russian,
uh,

415
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:21.820
which turn up in the wasteland.

416
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:27.460
Also a bewildering array of specialized types of discourse,

417
00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:31.660
technicals,
genres,
varieties of speech,
business documents.

418
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.320
In school books just begin.
Uh,
this,

419
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.930
there's an extraordinary,
uh,
sense of,
uh,
uh,
verbal,

420
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.400
uh,
chaos,

421
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:47.370
a kind of word horde that modern poetry and modernism,
uh,
uh,

422
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.500
generally a kind of linguistic environment of great complexity from which,

423
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.820
uh,
modern poetry and modernism emerge.
A,
this is an image,

424
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.580
uh,
called Rotterdam,
uh,
by the,
uh,
artist,
uh,
Edward wants,

425
00:31:02.581 --> 00:31:05.980
where it's a woodcut image from blast.
Uh,

426
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.760
I like it because it's the kind of image of the modern city that makes the

427
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:12.370
modern city look like language and look like letters,

428
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:15.280
look like a kind of scout scattered alphabet,
uh,

429
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:18.400
kind of babble it rep.
It's a,

430
00:31:18.401 --> 00:31:22.750
it's a kind of picture for me of the linguistic environment,
if you will,

431
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.900
of modern poetry behind this environment are the great social processes of

432
00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:34.381
migration and modernization that produced that new urban form,

433
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.560
the metropolis,
all of the poets we read,

434
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.900
even that New England Hayseed Robert Frost,
uh,

435
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.070
begin their careers in metropolitan centers,

436
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.050
primarily in London and New York.
All that is solid,

437
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:54.020
melts into air.
Karl Marx said,
uh,

438
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:59.200
evoking the accelerating transformation of modern economic and social life.

439
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.540
The metropolis is the center of this unsettled world that Mark's describes

440
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.430
coming to the metropolis a hundred or 90,
uh,

441
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.170
years ago now,
uh,

442
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:16.230
entailed for the writers that will be reading as much as for anyone else kind of

443
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:20.710
break with a world that they had known a break either with a native language.

444
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.730
This is what the immigrant or the,
uh,
uh,

445
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:29.731
ex Patriot experiences or perhaps with native ways of speaking and knowing,

446
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:30.820
uh,

447
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:35.820
familiar spheres of reference life in the modern metropolis was d familiarizing,

448
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.510
uh,
it,
Dean naturalized language,
uh,

449
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.900
where there are many languages in use.
Well,
uh,

450
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:50.030
language comes to seem arbitrary rather than natural as the product of

451
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.300
convention,
not as something you were simply born into,

452
00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:55.580
but something that you learn,

453
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:59.540
something that is made and that can be remade.
Uh,

454
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:04.660
this is a presumption of all the poets we'll be reading modern American writers

455
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.920
and artists,
uh,
immigrated famously,
uh,
to London,

456
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.130
to Paris.
Uh,

457
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.970
another key event in the making of modernism is the great migration of African

458
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.230
Americans from the rural south to the urban north.
Uh,
Langston Hughes.

459
00:33:21.231 --> 00:33:23.760
His poetry comes out of this experience.
Uh,

460
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.830
in the community of black intellectuals and artists,

461
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.710
it created specifically in Harlem.

462
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:36.610
And you'll see on your handout two quotations from poems by Hughes.

463
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.230
Uh,
the first,
uh,
uh,
of one 25th street,
uh,
giving us,

464
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:43.790
uh,
well here,

465
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:48.850
images of black life in the rural south transposed to Harlem.

466
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.940
Uh,
there's,
uh,
in those images,

467
00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:57.530
I think a kind of Utopian promise that the familiar ordinary pleasures,

468
00:33:57.531 --> 00:34:01.940
a rural life can be recaptured in a new society of plenty,

469
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:07.400
but it's also something hallucinatory and troubling about those images and

470
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:12.140
vaguely disturbing,
uh,
that's brought out,
I think in the,
uh,

471
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.260
related,
uh,
famous poem Harlem on the,
uh,

472
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.680
next side of the page where,
well,
if we've had faces as,

473
00:34:20.681 --> 00:34:25.340
as food,
uh,
in,
in the first,
uh,
text,
uh,

474
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:30.080
something,
possibly reassuring,
uh,
uh,
those faces,

475
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:30.770
uh,

476
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.330
begin to look like dangerous objectification in the second one,

477
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.950
uh,
where,
uh,

478
00:34:36.951 --> 00:34:41.060
that raisin in the sun threatens to explode.

479
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.770
Metropolis is in modern poetry,
uh,

480
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.860
set against a backdrop of war and violence and conflict and,

481
00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:52.520
uh,

482
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:57.520
modern poetry as it absorbs the world of the metropolis absorbs that,

483
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:04.040
uh,
that,
uh,
violence and energy,
uh,
as well.

484
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.020
Uh,
the metropolis.
Well,
it is,
it's a,
it's a place of ambivalence,

485
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:13.490
a place of promise and a threat,
uh,
of exaltation.

486
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.320
And also of dread.

487
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:19.630
This ambivalence that I'm describing is,
is that the,

488
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.290
the center of modern literature generally the metropolis,

489
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:28.470
uh,
is crowded with language crowded with faces,
uh,

490
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:33.290
but there's also a pervasive sense of absence,
uh,

491
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.330
and of loneliness and of loss captured also Perry dogmatically in the wasteland.

492
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:45.030
Uh,
and I've included,
uh,
they're,
uh,
more lines from that poem,

493
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:48.660
the Nymphs or departed.
Elliot says,
uh,

494
00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.160
Elliot's speaking of a spiritual and imaginative state,

495
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:54.610
uh,

496
00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:59.610
modern poetry arise is in Elliot's case with the death of God,

497
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:05.310
uh,
with the loss of a theological justification for life with a sense of

498
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.380
disenchantment,
uh,
uh,
sense of depletion,

499
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.220
depletion of meaning and value the metropolis which uproots people takes them

500
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:20.640
away.
It takes them out of traditional cultures.

501
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:25.560
Also uproots traditional religious belief.
And practices,

502
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.840
Elliot's poetry,

503
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:32.370
the poetry he created out of this experience as a poetry of spiritual agony.

504
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.630
Modernity is in his work,
uh,

505
00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:41.631
a condition of social and psychological fragmentation,

506
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.810
which is both,
uh,
both a private personal dilemma in,

507
00:36:46.811 --> 00:36:50.040
in a public one as he understands it

508
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.780
compare to Elliot's city,
uh,

509
00:36:55.950 --> 00:37:00.720
Elliot sense of the city.
This one,
this is a photograph by Alfred Stieglitz,

510
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.270
uh,
city of ambition.
Uh,

511
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:09.590
this is the modern cities not as a scene of fragmentation or despair,

512
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:15.240
uh,
but rather a place of ascent and aspiration.

513
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.770
It's also a scene of crossings,

514
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.730
uh,
bridging past and future.

515
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.600
This is a photo by another American photographer,
Walker Evans,

516
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:35.070
a photo of Brooklyn Bridge.
You recognize it.
Uh,

517
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.280
uh,
and here is another,

518
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.330
another image,
uh,
by Evans of the bridge.

519
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:46.980
This one comes from a page of heart cranes,

520
00:37:46.981 --> 00:37:51.130
epic poem,
the bridge,
uh,
and,
and uh,
uh,

521
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.440
a book that you can go find it at.
Meineke remarkable,
uh,

522
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:59.490
addition of cranes poem,
uh,
where,
uh,

523
00:37:59.491 --> 00:38:01.890
Evans photos,
grand photos appear.

524
00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:06.630
It's almost miniature images surrounded by white space.
Uh,

525
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:10.050
as you get some sense in this image

526
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.700
in crane,
in his great poem,
the bridge.

527
00:38:14.701 --> 00:38:18.840
And here's another photo by Evans,
this time of crane,
uh,

528
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:22.950
on the rooftop of the apartment building in Brooklyn,
one 10,

529
00:38:22.951 --> 00:38:27.690
Columbia Heights where he lived and where he began the poem with the bridge in

530
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:30.720
the background,
uh,
in crane.

531
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.620
And the emphasis is not on what is lost and modernity,

532
00:38:34.621 --> 00:38:38.180
but what found or what might be,
here's a,
uh,

533
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.490
another quotation from,
uh,
your handout.

534
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.620
Number seven,
new thresholds,

535
00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:49.680
new anatomies wine talons build freedom up about me and distill this competence

536
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:58.360
to travel in a tear,
sparkling alone within another's will.

537
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:04.750
Modern poetry is difficult.
Uh,
and,
and these are difficult lines.

538
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.210
New thresholds,
new anatomies.
Well,
that's not such a hard concept.

539
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.190
That's an,
an image of what the modern promises for crane.
And indeed those,
uh,

540
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.840
Gothic arches of the bridge seem to emblem Matteis for him,

541
00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:25.570
uh,
yet crane's poetry and those lines I just read really are difficult,

542
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.600
uh,
just as a,
as Elliot and pound or difficult.
Uh,
uh,

543
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.500
but,
uh,
not because as in those poets,

544
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:40.440
uh,
crane presents us with obscure references,
war,
uh,

545
00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.780
uh,
languages unknown to us,
um,

546
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.680
or learned illusion instead.

547
00:39:47.681 --> 00:39:52.390
What's difficult in crane as a kind of compression,
uh,
in his writing,

548
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.560
uh,
they,
they show us a,

549
00:39:54.561 --> 00:39:59.561
a poet taking language apart and putting it back together in new ways.

550
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.400
New configurations,
new anatomies.

551
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.510
A crane is full of mixed metaphors.
You know,

552
00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:11.950
you're not supposed to mix your metaphors well.
Uh,
he does all the time.

553
00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.870
Wine talents.
There's one wine towns.
What are they?
Well,

554
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.810
uh,
think about it.
Uh,

555
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.840
perhaps you too have felt wine talents grip you unexpectedly sometime and carry

556
00:40:26.651 --> 00:40:31.000
you a loft.
The Metaphor suggests ecstasy,

557
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:36.810
the exaltation of Modern Life.
That aspiration in,
uh,

558
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.760
imaged in Stieglitz to,
uh,

559
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.120
it suggests that ecstasy is like wine in wine is like an eagle.

560
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.290
Clasping you,
its prey in its claws.

561
00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:52.200
And keep in mind when crane wrote those lines too,

562
00:40:52.201 --> 00:40:56.770
it was illegal to buy and sell wine in this country.
Uh,

563
00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:00.010
modernity in,
in cranes,
strange,

564
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:05.040
gorgeous poetry is all about getting high about elevation exaltation.

565
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:14.920
Crane was an alcoholic.
And if you study this photo,

566
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:19.720
uh,
you can,
you can see the,
the,
uh,
uh,
qualities,

567
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.330
uh,
uh,
uh,
of a man,
um,

568
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.040
uh,
struggling with alcoholism,
uh,
this,

569
00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:32.190
this friendly and even dignified face,
uh,

570
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:37.250
have prematurely white hair.
Uh,
his cheeks are veins,

571
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.360
uh,
being drunk became for crane,

572
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:46.370
a kind of grim literalization of the freedom that came with being modern.

573
00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.690
Uh,
and that vision of,
of,
uh,
freedom,
uh,

574
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.570
is something that has poetry preserves for us and,
and,

575
00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.310
and carries forward for us.
And,
uh,

576
00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:02.470
continues to give us as a gift contrast his images of joyous or demonic ascent

577
00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:10.460
with the images of catastrophe,
of dissent,
uh,
of,

578
00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:14.570
of collapse in Elliot London.
Bridge is falling down.

579
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.050
The decay of,
of Christian belief and practice,
uh,
is not,
uh,

580
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:25.910
a loss,
but rather an opportunity for poetry in crane.
Uh,

581
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:29.310
he says,
uh,
in the bridge,
uh,
uh,
he,

582
00:42:29.311 --> 00:42:32.610
he asks the Bridge to lend the myth to God.
Uh,

583
00:42:32.611 --> 00:42:36.950
any suggests that this is something that every age must do a because our names

584
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:41.030
for God are always metaphors,
poems,

585
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.950
something imagined.
Uh,
acts of speech poet,
uh,

586
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.690
crane shares these general ideas with Wallace Stevens,

587
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.530
this as well.
Uh,
Steven's,
uh,

588
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.060
while Stevens who said poetry is a means of redemption and meant it,

589
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.260
uh,
Steven's,
uh,
began life,
uh,

590
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.860
well as a choir boy,
uh,
and as a Christian.

591
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.720
But his work is all about replacing Christian theology with poetry for Stevens

592
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.020
when at he takes away God.

593
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.460
What it does is unveil the poets,
godlike powers,

594
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:26.640
a power to create the world through imagination,
uh,

595
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.790
imagination which created God in the first place in Steven's.

596
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:36.110
Modernity's shows us that the truth of religion was always a fiction,

597
00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.870
a fundamentally poetic construction.
Stevens,

598
00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.810
his world is secular and non transcendental,
uh,

599
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.190
and he is fully at home in it.
So much so that,
uh,

600
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.420
he lives the life of a,
uh,

601
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.270
where's Ua businessmen as,
uh,

602
00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.650
an executive of the Hartford accident and indemnity,

603
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.510
uh,
company,
uh,

604
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:08.350
a great Connecticut Burger and poet,
uh,

605
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.480
Steven's celebrates the bourgeois world over and over again in a poetry that is

606
00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:16.460
about in itself enacts,
uh,

607
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.520
our perpetual recreation of reality through the mind and its special medium

608
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:24.740
language.
Uh,
Stephens,

609
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:29.300
he understands tragedy.
Uh,
but he is a comic poet,

610
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.410
a humanist who is concerned to preserve and exalt the human,

611
00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:40.410
uh,
the relativity of truth,
the profusion of languages,
these things that,

612
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:42.810
uh,
afflict Elliot,
uh,

613
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.750
are a source of faith for Steven's

614
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.820
modern poetry seeks absolutes.

615
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.390
What Moore calls the genuine,

616
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.150
what crane calls the myth of America.
Uh,

617
00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:03.270
the voice of the thunder in Elliot a Stevens is supreme fiction,

618
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.790
uh,
uh,
pounds.
Cantos a poem that would,

619
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:10.860
as he intended include history.

620
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.190
Modern poetry is in all these ways.
Promethian astounding,
a arrogant,

621
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.030
uh,
enormous,
uh,
imprudent visionary.

622
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.180
But it also contains other positions,
uh,
alternatives that,

623
00:45:27.181 --> 00:45:31.980
that open those oversized cultural ambitions to critique,

624
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:37.020
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,
imaginative,
uh,

625
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.160
alternatives of many kinds.
And these are suggested,
uh,

626
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:45.870
I'll suggest briefly,
uh,
by the last two poets,
we'll read,

627
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.790
uh,
wh Auden,
uh,

628
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.560
to begin with here pictured as an Oxford undergraduate,

629
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:57.450
ever cheeky,
uh,
who has written on the side of his photo,

630
00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.850
the cerebral life would pay
dry,

631
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.170
cool,
pragmatic and Elizabeth Bishop,

632
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.780
uh,
young in this glamorous George Platt Lynes photo.

633
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.900
While modern poetry in many of its forms strives to master reality.

634
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:24.230
Arden reminds us there and your handout cautiously that poetry makes nothing

635
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:28.710
happen while Steven's represents the poet as a kind of God.

636
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:34.380
Bishop sees the poet rather as a sand piper.
Uh,

637
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.800
that little bird,
a skittering along the shore,

638
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.800
not in control of the world,
but subject to it,

639
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:45.720
subject to its continual fluctuation and awesome powers.

640
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.130
A Bishop Piper poet there I knew in your handout is,

641
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.000
is obsessed with the mere details of experience.

642
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.930
Those sand grains,
quartz grains.
Uh,

643
00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:02.960
her aim is to get along in a world that is dominated by shifting forces that can

644
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:08.010
be registered in,
reacted to by poetry,
but not explained.

645
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:09.990
Uh,
this is,

646
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:15.050
I think really also aversion of poetic activity that has some sources in and has

647
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:20.990
a lot in common with Robert Frost's,
uh,

648
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:25.380
as we will see on Monday.
Thank you.
