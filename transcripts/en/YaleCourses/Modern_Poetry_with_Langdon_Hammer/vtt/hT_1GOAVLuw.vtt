00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.310
Langston hughes is our subject today.

2
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.670
Let,
let's start with a poem.
You probably know a,
it's on page six,
87.

3
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.680
It's really the poem,

4
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.393
<v 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.390
<v 0>for which he uses perhaps most known and was first known.
Uh,
he,</v>

6
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.930
uh,
composed at when he was 18 years old.
Uh,
it,
uh,

7
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.420
is the Negro speaks of rivers.
Uh,

8
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.760
you can see that it's dedicated to w e B Dubois.
Dubois was the,

9
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:58.650
uh,
uh,
important,
uh,
uh,
leader and,

10
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:03.360
uh,
uh,
speaker who was the editor of the magazine,

11
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:08.280
the crisis,
uh,
which published this poem,
uh,

12
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.800
and,
and the crisis,
uh,

13
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
had a circulation of 100,000 readers,

14
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.040
a at least,
if not more,
uh,
and uh,
uh,

15
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:24.600
isn't that way,
you know,
quite a debut to have.
And it,

16
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:29.601
it put Hughes immediately in a political magazine in a race magazine.

17
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.580
Uh,
and in some ways in a,
in a popular magazine,

18
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.880
not a one of the little magazines of modernism.

19
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.720
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.250
<v 0>I've known rivers.</v>

21
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.870
I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in

22
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:50.240
human veins.

23
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.700
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

24
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.770
I bathed the knee,
the Euphrates,
when dawns were young,

25
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.040
I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.

26
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.870
I looked upon the Nile and raise the pyramids above it.

27
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.760
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New

28
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.170
Orleans,
and I've seen it's money.
Bosom turned all golden in the sunset.

29
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.990
I've known rivers,

30
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.710
ancient Dusky rivers.

31
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.600
My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

32
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.260
He's a speaker,
is a,
uh,
particular ISED voice.

33
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.440
And I,
uh,

34
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:50.660
at the same time that he is a general one,
uh,

35
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.590
the Negro,

36
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.980
the Negro speaks as well,

37
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.590
well speaks of and for,
uh,
people,
uh,

38
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.050
as a representative figure,
uh,

39
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.590
like Hart Crane,
a Hughes returns to Walt Whitman,

40
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.680
uh,
Walt Whitman,
uh,
in his,
uh,

41
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:19.170
ambition to speak of and for America,
uh,

42
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.810
at the same time,
uh,

43
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040
unlike crane Hughes takes on Whitman's versification,

44
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.450
uh,
he,
uh,
Whitman's ways of making a line.
Uh,

45
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:35.830
his free verse is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

46
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.860
paratactic style in which things are listed as opposed to cranes,

47
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.770
crumpled and condensed quite trains stands as

48
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.740
a here.
The,
uh,
the relation,
uh,

49
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.330
between the particular and the general,

50
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:57.280
between the individual and a type a is one of the pumps subjects.

51
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.310
Uh,
it is a poem about knowledge,

52
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.190
about identity and about history to

53
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.760
what the eye nose is.
Rivers.

54
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.370
Uh,
we learned just a few things about those rivers.

55
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:19.030
They are ancient as the world.
They are primordial,

56
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.250
they are even,

57
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.280
it seems prior to the human in the sense prior to human blood,

58
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.010
which conventionally is a way of representing race,
of speaking about race.

59
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.280
So the rivers are older,
it seems than any race.
Uh,

60
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:44.260
and yet,
uh,
they're also,
uh,
an image of,
um,
of,
um,

61
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.330
of racial blood,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
flowing,
uh,

62
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.270
Hughes's is

63
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.620
he's writing about a universal from a particular point of view.

64
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.560
Uh,
the flowing of rivers is like the flowing of blood in the poem.

65
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.480
And to know them is to know what is under or inside particular racial experience

66
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:13.570
at the deepest level.
Uh,

67
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.970
in this sense we might paraphrase that that title,
um,
uh,

68
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.760
the Negro speaks of human life and history,
uh,

69
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.190
as the Negro has known it.
Uh,

70
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.450
it's a poem concerned with human life,
uh,
in history,

71
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.660
the very most general terms of experience from the particular perspective of the

72
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.250
Black Speaker.
Uh,
and from the perspective of black experience

73
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.180
as the poem goes on,
uh,

74
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:47.350
the rivers are named and the in localized,
in,
in history,

75
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.800
the Euphrates origin of civilization and the side of the Jewish captivity in

76
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:58.190
Babylon,
the Congo evoking Africa and its people,

77
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.020
the Nile side of the Pyramids,
those,
the arc type Typo,

78
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:07.130
human monuments,
a fixed in place and,
and,
and pointed to the sky.

79
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.970
And in that sense,
uh,
counter post to the flowing river,

80
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.980
uh,
being the Negro here means knowing all of these places.

81
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.480
Uh,

82
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:23.481
the palm begins interestingly in the perfect present tense,

83
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.750
uh,
I've known,

84
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.800
I've known my soul has grown.

85
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.870
Uh,
this is an interesting tense that evokes simultaneously,
uh,

86
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.890
the past and the present suggests a co past carried over and into the present.

87
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.380
Then in that third stanza of the poem shifts into the simple past.

88
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.330
I bathed,
I built,
I looked,

89
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.190
I heard,
uh,
the Mississippi,

90
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.880
the line about the Mississippi continues this pattern,

91
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.280
but then in the middle of the line breaks out of it.

92
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.710
I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New
Orleans,

93
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.360
and I've seen it's muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.

94
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.980
Uh,
there,
there's a way in which the story of,

95
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:23.690
of Lincoln and the freeing of the slaves that he was,
gets to at that point,
uh,

96
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:28.550
it seems to,
uh,
well break out of the particular and,
and then,

97
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.530
uh,
reach into this,
uh,
perfect,
uh,
present tense,

98
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.950
uh,
to,
uh,
evoke some kind of ongoing,
um,

99
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.260
experience moving from the past to the present again.

100
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.350
And then,
uh,
the poem,
uh,

101
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.000
goes back into,
uh,
that,
um,
that perfect,
uh,

102
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.590
presence.
Uh,

103
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.690
there's a sense of a past action that is ongoing and active,

104
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.860
uh,
present,
uh,
in the poem.
Uh,
the rivers,

105
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.700
they are deep,
dark dusky.
Uh,

106
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.410
they also at this pivotal moment in the poem turn Golden,

107
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.590
uh,
the poem projects,

108
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:20.591
a view of black history in which to be black means simultaneously to be the

109
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:25.670
product of black experience across history at particular moments,

110
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.410
uh,
uh,
uh,
particular moments,
particular times,

111
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.450
and also involved in the deepest,
uh,

112
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.280
trans historical meanings of the human.
Uh,

113
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:41.870
the journey that the poem,
uh,

114
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.790
describes links different times and places,
uh,

115
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.850
and ultimately,
uh,
white and black.
When Lincoln,
uh,

116
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.680
America's white present president goes down to New Orleans,

117
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.490
uh,
and resolves to end slavery.
Uh,

118
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.850
this was a remarkable poem,
uh,
by,
uh,

119
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.870
uh,
a young man to two,
right.
Uh,
it's,
uh,

120
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.540
uh,
not,
not living here.
Let me hold off this,
that interesting photo for a second.

121
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.530
Uh,
this is a,
um,
a picture of Hughes,

122
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.390
uh,
at,
uh,
still,
uh,
in the,
uh,

123
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.450
mid twenties when his work was just being read for the first time.

124
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.870
Uh,
it's a remarkable poem,

125
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.900
I think for a young poet to begin with.
Uh,

126
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.990
you could compare it to other,
uh,
early,
uh,
um,

127
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.080
sort of inaugurating or initiating poems that we've talked about such as cranes,

128
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:47.520
legend,
uh,
or the love song of J.
Dot.
Alfred Prufrock,
uh,

129
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.690
uh,
and other,
other sort of entries into poetry.

130
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.420
Uh,

131
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.420
we could compare its vision of the past two to that which we find in perhaps

132
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.100
pound or,
or Elliott,

133
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:09.230
which leads me to this general question of how do we place Langston Hughes a in

134
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:15.490
this course,
uh,
in more generally,
uh,
how do we,
uh,

135
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.400
uh,
position the black language and experience in his work,

136
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.820
uh,
in the general context of modern poetry?

137
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.990
Where else,
where else in this course does the Negro speak?

138
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.560
Uh,
uh,

139
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:37.080
have you seen black people or heard black voices,
uh,

140
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:40.000
in other poems?
Um,

141
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.260
blackness figures,
uh,
in frost,
interestingly,

142
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.310
a as a kind of charged symbolic color,
but,
uh,

143
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.390
in a very generalized way that isn't linked immediately to race.

144
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.620
Although it certainly could be seen to in certain contexts.

145
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.880
You could say the same thing.
I think about Steven's a,

146
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.050
although you do in Steven's encounter certain black figures,

147
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:12.030
including the word nigger in one poem,
uh,
there's,
uh,

148
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.820
there's no question though that,
uh,
in,
in Steven's a in frost,
uh,

149
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.530
the poetry,
uh,
doesn't aspire to,
uh,

150
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.270
doesn't pretend to,
uh,

151
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.890
represent the experience of African Americans.
Uh,

152
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:33.240
Marianne Moore,
whom we'll read,
uh,
soon.

153
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.430
Uh,
it has a poem called black earth.
Uh,
when Ezra Pound Reddit,

154
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.420
uh,
he wrote to her and asked since he didn't know he had never met her,

155
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.600
was she Ethiopian?
Uh,

156
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.760
this is a truly a crazy,
uh,
question.
Uh,

157
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.640
but an interesting one,
uh,
in this poem,
uh,
more,
uh,
speaks,
uh,

158
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.280
about an elephant.
And,
uh,
and,
and from the point of view,

159
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:02.281
if an elephant in ways that might seem to possibly speak for black people,

160
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.940
but only on the level of fable or allegory,

161
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.280
a crane comes closer.
Uh,
if you turn back a few pages,
uh,

162
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.250
to in your anthology to the crane section,
the first poem,
uh,
in,

163
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.600
uh,
that selection,
it's called black tambourine.
Uh,

164
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:25.540
that's on six oh seven.
Uh,

165
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.830
that poem describes,
uh,
again,

166
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:32.230
a kind of symbolic,

167
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.290
a generalized type of the black man as a figure trapped and what crane called a

168
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.240
mid kingdom,
uh,
in the popular imagination,

169
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:45.350
the mid kingdom between man and beast,
uh,
uh,

170
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.480
crane sees the,
the,
the black entertainer,
uh,
as a,

171
00:12:50.481 --> 00:12:55.240
as a kind of figure of the artist.
Something like his traps is wanderers.

172
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.890
Uh,
Charlie Chaplin,

173
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:02.250
a crane had initially intended to include,
uh,
uh,
in,

174
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.290
in the bridge a section that was to be a dramatic monologue spoken by a Negro

175
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.270
Porter,
uh,
on a train,
uh,
that,
uh,
plan fell away.

176
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.750
Uh,
but there are,
uh,
still,
um,
uh,

177
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.740
traces of that intention in his section of the poem called the river,

178
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:27.520
uh,
which,
uh,
uh,
tries to evoke aspects of,

179
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:30.050
of,
uh,
black experience,
uh,

180
00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:35.051
to integrate jazz blues spirituals into a crane's poetry.

181
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.150
Um,
and,

182
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:42.180
and make them part of the history that the bridge tills a crane,

183
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:44.800
uh,

184
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.800
might have had as one model for the inclusion of a African American expressive

185
00:13:50.111 --> 00:13:53.380
forms.
Surprisingly,
perhaps Elliott,
uh,

186
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:57.040
when oh ho that a Shakespearian rag,

187
00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:01.680
when that breaks into the wasteland,
uh,
jazz,
uh,
and,
uh,

188
00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:06.681
a distinctively African American form also enters a Elliot's poem.

189
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.360
Uh,
Elliot was writing,
however,
from,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

190
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.940
point of view of white Europe,
uh,

191
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:20.941
and blacks tend not to figure in his poetry a except perhaps as figures of

192
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:26.740
otherness.
Uh,
those,
uh,
perhaps hooded hordes that swarm,

193
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.060
uh,
across the plains in the wasteland,
uh,

194
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.830
by Nikki includes in its answer a pound papers.
Uh,

195
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:39.550
an interesting selection of poems published with,
um,

196
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:44.710
Elliot's Juvenalian not so long ago.
Um,
uh,
selection of,
of,

197
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:45.544
uh,
uh,

198
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.550
poems that circulated between pounds and Elliot and certain other friends,

199
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.260
which are a obscene racist,
uh,
limericks,
uh,

200
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.660
that Eliot wrote a about King Bolo and his big black bastard queen.

201
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.640
Uh,
this is too,

202
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:06.260
is part of Elliot's Irv though not part of the public form of it.
Uh,

203
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.860
and it's,
uh,
important,
uh,
uh,
information,
uh,

204
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.510
about at least one way right in which,
um,

205
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.130
black life figured in the high modernist,
uh,
um,

206
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.060
uh,
imagination of Elliot and others.

207
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.400
Um,
here's that photo.
I,
uh,

208
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:32.950
started to show him a moment ago,
I suppose.
Uh,
he uses the only,
um,

209
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.800
modernist poet who begins as a bus boy.
Uh,
this is,
uh,

210
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.630
this is a photo from 1925,
uh,

211
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.490
taking it the Wardman Park Hotel,
uh,
for,
um,
newspaper,

212
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:53.190
uh,
uh,
story about Hughes.
A Hughes had been,

213
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:57.540
it seems discovered by the poet Vachel Lindsay at lunch,

214
00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.930
uh,
when,
uh,
Hughes there.
So the anecdote goes,

215
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.340
presented his poems to Lindsay and Lindsay,
uh,
taken with them,

216
00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:09.510
went on to read them that a night at a reading Lindsay was giving.

217
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.870
Uh,
of course,
uh,
uh,

218
00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:16.500
this was all carefully orchestrated by Hughes if he's a bus boy.

219
00:16:16.501 --> 00:16:20.790
He has also a poet and once,
and he's really in a sense almost in costume there,

220
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.080
uh,
imposing for the newspaper photos.
But it's a,

221
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.610
it's an interesting and,
uh,
important,
uh,
uh,

222
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.970
image of the,
uh,
uh,
man Hughes was a,

223
00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:36.840
as he began to write poems like the Negro speaks of rivers.

224
00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.830
Uh,
if white poetry,
uh,

225
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.960
turns away from African American people in their experience in modernism,

226
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.820
a Hughes also himself,
uh,
intended to,
uh,

227
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.110
turn away from white poetry,
uh,

228
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.670
the Negro artist and the racial mountain.
That prose piece,

229
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:03.620
I've asked you to read a,

230
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:07.540
at the end of your anthology on nine 64.
Uh,

231
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:12.440
it makes this argument very forcefully.
Uh,

232
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:16.280
it begins by,
um,
uh,

233
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.680
huge contracting,
uh,
his own intention,
uh,
as an artist,

234
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.780
uh,
with that of,
uh,

235
00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:28.110
one of the most promising of the young Negro poets who,
um,

236
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.380
as a Hughes interprets his ambition,
uh,
uh,

237
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.390
wants to be like a white poet.
Uh,

238
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.320
and in that sense,

239
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.000
we'd like to be quite a Hughes is a writing here,
uh,

240
00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:48.360
about Countee Cullen,
uh,
a,
uh,

241
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.403
uh,

242
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.420
rival artists whose work you can sample on page seven,

243
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:58.320
27,
uh,
and,
uh,
following in your anthology,

244
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.193
um,

245
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.860
Hughes wants to get out of the curious condition,

246
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:09.150
uh,
of wanting to,
uh,
write white,
so to speak,

247
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.180
uh,
by redefining what it would mean to sing,

248
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.390
uh,
in,
in poetry on nine 65.
He,
he,
uh,

249
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.500
uh,
juxtaposes two

250
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.330
to black audiences.

251
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:36.470
One a what he calls a self styled high class Negroes,

252
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.740
uh,
that represent a bourgeois,
um,
uh,

253
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.300
norms or the aspiration to them,
uh,

254
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:49.890
and that seek,
uh,
what he was called Nordic culture.

255
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.250
Uh,
and he contrast them rather to,
uh,
another,
uh,

256
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:00.540
expression of,
of black life with which he identifies himself.

257
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.390
Uh,
these are the low down folks,

258
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:07.260
the so called common element and they are the majority.
He writes,

259
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:12.290
may the Lord be praised the people who have their nip of gin on Saturday nights

260
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.541
and they're not too important to themselves or the community or to welfare or to

261
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.440
learned to watch the lazy world go round.

262
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.340
They live on seventh street and Washington or State Street in Chicago,

263
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:29.700
and they do not particularly care whether they're like white folks or anybody

264
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:33.240
else.
There joy runs bang into ecstasy,

265
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.460
their religions source to a shout work maybe a little today,

266
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:42.990
rest a little tomorrow,
play awhile thinking while,
oh,
let's dance.

267
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.090
These common people are not afraid of spirituals as for a long time.

268
00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:52.350
They're more intellectual.
Brethren were were,
and jazz is their child.

269
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.310
Uh,
and he continues,
uh,

270
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.400
he juxtaposes ecstasy shouting jazz,

271
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.490
uh,
against what he calls here.

272
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.450
American standardizations,
uh,
uh,
they,

273
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.460
they furnish a wealth of colorful,

274
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:15.990
distinctive material for any artists because they still hold their
individuality,

275
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.740
their individuality in the face of American standard and standardizations.

276
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.370
And perhaps these common people will give to the world.

277
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.560
It's truly great Negro artists,

278
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:33.561
the one who was not afraid to be himself in which I Langston Hughes aspire to

279
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:35.670
be.
Um,

280
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.330
these are important statements.
Uh,
they a show,
um,
uh,

281
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.650
Hughes's ambitions.

282
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:48.250
They show him positioning himself in relation to another African American
writer,

283
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.260
uh,
other,
uh,
African American,
um,
uh,
audiences,

284
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.090
uh,
for,
for culture,
uh,
in making the move,

285
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.130
uh,
that he is doing here.
Uh,
move it.
That's really deeply,
uh,

286
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:06.790
uh,
influential in American literature and poetry,

287
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:12.240
which as a whole descends from Hughes rather than from county colon.

288
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.890
Uh,
he uses still,
however,
doing something similar after all,

289
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.870
uh,
to the other modern poets.

290
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:24.490
We've been reading in this course and I want to suggest some of the continuity's

291
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:28.600
between Hughes.
Uh,
and,
uh,
these other writers,

292
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.690
uh,
like Yates,
uh,
for example,

293
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:40.020
Hughes wanted to be a representative figure to speak for,

294
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:44.640
uh,
people.
Uh,
and we speak of,
um,
uh,

295
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.600
the Irish renaissance just as we speak of the Harlem Renaissance,
uh,
of which,

296
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.870
um,
Hughes was a central figure,

297
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.620
like Williams,
uh,
like more like crane and like frost.
Uh,
also,

298
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.210
uh,
he was,
was very conscious of being an American poet,

299
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.430
um,
uh,

300
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.690
issuing a European examples,
uh,

301
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.700
for the most part,
uh,

302
00:22:12.701 --> 00:22:17.701
and seeking to bring into poetry lives in language that had not been seen

303
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.090
previously as poetic material.

304
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.500
Uh,
at the same time,
uh,
like pound.

305
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:31.501
And like Elliot Hughes was interested in a long historical view,

306
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:34.931
uh,

307
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:39.931
and he makes links between people of different times and places in a,

308
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.050
what was a global vision for Hughes of history.

309
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.200
Uh,
like crane,
uh,
he was published his first book,
uh,

310
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.240
in 1926,
the weary blues,
uh,
like crane,

311
00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.000
uh,
Hughes's,
uh,
you,
you could call him a second generation modernist.
He's,

312
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.990
um,
uh,
you know,

313
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.610
consciously coming after a figures like,
uh,

314
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.290
Elliot and pound,
uh,
uh,
Yates and frost for that manner.

315
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.100
Uh,
this book to,
uh,

316
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.010
is published by Canape.

317
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.020
Alfred cannot a publisher of Wallace Stevens,
his first book harmonium,

318
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.500
uh,
so crane,
I'm,
excuse me.

319
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:31.501
So he uses in that way very much part of the same New York poetry world in which

320
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.220
well,
uh,
uh,
um,
Stephens and,
um,

321
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.190
crane,
uh,
and others are appearing

322
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.160
like frost.

323
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:47.390
A Hughes wanted to get a vernacular speech into poetry,

324
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.700
uh,
in like frost.
Um,
Hughes for the most part,

325
00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:56.510
did not write for little magazines,
but rather popular ones.

326
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.240
As I was suggesting,
a,
in fact,

327
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:03.650
both frost and Hughes went on to make a living in poetry and they have a kind of

328
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.530
national fame,
uh,
a general readership,
uh,

329
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:11.210
that really none of our other poets did.

330
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.450
Uh,
like pound,
uh,
like Yates in the teens.

331
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.540
Uh,
Hughes is,
uh,
uh,

332
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:25.130
is interested in what he calls a naked style,
uh,
uh,
kind of,

333
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.440
uh,
aesthetic aesthetic.
Uh,

334
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.500
like the other poets.
Um,
we've been reading,

335
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:38.690
he uses the city poet,
he's a metropolitan poet.

336
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.480
Uh,
any styles himself as we've just seen against,
uh,

337
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:48.530
middleclass tastes in norms and expectations and importantly,

338
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.790
like the other modern,
it's,
uh,

339
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.960
he finds no consolation in traditional religion.

340
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.630
Uh,
even well.
He sometimes works with spirituals,

341
00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.580
uh,
and,

342
00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:08.580
and often invokes a Christian motifs in his poetry,

343
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.370
uh,
in all these ways he uses is I think,

344
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:15.350
helpful to read at this point in the semester,

345
00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:19.700
partly because a hits affinities with the other moderns once you start to

346
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:23.900
recognize them,
uh,
help us to see a kind of whole picture.

347
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.350
But then,
uh,
just having said that,
uh,
we have to,
uh,

348
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.980
we have to start talking about Hughes's difference.
Uh,

349
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.850
if he is an American poet,
uh,

350
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.290
he is just as importantly an African American poet.

351
00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.430
Uh,
if he is,
uh,

352
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.030
an internationalist like pound and Elliot,

353
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.050
uh,

354
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:56.030
he's interested in the international struggle of the worker and the oppressed

355
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.210
racist.
Uh,
he's,
this is a,

356
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.930
this is Hughes writing about a journey to Cuba that he made.

357
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.400
Uh,
he,
uh,
traveled,
uh,
particularly in the 30s.

358
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.870
Frequently as a,

359
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:16.790
as a kind of a representative of black Americans,
uh,

360
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.260
sponsored by,
um,
left groups,
uh,

361
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.730
and traveled to,
uh,
uh,
well Soviet Russia,
uh,

362
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:27.860
among other places.

363
00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:34.220
If Hughes's style is,
is stripped down and naked,

364
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.040
uh,
it is,
uh,

365
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:42.100
used to describe a people who have been stripped of dignity and identity.

366
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.590
If he's a city pot,
uh,
he is not a poet of the village,
uh,

367
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:54.570
or of London.
Uh,
but rather of Harlem,
uh,

368
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.070
and,
uh,
if,

369
00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.100
if God has withdrawn from the world of fuses poems,

370
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.860
uh,
God has,
has a,
uh,

371
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.310
has left people not to Ellie odic,
uh,

372
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.170
despair and a epistemological anxiety,

373
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.100
uh,
but rather to rape and murder.

374
00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.710
Uh,
you might remember the,
the last presidential election.

375
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:28.560
Do you remember that?
Uh,
uh,
John Kerry,
uh,
always in search of a theme,

376
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.370
which he never quite found,
uh,
seized for a little while on,
uh,

377
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.640
the phrase let America be America again.
Sounds good.

378
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.720
Uh,
it's the title of a poem by Langston Hughes,
which,
uh,
carry,
uh,

379
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.230
also made note of,
um,
uh,

380
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:50.580
when he referred to that,
uh,

381
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.800
um,
when he,
when he quoted Hughes,
um,
which,
uh,

382
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.130
was resonant,
uh,
which,
uh,
uh,

383
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.700
sounded a good and all sorts of ways,
uh,

384
00:28:02.701 --> 00:28:07.400
and which had the added advantage of,
uh,
letting carry,
uh,
a quote,

385
00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:11.550
a black writer.
Uh,
but then,
uh,
as you,
if you remember,

386
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:15.860
this will also remember,
uh,
pundits,
uh,

387
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.430
quickly pointed out that,
uh,
this was,
uh,
not,
uh,
a poem,

388
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.850
a nostalgic for a golden era of democracy,
uh,

389
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.680
but rather a protest poem,
uh,
about the inequities of American history.

390
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.790
And it was written by a leftist who,
uh,
um,
uh,

391
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.680
had ties to the communist party.
Uh,
whoops.

392
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.820
Uh,
this is,
uh,
this is Langston Hughes,

393
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:47.820
that's a Russian script on the left.
And he was,
he was in the middle,
uh,

394
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:51.510
surrounded by a variety of comrades,
uh,
in,

395
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:56.280
in Russia in the 30s.
And,
and,
uh,
uh,
last,
uh,

396
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:00.330
this was not a what John Kerry wanted to project a,

397
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:04.500
or here is Hughes with two,
uh,
Soviet soldiers.

398
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.530
Uh,
also from the 30s,

399
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:13.350
he was as much photographed,
uh,
in many different roles and,
uh,

400
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.280
public,
uh,
scenes.
Uh,

401
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.140
and there's a vast archive of his papers at,

402
00:29:19.141 --> 00:29:23.580
by Niki from which these images come.
Uh,

403
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.800
although,
uh,
he uses,
uh,
uh,
reputation is,

404
00:29:27.801 --> 00:29:32.550
is a little bit like frosts,
uh,
in,
in having this,
this general readership.

405
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:34.060
You know,
he's,
he's a,
he's a poet.
You,

406
00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:37.310
you probably read even in elementary school,
uh,

407
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.860
he poses all sorts of political problems that frost does not,

408
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.920
uh,
well,
uh,
here is,
he was with somebody else,
uh,

409
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.870
someone more acceptable to be photographed with a WC handy.
Uh,

410
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.150
in some ways the father of the blues as he's,
uh,
uh,
called,
uh,

411
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.130
and,
uh,
a,
a close friend of,
of Hughes's.

412
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:08.080
Uh,
let me talk about Hughes and the blues.

413
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.470
Here's an image of a illustration of Hughes's poem to blue by the African

414
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:18.160
American artists,
Jacob Lawrence,

415
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.183
uh,

416
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.500
Hughes from the weary blues forward.
Um,

417
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.050
frequently,
um,

418
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:34.910
presents his poems as a forms of music,
uh,

419
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.470
as allied to,
um,
as,
uh,

420
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:42.870
identified with as perhaps metaphorical versions of,
uh,

421
00:30:42.871 --> 00:30:47.350
African American forms particularly.
But not only the blues,

422
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.340
uh,
later in his career,
his readings,

423
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:55.790
but sometimes be accompanied by music,
uh,

424
00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:00.500
in his best blues homes.
A Hughes is,
um,

425
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.740
here's this not,
um,

426
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.320
it's not trying to write words for music,
I don't think,

427
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.240
but rather,
uh,
is trying to write poems,
uh,

428
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:18.820
uh,
that,
uh,
allude to,
uh,
and,
and,

429
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.050
um,
uh,

430
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.670
let us here in in metaphorical ways the musical traditions,

431
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.630
uh,

432
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.630
which they are drawn on and the culture and experience from which they come.

433
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.710
A Hughes,
uh,

434
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.470
at his most powerful uses musical forms,

435
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:43.510
popular musical forms for effects of compression,

436
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:44.800
uh,

437
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.800
and to develop really complex ironies often through repetition,

438
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.620
uh,
uh,

439
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.280
usually built out of the three part structures of the blues.

440
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.730
Let's look,
uh,
at

441
00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:09.820
the palm song for dark girl on six 91.

442
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:13.543
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

443
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.533
<v 0>it is</v>

444
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.320
like many of Hughes,
his poems.
Uh,

445
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:28.220
it's a simple poem in it structure,
uh,
and yet,
uh,

446
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.560
that simplicity,
uh,

447
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.240
conveys a real verbal,
uh,
complexity.
Uh,

448
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:42.350
and the poem in its popular mode nevertheless invites a kind of close reading,

449
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.020
uh,
that we give to,
uh,
uh,

450
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.880
that's demanded by a modernist poetry that presents itself as,

451
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.530
um,
uh,
compressed images,

452
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:02.330
stick difficult,
uh,
and so on.
Uh,
well let's,
uh,

453
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.970
let's look at it
way down south in Dixie.

454
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.790
Break the heart of me.

455
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.210
They hung my black young lover to a crossroads tree

456
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:24.110
way down south in Dixie,
bruised body,
high in air.

457
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:29.110
I asked for the white Lord Jesus.

458
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.170
What was the use of prayer?

459
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.510
<v 1>Okay,</v>

460
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.600
<v 0>way down south in Dixie break,</v>

461
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:42.601
the heart of me love is a naked shadow on a gnarled and naked tree.

462
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.330
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

463
00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:53.590
<v 0>This is a song for a dark girl,
uh,
suggesting,</v>

464
00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.580
um,
uh,
at once,
uh,

465
00:33:57.581 --> 00:34:00.670
words for her to sing a dramatic monologue,
uh,

466
00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:05.671
and also for in the sense of a kind of a homage or tribute to her,

467
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.420
she is dark,
uh,
as in,
uh,

468
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:18.010
other Hughes poems.
Uh,
the word here seems to mean black.

469
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.260
Uh,
also darkened,
uh,
abused,

470
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.800
grieving,
shadowed.

471
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.360
It's all held there in that simple word.
Uh,

472
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.330
way down south in Dixie,
uh,
align from the minstrel refrain.

473
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:38.800
A,

474
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.800
it's borrowed here in adapted a Dixie is a kind of shorthand name for a system

475
00:34:47.141 --> 00:34:52.070
and history of oppression in this poem.
Uh,

476
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:58.060
and,
and the,
the very,
uh,
jauntiness and pride of,

477
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:02.170
uh,
a,
uh,
a colloquial name like Dixie is,

478
00:35:02.171 --> 00:35:04.120
is played off of here,

479
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.240
the melancholy and in grief of the context and that phrase way down that seems

480
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.450
innocuous to but isn't it resonant as you,
uh,

481
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.470
as it is repeated in,
as we feel our way into the poem,
uh,

482
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.870
it's formulaic,
but it suggests that we're going,

483
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.920
that this poem happens somewhere deep in Dark,

484
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:35.620
somewhere a way down,
uh,
somewhere in the heart,

485
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.230
in the heart,
this system of oppression,
but also,
uh,

486
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.160
as it will turn out in the heart of,
uh,

487
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.260
me as the poem develops it.
Uh,
here,
the,

488
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.980
the,
the,
the mere phrase way down south in Dixie.
Uh,
and the,

489
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.510
the mention of that name,
calling up the tune,

490
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.820
a summons,
a,
a kind of a history of,
uh,

491
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.890
oppression that would occlude the kind of story that Hughes wants to bring

492
00:36:08.851 --> 00:36:12.640
forward.
A until here.
Um,

493
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:18.270
the minstrel phrase is taken up by here,

494
00:36:18.271 --> 00:36:19.740
a speaker who suffers,

495
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:24.020
who is oppressed by this system of oppression.
Uh,

496
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:29.170
and she uses it to make her own music.
Uh,

497
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:31.650
as another huge pumps.
Repetition.

498
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.320
The use of the reframe,
uh,
uh,

499
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:40.680
makes everything that happens seem inevitable.

500
00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.060
It evokes here a repeated,
uh,
actions.
Uh,
it,

501
00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:51.660
uh,
a kind of history of repeated acts,
uh,

502
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.650
in general,
uh,
in the case of refrains,

503
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:01.050
uh,
we,
we,
uh,
they,
they function in a variety of ways.

504
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:06.210
A refrain that comes last in a verse unit,
uh,

505
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:10.320
would seem to convey the idea that,
well,

506
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:13.500
somehow things always end this way.
Uh,

507
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.360
here what we have is an instance of what we would call Anaphora.

508
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.230
That is a refrain used to,
uh,
initiate,

509
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:27.930
uh,
a,
uh,
uh,
a unit of verse.

510
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.230
Uh,
and the refrain is the,
the first line of these stanzas.
Uh,

511
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.580
and it seems to suggest to the story always.

512
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.660
This kind of story always begins the same way,

513
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.400
way down in Dixie.

514
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.150
This is the way into everything that's experienced in who,
the poem,

515
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.350
everything that's said,

516
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:52.490
the parenthesis that comes then a repeated in the second line of each of these

517
00:37:52.621 --> 00:37:57.200
stanzas functions in an interesting way.
Uh,

518
00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.140
it suggests,
I think that what is being said in them,
uh,

519
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.500
it's a kind of aside,
uh,

520
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.960
or some kind of interior reflection or Soliloquy,
uh,

521
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.030
perhaps a,
a voice that must be kept inside.

522
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.600
Does that first phrase break the heart of me?
Uh,

523
00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.620
referred to the girl,
uh,
to her lynched lover.

524
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.113
Uh,

525
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.680
we're to the poet reflecting on both.

526
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.440
Uh,
probably answer is all three,
uh,

527
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:36.640
held to gather in a system of identification.

528
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:42.430
Uh,
that phrase,
the heart of me is resonant.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

529
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:47.170
what holds these three together?
A kind of shared heart.
A,

530
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:51.130
it refers to the heart,
meaning emotion feeling,

531
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.440
probably pride.
Uh,

532
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:58.360
but the phrase also suggests simply the center.
Uh,
the heart of me,
uh,

533
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.440
myself,
my identity,
uh,
they,

534
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:07.470
they hung my black young lover to a crossroads tree.

535
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:12.910
They is superbly vague,
uh,
impersonal,

536
00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:17.710
plural,
formulaic,
dehumanized,

537
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.530
a evoking a mob,

538
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.310
a generalized body.

539
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:28.600
Then there's that phrase,
the crossroads tree.

540
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.830
There are a lot of suggestions in it.
First of all,

541
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:36.970
it evokes the tree of the Cross,
Christ cross.

542
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.460
Uh,
then,
uh,
the cross is also a figure for,

543
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.120
uh,

544
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:47.530
I think the intersection of white and black as it is and the in the little poem

545
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:52.510
called Cross,
uh,
on the page before you could a consult that,

546
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.070
uh,
and then the crossroads is,
uh,

547
00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:01.600
it's one of the central recurrent scenes of the blues.

548
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:06.700
It's,
it's where Robert Johnson,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,

549
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.880
blues man was said to have made his pact with the devil.
Uh,

550
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:14.680
it is the place where choices are made,
uh,

551
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:19.750
where crisis occurs in a wandering and,
and displaced life.

552
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:26.110
Uh,
that second verse,
way down South in Dixie,
bruised body,
high and air.

553
00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:30.310
I asked the white Lord Jesus,
what was the use of prayer?

554
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.780
Uh,
now the parenthesis holds in it a kind of brutal image,

555
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:39.310
something horrifying that must be set off slightly.

556
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:44.740
Uh,
the body is bruised.
It shows the marks of beating of suffering,

557
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.480
uh,
in advance of murder.
Uh,
it's lifted high in air,

558
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.190
not an honor or tribute,
uh,

559
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.010
rather to be lifted in this way is to lose all agency,

560
00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.900
uh,
to be made lifeless.
Uh,

561
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.280
all of this presented as a kind of syntactic fragment in the poem,

562
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.140
uh,
not yet integrated into the poem,
so to speak,
wart it may be,

563
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:15.910
and to not yet integrated into consciousness.
Uh,
the final verse,

564
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:20.620
we'll go back to it,
uh,
in,
in interpret that that image here,

565
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:25.270
Jesus is quite a in a sense of pure untouched,

566
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:28.880
redeemed,
uh,
but also because he is a,

567
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.740
it seems a representative of white culture,
a kind of mediator girl,

568
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.750
uh,
would seek to,
uh,
address,
uh,

569
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:42.350
the girl doesn't pray to him,
but rather asks a question,

570
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.440
a question about the use of prayer and,
uh,

571
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.610
Jesus notably doesn't answer.
Uh,
in addition to,
uh,

572
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.270
repetition,
um,

573
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:58.420
a song form poems like this are made out of omission.
Uh,

574
00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:03.430
and jumps from one stands up to another from one line to another.

575
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:09.130
And one thing admitted here is any sense of Jesus's reply or perhaps the answer

576
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.210
comes in the form of that final verse,
uh,

577
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.320
which repeats the first lines of the poem.
Uh,

578
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.700
this is the truth that it arises from and returns to.
Uh,

579
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:27.950
and it gives us a memorable image.
Uh,

580
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:32.810
the lover has become depersonalized and abstract,

581
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.010
uh,
merely a shadow.
Uh,

582
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.020
he is now though with his abstraction become love itself.

583
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.010
The girls love perhaps Christ's love

584
00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.200
and love is a naked shadow on it.

585
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.950
GNARLED and naked tree here,
the repetition of naked,

586
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:57.890
it's suggestive.

587
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:03.190
It evokes the man's nakedness is helplessness and exposure.

588
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.431
Uh,

589
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:09.431
there's also a sense of revelation of coming to the naked truth.

590
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:12.051
Uh,

591
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:17.051
and this is something very different from the nakedness that Yates boasts of in

592
00:43:18.591 --> 00:43:19.760
his poems.

593
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.553
Uh,

594
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:29.450
the blues is also about laughter.

595
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.690
Uh,
and uh,
it is,
uh,

596
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.150
laughter that I guess I would like to,
uh,
and with,
uh,

597
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:45.740
while we have a few moments left,
um,

598
00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:51.110
uh,
laughter that,
um,
uh,
comes out of,
uh,

599
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.960
the endurance of

600
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:58.690
hardship.
And suffering.
Uh,

601
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:03.700
this is a young youth laughing and here's a later one.
Uh,

602
00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.640
and why don't we end with a later poem,
uh,

603
00:44:07.641 --> 00:44:12.140
and that that's called life is fine.
On six 99,

604
00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.710
20 years,
uh,
after the poems I've been,
uh,

605
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:22.880
discussing it too,
has a,
uh,
uh,

606
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:25.890
a song form.
Uh,
and,
and he,

607
00:44:25.891 --> 00:44:28.820
a blues singer speaking to us.

608
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:34.050
I went down to the river and think of how many rivers appear in these poems.

609
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:38.070
Uh,
uh,
I went down to the river,
I sat down on the bank.

610
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.430
I tried to think but couldn't.
So I jumped in and sank.

611
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.830
I came up once and hollered.
I came up twice and cried.

612
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:51.750
If that water hadn't been so cold,
I might have sunk and died.

613
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.620
But it was cold in that water.
It was cold.

614
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:02.710
Suicide is contemplated and tried.
Uh,
uh,

615
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.240
not quite a,
because when the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

616
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.580
singer gets on top of the building,
he decides,
but it was high up there.

617
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:15.390
It was high.
And he's not about to jump.

618
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:21.240
Since I'm still here living,
I guess I will live on,

619
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.770
I could have died for love,
but for living,

620
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.030
I was born not for love because that would mean dying.

621
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.870
You may hear me Holler.
You may see me cry,

622
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:37.740
but I'll be dogged sweet baby.
If you're going to see me die,

623
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:43.470
life is fine.
Fine as wine life is fine.

624
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.310
Well,
I think rather than say anything else,
uh,
I'll uh,
stop right on time.

625
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:52.800
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

626
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.700
promised to return on Wednesday to talk about William Carlos Williams.
