WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.130
On Monday.
I will.
Well,
I,
you know,

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.100
I left,
uh,
I left off talking about this,

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.800
this,
um,
which we call it,
um,
uh,

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.200
exciting and dramatic,
uh,

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.200
ambivalence that one finds in the early Elliot,
uh,
that,
uh,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.633
uh,

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.860
expresses itself in his relationship to literary tradition.
Uh,

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.910
where on the one hand,
um,
he,

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.130
uh,
presents himself as a,
a,

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.170
a truly subversive and aggressive,
um,

11
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.600
uh,
entrant into a literary tradition.
Uh,

12
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.970
someone who's really going to shake it up and transform it.

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.920
And on the other hand,
uh,

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.660
as someone who is a traditionalist who is going to,
um,

15
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.880
uh,
speak with deference and seek as he uses the word,

16
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.000
he uses this conformity,
uh,
with the past.

17
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:10.860
Somehow both these things are going on at the same time and in relationship to

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280
each other.
Uh,
there's,
um,

19
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.700
well in,
in Prufrock itself,
uh,
uh,

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.300
is a poem I think preoccupied,
uh,

21
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
with this kind of ambivalence,
uh,
that I'm describing.

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.990
Um,
on the one hand,
it is a,
um,

23
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.753
uh,

24
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.510
a poem that introduces us to a speaker who lacks will,

25
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.730
uh,
and who,
uh,
seems,
uh,
timorous and timid,
uh,

26
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.380
and who hesitates before action.
Uh,
on the other hand,
uh,

27
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:48.740
he is a speaker who says to us,
uh,

28
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.350
there will be a time to murder and create a,

29
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:56.730
as if creating and murdering,
uh,
were in fact,
uh,

30
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.360
in some relation.
Um,
and Mike go on at the same time.

31
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.910
Uh,
and in fact,

32
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.911
if one does have some sense of creativity as involving a kind of aggression or

33
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.600
even murderousness when might hesitate before,
right.
Um,

34
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.760
these,
these,
uh,
psychological,

35
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.050
uh,
dimensions that I'm describing,
um,
uh,

36
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:26.130
have well a Friday in an oedipal,
uh,
dimensions that I think are,

37
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.850
are readily apparent.
Um,

38
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.330
how is it possible for Elliot to claim the Authority of past literature,

39
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.170
uh,
without,
uh,
at the same time,
um,

40
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
either destroying it or,

41
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.320
uh,
utterly,
uh,
submitting himself to it?

42
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.560
Uh,
this,
this problem expresses,

43
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.460
I think Elliot [inaudible] relation to the past.
Uh,
and,

44
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.470
and is expressed as I was suggesting last time in the ambiguous use of quotation

45
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:10.471
that seems to hover between some kind of a deferential honoring of the

46
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.420
literature of the past and something much more provocative,
uh,

47
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.640
and often parodic.
Uh,

48
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.110
and you can think of the many different texts that,
uh,

49
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.940
Prufrock,
uh,

50
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
alludes to and borrows only some of which are traced in your footnotes.

51
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:35.020
In fact,
there's a great many more,
um,
excuse me.

52
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.940
Uh,
you,
you,
you find in,
in your footnotes,
uh,
uh,

53
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.420
that there are quotations from Marvell,
uh,
from the Bible,

54
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:48.010
from Dante,
from 12th night.
Uh,
well,
there's that opening quotation,

55
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.140
uh,
from,
uh,
from Dante,
from the Gospels,
uh,
to,

56
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.030
um,
Prufrock's world weary,
Miss,

57
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.860
uh,
you know,
he's,
you know,
for,
I have known them all,
uh,

58
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.390
already known them all,
uh,

59
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.490
as a understood in the poetic context.
Um,
uh,

60
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:14.250
this,
this seems to well express his sense of belatedness and,

61
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:18.220
and of the everything having in some sense,
Ben done already.

62
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.530
Um,
yeah.
Uh,
in,
in,

63
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.080
again for ADN or oedipal terms,

64
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.700
terms that Harold bloom would develop as a reader of Elliot in his own

65
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:35.620
criticism.
Very influentially.
Uh,
you can,
you can put the problem,
uh,

66
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.740
this way.
Uh,

67
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.790
how can Elliot come to write in the father's place without killing it,

68
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.170
uh,
or being overwhelmed by him,
uh,

69
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.000
in his confrontation with the past,

70
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.140
neither he Elliot nor the past,
uh,
must be destroyed,
uh,

71
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.430
or the game's over,
uh,
Elliot there by swerves.
You could say,

72
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:05.830
I'll turn the actively,
uh,

73
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:10.170
from each of these except unacceptable alternatives,
uh,

74
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.180
in that kind of a back and forth in this you feel in Prufrock's delegations and

75
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:20.790
wanderings,
uh,
you,
um,
see it,
uh,

76
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.700
throughout Eliot's early career in his funny mixture of all on guard,

77
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:29.650
ism and traditionalism cause he's,
he's both those things.

78
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.200
Uh,
I've been describing this in psychological terms.

79
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.220
We could also think about it in social terms and I think it's important to do
so.

80
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.661
Uh,
this,

81
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:45.640
this oedipal drama that I'm describing is also a social drama,

82
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.320
uh,
in important ways.
Uh,
here's a question.

83
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.430
How,
how does a young American,

84
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.860
because that's what he was,
uh,

85
00:05:56.861 --> 00:06:01.861
how does a young American go and win a place in English literary culture,

86
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.250
Insert himself in a tradition that includes Shakespeare.

87
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:12.251
Milton Tennyson were Wordsworth insert himself not only as a member of that

88
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:20.010
tradition,
but as a central explainer of it,
uh,

89
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.320
and,
and tastemaker,
which is in fact what Elliot would become.

90
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.500
Uh,
last time I pointed out that Elliot's,
uh,

91
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.940
expatriation is going from

92
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.680
the US to London was a rejection not only of a America and American miss,

93
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.790
uh,
but,
uh,
in particular,
uh,

94
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.800
a rejection of his father and his father who died while he was abroad.

95
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.313
Um,
uh,

96
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.570
and there was a certain amount of question about would Elliot a return in time

97
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:01.030
to see his father before he died?
Um,

98
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.560
in a very short time in London,

99
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.530
Elliot becomes more English than the English.

100
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.470
It's a strange and marvelous,
uh,
if fascinating,
uh,
uh,

101
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:13.304
development,

102
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:18.730
he learns or creates a certain style of Englishness that he then goes on to

103
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.860
teach to the English themselves.
Uh,

104
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:28.250
this is what a Williams William Carlos Williams and,

105
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.780
and in fact other American writers despised about Elliot,
uh,

106
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.400
that he was the,
uh,
not just the angle of file,
uh,
that,
that he was,

107
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:42.280
but the,
uh,
um,
well the,
the true English authority,
uh,

108
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.790
that he became a,

109
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.530
he made himself without any previous standing,

110
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:53.330
any connections really,
uh,
in,
in London or an English culture.
Uh,

111
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.790
he made himself a central cultural authority,
uh,

112
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.490
which became in a very short time,
almost synonymous with tradition itself.

113
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.760
This is an amazing and remarkable achievement and an important cultural event.

114
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.800
The thing is that,
uh,

115
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.830
the tradition that Elliot expounded was something to a large degree.

116
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:23.720
He invented,
uh,

117
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.490
Elliot is not as,
he is often seen,

118
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.180
I think the defender of a social order,
uh,

119
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.880
uh,
that was passing away.
And sometimes Yates represents himself that way.

120
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.310
Uh,
rather,
uh,

121
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:45.270
Elliot is the representative of a new class,
uh,

122
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.300
a,
um,
uh,

123
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.340
a new class opposing itself to the traditional social authority of,

124
00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.090
uh,
money.
Uh,
and a blood aristocracy,

125
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.003
uh,

126
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.370
makes its claim for social authority on the basis of knowledge,

127
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.350
technical knowledge and expertise above all,
a kind of professional class,

128
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.130
uh,
into which you two are being educated.
Um,
uh,

129
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.750
largely through the modern university,
uh,

130
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.770
Elliot's,
uh,
tradition,
uh,
that he,
um,

131
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.450
that I'm saying he invented or created,
described,
defined.

132
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.980
Uh,
he made it out of the education he had received at Harvard,

133
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.630
uh,
be also importantly made it outside of the classroom,
uh,

134
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.250
impart in the school of Ezra pound.
Um,
uh,

135
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.000
who,
uh,
you might remember from last week.
Specifically.

136
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:52.380
Also when he expatriates leaves behind the Volvo,
the,
the people,

137
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.140
uh,
and,
uh,

138
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.900
sees himself as entering into some kind of a timeless,

139
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.160
a tradition that he identifies pound does with the spirits of irony and destiny.

140
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:08.700
That's his,
his phrase,
uh,
to describe the great writers of the past.

141
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.730
Elliott also enters this,

142
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.810
this kind of semi imaginary community of tradition.

143
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.900
Uh,
Elliot sense of tradition is established a impart through,
uh,

144
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:26.490
his quotations in illusions,
uh,
in his poetry.
Uh,

145
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.110
impart and importantly,
and I'll talk more about it today through his criticism,

146
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:36.690
uh,
this,
this kind of tradition with which,
uh,
Elliot ally's and himself,

147
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.810
you could say bank rolls,
everything he does legitimize it as,

148
00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.710
and this authorizes give sanction and precedent,
uh,

149
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.080
to what was Elliot's strange new poetry,

150
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.750
uh,
for us.
Do you remember?
Uh,
as he says,
goes to market,

151
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.250
uh,
so he could stand on his own two feet?
Well,
uh,

152
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.610
Elliot went to tradition,
uh,

153
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.230
to establish his autonomy.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

154
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.890
tradition allows him,
uh,
to well,

155
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.260
to stand apart both from the genteel audiences that,

156
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.660
um,
uh,

157
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:23.160
pound resisted that frost in certain ways courted,
uh,

158
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.790
and also allows Elliot to stand apart from the avant garde,
uh,

159
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.800
which he has a kind of,
um,

160
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.770
ambiguous relationship to,
um,

161
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.600
allows them to stand apart.

162
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.900
You could say from the audiences of both a magazine like the Atlantic or

163
00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:43.160
Harper's on the one hand and on the other hand,
uh,

164
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:48.180
a magazine like the little review or blast even where he did appear,

165
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.070
uh,
or were broom,
uh,
some of those magazines I showed you in the first week,

166
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.270
uh,
Elliot's own magazine,

167
00:11:55.271 --> 00:12:00.271
which becomes an important vehicle for his work and his ideas and his authority

168
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.640
and his presence and literary culture.
His magazine was,

169
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:07.840
and go back and look at,
uh,
look at its cover,
uh,
in,

170
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:11.470
in the images for the first week.
His magazine was the criterion,

171
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.180
a magazine that had a kind of semi official look,

172
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.400
uh,
and,

173
00:12:17.401 --> 00:12:22.210
and represents the kind of fantasy of I think of a kind of institutional and

174
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.860
universal authority.
Well,
uh,

175
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.770
how do you go about inventing tradition

176
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.020
in order to do so,
Elliot had to,
uh,

177
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.420
had to demonstrate that the received existing tradition,

178
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:45.220
it was a false one.
The metaphysical poets is the,

179
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.470
the great and,
and,
uh,

180
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.730
peculiar in many ways essay in which,
uh,

181
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.750
Elliot a undertakes this work in a very influential,

182
00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.430
a forum.
And I'd like to look at with you for a few minutes.
Um,

183
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.241
it starts,
uh,

184
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:06.241
nine 50 at the back of your book a and goes to nine 53.

185
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.930
Uh,
this was,
this was a book review.
This is one of the great book reviews.

186
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:15.550
And the history of English,
uh,
uh,
criticism.
Uh,

187
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:20.551
Elliot was reviewing an anthology of the metaphysical poets,

188
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.470
uh,
that is,
uh,
poets have a wit.
Uh,

189
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.800
in particular of the,
uh,
largely,
uh,

190
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:34.790
of the 17th century,
uh,
including,
um,

191
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.230
uh,
poets,
uh,
like done,
um,

192
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.210
who's a reputation.
Uh,

193
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.380
Elliot did a great deal to establish in the century,

194
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.740
uh,
lip in the process of reviewing this anthology.

195
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.670
Elliot comes up with a whole,
uh,
alternative theory,
uh,

196
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.500
oral alternative history of English literature,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

197
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.820
certain key poetic,
uh,
propositions and statements.

198
00:14:03.821 --> 00:14:07.960
Let me just emphasize a few of them for you.

199
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:12.910
You'll see how,
how,
um,
uh,
the account of literary history,
uh,

200
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:17.320
and Elliot's own ideas of poetics are all kind of mixed up.
Uh,
uh,

201
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:21.130
and so you have to consider them together.
And nine 51,

202
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.250
uh,
he has,
uh,
he has quoted,
I'm done.

203
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:32.550
And then he's quoted a Tennyson a and w and the idea is that done is good.

204
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:36.700
Tennyson is bad.
Now,
uh,
he will,

205
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.450
he will continue and say the difference is not a simple difference of degree

206
00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:41.261
between poets.

207
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:46.261
It's something that happened to the mind of England between the time of done or

208
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:52.561
alert Lord Har Herbert of Char Bray and the time of Tennyson and Browning.

209
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.900
It's the difference between the intellectual poet that's a good kind of poet and

210
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:02.210
the reflective poet bad,
uh,

211
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.630
Tennyson and Browning our poets.
And they think,

212
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.020
but they do not feel their thought as immediately as the odor of a rose.

213
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.060
A thought to done was inexperience.

214
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.050
It modified his sensibility.
Uh,

215
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.850
evidently,
uh,

216
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.770
he felt his thought as immediately as essentially as the odor of arose.

217
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.300
When a poet's mind is perfectly equipped for its work,

218
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:37.880
it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience.

219
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.520
The ordinary man's experience is chaotic,
irregular,
fragmentary,

220
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:48.080
maybe quite a bit like Prufrock's.
You would think,
uh,

221
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.880
the ladder falls in love or read Spinosa

222
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.150
and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other or with the noise

223
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:03.710
of the typewriter or the smell of cooking in the mind of the poet.
However,

224
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:07.310
these experiences are constantly forming new holes.

225
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.610
Well,
uh,
you can,
you can see they're a little recipe for,
uh,

226
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.380
for an Auden poem.
And excuse me,
well maybe for non pump,
but for an Eliot poem,

227
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.280
it's a poem about falling in love reading Spinosa and listening to the

228
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:25.900
typewriter.
Well,
somebody cooks something.
Uh,

229
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.160
we may express the differences by the following theory and note that we,
uh,

230
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:32.810
you know,
Elliot has this,
we,

231
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:37.811
that you just have to bow before I'm going to use is it a or join him,

232
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:41.240
I guess.
Uh,
the poets of the 17th Century,

233
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.250
the successors of the dramatists of the 16th possessed a mechanism of

234
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:49.820
sensibility which could devour.
And that's an interesting word.

235
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.320
Any kind of experience they are simple,
artificial difficult,

236
00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:59.090
are fantastic as their predecessors were.
No,
uh,
last,
no more than Dante,

237
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.910
uh,
in the 17th century.
However,

238
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.750
a dissociation of sensibility set in from which we have never recovered.

239
00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.410
And this,
uh,
what does he mean?

240
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:16.490
He means fought and feeling have somehow come apart.

241
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.700
And this dissociation as is natural,

242
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:23.390
was aggravated by the influence of the two most powerful poets of the century,

243
00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:27.350
Milton and Dryden.
And then he goes on to complain about Milton and Dryden,

244
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.490
and then follow the,
um,
uh,
um,

245
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.010
uh,
romantic,
a inheritance of,
of Melton and Dryden.

246
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.750
In the next paragraph,
uh,

247
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:43.751
he says the sentimental age began early in the 18th century and continued,

248
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.310
wouldn't you like in your own essays to be able to give this kind of rapid fire

249
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:52.800
summary of,
of,
uh,
literary history.

250
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.110
The poet's revolted against the Raffia,
some native,
the descriptive,

251
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.640
they fought and felt by fits unbalanced.

252
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.120
They reflected in one or two passages of Shelley's triumph of life.

253
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.920
In the second Hyperion of Keats,
uh,

254
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.960
there are traces of a struggle towards a unification of sensibility,

255
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.570
but Keats and Shelley died,
and Tennyson and Browning ruminated

256
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.670
[inaudible] amazing literary criticism.
Uh,
well,

257
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.680
uh,
here is,
here is quite,
uh,
an extraordinary,
uh,
account of,

258
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.970
of,
um,
English.
Uh,
literary history,
uh,

259
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.230
Elliot is proposing this,
it's quite a strange,
uh,
an interesting claim,

260
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.020
which for a long time,
uh,

261
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:50.150
I might add a really was persuasive and became a kind of orthodoxy,

262
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.470
uh,
among,
um,
uh,
readers of English poetry.

263
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.020
And that is that the metaphysical poets

264
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

265
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:05.890
<v 0>For centuries viewed as an anomaly in the history of English poetry.</v>

266
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:08.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.540
<v 0>Uh,
because of their,
uh,
extreme intellectual reality,</v>

268
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.800
uh,
their,
um,
uh,

269
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.640
their poetry of wit,
um,

270
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.280
that this anomaly in English literary tradition actually represents,

271
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.810
<v 1>yeah.</v>

272
00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.300
<v 0>Uh,
central values,
uh,</v>

273
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:36.330
in literature that were lost through what Elliot views as an eccentric and a

274
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:43.120
Barent tradition,
which is in fact that which descends from Milton,

275
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.800
uh,
uh,
and,

276
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.630
and runs through the Romantics and Victorians.
Uh,

277
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.760
Samuel Johnson in the 18th century,
uh,
uh,

278
00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.060
influentially complained to the metaphysical poets that,
um,

279
00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.360
they yoked the most heterogeneous ideas together by violence.

280
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.440
This is Johnson's phrase.
In other words,

281
00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:13.441
they were forced and willful and they put things together in a kind of a violent

282
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.110
and,
um,
uh,
artificial way.

283
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.400
Elliot is flipping that around and he says,

284
00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.770
only the metaphysical poets United Thought and feeling.
Uh,
and it's,

285
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.980
uh,
these other poets that are,
uh,

286
00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.360
that have been a deficient and,
and,
and uh,
uh,

287
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.600
marginal to,
uh,
the,
uh,
main mission of,
um,

288
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:39.910
uh,

289
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.910
English poetry and that they are symptomatic of some derangement in the mind

290
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.010
England,
uh,
that he calls a dissociation of Sensibility,

291
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.970
which somehow set in in the 17th century or so.

292
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:00.970
All of this,
this whole sort of,
uh,
account of,
of how English history,

293
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:05.890
English literary history developed all of this in this essay suddenly without

294
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:10.540
any preparation turns into a defense of modern poetry,

295
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.370
uh,
or you might say a defensive Elliot's poetry.

296
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.470
Uh,
he says,
um,
without,
as I say really any preparation,
uh,

297
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:22.030
on the bottom of nine 52,

298
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.930
it is not a permanent necessity that poets should be interested in philosophy as

299
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:32.500
I was or as I am,
uh,
or in any other subject.

300
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.830
We,
and there's that we again,
uh,

301
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:40.680
can only say that it appears likely that poets in our civilization as it existed

302
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.270
present must be difficult.

303
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.930
Our civilization.
He continues,

304
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.080
comprehends great variety and complexity and this variety and complexity playing

305
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:59.941
upon a refined sensibility such as mine must produce various and complex

306
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.450
results.
The poet,
and now he's,
he's now he's telling,

307
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.150
telling us what poets must do.

308
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.950
The poet must become more and more comprehensive,
more elusive,

309
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
more indirect in order to force to dislocate if necessary language into his

310
00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:27.640
meaning.
And then he will go on to,
uh,

311
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.440
a quote,
um,
uh,
French poetry,

312
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:38.170
modern French poetry,
uh,
uh,
to demonstrate as he feels it,

313
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.040
uh,

314
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.040
the continuity between a modern verse and the metaphysical well,

315
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:51.790
uh,
here,
excuse me,
Elliot is saying,
first of all,

316
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:54.463
uh,

317
00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:00.210
that the character of modern poetry and again for which we must read his poetry

318
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.990
a is simply a reflection of the forces playing upon it,

319
00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.980
the variety and complexity of our civilization.
Uh,

320
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:14.080
in that formulation,
the poet seems almost passive,
doesn't meet,
um,
uh,

321
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:17.580
and,
and,
uh,
passive and,
um,

322
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.650
like a kind of a receptor that is naturally and necessarily producing the kind

323
00:23:24.371 --> 00:23:28.670
of strange poetry that Eliot writes.
Then,
uh,

324
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.960
before that,
uh,
ideas really,
uh,

325
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.250
some kin Elliot gives us another view of what the poet,
uh,

326
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.240
is doing.
Uh,
the poet,
uh,
is not in fact passive,

327
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:41.800
but rather he's forcing,

328
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.570
he is dislocating language into his meaning.

329
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.710
It's such an odd phrase to dislocate language into your meaning.

330
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.720
Uh,
it,

331
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.280
it suggests a poet is not merely producing language,

332
00:23:58.281 --> 00:24:02.900
but moving it from one place to another.

333
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:09.410
Um,
the question that we might ask though,

334
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.270
standing back a of the metaphysical is this is a question that we could ask of

335
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:17.180
Elliot's poetry that is,

336
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.070
does this poetry that Elliot's talking about

337
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.830
put things together or take them apart.
Uh,

338
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.910
has it,
does it represent some kind of synthesis or rather some kind of,
uh,

339
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.750
violent derangement?
Uh,

340
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.340
is it a mirror of a various and complex civilization?

341
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:45.370
Is it in that sense memetic realist or is it rather expressionistic a willful,

342
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.790
uh,
a kind of,
um,
uh,
subjective,
uh,
uh,

343
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.240
and,
um,
uh,

344
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.080
highly personal expression in which the poet is purposefully a actively

345
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.670
dislocating and,
and deforming,
uh,
language?

346
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.430
Uh,
is it in,
in the,
in the sense of poetry that is a,
uh,

347
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.460
a kind of necessary and inevitable expression of the age or,

348
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.570
uh,
is it perverse and eccentric?
Uh,

349
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.520
an arbitrary assertion of authorial will.
Uh,

350
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.380
these are,
these are questions that,
um,
uh,
Elliot's own work,
as I say,

351
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:35.930
raises.
Uh,
and that,
that,
um,

352
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.940
are part of the history of his reception.
Uh,

353
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.080
Elliot in his account of the men of physicals and then in his defense of his own

354
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.920
kind of poetry,
uh,
seems,

355
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:56.921
I think to equivocate to a degree between these alternatives.

356
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.223
Uh,

357
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.890
equivocation is again,

358
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.080
the key rhetoric,
uh,
of Prufrock,
uh,
and,

359
00:26:09.081 --> 00:26:13.460
and of Eliot's early poetry,
um,
uh,

360
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:18.140
of Prufrock's temporizing and his delays and his going back and forth.

361
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.510
Let me say just a couple more things about Prufrock in the light of what I've

362
00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:27.980
just been quoting from you,
quoting for you,
from,

363
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.750
um,
the metaphysical poets,

364
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.420
uh,

365
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:40.420
Prufrock has a kind of ambiguous relation to the past,

366
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.540
uh,
and specifically to,
uh,
the past of English Romanticism.

367
00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:46.790
Uh,

368
00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:51.790
the poem is simultaneously a deconstruction and critique of the romantic ideals

369
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:02.490
and values of,
uh,
originality of

370
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:08.260
expressiveness.
And,
uh,

371
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:13.310
it is also a highly original and expressive reworking of those ideals.

372
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:15.841
A,
it's a,

373
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:20.841
it's a kind of anti romantic poem that is an extension of romanticism.

374
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.830
Unlike the conventional love song,

375
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.800
this one comes from the head rather than the heart.

376
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.320
Uh,
or,
uh,
you could say really from that opening quotation from Dante on,

377
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.280
it comes from,
comes out of many other texts.

378
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:43.853
Uh,

379
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.900
I think there's a kind of suggestion or implication in the poem that,
um,

380
00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.140
uh,
what people claim is original and primary,
uh,

381
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.160
is always in some sense already scripted that consciousness.

382
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.663
Uh,

383
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.210
the way our minds work is linguistic that we think and feel through language

384
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.570
with language.
Uh,

385
00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:14.571
and through a kind of collage network of verbal associations,

386
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.530
uh,

387
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:21.030
made out of texts and phrases from,

388
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.670
uh,
not only literary tradition of course,
but,
uh,

389
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.520
the whole spectrum of everyday life.
Uh,

390
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.570
original speech,
heroic action,

391
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.500
the will unmediated desire.

392
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.930
These ideals are all rejected and Prufrock,
uh,
parodied,
uh,

393
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.040
subjected to irony,
discontinuity.

394
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.200
They're seen as romantic illusions,
uh,
cliches,

395
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:58.790
but the poem is not merely a parody of them or maybe through parody,

396
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.350
it does something else.
It is of course,

397
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:05.820
in its own way,
uh,

398
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.240
quite as daring and disturbing a poem disturbing to the universe of poetry at

399
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:16.500
least,
uh,
as Annie,
uh,
as any modern poem.

400
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.993
Uh,

401
00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.920
and I think you can see it as ineffective,

402
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:26.270
a new kind of love song,
uh,

403
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.330
one in which the withdrawing of desire from a,

404
00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.280
an object are our consciousness of our own desires,

405
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.250
subject them to reflection,

406
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.310
but at the same time sustain them,
uh,
and,

407
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:51.130
and revoice them through reflection.

408
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.160
You could say that what the palm does is to intellectualize,

409
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.830
longing
and,
uh,

410
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.880
behind that it makes of the modern skeptic and intellectual,

411
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.560
a new kind of romantic hero.

412
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.850
What does proof we're hoc want ultimately?
Uh,
what does he mean when he says,
no,

413
00:30:15.851 --> 00:30:20.770
that's not what I meant at all?
Well,
it's hard to say exactly,
uh,

414
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.550
but the palm does,
uh,
conclude,
uh,
and as it does,

415
00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:28.750
it gives us a kind of answer,
I think.
Ah,
why don't we look at the end of it?

416
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:30.520
That's,
um,
four 66.

417
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.160
<v 0>I grow old.
I grow old.</v>

419
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.210
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

420
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:45.300
Shall I part my hair behind?

421
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.630
Do I dare to eat a peach?

422
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.000
I saw where white flannel trousers and walk upon the beach.

423
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.770
I have heard the mermaids singing each to each.

424
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.250
You see here,
uh,

425
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.970
Prufrock has moved into these rhyming tercets

426
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.150
he says,
uh,
quite simply and definitively.

427
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.570
I do not think that they will sing to me.

428
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.310
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves coming.

429
00:31:20.311 --> 00:31:25.311
The white hair of the waves blown back when the wind blows the water white and

430
00:31:25.441 --> 00:31:29.310
black.
And as he describes this,

431
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:32.520
there is a kind of heightening of conventional,

432
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.660
a lyric language with that alliteration.

433
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.520
And with those images

434
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:45.050
we have lingered in the chambers of the C by c girls wreathed with seaweed,

435
00:31:45.631 --> 00:31:50.631
red and brown till human voices wake us and we drown.

436
00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.730
It's hard to interpret.
I think the,
the end of this poem precisely.

437
00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.460
Uh,
I think that,
uh,

438
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.690
Prufrock has really no clarified,

439
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:12.691
no specified desire except maybe to hear the mermaids.

440
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.340
I do not think that they will think to me,
I want them to,
he seems to be saying,

441
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.270
uh,
in a sense.
I think you could say he wants romantic singing.

442
00:32:25.271 --> 00:32:26.410
He wants to hear it.

443
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.690
Perhaps he wants to be able to join in it himself,

444
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.790
which is a wish for lyric inspiration,
isn't it?
Uh,

445
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:40.520
he doesn't want to make love to these mermaids.
Uh,
he wants to hear them.

446
00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:45.460
Uh,
he wants to linger with them to have access to their element,

447
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:51.040
uh,
and to that extent to be among them and even like them.
Uh,

448
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:56.060
it is a wish for specifically freedom from human voices,

449
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.950
which I take to be the endless overheard inner voices,

450
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:05.880
uh,

451
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.880
in which the quoted repetitive speech that makes up his consciousness consists,

452
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.420
and in this sense,
uh,

453
00:33:15.421 --> 00:33:20.070
it's a wish for a renewal of romantic enchantment,

454
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.110
which he knows is impossible,
uh,

455
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.550
and which he also knows,

456
00:33:26.551 --> 00:33:31.551
I think is a wish as old as Kate's is owed to a Nightingale.

457
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.420
And this is a poem,
ultimately very much in that cutesy and tradition,

458
00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:47.500
the wasteland.
Let's begin at the end.

459
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.380
Let's begin at the end.
On page four 86,

460
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.180
the wasteland is a palm.
That it comes in five parts.

461
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.240
The fifth section,
I think it's the longest,

462
00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.640
uh,
it's called what the thunder said.

463
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.370
It reaches a kind of climax when,
when the poem,

464
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.810
uh,
renders the voice of the thunder

465
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:40.380
in the landscape of the wasteland.
We are waiting for water.

466
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.430
We're waiting for everything that water would represent

467
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.360
and a funder

468
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:55.880
promises that,
uh,
that water.
Um,
and um,

469
00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.620
it also importantly represents a kind of speech,

470
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.740
a speech that comes out of nature.

471
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.480
Something that the thunder says has all kinds of a

472
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.860
mythological resonance,
uh,

473
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:19.000
you might even view as,
um,

474
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.573
<v 1>okay,</v>

475
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.730
<v 0>the Voice of myth itself,
uh,</v>

476
00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.860
here able to be given,
uh,

477
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:36.730
a voice and a hearing,
uh,
in the poem what the thunder says

478
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:42.980
as Duh,
Duh,
uh,

479
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.680
primary
syllable.

480
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.610
Uh,
there is a note,
um,
uh,
uh,

481
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.540
explaining this,
I'm coming to us,
um,

482
00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:01.860
from your editor and from Elliott.
Uh,

483
00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.140
it is the,
uh,

484
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:09.230
first phoneme that becomes part of the instruction,

485
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:12.720
the series of instructions,
data dyad,

486
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.750
vom Dumb Yata a translated as give sympathize control,

487
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.300
uh,
with the fee.
When the thunder speaks.
This is what it has to say.

488
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.620
It gives us these instructions.
Um,

489
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.400
and four 10,
I'll,
I'll just

490
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:41.160
focus on one of these imperatives.

491
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.940
Duh.
Dyad Balm.

492
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.600
I have heard the key turning the door once in turn,

493
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:56.601
once only we think of the key each in his prison.

494
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.120
Thinking of the key each confirms a prison only at nightfall.

495
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:04.200
Ethereal rumors,

496
00:37:04.201 --> 00:37:09.201
revive for a moment of broken Corey Alaina's Da Dum,

497
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:14.340
Yada.
And then the boat responded.

498
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:18.780
Gayley to the hand expert with sale and or the sea was calm.
Your heart.

499
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.590
And there's this interesting switch of 10th would have responded.

500
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:28.110
Gaily when invited,
beating obedient to controlling hands.

501
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.000
Well,
Dyad Balm

502
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.660
is a translated here,
uh,
as sympathize.

503
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:38.821
Uh,

504
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:43.821
the poem is in many ways concerned with sympathy as essential value,

505
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.080
a central action
in human life.

506
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.890
The lines that,
that they introduce.

507
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:58.620
Describe the condition that's sympathy.

508
00:37:58.621 --> 00:38:02.490
Would redress or,
or enter into a,

509
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:06.070
in a some kind of healing way.
Uh,

510
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.660
I have heard the key turn in the door once in turn,
once only.

511
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.090
Well Elliott,
uh,

512
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.620
when he produced not the first version of this poem and uh,
uh,

513
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:23.280
the criterion,
um,
his own magazine when it first was published,

514
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:25.530
but rather a when it appeared

515
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.120
in the United States added footnotes or rather in notes to the palm.

516
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.110
And,
um,
the end notes we have here are,

517
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:41.920
are worth contemplating a in a sense,

518
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:45.880
Elliot's notes are kind of extension of the poem.
Part of the poem.

519
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.600
Uh,
these lines bear the note,
uh,
for uh,

520
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.480
and below I heard them nailing shut the door of the horrible tower.

521
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.710
The speaker of those lines that Elliot is alluding to,

522
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:07.890
half quoting a is Dante is count [inaudible] in the 33rd Canto of the fair

523
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:13.390
enough,
uh,

524
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:17.320
the trader who Galeano tells Dante that his enemies imprisoned him in his

525
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:21.670
children in a tower to die of starvation.
And of course,

526
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.670
Google Lino would eat his children.

527
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:31.120
Uh,
Elliot continues,

528
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.040
he gives us,
he gives us that little fragment from Dante.

529
00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:40.870
And then he says also Fh,
Bradley appearance and reality.
Page three 46,

530
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.970
it's w when he writes like that,

531
00:39:44.971 --> 00:39:49.971
it's like wearing that a waistcoat like kind of pose.

532
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.050
Uh,
in this case,
the pose of a scholar pedant

533
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.600
Bradley says,

534
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.800
my external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my

535
00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:07.420
feelings.
In either case,
my experience falls within my own circle.

536
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:12.740
A circle closed on the outside and with all its elements alike,

537
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.740
every sphere is opaque to the others,

538
00:40:17.741 --> 00:40:22.741
which surround it in brief regard of as an existence which appears in a soul.

539
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:29.130
The whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.

540
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:37.240
Elliot,
uh,
uh,
work done.
Bradley,
uh,

541
00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.550
for his,
uh,
uh,
thesis,

542
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:45.430
the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.
Well,

543
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.020
uh,
I don't know that there is any key to the wasteland,

544
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:51.340
but if there is a key to the wasteland,

545
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:56.341
it's this key in these lines which lead us to Bradley and Bradley's view of what

546
00:40:56.711 --> 00:41:00.110
consciousness is like.
Consciousness,
uh,

547
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:05.130
is a condition in which we are locked into our own,

548
00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.160
I think linguistic representations of reality without,
um,

549
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:17.590
a,
uh,
uh,
a common language to share them.

550
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.153
Uh,

551
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.410
how can a common world be created out of radically private experience?

552
00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:33.100
Well,
this is,
I think the,
the central question that,

553
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:38.360
uh,
the wasteland is,
is meditating on,

554
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.320
uh,
responding to,
uh,

555
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:45.290
it's one of the central questions in modern poetry.
Let's,

556
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:48.920
um,
we won't get too far in the poem today.

557
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:53.810
We'll have to conclude our discussion,
uh,
on Monday.
But,
uh,
let's,

558
00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:57.140
let's look at the beginning together to,
um,

559
00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:03.540
simply to recall how this poetry operates,
uh,
and,

560
00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.800
and make some preliminary observations.
Uh,
this section,

561
00:42:07.801 --> 00:42:11.350
the first section is called the burial of the dead,
uh,

562
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:16.230
and refers to,
uh,
the,

563
00:42:16.231 --> 00:42:20.760
uh,
uh,
ritual in the Anglican Church,
uh,

564
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:25.230
as as described in the book of common prayer.
Um,

565
00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.413
excuse me.

566
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.230
April is the cruelest month breeding lilacs out of a dead land,

567
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:36.810
mixing memory and desire,

568
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:40.380
stirring dull roots with Spring rain.

569
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:46.320
Winter kept us warm,
covering earth and forgetful,

570
00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:50.280
snow feeding a little life with dried tubers.

571
00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.420
Summer surprised US coming over the stern beggars day with a shower of rain.

572
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:02.780
We stopped in the colonnade and went on and sunlight into the half carton and

573
00:43:03.511 --> 00:43:08.420
drank coffee and talked for an hour.
Been Garkova,
rousson stoneware,

574
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.500
slew town,
Deutsche.

575
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:15.840
And when we were children staying at the arts dukes,
my cousins,

576
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.940
he took me out on a sled and I was frightened.
He said,

577
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.500
Marie Marie,
hold on.
Tight and down.

578
00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:30.000
We went in the mountains.
There you feel free.

579
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.340
I read much of the night and go south in the winter.

580
00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.160
It's extraordinary poetry.

581
00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:43.460
And one of the ways in which it is extraordinary is the,

582
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.850
um,
modulations.
And where do we,

583
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.680
where do we pinpoint the turning points between

584
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:56.460
the initial,

585
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.940
that Hick general voice of the poem and then

586
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.240
that extremely personalized,
uh,

587
00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.340
first person,
uh,
who will be Marie named,
uh,

588
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.660
uh,
that way through that memory.
Um,

589
00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.440
uh,
how do we get from April is the cruelest month two,

590
00:44:22.441 --> 00:44:26.130
I read much of the night and go south in the winter somehow.

591
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.090
Um,
there are a variety,
uh,

592
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.130
I think a range of voices,
um,
uh,
here.
Uh,

593
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:40.131
and how Elliot moves from the one to the other is a question for us as readers.

594
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:46.110
I think it also raises,
uh,
again,

595
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:50.460
this sort of central problem that the poem is concerned and that is what is the

596
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.870
relationship?
How do we articulate the relationship between,
uh,

597
00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.800
the general and the particular between,
um,
uh,

598
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:03.801
experience that is generalizable and that which is a almost irreducibly private.

599
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:12.150
Uh,
April is the cruelest month,
uh,
those,
uh,
wonderful lines.

600
00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:16.910
We all know,
uh,
well,
um,
the Palm Beach Gins with,

601
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:17.763
uh,

602
00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.730
illusion that it hardly even needs to press to,
uh,

603
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.470
one that operated with his short as sort of the first line of the Canterbury

604
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:31.450
Tales.
Uh,
it evokes to,
uh,
probably,
uh,

605
00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.940
a Whitman's,
uh,
uh,

606
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:38.680
when lilacs last in the door yard bloomed another April Elegy.

607
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:39.963
Um,

608
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.170
the poem begins by talking about the pain of awakened desire

609
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:53.280
begins talking about the risk that,

610
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:54.563
uh,

611
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:59.690
the risk that comes with beginning and desiring Prufrock's themes.

612
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.250
Here they are writ large.

613
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.960
A desire it seems is painful because it breaks things open that are closed and

614
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:14.160
shut.
Uh,
it's also,

615
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:19.161
it seems unsatisfiable all of these are to a degree conventional romantic toe

616
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:27.180
point motifs where exactly Cletus the poem,
uh,

617
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:32.350
uh,
modulating into personal memory.
Well,
maybe somewhere in that,
that,

618
00:46:32.351 --> 00:46:35.940
uh,
eighth line,
some are surprised us.
Uh,

619
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.960
it starts out,
uh,
looking and feeling a lot like winter kept us warm.

620
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:47.520
Uh,
but,
uh,
now,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

621
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:52.380
memory will become highly particularized through quotation incidentally,
uh,

622
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.370
as your,
your,
um,
um,
note we'll explain.

623
00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:58.560
Um,

624
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.330
the poem really moves into a kind of opaque set of,

625
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.560
uh,
personal associations,
uh,

626
00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.600
when we were children staying at the arch dukes and so on.

627
00:47:11.601 --> 00:47:15.320
He took me out on a sled.
Uh,
these,

628
00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:19.250
these associations are meaningful and resonant and representative.

629
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:24.730
I think to the extent that they have a generic quality that is,

630
00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:29.890
uh,
not so much that they are our memories,

631
00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.170
but they're like memories.

632
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.180
They're like personal memories and they're like personal memories in their,

633
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:42.390
uh,
in their very,
um,
uh,

634
00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.810
the difficulty of translating and sharing them.
Uh,
there's,

635
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:51.470
there's a kind of,
uh,
Marie,
uh,
has a kind of exemplary privacy,
uh,

636
00:47:51.471 --> 00:47:56.450
about her and her,
uh,
memories,
uh,
and her sense of,

637
00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.450
uh,
frustrated,
frustrated,
desire and longing.

638
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.700
Um,
there is,
um,

639
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.010
more that's important about this.
First of the wasteland speakers.

640
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:15.170
Uh,
the,
uh,
well BIM guard kind of loosen,
uh,
is,
is,

641
00:48:15.171 --> 00:48:19.460
uh,
translated for us,
uh,
down below us.
I'm not a Russian women at all.

642
00:48:19.461 --> 00:48:24.410
I come from Lithuania,
therefore a true German,
uh,
the,
uh,

643
00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.273
this,
uh,

644
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.840
who is whoever is saying that exactly whether it's Marie or someone else,
uh,

645
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.700
seems to be speaking

646
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:33.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

647
00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.520
<v 0>Uh,
of a kind of,
um,
um,</v>

648
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:41.910
hybrid identity.
It kind of,
uh,
a Mongrel or duress donated,

649
00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.690
uh,
identity,
uh,
the,

650
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.360
<v 1>yeah,</v>

651
00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.830
<v 0>condition of</v>

652
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.920
walked in sensibility and,
and,
uh,
um,

653
00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:03.020
uh,
difficult,
uh,
private,
uh,
emotion,
uh,

654
00:49:03.021 --> 00:49:08.021
is from the very beginning of the poem associated with Metropolitan Culture,

655
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:13.310
a culture where,
uh,
there are many languages,
uh,

656
00:49:13.311 --> 00:49:17.330
speakers from many places,
uh,
and well to the,

657
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:22.460
um,
uh,
uh,
a culture where there are,
as it were,

658
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.230
a kind of cacophony of languages,
uh,
untranslated,
uh,

659
00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.050
existing and competing side by side.

660
00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:36.040
This is a kind of linguistic environment,
um,
that,
uh,

661
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.980
the wasteland is made out of a,
in is also in many ways about,
uh,

662
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.440
and is the,
the,
the real medium,
uh,
of,
uh,

663
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.400
experience in the poem.
Well,
uh,
let me stop here.
And,
uh,

664
00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:54.080
we will go on trying to,
uh,
make sense of,
uh,
uh,

665
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.770
this great modern poem on Monday.
