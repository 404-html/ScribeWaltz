1
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
For
Wednesday.

2
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.430
This is my,
our first Yates lecture.
We're going to have three of them,

3
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.480
uh,
for the next class.
I'd like you to,
um,

4
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
uh,
well,
uh,
I'd like you to do a few things.

5
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.890
Um,
I know that,
uh,

6
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.070
you're teaching fellows will have handed out a meter exercise for you.
Uh,

7
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.070
I'd like you to,
um,
uh,
working on something else.

8
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:51.900
You don't have to do this for Wednesday,
but let's say for next Monday.
Uh,

9
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.710
and that,
that is,
I'd like you to memorize a short poem by,
um,

10
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.760
Yates or by frost,
either one.
Uh,

11
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.600
and this poem could be the basis of a first paper,

12
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.340
a topic for one.
It doesn't have to be,
uh,
but it,
it might be an aisle.

13
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.230
On Wednesday.
I'll also handout,
um,
um,
a topic for paper one,

14
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.940
uh,
in,
in class.
I'll talk about,
uh,

15
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.050
eastern 1916,
uh,
the magpie,

16
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.550
the second coming later in the swan.
Uh,

17
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.670
and I'd like you to pay special attention to these special [inaudible] words to

18
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.940
molt turbulence,
be steel.
Uh,

19
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.820
think about also that phrase,
terrible beauty in eastern 1916.

20
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.390
Uh,
and finally in your Ras packet,
you'll see a,
a timeline,
um,

21
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.810
that,
uh,
um,
charts oh,

22
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.430
uh,
significant dates,
um,
in,

23
00:01:56.431 --> 00:02:01.330
in modern poetry that that tells you something about,
uh,
when,
uh,

24
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.430
the different poets were reading were working,
uh,
in helps you,

25
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.900
uh,
perhaps,
uh,
keep track of them because confusingly,

26
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.390
although the course has a kind of rough,
chronological order,
uh,
uh,

27
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.030
we do move back and forth in time.
Uh,

28
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:21.540
and in fact today,
right now,
uh,

29
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.160
we're going to move back the furthest we go,
uh,

30
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.190
all the way until the 19th century to talk about the early Yates Yates.

31
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:34.650
His career is,
is maybe the most famous one in modern poetry,

32
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.220
uh,
that is,
uh,
uh,
career,
uh,

33
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:40.560
that has been seen as a,

34
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:44.220
as a kind of representative story about modern poetry as a whole.

35
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.980
Uh,
what's that story?
Well,
uh,
Yates begins as a,

36
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:53.280
as a romantic visionary,
uh,
and,
uh,

37
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.460
I'm kind of late 19th century aesthete and under the pressure of political and

38
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.980
social crisis,

39
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.610
he breaks with the artificial rhetoric of his early poems and becomes a kind of

40
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:13.150
heroic realist.
Uh,
now there,

41
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.890
there's something,
uh,
to this story.
Uh,

42
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.650
but it is also a kind of cliche and,
and uh,

43
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.200
I'll try to try to introduce a,

44
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.460
I think a more true,
uh,

45
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.210
and also more interesting way of understanding Yates as development today

46
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.320
starting with this picture.
Uh,
this is,

47
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.790
this is an unlikely picture that the,
the face there,

48
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.590
uh,
if you,
uh,
have seen him before you will recognize as Yates is,

49
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.430
uh,
this is,
this is Yates,
uh,
as King Gall.

50
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.010
This is Yates in costume

51
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.710
costumes as a figure from Irish myth,
uh,

52
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.740
as an ancient bard,
a mad king gall,
uh,

53
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.740
which is,
which is the furthest thing from a modern poet.
Uh,

54
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:11.980
it's a late Victorian image of an archaic singer,

55
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.210
a rendered in the melodramatic manner of pre-raphaelite art and thoroughly

56
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:21.670
removed from the aesthetic values of modernism such as naturalism,

57
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:26.220
formal clarity,
emotional restraint,
and so on.
Uh,

58
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.870
it's an image that was created by Yates's father,
uh,

59
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.160
the painter John Yates.
Uh,

60
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.720
you could also say that it was created by the late 19th century culture that

61
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:42.130
Yates is father John represented and introduced to his son.

62
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.940
It's an image of Yates that modern poetry,
uh,

63
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:50.941
eventually forgot a Yates as an unmodern 19th century poet,

64
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.320
hamming it up.
Uh,
but this poet is in fact important,

65
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.120
uh,
to the one that Yates became.
Uh,
in a way,

66
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.520
Yates is always in costume.
Uh,

67
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740
his poetic identity is forged through identification with the heroic characters

68
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.920
of his poems,
uh,

69
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.660
characters who are sometimes surrogates for the poets such as King Gaul.

70
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.390
Now the warrior Coolin a or the mysterious Michael Rebar Taiz,

71
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.550
uh,
all characters,

72
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:32.551
you will meet a or who are sometimes simply versions of the poet himself.

73
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.290
Um,
that is,
uh,
uh,

74
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.910
the poet rendering himself for us in stylized roles.

75
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.990
That is Yates,
the public man,
Yates,
the lover,
Yates,

76
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.430
the mad old man.

77
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.270
A Yates is always creating himself in his poems,
uh,

78
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.260
and creating himself as a kind of a version of a type A.

79
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.150
And he does the same thing.
In fact to those around him,
uh,

80
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.320
famously to,
uh,
his lover,
Maude Gunn,

81
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.660
who becomes Helen of Troy,
uh,
in,

82
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.130
in no second Troy and in other poems,
uh,

83
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.150
the martyrs in the Easter rebellion of 1916 become ancient Irish warriors.

84
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.160
We'll talk about that next time.

85
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.710
There are many other instances of this kind of myth making a imagination that

86
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:28.820
Yates,
uh,
is always working with Yates,

87
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.950
takes on self,
consciously staged a identities,
uh,

88
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.290
requiring costumes,
uh,

89
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:41.291
any sees other people in similarly theatrical and mythic terms.

90
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.500
His poetry is in fact,
deeply autobiographical.
Uh,

91
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.100
but it doesn't necessarily help to,
to know that,
uh,
because his life is,

92
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.300
is not a reliable key for reading the poems.
Exactly.

93
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.260
Because he treated his life,
uh,
as art,
uh,

94
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.150
raising the particulars of his,
uh,
experience,
uh,
into,

95
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.820
uh,
well general symbols,
uh,

96
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.470
working the narrative of his life into a,
uh,
into,
into myth.

97
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.080
Uh,
this is,
uh,
a way of conceiving his activity as a poet.
Uh,

98
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:21.140
but it's also as we'll see,
a way of conceiving in fact,

99
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.830
culture and human history in general in Yates,

100
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.190
uh,
people are always,
uh,
particulars who are fitted to types,

101
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.900
which are new versions of old identities that travel across time.

102
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.180
Uh,
in a,
in a certain sense,
uh,

103
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.460
Yates I think really felt that he was King Gaul.

104
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.470
Now the story of Kangol is interesting.
It's a longish poem,

105
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.820
a not in your anthology,
but you can find it in the complete Yates.

106
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:57.470
And I've given you on this handout page,
uh,
just a couple,

107
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.180
uh,
stands stanzas from it.
Uh,
so you have a,
a sense of it.
Uh,

108
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.350
King Gall is as a mythical Irish ruler who goes mad in the heat of battle.

109
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.380
He becomes distracted by an inward fire,
uh,

110
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.470
that draws him into the woods where he wanders and sings full of unfulfilled

111
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.280
desire.
Uh,

112
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.370
finally he destroys his harp and the scene represented by Yates's fathers

113
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.930
portrait.
This story is,
uh,

114
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.710
a certain version of Yates's own early ambition to become a particular kind of

115
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:41.030
figure,
not an Irish king,
but in Irish poet,

116
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.350
which would mean consolidating in him sense in himself,

117
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:50.070
a sense of national identity and explaining that identity,
uh,

118
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.820
representing it,
embodying it in all senses,
uh,
uh,
um,

119
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.570
representing and embodying Irishness for an English speaking readership,

120
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.040
uh,
in Ireland,
but also in England and elsewhere.

121
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.740
The nationality of that identity is important.
That is Yates is Irishness.
Uh,

122
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.800
and so is Yates is audience.
Uh,

123
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.280
his ambition is to become the first major Irish poet writing in English.

124
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.620
Uh,
significantly.
Uh,
this picture of,

125
00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:28.440
of Yates is king gall was used as an illustration for his first appearance in an

126
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:29.670
English periodical,

127
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.830
a magazine of art and ideas called the leisure hour.
Uh,

128
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.150
you Yates is,
uh,
uh,
Yates,
bridges,

129
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.830
Irish and English cultures,
uh,
any is importantly Protestant,
uh,

130
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.430
with social and family ties to English life.

131
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.980
The ambition that I'm describing as it is a public and political one.

132
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.220
Uh,
but,
uh,
paradoxically,
perhaps for the young Yates,

133
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.080
this ambition drew him away from the social and political world,

134
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.120
uh,
into the charm.
The landscapes of Irish myth,

135
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.520
uh,
maybe in the same way or,
uh,
uh,
as king gall is,

136
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.360
is drawn away from,
lured away from battle,
uh,

137
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.770
to wander in the Irish would,

138
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:26.270
all of Yates' early poetry takes place in a symbolic mythic domain.

139
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.180
King galls madness in the destruction of his instruments are,
are perhaps,

140
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.020
uh,

141
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.020
warnings about the dangers of a poetry that would be confined to a symbolic

142
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.060
world,
uh,
as if to fully enter it,
uh,

143
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.580
to fully enter mythical world,
to write a kind of pure poetry,
uh,

144
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.470
that was archaic in,
in its aims and its sources.

145
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.790
This would be to go mad,
uh,

146
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.640
to give suede of dangerously inward passions,
uh,

147
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.590
that can't be satisfied to be cut off from the world,
uh,

148
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.800
being cut off from the world in some kind of higher or separate reality is a

149
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.740
lure and threat,
uh,
opened up,
uh,
for Yates by the,

150
00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:16.770
uh,
uh,
particular ambition,
uh,
uh,

151
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.880
that he had to write a mythic poetry on Irish themes.

152
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.230
Uh,

153
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.830
now something else a is worth highlighting about king gall,

154
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.090
uh,
as a way to understand who Yates was.
A KANGOL is a singer,

155
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.030
a identifying with him.
Uh,
Yates identifies poetry with song,

156
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.460
uh,
in particular,
uh,
with songs of passion,
uh,

157
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:47.820
in which songs in which sound takes over,
uh,

158
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.950
is ravishing and chanting.

159
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.120
Yates' early poetry has those aspects of song as its aim.

160
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.240
They suggest a verbal and an oral equivalents for the poetry's cognitive concern

161
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:09.880
with symbols that is,
uh,
in sound,

162
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.380
just as in theme.

163
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.600
Yates is poetry is idealized,
purified,

164
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.340
centrally rich,
uh,

165
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.790
and yet also abstract contrast.

166
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.810
Frost Yates is poetry dominated the poetry world in which frost began writing

167
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:34.231
and publishing a Yates publishes King Gall in the leisure hour.

168
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:35.830
Uh,

169
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.830
and frost mocks the Po mocks the ideal of poetry as the dream of the gift of

170
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.910
idle hours.
Uh,

171
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.840
he mocks the idea of poetry as easy gold,
uh,

172
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.860
at the hand of Fei or Elf in,
in mowing,
uh,

173
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.220
characters that,

174
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.140
that come right out of early Yates frosts realism,

175
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.950
uh,
his roughness,
which you,
which is part of his sensibility.

176
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:07.210
It's part of the sound of his poetry.
Um,
well,
uh,

177
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.860
it contrast quite directly with the,
uh,
uh,

178
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.670
smoothness,
uh,
uh,
sought by Yates and the,
the,

179
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:21.340
the kind of a simulation of,
of ease.
Uh,
you could,

180
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:26.230
you could go to,
um,
uh,
yeats's poem Adam's curse to see the poet,

181
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.370
um,
uh,
talking about this,
uh,

182
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.410
aesthetic ideal Yates,
uh,
there,
uh,

183
00:13:35.411 --> 00:13:38.400
in Adam's curse,
which is in your anthology,
uh,

184
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.260
cost specifically for,
for kind of a simulation of,

185
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.450
of ease,
uh,
in poetry,

186
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.600
which is a traditionally aristocratic ideal one which hides,

187
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.340
uh,
one's labor in order to make accomplishments seem natural.

188
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.490
Uh,
Yates,
a in Adam's curse,
uh,

189
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.470
regrets that the beautiful is something to be labored for.
Uh,

190
00:14:05.471 --> 00:14:08.260
any wants to conceal that Labor.
Uh,

191
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.710
the contrast with Frost is,
is this powerful.

192
00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.960
Gates once said that he wanted the natural words in the natural order,

193
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.440
but he had a very highly cultured sense of what is natural.
Uh,

194
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:28.270
and his poetry is,
is full of,
of verbal archaism.
Uh,

195
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.310
it's characterized by kind of high formal bearing.
Uh,
it's,

196
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:38.230
uh,
uh,
has a careful decor.
I'm a kind of high sheen,

197
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.990
especially this early poetry,
uh,

198
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.970
metrically Yates is,
uh,
uh,

199
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.650
attitudes result in a kind of superb regularity,
uh,

200
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.800
in early,
uh,
Yates.
You find smooth,
unbroken lines,

201
00:14:55.170 --> 00:15:00.070
diction that's elegant and seemingly easy,
uh,
without,
uh,
every,

202
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.590
every deigning to seem merely colloquial.
Uh,

203
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.580
the sound of Yates was,
uh,

204
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.810
and was meant to be seductive.
Uh,

205
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.020
the poems are in fact very often about,

206
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.810
about kinds of seduction.
A child,
a king,

207
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:22.123
the poet.

208
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.820
These figures are drawn away from society or from family towards secret sacred

209
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.890
places,
uh,
magical places of love,
uh,

210
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:38.920
that are frequently imaged in these poems as an island or the center of a wood,

211
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.500
uh,
in short,
uh,
places of privacy that,

212
00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:48.410
that shut the world out in that stand for Yates is ideal of poetic autonomy.

213
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.550
His desire to create and inhabit self-sufficient,

214
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.040
imaginative worlds.

215
00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.860
The lake isle of Innisfree who goes with Fergus,
uh,

216
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.920
the hosting of the,
she,
uh,
the,
these are all poems,
uh,

217
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.900
from your anthology that exemplify this,
uh,
idea.
Uh,

218
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.410
and there are many,
many more.
Um,
the,
uh,
these pumps,
uh,

219
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.050
come from a phase in the eights,
his career,

220
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.230
the climax of which is this book published in 1,899 that I showed you the cover

221
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:29.120
of,
and the first class,
the wind among the reeds with,

222
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:33.230
it's a gorgeous Celtic,
uh,
aestheticism,

223
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.690
uh,
here.
It's the,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

224
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.780
title page reminding us again that this gorgeous Celtic aestheticism,

225
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:49.070
uh,
is,
uh,
published and put up for sale in London.
Uh,

226
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.590
which is important again.
Uh,
and,
and here is a,

227
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.160
the table of contents which you can't read,
but has a on it.

228
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.050
Uh,
uh,
well,
the first poem,
the hosting of the,
she,

229
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:08.060
uh,
uh,
the,
a song of Wandering Angus,

230
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.220
uh,
and other,
uh,
famous palms from Yates is early career.

231
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.180
I'd like to look with you at the song,
the wandering Angus as a,

232
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:21.920
as a kind of model of the kind of poem I'm talking about.

233
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.300
And it's the aesthetics.
It's on Nine

234
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.203
<v 1>v eight.</v>

235
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.430
<v 0>He ate,
says,
I went out to the Hazelwood.</v>

236
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:39.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

237
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.950
<v 0>Gate says,
that is to say,</v>

238
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.990
Angus says it's a dramatic monologue for Angus.

239
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.010
I went out to the Hazelwood because a fire was in my head and cut and peeled a

240
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:59.880
hazel wand and hooked to Barry to a thread.

241
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.490
If you're having problems identifying I ambit pentameter,
this should,
well,

242
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:09.740
it's not,
not quite pentameter,
but if you want,
I want to get an eye Ambika um,

243
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.130
rhythm in your head.
This will do it.
Uh,
and cut and peeled.

244
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:19.131
A Hazel won and hook to Barry to a thread and when white mobs were on the wing

245
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.760
and moth like stars were flickering out,

246
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.660
I dropped the berry in a stream and caught a little silver trout

247
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.780
when I had laid it on the floor.
I went to blow the fire of flame,

248
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.610
but something wrestled on the floor and someone called me by my name.

249
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.330
It had become a glimmering girl with apple blossom in her hair,

250
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:54.230
who called me by my name and ran and faded through the brightening air.

251
00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.280
Though I am old with wandering through hollow lands and Healy Lands,

252
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.600
I will find out where she has gone and kiss her lips and take her hands and walk

253
00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:15.720
among long dappled grass and pluck till time.

254
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:19.920
And Times are done.
The silver apples of the moon,

255
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.860
the golden apples of the sun,

256
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.110
it's rhymed.

257
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.850
I am Vick Tet travitor four beats per line with some variations.

258
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.090
Uh,
it is a popular song form a in English.
Uh,

259
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.910
it's the way Puck,
uh,
and uh,
uh,
other,

260
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.110
um,
uh,
uh,

261
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.630
folk characters speak,
uh,
in Shakespeare.

262
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.080
It's smoothness in its simplicity,
uh,

263
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.490
is associated with folk forms.
Uh,

264
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.920
perhaps with the condition of enchantment,

265
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.420
we're trance into which the speaker Angus falls.

266
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.790
The poem is a fairy tale.

267
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.940
It's a story of Angus is longing and quest for union with a fairy girl whom he

268
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:16.570
desires.
Yates spoke of the poem as a mad song.
Uh,

269
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.490
that's maybe not I kind of mad song.
We would,
um,

270
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.760
we isn't that what we would think of as a mad song necessarily.

271
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.540
Uh,
the poem imagines,
uh,
through a dramatic character,

272
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:36.090
Yates his own coming to poetry,
which he represents here,

273
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:40.110
both as the undertaking of a specifically erotic quest,

274
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.200
uh,
and as a sort of fury in the mind,

275
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.770
a fire was in my head and gets begins.

276
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:52.120
Yates wants us to share in as we attend to the sound of his poem,

277
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.900
a certain state of enchantment and longing,

278
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.420
which includes a feeling of monotony.

279
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.680
As we listened to those repeated phrases and images and syntactic structures

280
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:08.380
that always seem on the verge of redundance in this poem,

281
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.590
I think about how generalized,
how abstract,

282
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:14.980
how unnatural nature is in this poem.

283
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.850
But then it's exactly a poem about nature transformed.
Uh,

284
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.380
the fish who turns into the glimmering girl who,
uh,

285
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.930
like any really marvelous cat gets away,

286
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.770
uh,
the transformation here,
uh,
importantly interrupts the eating of the fruit.

287
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.750
Consummation of desire is deferred.
Appetite,

288
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.340
gets sublimated and at the same time deferred held in suspension.

289
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.160
The glimmering girl then,
cause Angus by name,
she names him.

290
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:56.430
She in a sense makes him Angus Angus is the Celtic name.

291
00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.450
Uh,
the Celtic,
uh,
the Celtic master of love,

292
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.530
a certain kind of Irish version of Apollo.
Uh,

293
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.060
he's also a mortal who ages the palm,

294
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:12.890
describes a vocational moment,
uh,

295
00:22:12.891 --> 00:22:16.380
when the poet is called to his calling,
uh,

296
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:18.641
called to,

297
00:22:18.641 --> 00:22:22.810
it's calling in in a way that amounts to a kind of seduction that lures him out

298
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:25.490
into the woods wandering,
uh,

299
00:22:25.491 --> 00:22:30.050
as he follows this fish woman,
uh,
and fairy girl,
uh,

300
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.810
who is a kind of Muse or mother to,
uh,

301
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.170
the quest is without end.
It's even without direction.
Uh,

302
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:41.440
uh,
it has,
uh,
a goal,

303
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.950
however that's described in that last stanza,

304
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:51.250
contrast.
Yates is old age and the,
the,
the freshness of his desire in this poem,

305
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:57.190
uh,
he holds in dream the possibility of satisfied desire,

306
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.320
possession of the beloved,
meaning specifically physical possession of her,

307
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.830
which would be an apocalyptic event.

308
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:10.831
The end of time and times a Yates represents that moment of consummation as the

309
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:17.020
plucking of the silver and the gold apples.

310
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.580
Yates was chained in the occult disciplines of theosophy and Gnosticism.

311
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.640
Those,
uh,
traditions,
uh,

312
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.540
merge in his early work with European symbolism.
Uh,

313
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:36.541
and also with the Irish cultural national nationalism.

314
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.003
Here,

315
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.520
the gold and silver apples are specifically al chemical symbols of body and

316
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:47.280
soul,
uh,

317
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.300
and a kind of mystical image of a earthly paradise.

318
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.670
It's a nice touch.
Uh,
uh,
but don't worry about these symbols.

319
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.980
It don't worry about them too much.
Uh,

320
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.840
here as elsewhere in Yates is poetry.
Um,

321
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.160
it's not essential for you to be able to,
uh,

322
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:17.260
pursue his a cult learning and decode his symbols in order to read his poetry.

323
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.780
Uh,
Johanne Ramezani who is the editor of the Norton,
uh,

324
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.160
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
great Yates and uh,
uh,
he's,

325
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.670
he himself has decided that all of this is too much to explain and you don't

326
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:34.220
really need it.
Uh,
and fair enough.

327
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
The point is simply to recognize that the apples are a cult symbols,

328
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.250
uh,
which is to say they're not apples.
They are rather images,

329
00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.660
symbols,
artifacts,
uh,

330
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.950
and isn't that clear already from their colors,

331
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.700
the material that they're made of gold and silver.
Uh,

332
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.720
these colors mark them as fashioned precious objects,
inorganic,
uh,

333
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.710
and,
and all these ways beyond time in nature,

334
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.780
growth or decay when Angus or Yates,
uh,

335
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.700
pursue their desires,
the object of desire that is,
uh,
when they,

336
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:18.260
when they pursue a kind of hope for unity of being that the merging with the

337
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:23.261
beloved would constitute this carries them out of the natural world into a realm

338
00:25:23.721 --> 00:25:25.340
of high art of symbols.

339
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.660
The realization of desire for this young Yates is something only possible in art

340
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.740
in many ways.
Uh,
retained this aesthetic bias.

341
00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.760
Uh,
this is Yates,
uh,
rather,
uh,
later,
uh,

342
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:49.660
still dressed.
However,
uh,
in his study,
uh,
as,
uh,

343
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.700
an aesthete and dandy.
Uh,
you can see that,
that,
uh,
wonderful,
uh,

344
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.330
coat m and a silk bow tie.
Uh,

345
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.240
he began and ended his career as a decadent,
uh,

346
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.280
I suppose,
uh,

347
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.970
a reader of Walter pater and Oscar Wilde.

348
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.860
Uh,
nonetheless,
uh,
Oscar Wilde,
a friend of Yeats.

349
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:14.283
Nonetheless,

350
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:19.070
Yates is poetry does undergo an important and notable,

351
00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.320
a stylistic change.

352
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.640
When I said that there's a story about Yates is career that makes him out to be

353
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:29.990
an exemplary modern poet.
Uh,
I had in mind,
uh,

354
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:34.670
how over the course of this long career,
uh,
he leaves behind him,

355
00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:38.600
that idealized world of late 19th century art,
uh,

356
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.930
for a more fully human realist poetry.
Uh,

357
00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:47.790
one that rhetorically strips away Yates's own poetic systems,

358
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.530
uh,
and locates his subjects in contemporary politics and history.

359
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.200
This is,
this is the,
uh,
the,
the kind of,
uh,
uh,

360
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.070
generalized story of Yates has career pound.

361
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.110
Ezra pound is Yates is younger friend pound you'll see,

362
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:09.510
keeps turning up and all of these stories.
Uh,

363
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.180
he had a role in,

364
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:17.100
in pushing Yates in the direction in which he went.
Uh,

365
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.570
he had also a big role in public eighth of development.
Uh,

366
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.790
here's the,
a copy of a letter to pound by Yates,

367
00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:31.060
uh,
when they were both living in London.
Uh,

368
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.070
this is at the [inaudible],
uh,
among,
um,
pounds papers.

369
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.570
Um,
the,
uh,
oh,
here's the,
this is,
this is Yates is letter.
Uh,

370
00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.570
he's living at this point,
uh,
uh,
at,
uh,
uh,

371
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:49.760
Wellborn place.
Uh,
Yates is in London,
uh,

372
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.670
where one of the bombs went off in London two summers ago.

373
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.960
A write up right outside his house.
My dear pound here is the poem.

374
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.030
Many thanks for

375
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.500
taking so much trouble with it.
Yours,

376
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.550
a WB Yeats,
uh,

377
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.060
pound goes to work on Yates.
Uh,
it goes to work on his,
uh,

378
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.630
poetry and helps modernize him.
Uh,

379
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:19.890
although I think in lots of ways the influence went just as much.
The other way,

380
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.640
the period of pounds influenced,

381
00:28:22.641 --> 00:28:26.950
coincides with Yates is significantly titled Book,
uh,

382
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.070
representation of skin representations,
responsibilities rather.
Uh,

383
00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:34.680
this is published in 1914,

384
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.420
which is the same year as frosts north of Boston.

385
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.820
And these two books are coming out the same moment in London.
Uh,

386
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.920
some of the poems in this book dramatize a dramatize and describe the stylistic

387
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:55.950
changes I'm talking about.
For instance,
uh,
the short poem,
a coat.

388
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:00.720
Uh,
here it is.
It's in your,
um,

389
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.180
anthology as well.

390
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.390
I made my song a coat covered with embroidery's out of old mythologies from heel

391
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:12.330
to throat.
But the fool caught it,

392
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.770
wore it in the world's eye as though they'd brought it song.

393
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.720
Let them take it for there's more enterprise in walking naked.

394
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.710
This is a,
uh,

395
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.040
Yates's Yates is throwing off his early work as if throwing off a kind of

396
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:35.460
costume.
All that King Golf crap that he had on,
he sees tossing it off.

397
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.490
Uh,
the embroidery and decoration,

398
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.800
all that now seems inauthentic.
Uh,

399
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.330
something that in fact the aids his audience had failed to value properly.

400
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:48.130
He's complaining here in this poem,

401
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.540
a short poem he's referring to.
Um,
the,
uh,

402
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.240
uh,
vexed efforts,
uh,
by himself.

403
00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.840
Uh,
and,
uh,
his collaborators,

404
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.740
JM sing and Lady Augusta Gregory,
uh,

405
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:10.450
to create an Irish national theater.
Uh,

406
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.370
Yates,
uh,
sought a popular audience for his poetry,

407
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:20.170
uh,
impart through,
uh,
his work in the theater.

408
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.240
Buddy became disenchanted with the theater going public,
uh,

409
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.860
with imitators and detractors to,
uh,

410
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:34.430
all of whom as he puts it here,
caught at his coat.
Uh,

411
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:39.450
this is a poem that declares nakedness as a,

412
00:30:39.551 --> 00:30:44.050
as a poetic,
uh,
as a point of value.
Uh,

413
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.740
it's a kind of semi official announcement,
but Yates is,

414
00:30:46.741 --> 00:30:49.840
is giving up his early manner,
uh,

415
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.330
precisely because it seems like a manner,
uh,

416
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.130
and a disguise in doing so.

417
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:03.330
Yates might've seemed to be moving closer to the Irish people in a move,

418
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:09.040
something like frosts for swearing of the poetry of dream,

419
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.970
uh,

420
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.970
and elves and fairies in favor of a poetry of fact,

421
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.770
uh,
in,
and,
uh,

422
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.800
let's keep in mind for us own wish to create a poetry that would reach ordinary

423
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:31.510
people,
uh,
and would reach,
uh,
uh,

424
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.480
all kinds and sorts.
Uh,
again,

425
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.820
it might seem that Yates,
uh,
is interested in something like this too.

426
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.291
And again,

427
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:46.220
the same moment that that frost is publishing his work in,
uh,

428
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:49.840
England,
but there's a difference in Yates.

429
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.680
He adopts this ideal of nakedness precisely,

430
00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.760
uh,
as a repudiation of a popular audience.

431
00:32:00.761 --> 00:32:05.680
It's a kind of dare,
uh,
demonstrating not just his indifference to the crowd,

432
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:09.010
but in fact is scorn for it.
I'm going to walk naked.

433
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.110
I'm not going to dress for you.
Uh,

434
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.700
Yates' early poetry is elite,
uh,

435
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.280
because it is high aristocratic,
uh,
uh,

436
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.260
ideal in character.
The middle poetry,

437
00:32:23.261 --> 00:32:28.261
the poetry that begins with the volume responsibilities remains elite.

438
00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.840
Uh,
only now it's a lead is and will be expressed differently.

439
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:37.020
It will be expressed in a rhetoric of nakedness or what Yates we'll also call

440
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.433
coldness.

441
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.223
<v 1>Uh,</v>

442
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.813
the fishermen.

443
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.600
<v 0>The fishermen is another poem from this volume,
uh,</v>

444
00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.320
that both comments on and,
and,
uh,

445
00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:03.350
exemplifies the transformation that I'm describing.

446
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.790
Uh,
the transformation of [inaudible] style and values.

447
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.513
Um,

448
00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:19.010
it's suggests both the difference between the earlier Yates and the Middle

449
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.140
Yates,
uh,
but also,
uh,
importantly the kinds of continuity between them,

450
00:33:25.141 --> 00:33:28.410
the ways in which Yates remained very much the same poet.

451
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.750
Let me read it for you.

452
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.093
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

453
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:39.480
<v 0>Although I can see him still.</v>

454
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:45.810
The freckled man who goes to a gray place on a hill in gray,

455
00:33:45.811 --> 00:33:47.250
Connemara close

456
00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.300
at dawn to cast his flies.

457
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.890
It's long since I began to call up to the eyes this wise and simple man

458
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:05.210
all day I'd looked in the face what I had hoped to would be to write for my own

459
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:12.750
race.
And the reality,
the living men that I hate,

460
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:18.510
the dead man,
that I loved,
the crave and man in his seat,

461
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.860
the insolent unwrap proved in no nave brought to book who has won the drunk and

462
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:30.770
cheer the Witty Man and his joke aimed at the commonest ear

463
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.510
and the clever man who cries the catch cries of the clown.

464
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.520
The beating down of the wise and great art beaten down

465
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:48.590
well Yates begins in scorn of an audience that's unable to recognize true wisdom

466
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.340
and great art.

467
00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:55.743
<v 1>Uh,</v>

468
00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:00.950
<v 0>in scoring of that audience,
uh,
he imagines another audience,</v>

469
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:06.250
another audience to write for and to emulate and audience represented by the

470
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:12.830
fishermen.
Uh,
what is the fishermen like?

471
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:18.800
What does he represent?
Uh,
what,
what,
uh,
values does he embody

472
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.980
grayness,
uh,
grayness,
uh,

473
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:29.900
that suggests the color of a land,
uh,
and uh,
culture.
Uh,

474
00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:34.520
the color of stone,
uh,
of peasant close,

475
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.440
uh,
he,
the fishermen,
uh,

476
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.220
is a solitary figure in,

477
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:45.990
in a landscape of stone stone that is dark,

478
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.640
uh,
resistant,
uh,
apparently non ideal.

479
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:56.010
That is real,
uh,
contrast this place,

480
00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.390
this way of imagining Ireland.
Ireland means,
uh,

481
00:36:00.391 --> 00:36:03.430
with the sensual landscape of Angus,
uh,

482
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.650
with the reality of the world of that earlier poem.

483
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:13.420
Uh,
in a sense,
the earlier poem,
the Song of Wandering Angus,
uh,

484
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.580
transformed,
uh,
the Irish landscape into a place of myth

485
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.930
in the same way that the poem is

486
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.030
describing the transformation of the trout into the girl

487
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.810
Yates seems to be reversing this trick in the fishermen,

488
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.300
uh,
seems to be converting myth back into reality.
Uh,

489
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.910
the ideal object of desire,
uh,

490
00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:45.510
from a glimmering girl back into a trout.

491
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:51.390
It's a,
the poem represents a kind of,
uh,
as,
as the,
the short poem,

492
00:36:51.391 --> 00:36:55.920
a coat represents a kind of ascetic move,
inactive,

493
00:36:55.921 --> 00:37:00.921
imaginative in rhetorical stripping down the landscape itself,

494
00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.140
uh,
in,
um,
here in,

495
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:07.410
in yeats's poem seems naked,

496
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:13.070
a barren probably until Ebel.
Uh,

497
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.020
and the poetry that Yates wants from this place,
uh,

498
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.750
will be as it seems as he goes on to describe cold,

499
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:25.620
uh,
and passionate.
Let me finish the poem here.

500
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.040
Maybe a 12 month sense.

501
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:34.430
Suddenly I began in scoring of this audience that Yates has been describing,

502
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.320
this audience associated with the double and middle class and theater going

503
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:43.620
public in scorn of this audience.
Uh,

504
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.890
I began imagining a man and his son freckled face and gray Connemara cloth

505
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.300
climbing up to a place where stone is dark under froth in the downturn of his

506
00:37:57.841 --> 00:38:02.010
wrist.
When the flies drop in the stream,

507
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.980
a man who does not exist,

508
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.700
a man who is but a dream and cried before I'm old,

509
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:15.750
I shall have written him one poem.
Maybe it's cold and passionate as the dawn,

510
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.630
the poetry that,
that,
uh,
Yates wants from this place,

511
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.040
place that the fishermen takes him to,
uh,
is a,
uh,

512
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.340
it's going to be cold and,
and passionate as he describes it.

513
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.500
You can see him in a sense.

514
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.450
It's a cooling the fire in the head of Angus,

515
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.270
uh,
at this moment,
uh,

516
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:48.271
the palm identifies also cold and passion with dawn.

517
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.000
Uh,
the moment of awakening,
which is also a moment of,

518
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.350
of coming into reality from,
from dream and,
and sleep.

519
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.683
Uh,

520
00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:07.340
Yates is the kind of rhetorical and stylistic transformation I'm describing,

521
00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.880
uh,
uh,
identified with,
with Yates as modernness,
uh,
his,

522
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:17.070
his coming into a modernity.
All Ha ha,

523
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:21.850
Ha has these qualities,
uh,
in,
as associated here.
You powerfully with,

524
00:39:21.851 --> 00:39:22.684
with morning

525
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.140
importantly though,
uh,

526
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:31.660
morning and dawn are also seen as moments of passionate,

527
00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:36.970
uh,
if Angus is a figure of passion.

528
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.330
So interestingly is the fishermen.

529
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.930
It's only what it means to,
uh,

530
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.080
to write a poetry of passion that Yates is now beginning to rethink.

531
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.230
Passion seems to lie and coldness rather than heat,

532
00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.900
uh,
lies exactly in the restraining,

533
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.530
in disciplining of passion.
Uh,

534
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.230
in this sense,
uh,

535
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:13.260
the fishermen is not after all a poem that's very different from the song of

536
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:16.660
wandering Angus.
In fact,

537
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.070
Yates is still writing about a solitary fishermen.

538
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:26.110
And,
uh,
just as in that earlier palm,

539
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.340
the act of fishing is symbolically resonant.

540
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.960
The fishermen is an image of man,
uh,
uh,

541
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.670
searching the depths of the world for the wisdom that hides beneath the surface

542
00:40:39.671 --> 00:40:44.620
of things.
Uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

543
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.480
uh,
uh,

544
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.250
fishing is seen here as in the earlier poem as an image of quest,

545
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.540
uh,
in a,
uh,
uh,
an image of desire

546
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:02.510
for all these reasons.
Uh,
the fishermen is really a rewriting,
uh,
and,

547
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.890
uh,

548
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.890
even a kind of a continuation rather than a repudiation of the song of wandering

549
00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:14.980
Angus.
And the poems from that period,
uh,

550
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.860
in fact,
uh,
as Yates declares

551
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.340
the fishermen does not exist.
It's a wonderful sentence,
isn't it?

552
00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.460
Uh,
a man who does not exist,
a man who is,

553
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:34.400
but a dream Yates is still writing dream.

554
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.800
Uh,
uh,
the man is not a real man.

555
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:44.530
The man is a symbol only this time,
a symbol of the real,

556
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:50.190
a symbol of the actual and local of the Irish race in the reality and the poetry

557
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:55.340
that he stands for,
that the fishermen stands for it like all of Yates.

558
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:59.230
His poetry is a poetry again,
of symbols.

559
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.140
Uh,
the fishermen is also representative of the Irish peasant tree,

560
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.350
uh,
to,
to whom Yates turns,
uh,

561
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.630
in scorn of the urban audience that he had tried to write for in the theater.

562
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:20.300
This is again,
not a break with the aristocratic values of the early poetry,

563
00:42:20.301 --> 00:42:25.301
but at an aligning of those values with an ideal image of the peasant classes,

564
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.700
uh,
with whom,
uh,
Yates,
uh,

565
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.650
creates a kind of imaginative bond against the bourgeois people who seem to

566
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:36.320
represent the new order of things.
Uh,

567
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:41.290
modernity a and Dublin,
uh,
Yates,

568
00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.280
a sense of,
of,
uh,
um,
uh,
of modern history,

569
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.130
uh,
uh,
of the crisis of his,
uh,
uh,

570
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:54.040
this is something we can describe,
uh,

571
00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.000
and explore next time and eastern 1916.
Uh,

572
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:03.610
before we finish today,
uh,
let me just,
uh,

573
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:04.603
connect

574
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.240
the fishermen and it's a images of a cold passion,
uh,

575
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:15.910
to,
um,
uh,
another,
um,

576
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.870
poem.
Um,
the,
uh,

577
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.070
uh,
um,
well,
specifically the,
um,
uh,

578
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.820
log for Robert Gregory.
Uh,
yeah,
it's,
it's,
um,

579
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.600
a friend,
Augustus Gregory's son,
uh,
who,
uh,

580
00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:43.880
uh,
uh,
dies in the first world war.

581
00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.680
An airman,
a Yates,
uh,

582
00:43:48.681 --> 00:43:53.610
here,
uh,
evokes Gregory as a kind of,
um,

583
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.790
uh,
fallen,
uh,

584
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:04.570
representative of Irish culture and of Aristocratic Culture in particular,

585
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:10.880
uh,
in which art and eloquence and,

586
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.110
uh,

587
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:16.700
political and cultural life all coexist.

588
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.820
And all,
uh,

589
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.910
combine and form a passionate heart.

590
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.370
Um,
Yates,
uh,

591
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:32.390
evokes Gregory's death and,
and sees,
uh,

592
00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:36.080
it,
uh,
in relation to,
uh,
other,
uh,

593
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:40.410
friends and collaborators of,
uh,
Yates as early life,

594
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.570
including Lionel Johnson and sing,
uh,
uh,
and,
and others.

595
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.400
Um,
this is,
uh,
uh,
again,
uh,
Gregory representing a kind of,

596
00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.580
uh,
aristocratic,
uh,
elegance,
uh,
and,

597
00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:00.840
and a culture that is,
uh,
juxtaposed to,

598
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:04.100
will be juxtaposed to the,
uh,
um,

599
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.270
revolutionary violence that,
um,
uh,
comes to

600
00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:15.360
shatter the Irish capital,
uh,
in,
uh,

601
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.110
1916.
Uh,

602
00:45:17.111 --> 00:45:22.111
and in many ways a reshape Yates his career as he,

603
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.110
uh,
encounters,
uh,
what he calls a,

604
00:45:26.111 --> 00:45:30.870
the terrible beauty of that.
Um,
uh,
uh,

605
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:36.090
explosive,
uh,
rebellion.
Well,
uh,
that's enough for today.
Uh,

606
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:41.010
and we'll continue with EHS on Wednesday.
