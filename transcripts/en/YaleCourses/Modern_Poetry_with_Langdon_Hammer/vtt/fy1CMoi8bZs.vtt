1
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.100
Let's see.
Uh,
I'm,
you're a handout.
I,

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.840
I have Yates on the subject of magic.
This,
this goes back in time,

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.720
uh,
from the,
uh,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
text we were discussing last time in the teens and twenties to 1901.

5
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:21.891
And I wanted to a introduce it to you as some of Yeats is reflections on the

6
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:29.820
general question of,
uh,
the occult and of,
uh,

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.040
the,
um,
uh,
symbolic,
uh,
in his poetry,

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.970
um,

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.970
kind of preparation in his thinking for some of the poems we discussed last

10
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:44.160
time,
such as the second coming.
Uh,
he says,

11
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:48.030
I believe in the practice and philosophy of what we have agreed to call magic,

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.500
uh,
and what I must call the evocation of spirits,

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
though I do not know what they are.
That's important.

14
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:02.030
I think in,
you remember Yates in the second coming,
uh,
you know,

15
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.200
there's a beast that's coming because know what it is.
Uh,
and,

16
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.070
and here he's saying something similar and he says,
uh,

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.100
also speaks of his belief in the power of creating magical illusions in the

18
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:17.160
visions of truth,
in the depths of the mind when the eyes are closed.

19
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.650
Uh,

20
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.580
and I believe in three doctrines which he will conveniently put forward for us.

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.070
One,
uh,

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.850
that the borders of our mind and he has that and the singular there are ever

23
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.851
shifting and that many minds can flow into one another as it were.

24
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.660
That's probably an important,
uh,
uh,
qualification,
uh,

25
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.720
and create or reveal a single mind,
a single energy in effect at work in our,

26
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.370
our common imaginations that the borders of our minds are shifting.

27
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.190
Uh,

28
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.070
and that our memories are part of one great memory when he calls the memory of

29
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.150
nature herself.

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.670
And this is the most important thing that this great mind and great memory,

31
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:07.470
this kind of unitary repitoire of,
of,

32
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.690
uh,
uh,
uh,

33
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
spirits and memories can be evoked by symbols.
Uh,

34
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:18.390
is this something poetry can activate and,
and,
uh,
draw upon,

35
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
uh,
that Spiritus Mundi that,

36
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.740
that a Yates refers to in the second coming?
Well,

37
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:29.500
this is Yates talking about that idea here.
Uh,

38
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.720
it is something as he stresses that can be evoked by symbols,

39
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:38.460
by poetic symbols in this he intends to do in his,
in his poetry.

40
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.910
Uh,
in fact,
Yates sees,
uh,
um,

41
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.570
his poems as a kind of summoning of spirits or evocation of spirits as he refers

42
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:52.650
to it.
Uh,

43
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.680
last time I talked just briefly about Yates is interest in automatic writing,

44
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.870
a practice that he engaged in with his wife.
Uh,

45
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.920
well,
his poems,
uh,
themselves have a cult dimension,
uh,

46
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.700
of,
uh,
uh,
evoking,
um,
this great mind,

47
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.930
uh,
and the spirits contained there in through symbols.

48
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.130
He also stresses that the borders of our minds and of individual identity are

49
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.910
ever shifting and unstable.
Uh,
and that,

50
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.570
um,
well behind all of these ideas I think is,

51
00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:35.650
is a sense of,
um,
uh,

52
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.651
the poet as a figure who channels in his life as well as in his writing,

53
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.990
uh,
channels,
spirits and presences,

54
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.950
uh,
and voices,
uh,
importantly.
Uh,

55
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:55.840
and this is related to two.
Yates is idea that the poet,

56
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.900
and this is something he wrote about in the pros I asked you to read for today,

57
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.420
that the poet is more type than man.
Uh,
on eight 84,
uh,

58
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.520
late in his life,
uh,

59
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.560
writing a kind of a summary comment on his work.
For the,
uh,

60
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.810
uh,
collected edition being produced by the publisher Scribner's.

61
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.063
Uh,
he,

62
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.110
he writes a certain important summary propositions about his work,

63
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:30.400
but about poetry in general.
And he says on eight 84,
a poet writes,

64
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.290
always have his personal life in his finest work out of its tragedies,

65
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.110
whatever it may be,
remorse,
loss,
love are mere loneliness.

66
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.860
He never speaks directly as to someone at the breakfast table.

67
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.710
There is always a phantasmagoria.

68
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.030
Dante and Milton had mythologies,
Shakespeare,
the characters of English,

69
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.910
history of traditional romance and so on.
Uh,

70
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.430
he says,
um,
uh,
the,

71
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.320
the writer is more type than man,
more passion than type P is lear,

72
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.430
Romeo,
Oedipus,
Tyree,
CEUs.
He has stepped out of a play.

73
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.410
And even the woman,
he loves his Rosalind Cleopatra,
never the dark lady.

74
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.480
Uh,
well,
uh,

75
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.540
he is part of his own phantasmagoria and we adore him because nature has grown

76
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.360
intelligible.
And by doing so,
uh,
uh,

77
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.940
we,
we apprehend a part of our creative power,
uh,

78
00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:32.560
in the poet and in his work,
nature grows intelligible.

79
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.630
This is an important idea for a Yates.
Uh,

80
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.840
and it suggests that though life is rooted,
or excuse me,

81
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:45.210
that work is rooted in life for a Yates.
It's always a,

82
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.820
a life transformed,
uh,
uh,

83
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.990
fed through this phantasmagoria that he's,
he's discussing,
uh,

84
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.100
which is important because,
uh,
at once,

85
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.070
Yates is insisting on,
on,
uh,
uh,
on,

86
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.300
on the personal nature of,
uh,

87
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.130
his poetry and have the experience it offers.

88
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.690
And yet he's also interestingly,
uh,
uh,
um,
uh,

89
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.250
curiously impersonal,
a figure,
a impersonal poet.

90
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:21.230
On eight 87,
he says towards the,
uh,
uh,
top of the,

91
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.460
uh,
page,
um,
uh,

92
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.430
he says,
um,

93
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.190
talk to me of originality and I will turn on you with rage.

94
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.580
I am a crowd.
I'm a lonely man.

95
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.960
I am nothing ancient.
Salt is best packing.

96
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.780
Uh,
uh,
the,

97
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:47.840
the heroes of Shakespeare conveyed to us through their looks or through their

98
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.860
metaphorical patterns of speech,
the sudden enlargement of their vision,

99
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.660
their ecstasy at the approach of death,
uh,
and,
and so on.

100
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.720
And this is the kind of,
um,
uh,

101
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.280
impersonal channeling of,
uh,
emotion that,
um,

102
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.980
uh,
Yates himself,

103
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:11.930
a kind of actor in his poetry wishes to convey,

104
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.410
uh,
on your,
on your handout,
there's another,

105
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.060
a quotation from late in Yates,
his life that I wanted to emphasize.

106
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.870
He says,
and here's that [inaudible] word all again.
He says,

107
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.380
when I try to put all into a phrase,
I say,

108
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.250
man can embody truth,
but he cannot know it.

109
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.520
Man can embody truth,
but he cannot know it.
I must embody it.

110
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.200
And the completion of my life,

111
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.210
the abstract is not life in everywhere draws out its contradictions.

112
00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:52.211
You can refute Hagle but not the saint or the song of experience.

113
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.430
And it's a wonderful claim.
You can,

114
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.250
you can refute Hagle but not a,

115
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:01.720
the saint or the song of experience.
Um,

116
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.800
man can embody truth but cannot know it.

117
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.700
This is,
this is a important formulation.

118
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.220
I think of it as a kind of reply to that famous question in later.

119
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.740
And the Swan,
uh,
that is,

120
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.890
did she put on his knowledge with his power before the indifferent beak could

121
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.710
let her drop?
Uh,

122
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.100
the answer that Yates is giving here is different from saying either yes or no

123
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:40.820
to that question.
Uh,
it's more,
uh,
like saying yes and no.

124
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.680
I think truth is something to be embodied in Yates,

125
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.140
uh,
embodied rather than known,
uh,

126
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.790
embodied in the sense of lived,
uh,

127
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.400
not merely understood but experienced.

128
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.890
But also I think embodied because it is specifically a thing of the body and

129
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.560
involves an experience of the body.
Uh,

130
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:08.010
as much as we're more than the mind,
uh,

131
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.920
what kind of knowledge,
if any,

132
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400
can be had from the shattering experiences of revolution or rape?

133
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.800
Uh,
those models of history that I proposed last time,
remember how,

134
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.250
uh,

135
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.250
how Yates represents history as rape in late in the Swan,

136
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.010
uh,
he sees it there as an experience of violence,
uh,

137
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.170
of sexual violence involving the intercourse of opposites of God and man,

138
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.420
a eternity and time,
male and female,

139
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.690
the will and patterning force of the one thing against the other imposed on it

140
00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:51.870
by brute force.

141
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.430
What kind of knowledge can be had from that experience?
Uh,

142
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.220
late in the swan seems to say a knowledge of the body.
Uh,

143
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.010
of the necessity of embodiment,
uh,
in,

144
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.740
in,
in the late Yates,
in the poems that I'll be discussing today.
Uh,

145
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.700
there's no knowledge apart from the body.
Uh,
and this is,

146
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:22.560
this is something to contrast with the early Yates and it's high idealism,

147
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.270
uh,
and it's,
um,
uh,
it's drive to,
uh,

148
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.490
exist in an abstract,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

149
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.540
ideal world.
The late Yates,
uh,

150
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:41.110
this is a poetry,
uh,
written,
uh,
in age,
uh,

151
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:45.250
and written about age and aging,
uh,

152
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.220
age scene and,

153
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.250
and experienced as the failure and corruption of the body to which the soul is

154
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:58.020
bound,
uh,
in,
in sailing to Byzantium,

155
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.290
uh,
kind of transitional poem.
Two,
two later Yates,

156
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.740
uh,
on,
on one 23 in your book,
um,

157
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.970
Yeats says an aged man is but a paltry thing,

158
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.360
a tattered coat upon a stick.

159
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:21.350
Unless soul clap its hands and Lao and sing and louder sing for every tatter and

160
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.860
its mortal dress

161
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.940
poet speaks of his soul there as,
um,

162
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.311
uh,
as,

163
00:11:35.311 --> 00:11:40.311
as sick with desire and fastened to a dying animal that is the body.

164
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.970
And yet for all of it,
but complaints about the body,
uh,
here in this poem.
And,

165
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:52.770
and,
and,
and in other late,
yeah,
the poet doesn't,

166
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.790
it doesn't reject that dying animal,
uh,
doesn't scoring it.

167
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.030
Uh,
instead,
Yates affirms,
it,
affirms the body,
uh,

168
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.310
in its corrupt state.
Uh,

169
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.680
he in fact sings and sings louder for it.

170
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:14.390
In this late poetry,
uh,

171
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.360
sings louder as he puts it for every tatter in the soul's mortal dress.

172
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.660
Uh,
this is the extraordinary energy of,

173
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.730
of Yates is late poetry a,

174
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:32.290
what he calls the word he has for the energy of this,

175
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:32.950
uh,

176
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:37.950
poetry and have this attitude towards life is joy or Gaiety,

177
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.510
uh,
words that recur throughout these poems.
Joy,

178
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.840
gaiety or sometimes madness.
Uh,
their,

179
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:51.841
their joy and gaiety are both states of mind associated with madness.

180
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.860
Uh,
in,
in these poems,

181
00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:00.090
the body's truth felt as an experience of joy or of Gatti is arrived at through

182
00:13:02.351 --> 00:13:06.970
a kind of a shattering of the body and an of the rational mind.

183
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:12.040
And it's working.
Um,
Gaddy,
uh,

184
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:17.070
for Yates seems to represent some reconstitution of,

185
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.860
of mind and body,
uh,
some experience of their unity,
uh,

186
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.890
out beyond an experience of tragedy and grief.

187
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.250
Uh,
this is a,
a point of view specifically associated in,

188
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:38.251
in gates is late poetry with old men and with women particularly,

189
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:42.880
but not only old women.
Uh,
he says,
uh,

190
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:46.900
on eight 86 back in that general introduction from my work,

191
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.640
uh,
we,
eh,
this is interesting.

192
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:55.770
He's talking here about the kind of style he wishes to,
um,

193
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.430
create in poetry,
which involves for him,
uh,

194
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:02.000
uh,
uh,

195
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.270
making the language of poetry coincide with that of passionate normal speech.

196
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.580
He says,
I wanted to write and this a version of Frost's ambition,
uh,

197
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.470
though conducted differently.

198
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.810
I want to write in whatever language comes most naturally when we soliloquies as

199
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:24.370
I do all day long upon the events of our own lives or in any life where we can

200
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:25.540
see ourselves for the moment.

201
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.820
I sometimes compare myself with myself with the old man,

202
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.900
old slum women.

203
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.040
I hear denouncing and remembering how dare you,

204
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.540
I heard one of them say to imaginary sooner,
and you without health their home,

205
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.630
if I spoke,
my thoughts allow,
they might be as angry and as wild.

206
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.030
Uh,

207
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.850
so this is a kind of model for the late Yates in,

208
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.420
uh,
poetry,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

209
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:01.190
the voice of the angry and wild slum woman.

210
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.080
Well,
uh,
in order to,
uh,

211
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:08.600
get at this style in action and the eight says late poems.

212
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:13.480
I want to look back a little bit,
uh,
at a,
uh,

213
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:19.100
a poem that looks back on Easter 1916.
Uh,

214
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:22.690
the palm I discussed last time as well as,
uh,

215
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.480
uh,
excuse me,
as well as the hates his

216
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.030
own earlier poetry.

217
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.770
And that is the palm called in memory of Eva Gore booth and cotton Markowitz.

218
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.450
On page one 26.

219
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.970
It's a kind of postscript to Easter 1916,
uh,

220
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
written in 1929 con markets was the only surviving leader of the Easter rising a

221
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:57.370
condemned to death.
But then her sentence was transmute,
uh,
trans,
uh,

222
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.420
what is it done?
Yeah,
thank you.
Commuted,
not transmit it.

223
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.780
Um,
uh,
well,
uh,

224
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.690
con Markowitz is in a sense of figure like later,
uh,

225
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.750
she is someone who has suffered the traumatic violence that in genders history

226
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.570
a Yates is allergy here.
Uh,
uh,

227
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.740
recalls her youth and that if her sister,

228
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.400
both friends of the younger Yates,
uh,
Eva Gore booth,
uh,

229
00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:34.820
youth spent uh,
in the slag oh mansion Lyssa Dell,
uh,

230
00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:37.880
where Yates visited in 1894.
Uh,

231
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.850
at that point the eighth was 1894.

232
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.880
Yates is 29 and the two women were slightly younger.

233
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.450
Let me read the beginning of it.
The light of evening.

234
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.113
Alyssa Dell,

235
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.970
great windows open to the south to girls in Silk Kimonos.

236
00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.120
Both beautiful one a gazelle.

237
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:03.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

238
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.910
<v 0>But a raving autumn sheers blossom from the summer's wreath.</v>

239
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.930
The older is condemned to death,
pardoned,

240
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.980
drags out lonely years conspiring among the ignorant.

241
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:16.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

242
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.310
<v 0>I know not what the younger dreams,</v>

243
00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:23.311
some vague utopia and she seems when withered old and skeleton gaunt an image of

244
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:27.830
such politics.

245
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

246
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.820
<v 0>Many a time I think to seek one or the other out in speak of that old Georgian</v>

247
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:39.000
mansion mix pictures of the mind.

248
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:44.001
Recall that table and the talk of youth to girls in Silk Kimonos,

249
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:48.870
both beautiful one,
a gazelle

250
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.450
here,

251
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.450
female beauty 19th century manners and aristocratic culture are all held

252
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:01.830
together as if expressing each other,
uh,
and,

253
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:04.620
and associated with each other.
Uh,

254
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.920
Yates is nostalgic.
Vision of them is charmed,
uh,

255
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.560
and static interestingly static.
Uh,

256
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.710
see how the verb is withheld in the first sentence of the poem.

257
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.420
And then in the closing lines of that first strokey,

258
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.240
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,
well,
uh,
W W in,

259
00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.160
in order to give us that image to girls and Silk Kimono,

260
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:37.050
both beautiful one a gazelle,
which he returns to.
Uh,
it's,

261
00:18:37.051 --> 00:18:42.051
it's as if the action itself are being withheld from the charmed world,

262
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.550
uh,
in time slowed down or even stopped,
uh,

263
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.240
making a picture,
an image,
a Haiku.
Uh,

264
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.240
but all of this is overthrown,
changed utterly,
uh,

265
00:18:57.241 --> 00:19:02.241
by the radical politics that altered Ireland during Yates is lifetime than

266
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:05.470
announced the coming of modernity.
Uh,

267
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:10.510
and that these two women themselves participated in a centrally politics,

268
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:15.150
makes them ugly to Yates.
Uh,

269
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:18.960
it's as if they might have maintained their beauty had they only refrained from

270
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:23.940
it.
Uh,
you,
you could look at a similar attitude in a prayer for my daughter.
Uh,

271
00:19:23.941 --> 00:19:26.140
another,
uh,
important,
uh,

272
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.780
big Yeats poem from a slightly earlier,
uh,

273
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.540
where it says an intellectual hatred is the worst.

274
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.190
So let her think.
His daughter,
that opinions are a cursed,
uh,

275
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.160
women shouldn't have them.
Uh,
this is not an attractive side of the aids,

276
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.540
uh,
at least for,
for,
uh,
people of our moment,
uh,
and Sensibility.

277
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.040
Uh,
it,
there's a kind of,
um,
uh,

278
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.480
well masculinism uh,
in,
in the eights and it's part of,
uh,

279
00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.610
uh,
when I met last time when I,

280
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:04.670
when I spoke of Yates is anti modernism or his reactionary modernism and it's

281
00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:08.090
here too in this poem.
Uh,

282
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.430
but the attitude here as an eastern 1916 and Yates is other great poems is

283
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:16.070
complicated,
uh,

284
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.680
for all of Yates is a reactionary moods,

285
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.310
even for his indulgence in the stallion to here.

286
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.380
He's not a nostalgic poet.
Uh,
and,
and this poem I think shows us,

287
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.190
uh,
what I mean by that.
Uh,

288
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.040
look at how the poem changes as it develops a,

289
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.050
as it moves to this second stroke.
Uh,

290
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:43.070
and Yates turns from the frozen image of the past to address those two sisters

291
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.790
directly,
uh,
saying dear shadows,
now,
you know,
it all,

292
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.650
all the folly of a fight with a common wrong or right,

293
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.150
the innocent and the beautiful have no enemy,
but time

294
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.750
arise and bid me,

295
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:05.890
strike a match and strike another till time.
Catch.

296
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.080
Should the configuration climb,
run till all the sages?
No,

297
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.830
we built the Great Gazebo.

298
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.790
They convicted us of guilt.
Bid me,

299
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:21.100
strike a match and blow

300
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.630
the poet and the woman together become we in the poems.

301
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:31.540
Last sentence.
They,

302
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.210
the they who convicted us of guilt.
Well,
that's hard to identify.
Who is that?

303
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.150
Uh,
I think it's possible to see that they,

304
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:42.970
as the sort of general forces of modernity,

305
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:47.971
of everything at odds with the aristocratic culture Yates and these women shared

306
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:53.500
inhabited,
uh,
we the great gazebo built.

307
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.970
I stumbled and put,
built in the wrong place when I read it.
Uh,

308
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:02.950
it's a strange line.
Uh,
I am told,

309
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.970
uh,
that it,
it,
uh,
plays on a,
uh,
uh,

310
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.860
a slang phrase,
then current to make a gazebo of yourself,

311
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.620
meaning to make a spectacle of yourself and a fool of yourself publicly.
Uh,
the,

312
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:21.650
uh,
uh,
footnote to your Norton here,
uh,

313
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.630
suggests

314
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:29.130
that the Gazebo is a summer house and by extension it's quite an extension,

315
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.140
the nationalist movement.
And then even the whole temporal world.

316
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.950
Those are some real extensions,
aren't they?
Uh,

317
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.560
it's a little hard to know what to do with this,

318
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:46.170
this gazebo a does it in fact represent,
um,
the,
the,
uh,

319
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.110
uh,
nationalist movement,
um,
uh,
that,
um,

320
00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.880
uh,
culminated a or one form of,
uh,

321
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:58.000
which culminated in the Easter rebellion.
Uh,

322
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.110
does it represent a Yates his own,
um,
uh,

323
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:06.830
early cultural nationalism and his,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

324
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.260
uh,
work,
uh,
representative,
uh,

325
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.980
the wind among the reeds and other early poems?
Well,
it's a little hard to say.

326
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.050
I tend to see that Gazebo or summer house,
uh,
as,
uh,
you know,
as a,

327
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:23.770
as a version of list of Dell itself,
uh,
this,
um,

328
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.860
a home that the poem evokes a and that is representative of a 19th century world

329
00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.110
of art,
uh,
of pleasure,

330
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.510
of rarefied and delicate and ideal beauty,
uh,

331
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.470
a world very important to Yates,
uh,

332
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.000
as,
uh,

333
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.430
as his thought develops in the course of this poem.

334
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

335
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.630
<v 0>Uh,
he,
uh,
turns from nostalgia,
uh,</v>

336
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.650
to affirmation,
uh,
and seems to join the sisters,

337
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.860
uh,
in the,
uh,
actions,
uh,

338
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:11.660
that they chose through some kind of sympathetic identification,
uh,

339
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.470
Yates who had seemed to stand apart from and against them.

340
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.780
In the first part of the poem,
uh,

341
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.160
the women,
uh,
represent,
uh,

342
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:26.840
48 to kind of self destructive energy.
Uh,

343
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:31.350
and it's something,
uh,
he too I think is willing to,
uh,

344
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.220
share,
uh,
and enter into a,

345
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:37.940
he speaks of the destruction of the world that they shared at the house that

346
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:38.780
they had built,

347
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.880
one that he mocks as this great Gazebo,
uh,

348
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.660
as something noble and beautiful,
perhaps,

349
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:50.780
but also fragile,
uh,
in a spectacle.

350
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:53.330
And unable to stand up to history.

351
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.410
Time is the enemy in the poem,
uh,

352
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.620
at Yates joins forces with the women at the end.
Uh,
and the,

353
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.360
in doing so joins forces with time,
uh,

354
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:09.950
and sets a match to it.
Uh,
as if time itself,

355
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:15.010
we're Tinder Yates

356
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.740
imagines a kind of act of arson in this pub.

357
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.440
Fire is symbolically important.
Throughout his poetry.

358
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.190
In the song of Wandering Angus,
I talked about the,

359
00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:34.040
the kind of flickering passion and the fire in the head,
uh,

360
00:25:34.041 --> 00:25:39.041
that sends Angus out on his quest fire reappears,

361
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:44.840
uh,
with increasing frequency in the late poetry,
uh,
in,
in,

362
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.440
uh,
your ris packet.
I gave you the,
a short poem,

363
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:51.350
two songs from a play.
Uh,

364
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.580
the first stanza of that interesting,
uh,
poem,

365
00:25:55.820 --> 00:26:00.530
a repeats themes from the match I,
and the second coming you can,
you can look at,

366
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:01.730
uh,
it,
uh,

367
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.760
with those palms in mind where Yates imagines a new world coming into being

368
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.910
ushered in through the blood of the old,
uh,
this,
uh,
idea,
uh,

369
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.310
leads him to,
um,
uh,
the meditation that's in the,

370
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:20.360
the second stanza,
uh,
there,
uh,

371
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:23.090
everything that man is steams,

372
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.940
endures a moment or a day,

373
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.950
loves pleasure,
drives his love away.

374
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.470
The painter's brush consumes his dreams.
The heralds cry,

375
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.460
the soldiers tread exhaust his glory in his might.

376
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:46.540
Whatever flames upon the night man's own resinous heart has fed man's heart in

377
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:55.620
Yates is resonance.
It's a sticky filth that flames

378
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.020
belonging,

379
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.020
heart accumulates desires that become in time a kind of volatile waste,

380
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.890
uh,
which can't be contained.
Uh,

381
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.550
the heart is combustible,
uh,
like the,
uh,

382
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:16.440
the energy that insists on birth in the magpie or the second coming.

383
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.660
Uh,
and this is our glory.
Yeats says,
uh,

384
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.430
again,
notice how bodily,

385
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.410
how material in physical Yates has images of human energy are.

386
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:34.350
Let's turn back to uh,
the anthology and,

387
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:38.790
and look at the poem vacillation on one 31.

388
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.760
Uh,
this is a meditation that comes in several parts.

389
00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.990
Um,
as Yates has work develops,

390
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:53.130
he creates a,
a kind of poem,
uh,

391
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.890
that comes in parts.
Uh,
that is,
uh,

392
00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.930
we might think of as a kind of sequence poem,
uh,
uh,
in which,

393
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.860
um,
uh,
with increasing daring,
uh,

394
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.510
Yates explores contending viewpoints,
uh,
seeking,

395
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.740
uh,
some kind of synthesis.
Uh,
that's what's going on here.

396
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.190
That's a similar kind of structure in other late [inaudible] poems,

397
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:25.080
Yates,
uh,
at first thought to call this poem,
what is joy?

398
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.170
Uh,
it takes up his lifelong quest to reconcile extremities,

399
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.890
opposites,
uh,
in his thought,
in his experience,

400
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.850
and to achieve some kind of unity of,
of being,
uh,

401
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.070
what is the goal of,
of wandering Angus,
uh,

402
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.110
between extremities.
Man runs his course,

403
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:54.230
a brand or flaming breath comes to destroy all those antinomy of day and night.

404
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.350
The body calls it death,
the heart remorse.

405
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.940
But if these be right,
what is joy

406
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.470
here in the first part of the palm?

407
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.900
Yates talks about death and remorse as the end of all debate

408
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.690
the last word.

409
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:23.490
We're all going to die and we're all going to regret what we did.

410
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.220
But this understanding of the end of things,
uh,

411
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:33.960
is only the cancellation of all those antinomy.

412
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:38.961
He's in a kind of failure to reconcile them and it doesn't satisfy Yates.

413
00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:40.940
Uh,
he's asking in

414
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.940
how can we be joyful in the face of death and in the face of certain remorse?

415
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:55.090
Or how is it that somehow we are,
he wants to explain this.

416
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:57.520
He wants to,

417
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.480
he wants to find a way to not so much redeem as affirm a time and age,

418
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.070
uh,
and understand them not simply a,

419
00:30:09.071 --> 00:30:13.810
as a cause of despair,
uh,
or as a cause of defeat.

420
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.370
The poem then tries out different answers,
uh,

421
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.400
answers that a alternately explore transcendental and secular,

422
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.270
uh,
solutions.
Um,

423
00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.550
and at the poem vacillates a as it were between them

424
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.780
in section three below,
uh,

425
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.840
Yates has get all the gold and silver that you can provide provide.

426
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.040
Uh,
but,
uh,
just as in frost,
uh,

427
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.440
the strategy isn't going to work.

428
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.570
So therefore,
uh,
we must take up,

429
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.130
he suggests a anesthetic path,
uh,

430
00:30:57.131 --> 00:31:02.131
engaging only as he says in those works that are fit for such men as come proud

431
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:05.980
and open eyed and laughing to the tomb

432
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.650
in section four.
Then the next on the next page,

433
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:18.040
uh,
blessing is,
is not,
uh,
on the other hand,

434
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:21.520
something to work for,
uh,
rather,
uh,

435
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:26.110
it's a potential fire that flashes up momentarily within us.

436
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:32.430
My 50th year had come and gone when I first read this poem that seemed to really

437
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.080
long way in my future

438
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.710
as perhaps it does do you,
uh,
my 50th year had come and gone.

439
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.050
I sat a solitary man in a crowded London shop,

440
00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.980
an open book and Empty Cup on the marble table top while on the shop and street,

441
00:31:55.031 --> 00:32:00.031
I gazed my body of a sudden blazed and 20 minutes more or less.

442
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:03.220
It seemed so great.

443
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.960
My happiness that I was blessing and could bless.

444
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:15.330
It's a serendipitous and,
and moving,
uh,

445
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.160
a momentary experience.

446
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.220
Yates describes and notice that it's the body that blazes a soul and body or

447
00:32:26.741 --> 00:32:30.160
soul and heart.
Uh,

448
00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.930
these are our antinomy is that the poem is exploring.

449
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.400
A Yates insists that the heart is an organ of the body.

450
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:47.340
Uh,
they have been located in it.
Uh,
this,
this is important,
uh,

451
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.600
in,
in,
uh,
uh,
the sixth section down below.

452
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:54.260
He speaks of man's blood sodden heart.

453
00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:58.460
So another turn on that image of Man's resinous heart,

454
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.090
uh,
in,
in section seven,

455
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.200
a soul and heart argue,
uh,

456
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:11.720
the vacillation and debate,
uh,
becomes uh,

457
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.400
quickest here.
Uh,

458
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:18.200
as one point of view gets one line and uh,
the other,
uh,

459
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.830
the a rhyming next line,
well,

460
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:27.440
they're not in couplets,
but you'll,
you'll hear the rhymes when they come.
Uh,

461
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.560
seek out reality.
Leave things that seem,

462
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:35.390
that's what the soul instructs us.
The heart responds.
What?

463
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.000
Be a singer born and lack of theme

464
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.720
Isaiah's coal.

465
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.350
What more can man desire struck dumb and the simplicity of fire.

466
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.700
Look on that fire.

467
00:33:49.701 --> 00:33:54.701
Salvation walks within what theme had homer but original sin.

468
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:57.981
It's,

469
00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:02.981
it's a wonderfully compressed argument in which the soul and the heart make,

470
00:34:04.811 --> 00:34:09.150
compete.
Keep,
excuse me.
Competing claims for Christianity,
uh,

471
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.880
and classical,
uh,

472
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.140
and literary wisdom Yates counter poses.

473
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:17.510
Isaiah is prophetic coal,
uh,

474
00:34:17.511 --> 00:34:20.210
to the blazing body of section four,

475
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.430
a where fire is spontaneous,
imminent,
something that arises from the body.

476
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:31.670
Uh,
there then follows a,
in that last section,
a kind of comic,
uh,

477
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.550
conclusion where the poet chooses to side with homer,
uh,

478
00:34:35.551 --> 00:34:39.560
and implicitly with poetry against,
uh,

479
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:42.250
the theologian,
uh,
von Hugele,

480
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.550
who's a kind of comic figure,
uh,
at the end there,

481
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.250
a vacillation the poem was written,
uh,

482
00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:56.090
following a series of poems called the crazy Jane poems written as a kind of

483
00:34:56.091 --> 00:35:00.290
summary of them and kind of resolution of the debates that go on.
And the,

484
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.860
uh,
you have just one of them in your anthology.
Uh,

485
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.710
but it is a,
one of the,
uh,
uh,
greatest,
uh,

486
00:35:09.711 --> 00:35:13.460
it is,
uh,
back on one 30,
uh,
in the,
uh,

487
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:17.540
crazy Jane poems.
Uh,

488
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.100
the bishop who is crazy,
Jane's antagonist has as the real,

489
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:26.960
the part of von Hugele,
the,
uh,
position of the,
uh,
um,

490
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.030
church authority,
uh,

491
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:33.010
and Jane speaks for Yates and for poetry,
uh,

492
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.170
for homer to I suppose,
uh,
crazy.

493
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:40.770
Jane is one of a Yates is masks or roles.
Uh,

494
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.780
she is a mad peasant woman.
Uh,
um,
she,

495
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:50.700
uh,
uh,
she speaks from the point of view of a cracked or shattered mind.
Uh,

496
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.000
uh,
in the tradition of a Shakespearian fool.

497
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.440
She speaks what gates calls in his general,
uh,

498
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.660
title for this group of poems,
words for music,
perhaps,
uh,

499
00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:08.280
uh,
the poems,
uh,
connection to music,

500
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.790
uh,

501
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.790
signifies the difference in point of view in these poems from reasons speech.

502
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.443
Uh,

503
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:21.000
it also seems to relate these poems to folk forms,

504
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.880
uh,
into the wisdom of the folk.
Uh,

505
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.320
Jane speaks in praise of love,
uh,

506
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.790
in praise of satisfaction.

507
00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.870
She speaks of the necessary unity of body and soul,

508
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:39.180
which for her entails a defense of the body,
uh,

509
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.780
defending,
uh,
as she does it's knowledge.

510
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:47.700
It's goodness as a character.
She is sour.

511
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.150
Uh,
she's rank ill tempered,

512
00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.910
pungent,
uh,
in all senses.
Uh,

513
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.460
well let's,
let's look at this debate.
I met the Bishop on the road and much said,

514
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:06.780
he and I,
those breasts are flat and fallen.

515
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:11.670
Now those veins must soon be dry.
This is the bishop,
uh,

516
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.350
speaking to her of her body,
live in a heavenly mansion,

517
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.930
not in some foul sty,

518
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.900
to which Jane replies,

519
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.300
fair and foul are near of kin in fair needs foul.

520
00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.130
I cried.
My friends are gone,
but that's the truth.
Nor grave,

521
00:37:33.131 --> 00:37:34.480
nor bed denied,

522
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:40.150
learned in bodily lowliness and in the heart's pride.

523
00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.280
And she continues.

524
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.420
A woman can be proud and stiff when on love intent,

525
00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.260
but love has pitched his mansion in the place of excrement.

526
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:58.600
For nothing can be sole or whole that has not been rent.

527
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:03.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

528
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.650
<v 0>The points of view,
again,</v>

529
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.160
are those of the sacred and profane,

530
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.210
the soul and the body.
Uh,

531
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.220
the promise of a heavenly mansion and the reality of a life lived in a foul STI.

532
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.230
The bishop claims one side of the bait.
Jane claims the other,

533
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.000
uh,
but unlike the bishop,
she doesn't want to reject the other.

534
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:30.160
And this is important.
Speaking for the body.

535
00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.450
She speaks for the potential unity of body and soul.

536
00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.860
In answer to the promise,
uh,

537
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.900
of the bishops health heavenly mansion in another life,

538
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.220
she claims another sort of house which she calls loves mansion,

539
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.740
which is noble itself,

540
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.010
and which is to be lived here on earth.

541
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:59.590
Love has pitched his mansion in the place of excrement.

542
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.260
This is an outrageous claim.
Uh,
what does it mean?
Uh,

543
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.300
look at the claim it's paired with for nothing can be sole or hole that has not

544
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:11.920
been rent.

545
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:18.210
Why is it necessary to rent something to make it soul or hole?

546
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.020
Is it unnecessary?
Uh,

547
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.020
only that which is broken.

548
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.970
Jame claims is unified,
uh,

549
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.760
that which appears hole is not

550
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:40.390
a Yates seems to be insisting through Jane on the necessity of,

551
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:45.391
of shattering experience to achieve unity of being a witch.

552
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:50.170
Yates imagines a,
again,
as a union of opposites.

553
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.340
Uh,
again,
think of the rape of later.
Uh,

554
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:59.350
this is the type of the violent union,
uh,
that Yates imagines,

555
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.010
uh,
in which the,

556
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:05.170
the divine enters the human and the human finds access to the,

557
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.440
to the divine through the beast deal.

558
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.660
And the beast steel is identified in Yates with the heart and with the

559
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:17.050
irrational,
uh,
and with the uncontrollable,

560
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.630
um,

561
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:27.210
Yates is a
late poems,
uh,

562
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.410
speak from the point of view of,

563
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:33.960
of Jane more often than not,
uh,

564
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:39.300
and yet powerfully we do see him vacillating from different between different

565
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:45.160
points of view.
We have really no time left to explore them.

566
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:47.980
But I want to just point you to,
uh,

567
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:52.420
to important late poems that,
that seem to,
uh,

568
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.740
represent different,
um,
attitudes,
uh,

569
00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:01.770
in late Yates that contrast the kinds of claim that can be made for art.

570
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.070
Uh,
one of them is the,
uh,
moving,
uh,

571
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.910
valedictory to his work that is called the circus animals' desertion,

572
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:20.390
uh,
where,
uh,
the poet,
um,

573
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:25.720
imagines his imagination is having arisen,
uh,
on,

574
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.790
on ladders,
if you will,

575
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
out of a what he calls the foul rag bone shop of the heart.

576
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:39.470
Uh,
and in conclusion,
he imagines,
uh,

577
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.850
giving up,
um,
that,
uh,
terrific,
um,

578
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:44.920
uh,

579
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:49.910
drive towards a imagination and idealization,
uh,

580
00:41:49.911 --> 00:41:50.420
and uh,

581
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.010
and a return to the rag and bone shop of the heart.

582
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.650
That's a,
uh,
uh,

583
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.580
image of art ultimately leading out of art,
uh,

584
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.060
to a kind of state of,
uh,
de sublimation.

585
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:10.000
Contrast this poem,
uh,
to,
uh,

586
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.000
Lapis Lazily,
uh,
a,
uh,
uh,

587
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:19.120
beautiful and moving late poem on one 35 a that is full of echos,

588
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.850
uh,
from that,

589
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.880
a general introduction to his work that I quoted from,

590
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:32.700
uh,
earlier,
um,
here.
Yates,
um,

591
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.190
presents us with

592
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.780
an image of art in the form of a Lapis lazily Chinese carving.

593
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.063
Uh,

594
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.380
and he describes the figures on that carving who,

595
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:52.370
uh,
are,
uh,
in some sense,
um,
uh,

596
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:57.260
representatives of an attitude,
again,
uh,
beyond,
uh,
tragedy,

597
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.450
uh,
beyond,
um,
the kinds of,
um,
uh,

598
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:07.480
social and political apocalypse that a Yates faced in his career.

599
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.870
Uh,
and then he describes also in this poem,
uh,

600
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:16.790
and Yates concludes,
uh,
well with an image of the artwork,

601
00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.840
uh,
that I'll,
I'll,
I'll read for you.
Um,

602
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:25.820
that is a fascinating in itself,
but all is also,
as I suggest,

603
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:31.010
an image of a Yates is I'm late,

604
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.820
uh,
ideal for what art should be like.
He says,

605
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:38.960
every discoloration of the stone.
This is on page one 36.

606
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.320
Every accidental crack or dent seems a watercourse or an avalanche or lofty

607
00:43:47.781 --> 00:43:50.030
slope where it still snows,

608
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:55.250
though doubtless plum or cherry branch sweetens the little halfway house those

609
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:56.810
Chinaman climb towards.

610
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.520
And I delight to imagine them seated there

611
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:08.120
in their,
at their altitude looking at the world from within,

612
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:08.990
uh,

613
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:13.990
the perspective of art there on the mountain and the sky on all the tragic scene

614
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:16.364
they stare,

615
00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.940
one asks for more informalities accomplished fingers begin to play their eyes.

616
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:28.250
Mid many wrinkles,
their eyes,
their ancient glittering eyes are gay,

617
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.060
uh,
and their,
uh,
is,
uh,
finally again,
uh,

618
00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:38.030
an affirmation of this,
uh,
uh,
uh,
joy,
uh,

619
00:44:38.031 --> 00:44:42.980
and,
and Gay Iot,
uh,
here seen as a property of the artwork itself.
