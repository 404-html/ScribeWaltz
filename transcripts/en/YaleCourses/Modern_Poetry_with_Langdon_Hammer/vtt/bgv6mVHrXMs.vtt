1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.880
Frost was his born in,
in 1879,
I think,

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.463
uh,

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.600
Hart Crane and 1899 representing almost another generation from frost.

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.410
Uh,
Auden was born in 1906,

5
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.260
uh,
bishop in 1911.
Uh,
she,

6
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.730
she's the latest,
the youngest,
uh,
in our syllabus,
you know,

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.560
almost,
uh,

8
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.390
almost two generations a distant from,
from Robert Frost.

9
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.693
Uh,

10
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.900
when I was a freshman at Yale in 1976 in April,
um,

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.570
uh,
Elizabeth Bishop came to read it,
you know,
she,
um,

12
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.480
uh,
she's in a sense,
you know,
part of a,
uh,

13
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.710
a part of our world in a way that the,
uh,
uh,

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.540
poets that we've been reading really aren't quite,
she was good friends with,

15
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.500
uh,
uh,
John Hollander.
Uh,
Penelope,

16
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.860
Lauren's on our faculty,
Sandy McClatchy and others.

17
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.620
Uh,
she,
uh,
filled the art gallery,

18
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:24.320
Lecture Hall,
uh,
you know,
400 people.
Um,
uh,

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.640
and this is at a moment,
interestingly,

20
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.960
when she was not yet at the height of her fame,
uh,
she,
uh,

21
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.540
she would,
uh,
uh,
become by the end of the century,

22
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.920
a figure as prominent as often read and widely read and esteemed,

23
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.340
uh,
as any of the poets we've been reading,
uh,
which is,
uh,
a remarkable,
uh,

24
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.140
event in literary culture because,
uh,

25
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.830
bishop would have seemed to herself and to others,
uh,

26
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.780
through the course of most of her career,
uh,
as an interesting poet,
uh,

27
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:05.020
but as,
uh,
uh,
but not as a major figure a inch.

28
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.750
Surely she was herself uncomfortable with that kind of stature.

29
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.700
Uh,
she was,
I think it's fair to say excruciating by public,

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.170
uh,
occasions,

31
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.310
including this one that I'm referring to.

32
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.380
Listen to her read.
I think there,
there are some recordings of her on,
um,

33
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.380
uh,
the,
uh,
center for language study.
A website,
uh,

34
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.920
bishop has a,
a kind of,
um,
uh,

35
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.670
exaggeratedly ordinary voice,
uh,

36
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.140
in the sense of very private voice that she was willing to,
uh,

37
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.090
put on stage,
uh,
but always,
only uncomfortably.
So,

38
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.200
uh,
in this particular reading I'm remembering,
uh,
she,
uh,

39
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.490
she had read for about 20 minutes and then,
uh,
uh,
uh,

40
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.950
looked across the stage with these 400 people in of her,
uh,

41
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.810
at her hosts a Penelope Lawrence.
Is that enough penny?
Uh,

42
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.070
she said,
uh,

43
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.090
and of course people wanted a lot more and a lot more of her,

44
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.810
uh,
but she was reluctant to give it a and uncomfortable giving it.

45
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.470
Um,
bishop in a sense,
uh,
belongs to,

46
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.120
um,
poetry after modern poetry,
poetry after modernism.

47
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.950
And you know,
uh,
in September I'm going to give a lecture course,
uh,

48
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.960
on poetry after 1950 and we'll start with bishop and pay a lot more attention to

49
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:39.040
her than we have room to do in this course.
But,

50
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.270
uh,
bishop belongs to,
uh,
in,
uh,
any history of,
uh,

51
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.050
modern poetry.
Uh,
and she provides a con I think an important end point,

52
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.230
um,
to the work that we've been doing together.
Uh,

53
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.480
she provides a,
in a sense,
a kind of

54
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.470
a extension of,
of,
um,

55
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.330
a certain strains of,
of modern poetry and a,

56
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:09.250
and also at the same time,
a kind of critique of them.
Uh,

57
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.750
Bishop went to Vassar,
uh,
and,

58
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.640
uh,
she,
um,
uh,
was,
uh,

59
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.300
on the literary magazine there.
Uh,
and,
uh,

60
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:27.280
in 1929,
I think,
uh,
she interviewed the,

61
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.260
uh,
important guests,
uh,
on the campus.
Tsl,
yet,

62
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.070
uh,
you,
you,
I would have liked to have been in the room.
Uh,

63
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.350
she,
she wrote,
um,
uh,

64
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.800
well I guess what I want to highlight is the fact that what bishop was in

65
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:49.230
college reading Eliot and having Elliot visit,
uh,
uh,
when,
uh,

66
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.130
she's being,
when she's really forming herself as a writer,

67
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.830
uh,
uh,

68
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.080
she wrote a paper for one of her courses called dimensions of the novel.

69
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.270
Uh,
and,
uh,
this essay,
um,

70
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.250
involved a reading of it Elliot's essay tradition in the individual talent,

71
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:16.030
which you've read in which we've talked about.
Uh,
bishop liked it.

72
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:20.350
She was interested in it,
uh,
in her,
uh,
account,

73
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.150
uh,
of the way in which she uses Elliot.
Uh,

74
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.030
uh,
she,
um,
uh,

75
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.940
accents certain aspects,
uh,
of his ideas and,

76
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.880
and downplays others.
Let me quote from that essay.

77
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.980
Uh,
she says this is on your handout,

78
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.880
a constant process of adjustment.
And that's Elliot's word adjustment,

79
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.850
uh,
is going on about the past.

80
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.990
Every ingredient dropped into it from the present must the whole,

81
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.640
you remember Elliot writing about that in tradition and there was little talent

82
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.980
where he talks about how the new work,
uh,

83
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.780
sh reshapes everything that's gone before.
Now,

84
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:12.130
what Mr Elliot says about the sequence of works of art,
uh,

85
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.300
in a tradition in history,

86
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.940
and this is bishops extension of Elliot's idea,

87
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.510
seems to be equally true of the sequence of events or even of pages or

88
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.510
paragraphs in a novel.

89
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.590
But I know of no novel that makes use of this constant readjustment among the

90
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:37.970
members of any sequence.

91
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.080
So what bishops doing is applying Elliot's idea of,

92
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140
of sequence in tradition to the way in which a literary work might itself

93
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.790
unfold.
That is where every,
uh,
as it were,

94
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:57.740
new moment,
uh,
in a novel here,
she's talking about a novel,
uh,

95
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.180
affects a kind of readjustment of what's gone on before.

96
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.270
Uh,
it is as she's imagining it,
um,

97
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.750
a literary form in which there is a kind of continual,

98
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.850
um,

99
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.260
reorientation required by both reader and writer.

100
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.170
Uh,
she,
um,
uh,
uh,

101
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.910
takes over specifically that that phrase constant readjustment,
uh,
uh,

102
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.260
identifies this as a kind of a poetics if you will.

103
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.650
Uh,
this is really a,

104
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:40.910
an important idea in modern poetry generally.
And,
and you could,

105
00:07:40.911 --> 00:07:45.350
you could look at Elliot's own poetry in,
for example,
Prufrock,
uh,

106
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:50.351
as exemplifying something of what bishop is describing that is a,

107
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.850
a poem that unfolds disclosing at every point,

108
00:07:55.851 --> 00:08:00.320
new principles of order,
uh,
and perspective.
Uh,

109
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.410
it's an idea that that,
uh,
uh,
is,

110
00:08:03.411 --> 00:08:06.110
is in that sense central to modern poetry,

111
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:11.090
but bishop takes it and she pushes it in her own work much further.

112
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.350
Uh,

113
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.350
she creates in her poetry a radically relative point of view.

114
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.531
Uh,

115
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:23.531
that is adjusted to a kind of metamorphic and decentered world as she sees it.

116
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.550
A,
a world that is living in change.
Uh,
that phrase,

117
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.080
uh,
you,
you might remember from the very end of a primitive,
like an orb.

118
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.500
A Stevens is great late poem.
Uh,

119
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:44.360
and bishop is in many ways a Stevens Indian poet,
a poet of,

120
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:47.840
of change,
constant change,
uh,

121
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.800
but significantly in bishop's imagination.

122
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.750
As in Odense,

123
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.400
there are no Steve NZ and giants.
No,
no.
Uh,

124
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.970
major man,
no large men reading,
uh,

125
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.180
the poet in bishop's poetry

126
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.810
describes the world rather than creates it.
Uh,
the,

127
00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:18.610
the,
the poet is not like God,
uh,
as,

128
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.000
uh,
the poet is in Steven's.
Yeah,

129
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.090
the poet is much more like an ordinary person,

130
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.090
a woman on stage,
uh,
in a skirt,
uh,

131
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.740
uh,
speaking,
uh,

132
00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:38.741
uncomfortably if he like to a large audience in an ordinary voice.

133
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.820
Her poetry is in fact full of ordinary people.
Uh,

134
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.530
and this links her to frost.
Uh,

135
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.620
there are,
well,
generally a few,
uh,

136
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.950
uh,
oh,
uh,
oh,

137
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.680
emblematic or architectural figures such as you find in Yates or,

138
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:09.540
or in Morris poetry or often,
uh,
for that matter in Auden's,

139
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.510
uh,
there is in bishop a really know sublime,

140
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.100
uh,
no,
um,
no [inaudible],
uh,
assent,

141
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.970
uh,
out of the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.
Uh,

142
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:29.730
there's no cranium verticality,
uh,
no,
uh,
uh,

143
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.100
you know,
Icarus like a scent of the sky.

144
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.620
Instead,
uh,
bishops,

145
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.310
poetics of description are what I would call a kind of horizontal poetics,

146
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.230
uh,
that moves laterally,

147
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.190
that is earthbound and is concerned with in a sense,

148
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.780
this is her primary recurrent trope mapping the world,

149
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.420
uh,
giving an account of the earth surface.
Uh,

150
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.583
uh,

151
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.120
it's a perceptual poetics that she's concerned with,

152
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.010
uh,
something she calls geography or sometimes travel.

153
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.090
The,
uh,
poem that

154
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:20.320
really inaugurate bishops,
uh,
mature writing,
uh,

155
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.050
and that she placed first in her,
uh,
first,
uh,

156
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.830
volume of poetry north and south,
uh,

157
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:32.730
and that subsequently it's placed first in all,
uh,

158
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.710
collected volumes of her poems is the poem called the map.

159
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.780
Uh,
it's a kind of preface to or work,
uh,

160
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.090
and it's an inevitable place to start,
uh,
thinking about her.

161
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.730
Uh,
so let's look at it together.

162
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.010
Uh,
poem written in,
um,
uh,

163
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.130
I believe,
uh,

164
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.790
at least begun a new years eve.
Uh,

165
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.650
1933,
uh,
as Bishop,
um,
uh,

166
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.060
left college.
Maybe you seniors,

167
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:13.820
we'll write your own map next year.
Um,
she,
uh,

168
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:14.770
uh,

169
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.770
didn't collect it in a book until 1946 a which has her,

170
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:25.240
her first book publication,
uh,
like Steven's like frost.

171
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.170
Uh,
she's,
uh,
uh,
slow to,
uh,

172
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.120
gather her her first poems.

173
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.670
The poem begins with a,
a marvelous,

174
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.110
uh,
uh,

175
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.100
limpid clarity land lies in water.

176
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.540
It has shadowed green shadows,

177
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.220
or are they shallows
at its edges,

178
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:56.820
showing the line of long seaweed ledges where weeds hang to the simple blue from

179
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:00.064
green,

180
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.030
or does the land leaned down to lift the seat from under drawing.

181
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:11.251
It unperturbed around itself along the Fine Tan Sandy Shelf is the land tugging

182
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:16.390
at the sea from under,

183
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:24.810
it's a deceptively declarative flat voice,

184
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.830
a voice of description.
Uh,

185
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.870
it is interestingly impersonal and intimate at once.

186
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.820
Uh,
it's as if,
uh,
uh,

187
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.660
we were so close to her,
she need not introduce herself.

188
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.170
We are invited to look over her shoulder with her at the map.

189
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:56.050
Uh,
she doesn't,
as I say,
introduce herself or her subject really here.

190
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.550
Uh,
she just starts,
uh,

191
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.020
the poem represents itself as happening now,
uh,

192
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.170
as if it were recording the mind in action.

193
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.920
A process,
an action of perception.
Uh,

194
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.880
the poem was gathered first for publication by Marianne Moore,

195
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.560
who was a bishop's friend and mentor,
uh,

196
00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:28.480
described a friendship described in,
uh,
bishops long,

197
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:29.290
beautiful,

198
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.760
funny memoir efforts of affection that I asked you to read when we were reading

199
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:37.090
more.
Uh,
an essay that tells you a lot about more,

200
00:14:37.091 --> 00:14:41.350
but also tells you a lot about bishop,
uh,
more,
uh,

201
00:14:41.351 --> 00:14:46.150
as her mentor gathered this.
And three,
two,
excuse me,
two other poems.
Uh,

202
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:50.950
and,
um,
uh,
had it published in a volume in which an older poet,

203
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.440
a younger,
uh,
as a,
uh,
teacher or mentor,
uh,
would,
uh,

204
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.620
present a protege,
uh,
more says about bishops pumps.

205
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:03.860
A number of interesting things I've sampled.
Uh,

206
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.740
just these sentences on your handout.

207
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.050
Some authors do not muse within themselves,
but by contrast,

208
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:14.810
bishop does,
they,
they,

209
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:19.160
those other authors think like the vegetable shredder,

210
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:24.110
which cuts into the life of thing.
Ms. Bishop is not one of these friendly,

211
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.370
intensive machines.

212
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:32.020
Yet the rational considering quality in her work is its strength.

213
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.580
The rational considering quality,
assisted by unworthiness,

214
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:43.280
uncontested intentional and the Nis phrases that only Mary and could have

215
00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:46.280
produced.
Uh,
the flicker of impedance,

216
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:51.500
the natural unforced ending,
uh,

217
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.600
these are are,
are important,
uh,
qualities of,
of bishops writing.

218
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.850
Um,
uh,
although
to,
um,

219
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:06.650
highlight them is to risk of sort of misperception.

220
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:11.540
That is if bishop presents herself as a kind of rational considering

221
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.940
intelligence in these poems.
Um,

222
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.380
what she very rapidly uncovers,
uh,

223
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.030
is um,
uh,
fantasy,
uh,
and uh,

224
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:27.320
the fantastic,
uh,
or fabulous or metaphorical,

225
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.490
uh,

226
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.490
just so her poetry of precip perception and description rather than,

227
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.070
um,
uh,
uh,

228
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.870
giving us a kind of poetics of objectivity that we might associate with pound

229
00:16:41.871 --> 00:16:45.440
and images.
And,
uh,
very quickly,
uh,

230
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.710
turns back on the perceiving subject to ask questions about the process of

231
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:54.590
perception itself into suddenly become a poetry,

232
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:57.740
very much about subjectivity.
Uh,

233
00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:02.060
you can see this going on already,
uh,
in,
um,
uh,

234
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.560
the lines that I've quoted here,
uh,

235
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.420
uh,
bishop no sooner says one thing.
Uh,
then,
uh,

236
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.720
she elaborates it,
uh,
or questions that,
uh,

237
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:20.320
shadows or are they shallows?
She says,
uh,

238
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.520
she is formulated one idea and then she asks a question about it.

239
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.960
And then a further question about that,
uh,

240
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.480
this is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
very much,
uh,

241
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:38.190
in image a poetics of a mind in action,

242
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:42.860
a mind thinking,
uh,
that is the,
the drama,
uh,

243
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.700
that bishop shares with us.
Uh,
in another,
um,
uh,
early,

244
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.240
uh,
statement this in a,
um,

245
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.690
a letter to a poet Donald Stanford.
She quotes,
uh,

246
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.730
a literary critic on Baroque that is a 17th century prose which she liked.

247
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.490
Uh,
and,
and this quotation is also on your handout.
Uh,

248
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.150
there,
that is the writers of Brooke Pros.

249
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:15.810
Their purpose was to portray not a thought,

250
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:21.170
but in mind thinking they knew that an idea is separated from the act of

251
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:25.650
experiencing.
It is not the idea that was experienced.

252
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.430
The ardor of its conception in the mind.

253
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.270
That's my misprint isn't necessary.
Part of its truth.

254
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.400
The order of the conception in the mind is,
uh,

255
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.270
what bishop wants.
Uh,
ardor that's an important word.

256
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.830
It suggests a passion,
a certain amount of heat,

257
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.600
uh,
emotion and heart.
Um,

258
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.100
in bishop's case,

259
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.430
this ardor is communicated sometimes through the deceptively,

260
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.940
uh,
cool manner of self interrogation.
Uh,

261
00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.960
and in particular through the grammatical form of the question,

262
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.970
uh,
here,
uh,
in this very first paragraph of her poetry,

263
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.830
uh,
bishop is asking questions.
Uh,

264
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.750
there's a kind of level of clarity and detail in her observations,

265
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.070
uh,
that makes what she's looking at.
Interestingly,

266
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.880
unstable and uncertain.
She turns back on it,

267
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:37.970
ask questions about it.
You could contrast,
uh,

268
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.880
uh,

269
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.380
bishops questions with Yates is great rhetorical questions.

270
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.030
Uh,
a,
uh,
a,
a form that we,
we,
uh,
uh,

271
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:52.100
stressed in,
in reading later in the swan and other,
uh,

272
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:57.090
late Yates poems.
Uh,
in general,
uh,

273
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.990
thinking about,
uh,
bishops relationship to Yates,

274
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:04.950
you could say that romance quest,
which is this,
you know,

275
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.800
essential structure that's,
uh,
uh,

276
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.830
behind all of Yates as poetry romance quest has come down in bishop to the act

277
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.600
of asking questions,
uh,
raising questions,
uh,

278
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.910
here in this poem,
uh,

279
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.500
and very frequently and other bishop poems question specifically about

280
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:29.334
boundaries,

281
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.700
about the way in which we categorize a and frame the world,

282
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.470
uh,
how we,
uh,
draw lines,
uh,
and,
uh,

283
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.430
separate and connect things at the same time.
Uh,

284
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.440
as we do,
one thing seems to turn into,
uh,
another,

285
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.370
uh,
opposites interact,
uh,
uh,

286
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:58.630
opposites are involved.
Uh,
and notice the,

287
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.950
the pair of opposites that she's,
uh,
stressing here.

288
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.510
Land and water.

289
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.000
These are our primary categories that are poetry centers itself.
On,

290
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:14.740
over and over again.
Bishop is a poet of the seashore.
Uh,
there are,

291
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.710
uh,
uh,
poems,
uh,

292
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.570
throughout her career that station themselves on the beach.
Uh,
in particular,

293
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.460
uh,
a place of,
uh,
um,
unstable,

294
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.990
uh,
uncertain,
dynamic boundary.
Uh,

295
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.320
you can see the same kind of play of a similarity and difference,

296
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.600
uh,

297
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.600
between terms in bishop's poetry on a formal level already working here in this

298
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:51.190
first stands,
uh,
uh,
it is rhymed poetry isn't it?

299
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.990
Uh,
but what an interesting set of rhymes.
Uh,

300
00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.010
green edges ledges green,

301
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.170
uh,
under itself shelf under,

302
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.170
uh,
these are our rhymes were uh,
uh,

303
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.620
it seems as though words are a little too close together.

304
00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.200
If they're repeated green or maybe a little too far apart,

305
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.540
uh,
in the second stanza,
then,
uh,

306
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.500
the rhyme scheme gives way entirely.
This is,

307
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:30.730
and this is like bishop to set up one pattern and then drop it.

308
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:36.870
The shadow of Newfoundland lies flat and still Labradors yellow where the Mooney

309
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.520
Eskimo has oiled it.

310
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:45.870
We can stroke these lovely bays under a glass if they were expected to blossom

311
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.880
or as if to provide a clean cage for invisible fish.

312
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:58.290
The names of seashore towns run out to see the names of cities cross the

313
00:22:58.661 --> 00:22:59.770
neighboring mountains.

314
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.520
The printer here experiencing the same excitement as when emotion too far

315
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:08.200
exceeds its cause.

316
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

317
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.080
<v 0>These peninsulas take the water between thumb and finger,</v>

318
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.670
like women feeling for the smoothness of yard goods.

319
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.020
<v 1>Then</v>

320
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.990
<v 0>the rhyme scheme returns.
Uh,
and again,</v>

321
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:30.370
it's a peculiar one that includes,
uh,
not just a rhyme,

322
00:23:30.371 --> 00:23:35.350
but a repetition of,
of,
uh,
particular words.
Mapped waters,

323
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:40.380
she says are more quiet than the land is lending.

324
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:44.890
The late the waves,
excuse me,
lending the land,

325
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:47.300
their waves own con formation

326
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.750
in Norway's hair runs south and agitation profiles,

327
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:56.810
investigate the sea where land is,

328
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.870
are they assigned or Ken,
the country's pick their colors.

329
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.070
What suits the character or the native waters.
Best

330
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.510
typography displays.
No favorites.

331
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.210
North's as near as west,

332
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.290
more delicate than the historians are.
The map makers colors.

333
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.720
Uh,
it's a,

334
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.950
a poetry like aspects of Yeats,

335
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.940
like aspects of Moore's,
uh,

336
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.660
that presents itself with a,
uh,
a kind of,

337
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.810
um,
resolute,
uh,
uh,
um,

338
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.820
clarity and simplicity of lucidity,

339
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.770
of,
of,
um,
uh,

340
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.800
language that sometimes seems to feel,
uh,
like pros.

341
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.740
Uh,
there is a lyric power here,
uh,

342
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:08.240
but it's got app,
um,
through,
uh,
uh,
language,
uh,

343
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:10.340
again,
um,
uh,

344
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.400
close to that of ordinary life as bishop,

345
00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:22.340
uh,
observes the boundaries that she's talking about here,

346
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.710
the sea and the shore.

347
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.790
She's also concerned with another set of opposed terms in ones that will follow

348
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:33.920
her throughout her poetry.

349
00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:38.921
And that is the difference between the real and representation and the ways in

350
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:44.051
which representation that which is represented can take on a certain kind of

351
00:25:44.481 --> 00:25:47.720
reality itself.
Uh,
as,
uh,

352
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:52.480
she fancifully allows,
uh,
the,
um,
uh,

353
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.030
forms of the map to do here.
Uh,

354
00:25:56.031 --> 00:26:00.530
the map really becomes a world and,
uh,

355
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.950
not only a representation of it and the poet plunges really imaginatively into

356
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:08.504
it

357
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:14.720
takes us with her and she does a entering the versions of life that it suggests

358
00:26:16.111 --> 00:26:16.944
to her.

359
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

360
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.760
<v 0>In that third stanza there though,</v>

361
00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:26.290
as she returns to that peculiar rhyme scheme,
there's a certain kind of,
um,

362
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.640
uh,
holding back,
a gathering of her intelligence,
uh,

363
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:36.250
and reflection on the process,
uh,
that she's been engaged in.

364
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.960
What emerges there is a kind of key idea.
The one I've already mentioned,

365
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.400
geography or topography here.

366
00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.830
Uh,
geography,
topography,

367
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.280
they display no favorites.
They represent a,

368
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.920
a poetics,
uh,
uh,

369
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.600
that is non hierarchical in its orientation.
And again,

370
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.570
this is the link to more,
uh,

371
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.300
bishop is interested in a point of view that takes no sides,

372
00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.260
uh,

373
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.260
except to suggest to insist on the relativity of all cognitive categories north

374
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.980
as near as west.
It always is,
right?
Uh,

375
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.810
that is,

376
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:31.810
it's as near to the perceiver whose perspective is constantly shifting,

377
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.320
constantly readjusted.
Uh,

378
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.890
I talked about perspectivism in,
in Arden.
Uh,
well,
uh,

379
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.010
bishop,
uh,
has,
um,
uh,

380
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:48.870
has a hold of the same idea a and we'll make it even more central,

381
00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:51.990
make it more thematically central to her work.

382
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.420
Then even on,
uh,
uh,
the,
um,
um,

383
00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.800
opposition that she ends with a,

384
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:06.480
is the one between the historian and the map maker.

385
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.143
Uh,

386
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.960
she presents herself here clearly on the side of the mapmaker one whose colors,

387
00:28:16.831 --> 00:28:20.700
colors of rhetoric,
uh,

388
00:28:20.701 --> 00:28:24.570
are more delicate then the historians.

389
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.490
And on the side of the historian,

390
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.680
who could we place perhaps Yates,
perhaps pound,

391
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.720
perhaps Elliot,
uh,
certainly,
uh,
uh,

392
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.700
bishops.
Great Contemporary Robert Lowell,
uh,

393
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.580
bishop presents herself as,
uh,

394
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:50.040
engaged in a poetics of geography and of map making,
uh,

395
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:54.180
that is more delicate than that of the historian

396
00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:00.780
in that word delicacy.
Uh,
there is certainly,
um,
uh,

397
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:05.670
some,
um,
uh,
uh,
implication,
uh,
of gender,

398
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.470
um,
the opposition between the map maker in the historian,
well,

399
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:12.630
it would be too simple to,
uh,
uh,

400
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.400
call it an opposition between a woman and a man.

401
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.440
Uh,
and yet,
um,
uh,
gendered terms,
our,
our,
our,
uh,
uh,

402
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:26.990
they're in bishops language.
I think,
uh,
this poem,
uh,

403
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.890
as I suggested is composed in 1933,

404
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:38.010
uh,
after,
uh,
bishop has,
has left Vassar,
has,

405
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.460
uh,
made friends with more,
uh,
who,
uh,
uh,

406
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.890
will be a central figure in her life.
Uh,

407
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.450
if in some sense,
emotion

408
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.080
<v 1>might,
uh,</v>

409
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.320
<v 0>exceed its cause,
uh,</v>

410
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:59.320
might lead bishop to get carried away.

411
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.270
Uh,
there were lots of reasons why this might be so,

412
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.340
uh,
bishop,

413
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.203
<v 1>uh,</v>

414
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.870
<v 0>grew up,
uh,
at first,
uh,
in Nova Scotia.</v>

415
00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:15.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.280
<v 0>Uh,</v>

417
00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.260
she is a Canadian poet as much as an American pot poet,

418
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.220
uh,
uh,
of uncertain national identity.
You might say,
uh,

419
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.060
her father died when I believe she was five.
Uh,

420
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.720
her mother,
uh,
in grief,
um,
went mad,
uh,

421
00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.150
and was,
uh,
institutionalized,
uh,

422
00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:44.320
and bishop was separated from her so that she grew up very much as I'm an

423
00:30:45.291 --> 00:30:46.124
orphan,

424
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.360
<v 1>okay.</v>

425
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.630
<v 0>Uh,
much has been made of her biography.
Um,</v>

426
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:56.820
I wouldn't encourage you to,
um,
because,
uh,
bishop herself,

427
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.840
uh,
treats it,
um,
uh,
as a,
uh,

428
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:04.740
an important frame resonance for her poetry,

429
00:31:04.741 --> 00:31:09.420
but not as a rule a as its subject.
Uh,

430
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:10.201
there is,

431
00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:15.030
I think simply the important point to be made that,

432
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.870
uh,
here is a poet who grew up,
uh,
with,
uh,

433
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.930
certain primary sense of dislocation and disorientation in an acute sense of

434
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:29.790
divided identity,
uh,
uh,

435
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.780
biographical facts that in a sense lead us very quickly,
uh,

436
00:31:33.781 --> 00:31:38.130
into the ethical and cognitive problems that,

437
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.780
that are central to,
um,
uh,
bishops work.
And,
and,

438
00:31:42.781 --> 00:31:45.300
and I think,
uh,
to this problem in particular,

439
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.083
<v 1>how do you</v>

440
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.930
<v 0>hold yourself together?</v>

441
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.470
<v 1>Uh,
it's,
it's a,
uh,
uh,</v>

442
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:59.150
<v 0>it's an important one,
a and one that we all in various ways struggle with,</v>

443
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.970
uh,
bishop fines,

444
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:04.880
various ways to raise that question,

445
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.080
to figure it and explore it.
Uh,

446
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.720
one early amusing,
uh,
and suggestive,
uh,

447
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:17.500
instance,
uh,
is the poem called the gentlemen of Shalott.

448
00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:22.510
Uh,
and I'd like to look at that with you to,
um,
uh,

449
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:27.610
get a little more sense of bishops poetics and some,

450
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.800
uh,
uh,
sense of her early self conception as a poet.

451
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.640
Uh,
remember the idea that she's taken from Elliott,

452
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.980
she wants imagine a kind of writing,
uh,
that would include time in it.

453
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.070
That would include change in it,
uh,

454
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:51.620
in which the organization of the whole would be constantly subject to

455
00:32:51.621 --> 00:32:54.290
readjustment.
Uh,
a text

456
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.530
that would incorporate flux,
uh,

457
00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.640
a text that would be determined locally rather than by some,
uh,

458
00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:08.050
global,
uh,
and,
uh,
general perspective.

459
00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.100
Uh,
the,
I think,
um,

460
00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:18.570
unstable orders of a poem like Prufrock are important for bishop and that

461
00:33:18.791 --> 00:33:23.020
Prufrock is in fact a figure behind,
uh,
this one of bishops.

462
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:27.910
The gentlemen of Shalott a bishop's character is a kind of dandy,

463
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.360
like Prufrock.
Um,

464
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.190
bishop is also at the same time playing with Tennyson.
Uh,

465
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.660
and his poem,
the Lady of Shalott,

466
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.680
a kind of gender switch has,
has occurred,
uh,

467
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.620
in bishop's poem.
Uh,
what does it mean?
Uh,
well,
I'll leave you to ponder it.

468
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:52.210
Uh,
but I think that one way to understand her,
her joke here,

469
00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.030
uh,
I'm not going to write about the lady of Shalott.

470
00:33:55.031 --> 00:33:59.110
I'm going to write about the gentlemen of Shallot.
Uh,
uh,

471
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.360
one way to understand her joke here,
uh,

472
00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:06.390
is to suggest that this poem is in part about what it means for bishop to be a

473
00:34:06.431 --> 00:34:11.320
woman poet.
Uh,
and it implies that,

474
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.453
uh,

475
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.960
that meant for her a certain kind of gender switch,

476
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:22.090
a sex change,
uh,
and one that might,
uh,

477
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:26.260
introduce a certain amount of stress,
uh,

478
00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:31.290
as well as comedy.
Uh,
well,
uh,
let's,
uh,

479
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:36.160
uh,
let's listen to some of it,
uh,
which eyes his eye,

480
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.140
which limb lies next to the mirror.

481
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.650
Her joke is that the gentleman of Shalott,

482
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.720
like the Lady of Shalott,
it's fixated on a mirror,

483
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.160
but the mirror that,
uh,
uh,
is,
um,
uh,

484
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.730
in place here is one that,
uh,

485
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.640
as she'll describe it goes down the body splits.

486
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.820
This figure creates a kind of divided figure,
uh,

487
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.840
which limb lies next.

488
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:13.640
The Mirror for neither is clearer nor a different color than the other,

489
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.170
nor meets a stranger in this arrangement of leg,

490
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.260
in leg and arm.
And so on.

491
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.870
To his mind,

492
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.130
it's the indication of a mirrored reflection.

493
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:31.400
Somewhere along the line of what we call the spine,

494
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.950
he felt in modesty his person was half looking glass for why should he be

495
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.793
doubled?

496
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.370
The glass miss stretched down his middle or rather down the edge.

497
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:50.360
But he's in doubt as to which sides in or out of the mirror.

498
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.500
There's little margin for error,
but there's no proof either.

499
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.530
And if half his heads reflected,

500
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.080
thought he thinks might be effected,
uh,

501
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.980
this is poetry that presents itself as light verse.
Uh,

502
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.270
in that way it's again,
like much of early Aaden.

503
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:16.710
Uh,
and yet it is a poem that is secretly very serious.

504
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.950
Uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
well,

505
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:23.970
much of the lightness as well as the seriousness of the poem,
uh,

506
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:28.010
depends on its formal organization.
Uh,

507
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.230
these lines are well,
aren't they?
About half as long as,
uh,

508
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.980
a normative line of poetry

509
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.660
and they're rhymed.
Uh,

510
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.620
but they're rhymed and in a most interesting and playful way.
In fact,

511
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:46.560
the poem has a lot of play in it.
Uh,

512
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:51.860
the pleasure that it gives is a one of a certain mild exhilaration and

513
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:55.500
uncertainty of a pattern that includes,

514
00:36:55.501 --> 00:37:00.501
and that in fact tolerates or even generates dramatic change in line length and

515
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.360
surprising rhymes.
Uh,

516
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:10.200
the gentleman is in a sense trying to hold himself together.

517
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:11.850
Uh,

518
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:16.850
the idea is repeated by the poet trying to hold her lines together,

519
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.070
uh,
in rhymed couplets.
Uh,

520
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.650
bishop is in general,
a very interesting poet,
technically,

521
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.000
uh,
here as elsewhere.
How relaxed,

522
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.860
how unpretentiously a casual,
uh,

523
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.030
uh,
how disorienting Lee casual,
even the voices,
uh,

524
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:44.880
there isn't here or elsewhere in bishop frosts.

525
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.770
Tension between speech and meter,
uh,
rather,

526
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.230
as in this case,
each keeps getting adjusted to the other.

527
00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:00.210
Uh,
it's important.
There's almost no blank verse.
No,

528
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:03.720
I am back pentameter in Bishop.
She,
uh,

529
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.140
the canonical heroic meter doesn't appear here,
uh,

530
00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.160
accept I think possibly in,
in one or two examples.

531
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:17.550
There are in Bishop,
uh,
free verse poems.
There's meter and rhyme.

532
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.630
Uh,

533
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.630
there are often a poem poems that move in and out of these forms much as the map

534
00:38:24.091 --> 00:38:28.710
begins in rhyme,
moves out of rhyme and returns to rhyme.
Uh,

535
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.780
the poems don't seek more is highly idiosyncratic,

536
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:38.560
crafted formal,
uh,
uh,
instead,

537
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:44.440
bishops practice is probably closest to Arden's who's got a form for every

538
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:46.480
occasion form for every purpose.

539
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.700
But Auden's forms are always in a sense,

540
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:56.020
preset drawn from an existing repertoire.
What is right for this occasion,

541
00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.370
a ballad.
I will do a ballot,
a assessed Dena,
um,
uh,

542
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.540
Ella Jaic quatrains,
uh,
et cetera.
Uh,
that's,
uh,

543
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.240
the way in which Auden presents himself,
uh,

544
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:12.850
and od adheres strictly to his forms.
Uh,

545
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.163
uh,

546
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:19.320
and he uses those forums to shape and interpret the occasions of his writing.

547
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.190
In bishop's case,
it's really just the other way around.
Uh,

548
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.870
what she does is,
uh,
uh,

549
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.940
all to her forms under the pressure of the occasions of her writing her purpose

550
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.630
and subject.
Nothing in Bishop is preset.

551
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:43.620
Everything is provisional.
Uh,
in the process of being remade,
uh,

552
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.620
uh,
in a process of constant readjustment,
uh,

553
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.660
on a technical level as well as on the perceptual level,
uh,

554
00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:56.700
that I began by talking about,
um,
this is,
uh,
uh,

555
00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:01.420
a vision really of what the world is like and how writing might,

556
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.770
uh,
respond to it.

557
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.380
All of these things are going on in this little poem.
Um,
uh,

558
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.390
the,
the gentleman of a Shallot,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
with,

559
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.990
uh,
a sense of,
of comedy.
If the glass slips,

560
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:20.200
he's in a fix only one leg,
et cetera.

561
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.540
But while it stays put

562
00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.970
so long as we accept this provisional arrangement,

563
00:40:26.971 --> 00:40:31.971
he can walk and run and his hands can clasp one another.

564
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:37.050
The uncertainty,
he says he finds exhilarating.

565
00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.510
He loves.
And here's that phrase from the essay on on Elliot,

566
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:44.970
that sense of constant readjustment.

567
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.580
He wishes to be quoted as saying at present half is enough,

568
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:57.140
a kind of motto that Bishop might have adopted to let's look,

569
00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.600
uh,
uh,
at,
uh,
another version of this figure.
Um,

570
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:07.470
a,
uh,
uh,
this time not a person,
uh,
but,
uh,
a creature.

571
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:12.420
Uh,
and uh,
I mean specifically the Sandpiper,
uh,

572
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:16.680
who,
uh,
uh,
appears,
uh,
in,
uh,

573
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.120
a much later book,

574
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:20.913
<v 2>uh,</v>

575
00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.580
<v 0>questions of travel,
uh,
from,
uh,</v>

576
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.640
a book written largely in the 1950s and early 1960s.

577
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:31.880
Sandpiper is on page one 31.

578
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.740
Uh,
again,
uh,
it is a

579
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.580
poem that takes place on the shore

580
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.930
instead of the gentleman of Shalott,
uh,
uh,

581
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:51.210
in his,
uh,
um,
a fussy way,
uh,

582
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.680
and yet practical way,
um,
uh,

583
00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.020
getting along in the world,
we are introduced to a finicky bird.

584
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.300
The roaring alongside he takes for granted.

585
00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:10.100
And that every so often the world is bound to shake.

586
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.230
He runs,
he runs to the south finical,

587
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.410
awkward in a sense of controlled panic.

588
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.720
A student of Blake,
uh,

589
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.430
another poem that is stationed on a shifting boundary.

590
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.760
The boundary of the tide,
uh,

591
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:36.380
bishop is engaged here in a kind of playful,
active,
uh,

592
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:41.410
revision of the Visionary Innocence celebrated by William Blake.

593
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.870
Uh,
I,
uh,
a quote the lines on your handout that,

594
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:52.280
that a bishop is referring to,
to see a world in a grain of sand.

595
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:56.270
This is the beginning of auguries of innocence in heaven,

596
00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.300
in a wildflower hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.

597
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.310
Uh,
well,
uh,
here bishop is sort of playfully thing.
Uh,

598
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.710
well what kind of figure is,

599
00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:10.970
is really Blakey and what kind of figure wants to see the world in a grain of

600
00:43:10.971 --> 00:43:14.600
sand?
Well,
a Sandpiper,
uh,
looking for his food.

601
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.820
The beach hisses like fat
on his left,

602
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.860
a sheet of interrupting water comes and goes and glazes over his dark and

603
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:28.670
brittle feet.
He runs,
he runs straight through it,

604
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:31.970
watching his toes watching rather.

605
00:43:31.971 --> 00:43:36.971
And this is again bishop correcting her proceeding by correcting her perception,

606
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.730
watching rather the spaces of sand between them where no detail too small.

607
00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:46.670
And again,
the Sandpiper like the poet is focused on detail.

608
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:50.570
The Atlantic drains rapidly backwards and downwards

609
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:55.580
as he runs.
He stares at the dragging grains.

610
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:01.100
The world is a mist and then the world is vast.

611
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.140
In my newt and clear,
the tide is higher or lower.

612
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.700
He couldn't tell you which north as near as west,

613
00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:16.100
his beak is focused.
He is preoccupied looking for something,

614
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:20.270
something something poor bird.
He is obsessed.

615
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:24.530
The millions of grains are black,
white,

616
00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.210
Tan and gray mixed with quartz grains,

617
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.070
rose and

618
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:41.080
the poem Zone Structure Shifts,
uh,
interestingly,
uh,
in terms of its,

619
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:45.840
uh,
line lanes,
uh,
uh,
and uh,

620
00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.880
bishops ways of using in jam or end stopped lines.

621
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:56.970
Uh,
the world is well,
uh,
uh,

622
00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.740
the world is a place of vast forces,

623
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.870
a of roaring of missed,
uh,

624
00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.040
and yet it's also a minute,
uh,

625
00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:13.080
and clear all of these things at once or in succession.

626
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.930
Uh,
the bird's perspective,
uh,
uh,

627
00:45:16.931 --> 00:45:21.660
can't tell us whether the tide is higher or lower.
Uh,

628
00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.470
because he is as it were in the picture.
He's always wherever it is.

629
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.930
Uh,
it is,
uh,
a position again,
of constant readjustment.

630
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.890
What is he looking for?
Something,
something,
something,

631
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.850
uh,
uh,
calculatedly vague word,

632
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:48.190
a word that we see frost using in for once then something.

633
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.713
Uh,

634
00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:56.470
instead of moving here towards generalization,

635
00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:02.200
the palm moves towards more detail towards the list,

636
00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:07.000
a series finally of colors,
simply,

637
00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.010
uh,
uh,

638
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:14.160
in a sense bishop moves away from the black and white to other shades,

639
00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.070
uh,
uh,
shades that involve combinations of colors.

640
00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.620
Uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
the question is really

641
00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.450
how can the world be seen serially?

642
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.930
How can it be be made?

643
00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.440
How can it be seen as a series of perceptions and yet able to cohere?

644
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.060
Uh,
this is,
this is a fundamental question of,
of bishops poetry.

645
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.960
It is,
as it were,
the compliments of the question.

646
00:46:52.961 --> 00:46:57.310
How can you hold yourself together?
Well,
how can you hold the world together?

647
00:46:57.311 --> 00:47:02.050
How can you hold the world that you perceive together?
Uh,
bishops.

648
00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.270
A great poem on this subject,
uh,

649
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:11.430
is the travel poem over 2000 illustrations and a complete concordance,

650
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:16.690
which I promise to talk about on Monday.
