1
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.480
Um,
last Wednesday,
uh,
talking about the poetry World War One,

2
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.320
we're talking about poems written in the period 1914 to 1918 pretty much the,

3
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.160
the period of the first world war.
This is a,

4
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.170
a period that we've already had a certain amount to say about it is the period

5
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:34.870
in which fraud fraud starts writing,
uh,

6
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.090
publishes a boys will in London and then north of Boston in 1915.

7
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.773
Uh,

8
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.590
it's the same period in which a Yates is work a undergoes.

9
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:52.350
It's,
uh,
uh,
important,
uh,
stylistic shift,
uh,

10
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.280
in development in the volume called responsibilities.
Uh,
and,

11
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.390
uh,
other,
uh,
books from the teens,
uh,

12
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.280
exemplified in that little poem a coat.
Um,
it is a period,

13
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.140
uh,
in which,
uh,
in London itself are gathered,

14
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.650
uh,
frost,
uh,

15
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.270
Yates pound.
Okay.
Uh,
and Elliot,

16
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.700
uh,
all,
uh,
poets wheel,
uh,
study,
uh,

17
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.450
not simply gathered,
but interacting,
talking to each other,

18
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:33.340
reading each other's work and giving each other,
uh,
ideas and criticism.

19
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.030
Uh,
another figure,
uh,
in this,
uh,

20
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.040
Amelia and have this moment,
uh,
is the poet HD.

21
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.250
Uh,
he or she is a in a,
uh,

22
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.540
photo from a 1915,
uh,

23
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.470
with a,
with a lock it,
uh,
in a poetical pose.

24
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.550
Uh,
let's see,

25
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.680
I've got some other photos of the poet here.

26
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.673
Let's see.

27
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.530
This is as an older woman,
uh,
and

28
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.190
in a familiar place,
uh,
seated,

29
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.170
she's on the left or right on your left.
My right,
uh,

30
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.030
with,
uh,
her companion brier right here.

31
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.760
And that nice man in the middle,
uh,

32
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:41.930
is one of my predecessors in this position.
Norman Holmes,
Pearson,

33
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.750
uh,
a professor of modern poetry,

34
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:49.550
one of the founders of American studies at Yale.
Uh,
and one of the,

35
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.750
uh,
one of the people,
um,

36
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.620
involved in the creation of the incredible archive of modern poetry.

37
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:00.160
That is the key,
uh,

38
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.210
where we have the papers of Ezra pound HD.

39
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.370
Uh,
lots of,
lots of materials from Williams.
Uh,

40
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.350
um,
um,
uh,
um,

41
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.340
I'm,
I'm getting stuck here.
Uh,

42
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.200
Langston Hughes and many other figures.

43
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.220
Let's see.
Yeah,
there she is.

44
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:28.480
A on her 70th birthday in the nave of sterling.

45
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.720
Um,
well,
and this is,

46
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.580
this is over and buying a key to that is her death mask.
Well,

47
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:41.320
we've gone a long way from that.
A young woman with a locket,
uh,
to this point.

48
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.390
Uh,
uh,
let's return to her in her youth.
Uh,
this was,

49
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.480
uh,
uh,
also over and buying a key.
It's a,

50
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:53.700
it's a photo of a HD,
uh,

51
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.300
and it is inscribed to Marianne Moore,
uh,

52
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.090
her friend,
uh,
and pounds friend.

53
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.290
Uh,
on your,
on your handout,
you'll see,
um,

54
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.640
the interesting anecdote relayed from Hilda Doolittle's autobiographies.

55
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.380
I had never heard of very Libra until I was discovered by Ezra pound.

56
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.470
Pounded a lot for modern poetry,
including naming HD.

57
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.120
Uh,
I did a few poems that I don't think Ezra liked,

58
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.020
but later he was beautiful about my first authentic versus,

59
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.860
and sent my poems in for me to Ms. Monroe.

60
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.900
That is Harriet Monroe,
the editor,
very powerful woman of Poetry magazine.

61
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.360
He signed them for me.
Hd Image East.

62
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.480
Uh,
the name seems to have stuck somehow.
Uh,
well this,

63
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.320
this is a wonderful anecdote,
sometimes told differently,
uh,
which,

64
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.950
uh,
pound and HD as she would come to be known,
uh,

65
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.660
were conversing about her poems,
uh,
and,
uh,

66
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:14.590
in a coffee shop and pound,
uh,
put,
uh,

67
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.600
at the end of a hds poems,
a new signature to them,

68
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.060
uh,
HD,
uh,
that is,
um,
uh,
and,
and uh,

69
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.790
at the same time name the kind of poet she was Ema [inaudible] East,

70
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.680
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
promptly,
uh,

71
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.510
since pound is a great entrepreneur,
sent the poems off to be published,

72
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.100
uh,
and to found a movement.
Uh,
it's a,

73
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.960
it's an interesting,
uh,
and,
and uh,
telling story.
Um,

74
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.470
I suppose if,
uh,
this is poetry magazine,
uh,

75
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.240
it's covered where you see,
uh,
uh,

76
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.900
poems,
uh,
by pound,
uh,
and others,
uh,

77
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.670
that included hds work in the same volume.

78
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.040
Uh,
there's,
uh,
there are a couple of things to be said about this,

79
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.110
this little anecdote.
Well,
first of all,

80
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.110
there's the kind of a complicated literary exchange of a,

81
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:21.740
a man telling a woman,
uh,
what to call herself,
uh,
and,
and in fact,

82
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.070
doing it for her.
And,
and sending it,
uh,
uh,

83
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.660
her name and her work to be published.
The,
uh,

84
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.550
the name [inaudible],
uh,
is,
is funny.
Uh,
it,
it,

85
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:37.970
uh,
uh,
it seems to,
uh,
well,

86
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.920
it seems to evoke something excitingly,
uh,
and pretentiously foreign.

87
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.460
Uh,
and,
and you could remember,
uh,

88
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:51.230
the force of French painting in this period.
Uh,
you know,

89
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.980
everything that was modern came from Paris,
it seemed,
uh,

90
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:59.720
and here is a pound trying to in effect,
create something,

91
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.310
uh,
some similar kind of,
uh,
public relations,

92
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.550
excitement for poetry,
uh,

93
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.410
Amazon GC,
uh,
highlights,
well,
it highlights the word image,
uh,

94
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:16.190
and it highlights the visual,
uh,
as if poetry,

95
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:21.050
we're a kind of painting a,
that's important.
Uh,
and then there's the,
uh,

96
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.660
the fact of,
uh,
uh,

97
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.610
Hilda Doolittle a transformation into HD.
Uh,
I,

98
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:33.410
I don't know,
uh,
is the name Hilda Doolittle insufficiently poetic?

99
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.330
Uh,
the,

100
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:40.331
the compression of that kind of wonderfully homely American name,

101
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.210
uh,
into the enigmatic,
uh,

102
00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:50.030
initials HD seems emblematic of,
uh,

103
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.470
image,
just aesthetics in general,
which depend on the,
uh,
you know,
uh,

104
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:57.950
radical compression,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,

105
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.630
language and the,
uh,
um,
uh,
conversion,
uh,

106
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:05.450
of,
of,
um,
well,
uh,

107
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.710
the prosaic and every day to the essential.
Uh,
and you could,

108
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:14.540
you could say that,
uh,
here,
here pound is trying to,
uh,
do something,
uh,

109
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.850
with the same,
uh,
ideal of extreme economy with,
uh,

110
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.470
uh,
hds name.
Well,
uh,

111
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.650
what was images and,
uh,
this is,
uh,

112
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.350
um,
well,
uh,
these are,
these are,
um,

113
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.320
copies of,
um,
uh,

114
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.680
hds poems as they appeared in poetry magazine.
Uh,
Palm Hermes of the ways.

115
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.600
Um,
HD was,

116
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.470
uh,
and there's,
there's her initials right here.
Uh,

117
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.480
this new pen name.
Uh,
she went under,
uh,
she,
uh,
uh,

118
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.890
his writing even in this very early phase,
uh,

119
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.540
poems that have classical subjects and antecedents and are sometimes,

120
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.250
uh,
in fact,
uh,

121
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.190
translations from a classic sources,
uh,
from the,
uh,

122
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:17.490
Greek anthology and others.
Uh,
here's one epigram after the Greek.

123
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.000
And then here's hds name,
uh,

124
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.150
followed by the Amazon East in quotation marks.
Uh,

125
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.130
identification that pound has introduced,
um,
images,
um,

126
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.470
was,
uh,
initially marketed.
I think that's,

127
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.810
that's the fair word to use,
uh,
in a series of anthologies that,

128
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:43.500
that collected this,
this new exciting,
uh,
representative Lee.

129
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:48.250
It seemed modern poetry,
uh,
in an anthology called days.

130
00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:52.920
Amazon East,
uh,
again,
uh,
French defied.
Uh,

131
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:55.000
and then,
uh,
uh,

132
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.040
you can see this is from 1914 and it's published in London and New York.

133
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.130
And then,
uh,
well,
uh,
I'll tell you,
it's table of contents.
It's got,

134
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.070
um,

135
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:12.990

James Joyce is appears here and Ezra pound,

140

142
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.890
Uh,
this was followed a little bit later by this book called,
uh,

143
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.670
some images to poets 1915.
At this point,

144
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.380
pound a is no longer the,
uh,

145
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.590
master a entrepreneur.
Uh,

146
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:56.430
and the movement has rather been taken over by,
uh,

147
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.990
the very amply represented Amy Lowell,
uh,
who,

148
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:04.530
uh,
has become the primary,
uh,

149
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.780
exponent of images.
And,
uh,

150
00:11:06.781 --> 00:11:11.070
already by 1915 and pound,
uh,
has,

151
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.990
has more or less despaired of,
uh,
his own creation images and,

152
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.090
and now complains of it as being merely Amy Jizzum,
uh,

153
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:26.230
as he referred to it.
Uh,
Amy,
uh,
well you,

154
00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:30.450
you can see in this,
uh,
kind of,
uh,
uh,
oh,
you know,

155
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.130
envy and competition on pounds part.
He,
you know,
he's,
he's unhappy that his,
his,

156
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:39.780
uh,
uh,
his little group has been taken over by Amy Lowell.

157
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.140
Uh,
and so he doesn't want him to have anything to do with it.
Uh,

158
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:46.200
Amy Loral herself would later become,
uh,

159
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.560
a distressed at the proliferation of images and images and attempt to copyright

160
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:55.300
the name,
uh,
which she was unable to do.

161
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.100
Well.
Uh,
this is,
uh,
her,
uh,

162
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.150
her longish a poetics,
uh,

163
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.500
presented as a preface to that volume.
And An,
I,
uh,

164
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.220
recommend it to you.

165
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.750
It's an interesting statement of,
uh,
images.
Um,

166
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.860
uh,
in,
here's a photo of pound from this same period,

167
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.390
uh,
pound,
uh,
despite,
uh,

168
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.300
Amy lols taking over of images and remains the,
the real theorist of,

169
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.310
of,
uh,
images.
Um,
and,
and the,
uh,
the one who's formulations,
uh,

170
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:37.310
we still return to,
to understand what images and was and,
uh,

171
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.490
to an extent to understand some of the essential,
um,

172
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.490
aesthetic ideas and criteria of,
of modern poetry.

173
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.500
On your handout,
you have,

174
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.810
you have pounds rules.
He liked to make rules,
uh,
for,

175
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.960
for writing an image,
just poem.
Uh,

176
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.900
and they're happily there.
Just three of them,

177
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.240
not too many,
uh,
one,
uh,

178
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.570
direct treatment of the thing where they're subjective or objective.

179
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.340
Two two's absolutely no word that did not contribute to the presentation.

180
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.820
You can see even in,
in his,
uh,
uh,
telegraphic,
uh,

181
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.641
rules here.

182
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:32.641
He's trying to be a economical and three as regarding rhythm to compose and

183
00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:38.710
sequence of the musical phrase,
not in sequence of a metronome.

184
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.830
Well,
uh,

185
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:48.240
these are each suggestive and as I say,
important ideas in there.

186
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:53.230
They're worth dwelling on,
uh,
to understand some of what,

187
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.940
uh,
directs pounds,
uh,
thinking,
uh,
and,
uh,

188
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
some of pounds important influence early on in the,

189
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:07.120
uh,
uh,
development of modern poetry.
First of all,

190
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:10.510
that focus on the thing,
uh,

191
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.040
a poem is imagined here as an image of a thing.

192
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.620
Uh,
there's,
there's a kind of empiricism in this,
isn't there?

193
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:25.320
Uh,
uh,
I kind of vaguely scientific language.
Uh,

194
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.340
and if you look in pounds retrospect,
when he goes back and reprint some of his,

195
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.910
his writing about images and reflects on it,
uh,

196
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:36.610
in that essay that's in the back of your anthology,

197
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:40.420
you'll see pound talking about,
um,
uh,

198
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.830
his wish to ally poetry with science rather than advertisement.

199
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.780
Uh,
and,
and,

200
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:51.781
and here you can see him really trying to do so in this stress on objectivity

201
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:56.330
or,
or,
uh,
uh,
the,
the,
the aim of objectivity.

202
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.300
Notice that the thing may be as he says,
subjective or objective.

203
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.980
Uh,
but,
uh,
when we call it a thing,
uh,

204
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:12.010
this has the effect of turning even the subjective into something objective.

205
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.280
Uh,
something oddly objective.

206
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.410
And there's also a in that,
that first rule of kind of emphasis on directness,

207
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.700
you know,
direct treatment of the thing that's important.

208
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.450
All of this leads to a in pounds a second principle.

209
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.380
They are the ideal of concision of efficiency.

210
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:42.020
Uh,
nothing that does not contribute to the presentation,
you know,

211
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.230
uh,
Hilda Doolittle,
your name is too long.
Hd,
uh,

212
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.910
presentation,
pound doesn't say representation.

213
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:58.210
Uh,
he says presentation.
Uh,
again,
there's,
there's,
uh,

214
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:03.230
an emphasis on,
um,
immediacy,
a directness on,

215
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.920
on,
uh,
an ideal of presence if you will.

216
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:12.830
There is in pound a wheel to override or do away with mediation,

217
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.180
uh,

218
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.180
to bypass in a way the medium to make the word a thing,

219
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.200
to make the word an image in the image of thing.
Uh,
direct,

220
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:29.000
uh,
also implies a kind of stripping down of rhetorical ornament.

221
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.130
Uh,

222
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:36.130
the idea again that we saw in frost that the truth is something you arrive at

223
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:41.930
through reduction,
uh,
or,
uh,
in,

224
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:46.930
in Yates as little poem,
a coat.
Uh,
and,
and remember that,

225
00:16:46.931 --> 00:16:51.530
that Yates and frost are coming to these ideas.

226
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.680
And just the same time that a pound is finding these formulations for his own

227
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.630
poetics,
uh,
these ideas,
uh,

228
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.570
in frost,
in Steven's,
uh,
excuse me,
uh,
in frost and Yeates,

229
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:13.620
not in Steven's,
uh,
importantly,
uh,
and,
uh,
here,
uh,

230
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.590
centrally,
uh,

231
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.640
expressed by pound these ideas all point to a kind of radical skepticism in

232
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:25.820
modern poetry,
towards imagination and towards rhetoric.

233
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:31.340
Uh,
there's a skepticism about poetry's own Elysian making,

234
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.530
uh,
powers.
Uh,
there's a kind of linguistic skepticism here,
uh,

235
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.260
and,
and,
uh,
good poetry,
uh,
is,
um,

236
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.370
uh,
has,
has,
um,
uh,
it has a kind of aesthetic dimension,

237
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.450
a four pound or so it seems at this point.
Uh,

238
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.100
finally that third point about proximity,
uh,

239
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.950
that's important to what pounds says,
uh,

240
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.620
cause the kind of priority of the musical phrase over the sequence of the

241
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:03.960
metronome.
Um,

242
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.830
the musical phrase over kind of bigger,
uh,

243
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:10.470
and regularized pattern.
Uh,

244
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:13.080
that's a kind of privileging of the part,

245
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:18.320
the smaller thing,
uh,
over the whole,
uh,

246
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.000
and certainly over a repetition.

247
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.170
It's a privilege of individual detail over pattern or sequence.

248
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.950
Uh,
it's,
it's a,
a,
a privileging of,

249
00:18:30.951 --> 00:18:35.951
of this idea of the musical phrase over the abstract a or a kind of continuous

250
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:40.020
structure,
um,
which is,
which is viewed as,

251
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:43.760
as a kind of mechanical discipline.
Um,

252
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.880
all of these ideas are,
are rehearsed,
uh,
again,
uh,
by Amy Lowell,

253
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.580
uh,
and,
uh,

254
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.340
given sometimes somewhat different emphases and you can compare her,

255
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.950
uh,
account.
Well,

256
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.400
let's,
uh,
let's look at some of hds poems,

257
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.550
uh,
to,
uh,
see images him at work,
uh,

258
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.850
as it were,
uh,
at least,
uh,

259
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.100
as practiced by HD.

260
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.830
They,
a number of the early palms here,
uh,

261
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.550
in your anthology come from her book,
See Garden.

262
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.840
<v 0>Uh,
a wonderful and fascinating first book,
um,</v>

264
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:41.410
that imagines the poems themselves as constituting together a kind of well see

265
00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:45.780
garden.
I kind of enclosed,
uh,
space,
uh,

266
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:51.070
that offers reflection on symbolic objects that suggest a kind of allegory of

267
00:19:56.031 --> 00:20:01.031
poetic activity for HD in which flowers stand for kinds of poems,

268
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.970
certainly kinds of feeling,
uh,

269
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.200
and the garden itself constitutes a certain kind of pastoral,

270
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.250
imaginative space.
Uh,

271
00:20:12.251 --> 00:20:16.880
and a h d has a classical sources for this Greek models for this.

272
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.130
Uh,
and the,
the crucial poet for her,
uh,
is Sappho.

273
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.340
Uh,
and like Sappho,
uh,

274
00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.380
HD is a lyric poet of sexual desire.

275
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.600
Uh,
you,
you can see her,
her,
um,
uh,

276
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.750
translation of,
of Sappho fragments 68.

277
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.760
On page three 89,
uh,
let's look at the,
uh,

278
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:48.550
the Palm Garden three 90,
uh,

279
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.930
which gives a sense of,
of hds s aesthetic,

280
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.350
uh,
aesthetic aesthetic program.
Uh,

281
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.970
here,
there's an address to a,
to the rose,
uh,

282
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.730
traditional symbol of romantic beauty.
You are clear.
Oh,

283
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:14.560
rose,
cut in rock hard is the descent of Hale.

284
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.730
I could scrape the color from the pedals,

285
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.760
like spelt dying from a rock.

286
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.350
If I could break you,
I could break a tree.

287
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.880
If I could stir,
I could break a tree.

288
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.620
I could break you.
Oh,

289
00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:40.621
wind rand open the heat cut apart the heat rented it to tatters.

290
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.890
Fruit cannot drop through this thick air.

291
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.280
Fruit cannot fall into heat that presses up in blunts the points of pears and

292
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:55.480
rounds.
The grapes,
cut the heat,
plow through it,

293
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.990
turning it on either side of your path,

294
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.100
the rose image of romantic beauty.
You could compare it to,
uh,

295
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.530
uh,
the rose and in the eights,
his early poems.
Uh,

296
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:13.320
but here the images transformed.
Uh,

297
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.600
hds emphasis is not on its softness or sweetness or a sensual abundance.

298
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.190
It's richness of color or touch a instead,

299
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:29.170
the rose is clear and hard,
uh,
just as an image,

300
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:32.800
just poem is supposed to be.
It is cut in rock.

301
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.810
Ah,
you could compare it to,
uh,
uh,
see rose on,

302
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:39.330
on three 95.
The,

303
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:44.590
the page before rose harsh rose marred with stint of Pir pedals,

304
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:49.450
meager flower,
thin,
sparse of leaf,
where again,

305
00:22:49.451 --> 00:22:53.620
it seems a HD is writing about her poem,
uh,
in,

306
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:57.310
in its properties,
a stunted with small leaf.

307
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.860
You are flung on the sand,
you are lifted in the crisps and that drives them.

308
00:23:00.861 --> 00:23:01.690
The wind.

309
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.690
Can the spice rose drips such accurate fragrance hardened in a leaf.

310
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.820
This is a Po poetry that wishes to convey to us,
uh,

311
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:18.040
an accurate fragrance,
uh,
in,
in hardened forms,

312
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.630
uh,
in,
in garden.
Well

313
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:29.080
to,
uh,
HD is interested in,

314
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:34.060
in a kind of experience that is harsh or a stringent,
uh,

315
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:38.230
that,
uh,
would open itself to elemental forces,

316
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.960
uh,
here represented by the wind,
uh,
uh,
forces that,

317
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:48.650
that suggest human passion as much as weather,
uh,

318
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:53.060
and,
and,
uh,
that would transform,
uh,

319
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:55.480
and,
um,
uh,

320
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.380
transform the poets Torpor and,
and heat,
uh,
and,

321
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.670
and,
uh,
uh,
do so specifically through the action of cutting,

322
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.590
which is important,
uh,
here.
Uh,

323
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.880
and really in all these early poems,
hds poems,
uh,

324
00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:18.320
take place as a kind of lyric drama of Apostrophe Apostrophe,

325
00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:21.360
that is the act of address,
uh,

326
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.640
through which a a speaker finds her voice,
uh,

327
00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:29.990
by speaking in some relation to a part of the object world,

328
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:32.530
speaking to a thing,
uh,

329
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.340
which she identifies with or struggles against.
We're,
we're both,

330
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.810
uh,
as is the case.
I think in,
in the poems I've just read,

331
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.150
uh,
here,
here too,
you could see these,
these,
uh,
these images in,

332
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:51.810
in hds poems as a,
in some sense,
uh,
uh,

333
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.760
things subjective or objective to take pounds,
uh,

334
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.820
phrase the extreme compression of these poems expresses a kind of wish for

335
00:25:02.331 --> 00:25:07.280
intensity as if by compacting things you made them more fierce.

336
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.420
Uh,
sometimes a wish for braking or,
or cutting,
uh,
and,
and,

337
00:25:13.421 --> 00:25:14.660
and,
uh,
uh,

338
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:20.000
you might say fragmenting of things to get down to essential parts,

339
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.700
uh,
to do away with the,
um,

340
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:29.360
let's say the lassitude of mere rhetoric.
Uh,

341
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:33.980
and to cut to what is essential
well,

342
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:38.900
um,
or a ad is,
is,
uh,
maybe,
uh,
uh,

343
00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:42.320
hds most famous poem from

344
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.420
her early work,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
a poem,
um,

345
00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.623
<v 1>often</v>

346
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:56.140
<v 0>presented as,
as a,
um,
a paradigm of images them.</v>

347
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:58.723
<v 1>Uh,</v>

348
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.430
<v 0>if so it makes us see,
uh,</v>

349
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.230
images and in somewhat different terms from those pound presented.

350
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.830
Uh,
it is like the other pumps I've just been discussing,

351
00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:13.710
a kind of dramatic monologue,
uh,

352
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.760
which is not something that that pounds ideas emphasize.
Uh,

353
00:26:17.761 --> 00:26:22.680
here orient is the name for a wood Nymph and,

354
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:27.240
uh,
it indicates the speaker of the poem who says,
we're all up.

355
00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:31.800
See Whirl.
You're appointed pines,

356
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.250
splash your great pines on our rocks,

357
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.980
her earlier green over us.

358
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.280
Cover us with your pools of fur.

359
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.910
Again,
there's a,
a kind of,
uh,
uh,

360
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.080
lyric act of Apostrophe of address where,
uh,

361
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:53.730
what is implored,
uh,

362
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:58.280
would be a kind of overwhelming experience.
Uh,

363
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:02.880
who or what exactly is a oriented,
uh,

364
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.390
is this nymph addressing?
Uh,

365
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.990
it's hard to say.
Uh,

366
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:14.340
is she speaking in fact to the sea as she seems to be?

367
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:18.060
We're up,
see,
splash your pines over us,

368
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.130
or is she speaking to the woods and the pines as if they were the sea?

369
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.700
Uh,
I,
it's hard to decide.
Uh,
it is,

370
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.900
um,

371
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:38.030
a poem that presents a kind of enigma on that level,

372
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.620
uh,
and um,
uh,
doesn't,
uh,
uh,
resolve the question.

373
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.590
It provokes the very brevity of the palm,
uh,

374
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.620
expresses a kind of wish for intensity that is right on the edge of canceling

375
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:59.640
the poem.
You could say,
uh,
uh,
leaving us nothing there,
uh,

376
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:02.220
at all.
Um,
uh,

377
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:07.580
a speaker in this case who wishes to be covered up to be subject to a greater

378
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:12.570
force.
Uh,
and the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

379
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.750
palm leaves us with this cognitive problem.
Uh,

380
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.800
the difficulty of identifying what is figure or ground,

381
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.490
what is a literal or a,
what is a metaphor,

382
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.463
um,

383
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.480
that is whether she is speaking to c four pines,

384
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.740
seeing the seat like pines or the pines like the sea.

385
00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.830
Uh,
the pool is another,
uh,
enigmatic,
uh,

386
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.040
poem,
uh,
here,
uh,
uh,

387
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.050
one that poses questions.
Well,
this,
uh,

388
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:57.240
this problem that Ori add raises is in fact one that you see in other images,

389
00:28:57.241 --> 00:28:58.740
poems.
Um,

390
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.180
the question of what is literal and what is figurative.

391
00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.863
Um,

392
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:11.080
pound again,
uh,

393
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.730
theorizes this,
uh,
the,
the effects,
uh,

394
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.960
that I'm trying to describe,
uh,
in the,
uh,

395
00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.283
<v 1>middle</v>

396
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.960
<v 0>quotation on your handout,
he speaks of a,</v>

397
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.870
the idea of instantaneity or sudden this,

398
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.370
uh,

399
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:37.370
he talks about the palm as constituting a complex of elements held together,

400
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:43.400
uh,
made in some sense simultaneous with one another.
Uh,

401
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.880
rather,
you know,
as if as as,
uh,
uh,
Orient holds,

402
00:29:47.881 --> 00:29:52.881
see and pines together in a way that asks us to see these elements as joined a

403
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:01.170
pound says in images that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex

404
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.630
in an instant of time.
And it,

405
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.630
and when he uses that word complex that it has,
uh,
perhaps,
uh,

406
00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.280
certain,
uh,
resonances,
uh,
from psychoanalysis,
uh,

407
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.050
and also perhaps from,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

408
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.810
chemistry.
Uh,

409
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.830
it is the presentation of such a complex instantaneously,

410
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.250
which gives that sense of sudden liberation,

411
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
that sense of freedom from time limits in space limits that sense of sudden

412
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:40.990
growth,
which we experience in the presence of the greatest works of art.

413
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.490
And then he says,
one of my favorite quotations,

414
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.100
it is better to present one image in a lifetime.

415
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:51.850
Then to produce voluminous works,
uh,

416
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.430
um,
the,
uh,
uh,

417
00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.380
you could say oriented as a palm,
uh,
wishing for and,
and,

418
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.150
uh,
seeking that sense of sudden liberation that pound,
uh,

419
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:11.790
talks about here.
Uh,
it's important,
uh,

420
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.940
again,
that pound emphasizes a presentation.

421
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.970
It is the presentation rather than the representation of such a complex,

422
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.750
um,
as he describes it,
uh,

423
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.580
how his presentation different from representation

424
00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.190
for pound.
The literary image is not,
uh,

425
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.630
a memory of a prior reality,
a reflection,

426
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:41.710
but is rather,
it's something more like a new experience itself,

427
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:44.990
not an imitation of a thing.
Uh,

428
00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.840
but itself a kind of thing.
Uh,
again,
impound.
There's,
there's a,

429
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.210
there's a kind of as pound thinks about these things.

430
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:57.211
There's a drive specifically through technique to arrive at a kind of

431
00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:03.310
transparency beyond technique.
Uh,

432
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.680
this is also,
uh,
it should be emphasized a,
a,

433
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.760
a romantic project.
Uh,
uh,
the,
the image,

434
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.190
uh,
gives a kind of epiphany,

435
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:20.280
a visionary experience for both poet and reader gives us sudden liberation from

436
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.760
historical,
particularities of,

437
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.360
of place and of time.
Uh,

438
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.390
let's look at at lbs own poem,
uh,
in a station of the Metro,

439
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.220
uh,
which is on page three 51,
uh,
as a,
um,

440
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.353
uh,

441
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.250
important test case and example,

442
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.370
uh,
for this poetics.

443
00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.693
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.320
<v 0>It has the honor of being the,
the uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

445
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.200
shortest famous palm and modern poetry.

446
00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:10.130
You can memorize it,
uh,

447
00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.430
in a station of the metro.

448
00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:15.510
<v 1>Okay.</v>

449
00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.500
<v 0>And,
and wonderfully when I've said the title,</v>

450
00:33:17.501 --> 00:33:20.160
I've already said a third of the palm,
uh,

451
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.110
the apparition of these faces in the crowd,

452
00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.800
petals on a wet black bough

453
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.360
in a station of the metro.

454
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.720
The apparition of these faces in the crowd,
semi-colon,

455
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.860
petals on a wet black bough,

456
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.560
not many elements.
The title,
how does it function?

457
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.460
Uh,
it functions as a kind of locator.
Uh,

458
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:57.610
it places us somewhere.
It places us specifically in the Paris underground,

459
00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:00.310
in a station of the metro.

460
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:03.343
<v 1>Uh,</v>

461
00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:08.140
<v 0>as I said that that title really is,
um,</v>

462
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.750
well you could understand it as a standing outside the palm or really as a part

463
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:17.330
of the poem itself.

464
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.800
Lines one and two,
again,

465
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.690
pose for us this question of what is the figure and what is the ground,

466
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.700
what is being observed and what does it,
what does,
uh,
what does the metaphor,
uh,

467
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.080
it is generating?

468
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.160
Are we in fact well are these,

469
00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:42.910
is pound observing faces and comparing them to petals on a wet black bough?

470
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.550
Uh,
is he seeing both those things in some sense?

471
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:51.950
Uh,

472
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.630
we have here two elements joined and compressed radically.

473
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.483
<v 1>MMM,</v>

474
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:06.110
<v 0>probably it's wrong to speak here of metaphor or for that matter similarly,</v>

475
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:12.150
uh,
but rather we can use the word the pound is this image,
uh,

476
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.540
or as he would later call it idiot Graham,

477
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.720
a borrowing from his ideas about Chinese writing.

478
00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.560
Uh,
the key to this poem,
uh,
as,
uh,

479
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.830
two other pounding in palms is syntax.

480
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:34.680
Syntax is the temporal ordering of language.
Uh,

481
00:35:34.681 --> 00:35:37.860
the ordering of a sentence is unfolding.
Consequently,

482
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:41.790
the definition of its elements and the relationships among them.

483
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:48.120
Uh,
pound has here a kind of abbreviated para taxes.

484
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.340
That is a syntax of series here.
Uh,
only two elements,

485
00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.250
uh,
are in that series.
A,

486
00:35:56.251 --> 00:36:00.600
the series is joined by an and usually,
uh,

487
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:05.370
but here there is no end.
Uh,
here are the syntax is a compressed,

488
00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:05.850
uh,

489
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:10.850
in the service of rendering what is ineffective new kind of perception,

490
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.780
a perception that is modern urban of the crowd,

491
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.220
momentary,

492
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:22.730
but also as pound conceives it timeless pointing us elusively to historical and

493
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:32.580
cultural overlays.
We're in Paris,

494
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.600
but this literary form draws on Japanese verse models and Japanese pictorial

495
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:41.634
aesthetics.

496
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:47.580
The time is now the present these faces,

497
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.470
uh,

498
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:54.210
this is self consciously an image or picture of modernity,

499
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.910
but it's also the picture of an underground that inevitably recalls the

500
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:04.680
classical underworld.
And so,
uh,

501
00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:09.681
also recalls the long poetic history of comparing dead souls to leaves,

502
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:15.330
which you find in homer Virgil,
Dante,

503
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.110
Milton,
uh,
here.
Uh,

504
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.120
it says if an epic simile from one of those great poems had been taken out,

505
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.040
uh,
and,
and presented,
uh,
to us,
uh,

506
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.230
in fragmentary form all of this,
this,

507
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:36.231
this kind of a rich allusive overlay is created through a kind of stripping down

508
00:37:38.161 --> 00:37:42.720
to the poems,
uh,
essential primary elements.
Uh,

509
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.400
pan gives us the story of the poems composition here,
uh,
which,

510
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:52.300
whether it's true or not a is an important poetic fable.
Uh,

511
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:57.090
uh,
that,
that in a sense stands behind this poem he says three years ago.

512
00:37:57.091 --> 00:37:58.470
And your footnote in Paris,

513
00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.710
I got out of a metro train and Lacan could and saw suddenly a beautiful face and

514
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:07.470
then another and another and then a beautiful child's face.

515
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:12.030
And then another beautiful woman,
you know,
a whole series.
Uh,

516
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.770
uh,
and I tried all that day to find words for what this had meant to me.

517
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.520
And I could not find any words that seemed to me worthy or as lovely as that

518
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:22.050
sudden emotion.
Again.

519
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:27.110
Suddenness and that evening I was still trying and I found suddenly another

520
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:32.850
experience of sudden this,
the expression I do not mean that I've found words,

521
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:37.390
but there came an equation,
not speech,
but in the little splotches of color.

522
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.360
The one image palm is a form of,
uh,
uh,
super position.

523
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.970
That is to say,
it is one idea,

524
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.260
a getting out of the impasse in which I had been left by my metro emotion.

525
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.910
I wrote a 30 line pump and destroyed it.
Six months later,
I made a poem.

526
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:56.920
Half that length,
a year later,

527
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:01.990
I made the following Hoku like Haiku,
like sentence.
Uh,

528
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.160
so,
uh,
there interestingly,

529
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:11.280
this poem that purports to present and present again is the right word rather

530
00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:16.930
than represent,
uh,
a moment of intense,
vivid,

531
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.140
spontaneous emotion is arrived at as pound describes it through laborious

532
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:26.260
technique,
uh,
and over time,
uh,
and,

533
00:39:26.261 --> 00:39:31.240
and that technique is concentrated specifically on what compression,

534
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.590
cutting things down and eliminating words,

535
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:41.320
uh,
again,
uh,
as in frost mowing,
uh,
uh,
uh,

536
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:46.240
the truth is,
is something you get down to a by cutting away rhetorical ornament.

537
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.773
Um,

538
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.030
pound takes Japanese and Chinese.

539
00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:56.410
Poetry's a as models for this aesthetics of compression.

540
00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.510
And,
uh,
it's worth stressing that,
uh,

541
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.440
on the one hand pound is,
is polemically,
uh,

542
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.140
writing and protest against late 19th century,
uh,

543
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:12.790
drawing rooms that are crowded with brick or brack and the ornamental

544
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:15.790
aestheticism of,
uh,
uh,

545
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.180
well of poets such as Swinburne or even the early Yates,

546
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:23.740
uh,
and yet pounds taste for Japanese.

547
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:28.360
And Chinese art comes right out of a Victorian decadence.
Uh,

548
00:40:28.361 --> 00:40:31.490
and,
and well,
you can,
you can see this yourselves.
Uh,

549
00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.830
if you look at the paintings,
uh,
of James Whistler and others,

550
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.750
uh,
pound is,
is,
uh,
um,

551
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:43.750
a polemical modernist artists who was also really a,

552
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.480
as he looks right here,
a Victorian decadent,

553
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.560
uh,
for pound,
um,

554
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:55.650
compression in Japanese and Chinese,
uh,
poems,
uh,

555
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:57.730
means implication.

556
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:02.430
And that's what he's really interested in getting at.
Uh,
in your,
uh,

557
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.360
Ras handout a,

558
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:09.361
you'll see his translation of leap pose a jewel stairs grievance as pound

559
00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:14.280
renders it,
uh,
in in pounds handling.

560
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.370
He says the jeweled steps are already quite white with do.

561
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.010
Again,
this is a dramatic monologue.

562
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.340
It is so late that the do soaks my gauze stockings and I let down the crystal

563
00:41:27.461 --> 00:41:31.750
curtain and watched the moon through the clear autumn

564
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:37.910
and then pound,
uh,
ever the,
uh,
teacher,
uh,

565
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:42.350
in his poems as elsewhere says,
uh,
I'm,
I'm,
uh,

566
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.950
in his,
uh,
uh,
presentation of this poem.

567
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:50.930
Note a jewel stairs,
therefore a palace grievance.

568
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.640
Therefore,
there's something to complain of Gauze stockings.

569
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.540
Therefore,
a court lady was doing the complaining,
not a servant,

570
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.890
a WHO complains clear autumn.
Therefore,
he,

571
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:08.120
he for whom she was waiting has no excuse on account of the weather.

572
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:14.510
Also,
she has come early for the do,
has not merely whiten the stairs,

573
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:16.190
but has soaked her stockings.

574
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.110
The poem is especially prize because she utters no direct reproach,
uh,

575
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.620
here,
uh,
as pound,
uh,
unfolds it for us.
Uh,
does,

576
00:42:26.621 --> 00:42:31.621
is explaining for us the human situ situation is inferred from the scene,

577
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.670
uh,
because it is so exactly rendered,
uh,

578
00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:40.671
in the power of sentiment is felt not through its direct expression,

579
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:43.520
but rather through a kind of deliberate restraint.

580
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:47.240
The palm is a specially priced because she utters no direct reproach.

581
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.850
A narrative here in this palm as an other instances of,

582
00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:54.350
um,
uh,

583
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:59.120
pounds work is displaced by the pictorial or,
or you might say,

584
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:03.220
is it's not so much displaced as condensed in it.
Uh,
uh,

585
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.270
all that matters of the story of a lover's grief can be told in a quatrain.

586
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.720
Well,
uh,
I'm going to finish in just a moment,

587
00:43:11.721 --> 00:43:16.721
but I want to suggest a further dimension to,

588
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.230
uh,
this,
um,
uh,
aesthetic that I'm trying to describe,

589
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:26.690
uh,
in other translations from the Chinese,
uh,

590
00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.190
pound who didn't know Chinese.
Uh,
and I'll,

591
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:34.800
I'll say a little bit more about that next time.
Uh,

592
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:39.650
builds a kind of layered narrative out of discreet images,
uh,

593
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.900
and finds a way to innocence,

594
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.310
not simply create a poetry,
radical compression,

595
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:51.170
but rather a poetry that expands out of,
uh,
this,

596
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:55.820
uh,
image.
Just stick a basis.
Uh,
the river merchant's wife,

597
00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.210
a letter on three 52 a is an example.

598
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:03.560
It's one of the really great love poems of modern poetry.
Uh,

599
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.870
like the jeweled stairs grievance.

600
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:10.280
It is a dramatic monologue for a female speaker.
Uh,

601
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.330
but these are different poems.
By the end of this one,

602
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:18.760
the wife speaks very directly,
uh,
not in reproach,
uh,

603
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.130
but in self knowledge and paint desire,

604
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.570
the leaves fall early.
This autumn in wind,

605
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:32.590
the paired butterflies are already yellow with August over the grass and the

606
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.110
West Garden.
They hurt me.
I grow older.

607
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.970
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river king,

608
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:46.650
please let me know beforehand and I will come out to meet you.

609
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:48.270
As far as [inaudible]

610
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.210
of the,
of the paired yellow butterflies,

611
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.410
the wife says with sublime simplicity,
they hurt me.

612
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.090
I grow older.

613
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.130
It's possible to forget that the speaker who says this is 16,

614
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.780
not 36.
Uh,
but her age makes no difference.

615
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:15.020
She is already grasping as you two will have through in this case the pain of

616
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:18.780
her separation from her husband that uh,

617
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.410
the essential experience of living in time is lost with this recognition.

618
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.780
Pound's poem,
uh,
reaches out of the confines of its images,

619
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:33.300
him towards something much larger.
Uh,

620
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:37.820
and at the same time you see him carrying forward the,
uh,

621
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.290
the images.
It's don'ts.
Uh,

622
00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:43.290
this poem is a direct treatment of feeling.

623
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.420
It uses absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.
And,

624
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.170
uh,
it is composed in the sequence of the musical phrase,

625
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.770
not that of the metronome with those,
uh,

626
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.170
dramatically varying line lengths,

627
00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:03.890
how pound develop this poetics on a truly grand scale.

628
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:08.170
And the role that translation played in it.
Uh,

629
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:12.390
these are things I'll discuss next time when we turn to the beginning of his

630
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:14.520
epic poem.
The cantos.
