WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.350
Is private ritual possible.
This is,
um,

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.150
this is a kind of oxymoron,
a private ritual,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.740
because ritual is or should be,
uh,

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.660
precisely something that's collective and shared.
Um,
uh,

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.670
is it possible for

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.280
the individual to,
uh,
produce,
uh,

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.310
some kind of a shared patterning of experience such as ritual represents,

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.440
um,
for Freud,
uh,
who is,
uh,
of course,

9
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.580
I think are in the background of,
um,

10
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.300
the wasteland and all of the poetry that we're reading.
And,
uh,

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.820
thinking about this,
uh,
semester,
uh,
private ritual meant neurosis,

12
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.190
uh,
sickness of a kind,
um,
some kind of,

13
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.690
um,
uh,
derangement,
uh,
and indeed,

14
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.400
uh,
the wasteland,
which is a,

15
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:07.200
a poem that in certain ways tries to imagine forms of private,

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.550
of form of private ritual or at least struggles with this question,

17
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.720
uh,

18
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.460
was certainly considered by some readers to be an erotic poem.

19
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.323
Um,

20
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.970
I began by last time by talking about that first,

21
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.050
uh,
verse paragraph a of the poem.

22
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.900
Why don't we go back there?
Uh,
that's,
um,

23
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.300
on four 74,
uh,
in your anthology.

24
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.093
Uh,

25
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.020
I'll try to talk about the poem,
uh,
in,
in sequence,
uh,

26
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.010
from,
uh,
for section two last,
uh,
and,

27
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:54.080
and at least tell you some of the ways in which I make sense of it.
Uh,
and,

28
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:58.950
and this may be,
I hope,
helpful to you,
uh,
in,

29
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.740
in the,
this first section,
the burial of the dead.

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.110
Um,
we have,
um,
well when I think of as,

31
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.680
as a series of preliminary statements,
uh,

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.330
about the poems,
ames,
uh,
what it seeks a,

33
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:22.530
what it
would gesture towards or move towards,

34
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.730
uh,
they include,
well,
some form of ecstasy.
Uh,

35
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.070
I think Maurice sled ride,
uh,
is,

36
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:36.000
is the experience of personal freedom,
uh,
in its modest way.

37
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.250
Um,
uh,
in the mountains there you feel free.
Uh,
she says,

38
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.150
uh,
uh,
recalling,
um,
that experience,

39
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.860
uh,
prophecy,
uh,

40
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.870
the poem a introduces us to prophesy in the second verse,

41
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.020
paragraph,
uh,
freedom,
I suppose,
uh,

42
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.480
intimacy between people.
Uh,

43
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.290
some kind of meaningful coherence.
Uh,

44
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.210
all of these

45
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.080
possibilities of experience are a,

46
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.100
as it were glimpsed in the poem in this beginning glimpsed a and then withdrawn

47
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.000
or blocked or parodied,
um,

48
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.790
Marie sled.
Uh,
well isn't that a,
um,

49
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.800
a kind of a figure for letting go?
Um,

50
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.810
and um,
well,
uh,
for release,
uh,
and,
and,

51
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.960
and for trust,
uh,
uh,

52
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.920
an experience as I say,
of of freedom.

53
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.620
Um,
ultimately,
uh,

54
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.690
in what the thunder said,

55
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.580
the poem will again return to those specific themes,
uh,

56
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:02.220
when,
um,
um,
uh,
it interprets,
uh,

57
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.160
those,
um,
uh,
Sanskrit words,

58
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:09.760
not a dyad vom and so on.
Well,

59
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.920
uh,
in the second paragraph of the poem is her second stroph fee.

60
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.630
If you,
if you like,
um,
we,
uh,

61
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.010
we're introduced to this through wasteland landscape.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

62
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
it's a kind of landscape that the poem returns to at different points.

63
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.780
Uh,
what are the roots that plush,

64
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.290
what branches grow out of this Stoney rubbish,

65
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.770
son of man,
you cannot say,
or guests for,
you know,

66
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:43.771
only a heap of broken images where the sun beats in the dead tree gives no

67
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.790
shelter.
The cricket,
no relief.
And the dry stone.

68
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.840
No sound of water.
Uh,

69
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.480
excuse me.
Um,
here.
Um,

70
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.470
well we,
we have a kind of symbolic representation of kind of,
uh,

71
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.700
a modernist iconography if you like,

72
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.080
of a spiritual state.
Uh,
one of desiccation.

73
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.680
It's,
it is as it were,

74
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:19.681
a kind of picture of the mental space inhabited by the people that we'll meet in

75
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.680
this poem.
Um,
it's,

76
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.240
well they're there.

77
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:30.130
There's a quotations here as your notes from Elliot and then your editor,

78
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.420
uh,
explained from Ezekiel.
Uh,

79
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.870
the poem is drawing on a prophetic language and giving its own form of prophecy,

80
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.700
uh,
but as he keel here is,
is secularized in this,
uh,
uh,

81
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.230
context.
And,
uh,

82
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.260
you might look at this as something more like a quotation from prophecy rather

83
00:05:56.081 --> 00:06:00.240
than prophecy itself.
Uh,

84
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.633
here,

85
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.650
the poems general concern with,
with,
with,
uh,
a spiritual state that,

86
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.350
let me call the withdrawal of God is represented as,
as I say,

87
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:19.670
as dryness,
as dryness and as fragmentation.

88
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.700
Uh,
what we have is stony rubbish,

89
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.890
a heap of broken images where the Sun Beats,
uh,

90
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.210
here,
you know,
w w we've got to kind of fragment of,

91
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.830
of sacred text itself.
Uh,
you know,
if you like a bit of rubbish,

92
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.710
um,
uh,
eh,
that has that,

93
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.500
that's part of the palms heap of broken images,
uh,

94
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.580
that we will explore.
Uh,

95
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.930
the withdrawal of God,
uh,
in the poem,
um,
is,

96
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.810
is a kind of fall into fragmentation,
uh,

97
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.900
where experience,
uh,
doesn't cohere,
uh,

98
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.590
where,
uh,
there's dryness.
Uh,

99
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.180
there's no connectivity,
there's no fluidity.

100
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.080
Um,
the

101
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.160
palm then moves abruptly,
uh,
and,
and the poem,
you know,

102
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:26.840
moves that this kind of exhilarating a abruptness,
uh,

103
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.400
throughout,
uh,
between kinds of language,
uh,
here,

104
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.061
uh,

105
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:37.061
introducing Wagner and a little quotation from,

106
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.400
uh,
a quad train,
uh,
from the,
uh,
Libretto,
uh,

107
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.440
for Tristan and Isolde,
uh,

108
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.030
translated for us.
Uh,
uh,

109
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:53.720
fresh blows the wind to the homeland.
My Irish Darling,

110
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.730
where are you waiting?
Um,
uh,
is old.
Uh,

111
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.710
here's this,
this song,
and it's a,
it's a kind of,
uh,
uh,

112
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.220
well song of a longing,

113
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.060
a as she goes off to marry the wrong man.

114
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.360
Um,
uh,

115
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.820
this Wagner text,
uh,
and,
and the little quotation from it,
uh,

116
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.290
down below,
uh,
again,
another quotation from Wagner,

117
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:28.880
uh,
[inaudible],
um,
is,
uh,
uh,

118
00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.800
a more sinister and haunting,
uh,
phrase,
uh,

119
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.300
maybe,
uh,
translated as a waste and,

120
00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:42.200
and empty the sea or desolate and empty the sea here.
Um,

121
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.790
this frame's a little vignette and a little little scene,

122
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.450
uh,
a dialogue or part of a dialogue.
Uh,

123
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.220
you gave me hyacinths first a year ago.

124
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.930
They called me the highest and girl,

125
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.820
and then out of that quotation,
the poem,
uh,

126
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.540
now speaks to us as it were more directly,
um,

127
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.550
without quotation marks.
Yet when we came back late from the hyacinth garden,

128
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.530
your arms full in your hair wet.

129
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.160
I could not speak and my eyes failed.

130
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.140
I was neither living or dead and I knew nothing.
Looking into the heart of light,

131
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.420
the silence,
a kind of ecstatic,
uh,
vision.
Uh,
but here,
one of us,

132
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:35.190
certain,
uh,
perhaps frightening emptiness,

133
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.560
uh,
where,
um,
uh,
a,
uh,

134
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:45.040
um,
a couple presumably,
um,
have,

135
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.760
um,
had some kind of,
uh,
exchange,
uh,

136
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:55.650
that leaves the speaker,
uh,
with this particular vision of,

137
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.510
uh,
the heart of light and silence,
the,
um,
uh,

138
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.700
references to,
uh,
the flower,
the highest synth,

139
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.920
a call up,
the,
uh,
uh,

140
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.020
the whole system of images of April and spring.
That the poem,
uh,

141
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.150
we'll play on a as well as the,
uh,
uh,

142
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.780
story of hyacinth,
uh,
from,
um,
the metamorphosis.

143
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.230
Uh,
and,
uh,
your,
your editor here,

144
00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:29.940
we'll explain that Apollo loved and accidentally killed hyacinth,

145
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.360
uh,
from his blood,
sprang the flower named for him,

146
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:38.160
inscribed with I a cry of grief.
Um,
here,

147
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.660
uh,
love,
uh,
is associated with killing,
uh,

148
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.240
and with um,
uh,
also with,
with a kind of,
um,

149
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.340
uh,
generation,
uh,

150
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.230
though of a painful,
uh,
and um,

151
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.190
uh,
disturbing kind,
uh,
here.

152
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.680
The,
the,
the general,
you know,

153
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.900
wasteland space with what I'm calling the kind of space of God's absence,

154
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.110
uh,
becomes a space between two people,
two lovers,
um,

155
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.920
and,
uh,
a,

156
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.820
it seems some form of missed connection,

157
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.540
uh,
as a sequence.
Uh,
these lines I've just been talking about like the poem,
uh,

158
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.600
as a whole,
uh,
advanced by collage.
Uh,
they,

159
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:33.570
they make a kind of argument,
they make a kind of sense,

160
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.970
but perhaps not in the ways that we're used to.
Um,
the,

161
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:43.971
these materials together I think suggests that the loss of common experience

162
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.310
that comes with,
uh,
the withdrawal of God is,

163
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.380
is played out between people in their relationships where God was,

164
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.310
uh,
sex is,
uh,
or,
uh,

165
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:05.000
you could say that the loss of,
of collective and shareable meanings,
which,
uh,

166
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:10.030
results,
uh,
in the privacy of our mental experience,
our dreams,

167
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:12.670
our aspirations,
memories,
poems,

168
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.900
difficult palms is represented here in this poem by the irreducibly private and

169
00:12:21.521 --> 00:12:25.690
therefore anguishing nature of sexuality.

170
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.810
And this is,
uh,
uh,

171
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.020
a theme that the palm we'll return to again and again.
Uh,

172
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.570
instead of a reciprocity,
uh,

173
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:41.860
and some kind of mutuality in human relations,
we find,

174
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.840
um,
uh,
people doing kinds of violence to each other,

175
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.100
uh,
dominating each other,
uh,
finding,
uh,

176
00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.670
incompleteness in their unions.

177
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.090
The poem then moves on,
uh,

178
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:03.040
two again with a kind of exhilarating shift of register reference to a comic

179
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:07.120
figure.
Madam Psas.
So stress,
a famous clairvoyant,
uh,

180
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:09.430
with a bad cold.
Uh,

181
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.390
I think of Madams assisters often in the winter.
Um,

182
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.820
she,
um,
is nevertheless known to be the wisest woman,
uh,
in Europe,

183
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.100
and she has a wicked pack of cards.
Um,
and what does she produce?
Well,

184
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.990
uh,
here said she is your car,
the drowned Phoenician sailor,

185
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.093
who is you,

186
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.090
perhaps ourselves,
the reader,
perhaps the poet.

187
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.940
Uh,
those are pearls that were his eyes.
Look,
here is Bella Donna,

188
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.940
the Lady of the rocks,
the lady of situations.

189
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.100
Here's the man with three staves,
uh,
and here the wheel and so on.

190
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.140
Uh,
and something,
uh,
that she has forbidden to see.

191
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:03.670
I do not find the hanged man.
Fear,
death by water.

192
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:08.740
I see crowds of people walking around and a ring.
Thank you.

193
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.520
If you see dear Mrs equitone teller,

194
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.580
I bring the horoscope myself when must be so careful these days.

195
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.790
Uh,
this,
this is a wonderful passage.
Uh,

196
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.140
here it's doing a number of different things.
Uh,

197
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:30.210
the horoscope seems Alaska kind of a debased modern form,

198
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.470
uh,
of,
uh,
a modern system of interpretation,

199
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.490
a way of understanding the self,
uh,

200
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.390
very is in these lines of kind of parody of a cultism,

201
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.720
which would include perhaps a parody of Yeats.
Uh,

202
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.590
although a Yates is a vision,
wasn't yet

203
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.240
at the same time even while the palm is parotic.
Uh,
it's serious too,
uh,

204
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.040
because in this kind of ad hoc,
uh,

205
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.100
somewhat fanciful and crazy way the power madam,
so,

206
00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:10.220
so stress is cards is producing images that,
uh,
uh,

207
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.290
Elliot is dealing us,
uh,

208
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:16.550
and that he will collect in the course of the poem and try to make some sense
of,

209
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.410
uh,
in the,
uh,
collage that is,
uh,
the,
uh,
the wasteland,

210
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.330
uh,
including,
uh,
among those cards,
the drowned Phoenician sailor,

211
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.680
uh,
who will return for us in that little section death by water.

212
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.120
Um,
the,
uh,
uh,

213
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.590
well I,
I like to think of Eliot himself,
uh,

214
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.740
as Mrs Equitone,
uh,
that is,
um,

215
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.010
because he's so difficult to read in his tone.
Uh,
and,
uh,

216
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.500
uh,
after all,
um,
it's a,
in a sense,
um,
nurses equitone who's,

217
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:59.120
who's,
who's getting this stuff and it's going to try to do something with it.

218
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.790
Well,
um,
part one,

219
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.290
uh,
the burial of the dead ends,
uh,
with another,
uh,

220
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.420
instance of scene setting.
Now this,
the sort of,
um,

221
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:16.700
uh,

222
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.700
symbolic iconography of the dry landscape is going to be overlaid on another

223
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.750
landscape,
which is metropolitan London,

224
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:32.470
unreal city.
This is
Elliot's,

225
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.440
uh,

226
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.440
evocative name for the urban space that the poem,

227
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.910
uh,
represents unreal city under the brown fog of a winter.
Dawn,

228
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.340
a crowd float over London bridge.

229
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.760
So many I had not thought death had undone.

230
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:53.360
So many size,
shorten and frequent.

231
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.750
We're exhaled in each man fixed his eyes before his feet float up the hill and

232
00:17:00.501 --> 00:17:03.020
down in a rhyming couplet,

233
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:08.050
King William Street to where Saint Mary Woolnough kept the hours with the dead

234
00:17:08.061 --> 00:17:10.190
sound.
On the final stroke of nine,

235
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.690
you go to the note and in Elliot says,

236
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.500
a phenomenon which I've often noticed a just in case you were wondering whether

237
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:25.280
he's in the scene or not a well here.
Um,
we are,

238
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:30.160
uh,
being introduced,
uh,
to,
uh,
the metropolis,
uh,

239
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.340
which as I say is,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

240
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.840
the scene of the wasteland.
Um,
it's the,
uh,

241
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.820
it's where the events of the poem will take place more or less.

242
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.430
Uh,
what,
um,
uh,
what,

243
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.290
what we're seeing here are people going to work,
um,

244
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.560
people that we're going to see later in effect in the palm.
Uh,
uh,

245
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.590
the typist in the young man carbon killer must be crossing the bridge to,

246
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.130
uh,
or the people that we'll meet in the pub and so on.

247
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.240
Um,
there's,
um,

248
00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:16.260
a kind of strange mixing here of the dead and the living of the apocalyptic and

249
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:22.060
the utterly ordinary,
uh,
Elliot then,
uh,

250
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.770
moves with,
you know,
again,
uh,
uh,

251
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.350
no framing,
uh,
uh,
that would help us to say there,

252
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.460
I saw one I knew,
and then who of course is this I who's speaking to us?

253
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.230
We don't really know.
Um,
I saw one I knew and stopped him crying.

254
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:43.980
Stetson,
you were with me in the ships at my lai.

255
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.390
That corpse he planted last year in your garden.
Has it begun to sprout?

256
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.740
Will it bloom this year?
A hyacinth perhaps,

257
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.260
uh,
or has the sudden frost disturbed it's bed.
Oh,

258
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:02.190
keep the dog far.
Hence that's friend to men or with his nails.

259
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:07.170
He'll dig it up again.
You HIPO Crete Lecter Molson blob of more flair.

260
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.360
He says,
quoting a bud lair,
uh,
at the very end,
uh,

261
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.440
bursting out with it.
Uh,
it's,
it's a,
uh,
again,

262
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.920
fascinating turn that the poem takes.
Um,

263
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:25.030
there is perhaps a kind of a glimpse of the still echoing world war in the here

264
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:31.030
imagined hailing of,
um,

265
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.900
one man who knew another in battle.
Um,
uh,

266
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.980
that is,
uh,
uh,
the ships at,
at,
at,
uh,
uh,

267
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.930
my lie that the,
um,
um,
um,
uh,

268
00:19:45.931 --> 00:19:50.100
where they last met.
Um,
excuse me.

269
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.030
Um,
there's,
um,

270
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.820
here another instance of exchange between,

271
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.050
uh,
to,
uh,
people,
uh,
here.
Um,

272
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.600
there's,
there's a way in which that first person's addressed to Stetson,

273
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.710
um,
uh,

274
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.960
plays upon parodies.
Uh,

275
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:20.490
if you like the poets relation to you or to me,
uh,
the reader,

276
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.300
there's a here a,
a general,
uh,

277
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.920
problem or question of how to make each other out,
um,

278
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.570
how to recognize and,
uh,
uh,
acknowledge,

279
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.880
um,
the relation between brothers or some blobs,

280
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:43.200
um,
uh,
as,
as,
uh,
uh,
but,
uh,
layer,
uh,

281
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.500
would have us,
um,
call them.
Um,

282
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.230
the little glimpse of war and the war dead perhaps that,

283
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.500
uh,
we get,
uh,
in these lines
will,

284
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:04.510
um,
throughout the rest of the poem,
um,
turn into a,

285
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:08.740
a postwar,
uh,
vision of,
um,

286
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.270
again,
war between the sexes and war between people.

287
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.130
Um,
most immediately in a game of chess,
uh,

288
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:22.510
the second section,
which is built around two conversations,

289
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.630
the first takes place in,
uh,

290
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.630
a well to do drawing room the second,
uh,
in a pub.

291
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:37.930
Um,
there's,
uh,
much to a contemplate in the opening,

292
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.060
uh,
description of that,
um,
uh,
home,

293
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.320
uh,
where the,
uh,
uh,
we'll,
we'll hear these,

294
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.500
these two characters speaking and thinking,
uh,
in a moment,
uh,

295
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:54.340
one that is important and recurs,
uh,
often,
uh,

296
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.930
in the scene when detail that recurs often in the palm,

297
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.680
uh,
is the,
uh,
image of a,
a male,
uh,

298
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.390
around line 98 as though a window,
or,
excuse me,

299
00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:08.380
let me go a little bit further.

300
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:13.381
Above the antique mantle was displayed a picture as though a window gave upon

301
00:22:14.081 --> 00:22:17.400
the sylvan seeing the change of filler ml.
Another,
uh,

302
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.910
Videon metamorphosis by the barbarous king.
So rudely forced,

303
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.360
uh,
fill a mill,
uh,
raped by a,
uh,

304
00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.120
terrorists is,
um,
uh,

305
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.570
transformed into the Nightingale.
Um,

306
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.980
yet they're the Nightingale filled all the desert with inviolable voice.

307
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:40.930
Suddenly where Elliot has,

308
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.680
has brought us into this dining room to see this picture.

309
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.370
And now we're in the picture,
uh,
listening to,
uh,

310
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:53.170
the Nightingale filling all the desert,
this wasteland space with a kind of,

311
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.560
uh,
again,
song of complaint,

312
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.470
a kind of lyric voice.
Um,

313
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.430
that's called here inviolable and still she cried.

314
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.740
And still the world pursues jug jug to dirty ears,

315
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:14.130
a jug jug being the conventional representation of the Nightingale Gail song in

316
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.860
a Elizabeth and poetry.
Well,
um,

317
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:26.230
there are,
uh,
this is,
uh,
you know,
again,
uh,
in image of,

318
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.740
um,

319
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.740
sexual violence that produces a particular kind of a lyric utterance.

320
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.550
Um,
it is,
uh,
a kind of,
um,

321
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.080
motif that recurs in the poem.

322
00:23:38.081 --> 00:23:43.081
It's also a way of imaging the poem itself as a kind of,

323
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.960
uh,
uh,
inviolable voice that emerges,
uh,
from,

324
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.000
um,
some kind of,
um,
um,

325
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.370
vision of erotic,
um,
violation.

326
00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.800
Uh,
the conversation that follows if it's a conversation,

327
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.780
uh,
we really only have what we,

328
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.700
what we have is one speaker speaking in quotation marks and the other speaking

329
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.480
without quotation marks.
Um,
what does that mean?

330
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.610
Presumably the one speaker that we,
uh,

331
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.120
overhear that seems to be female,
uh,

332
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.150
we're hearing her speak,
uh,
when we,

333
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.710
when those quotation marks disappear probably for the man speech,

334
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.660
um,
that would seem to represent some kind of interiorized speech.

335
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.730
Uh,
some kind of thought,
uh,
my nerves are bad tonight.
Yes.
Bad.

336
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.720
Stay with me.
Speak to me.
Why do you never speak,
speak?

337
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.300
What are you thinking of?
What thinking what?
I never know what you're thinking.

338
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.213
Think

339
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.240
I think we heard in rats alley where the dead men lost their bones.

340
00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.070
What is that noise?
The wind under the door.

341
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.920
What is that noise?
Now?
What is the noise doing?
Excuse me.

342
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.330
What does the wind doing?
Nothing again.
Nothing.

343
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.230
Another phrase that will recur in the poem.
Do you know nothing?

344
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.700
Do you see nothing?
Do you remember nothing I remember.

345
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.920
Those are pearls that were his eyes.
Are you alive or not?

346
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.300
Is there nothing in your head?
But Oh,

347
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:30.770
that Shakespearian rag.
It's so elegant,
so intelligent.

348
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.890
What shall I do now?
What shall I do?

349
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.930
Quotations there from Prufrock,
right?
Uh,

350
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.830
I shall rush out as I am and walk the street with my hair down.

351
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:46.820
So here Prufrock's questions are being answered.
Perhaps.

352
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.680
What should we do tomorrow?
What shall we ever do?
The hot water at 10.

353
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:54.440
And if it rains a closed car at four,

354
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.870
and we shall play a game of chess,

355
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.340
pressing lidless eyes and waiting for knock upon the door.

356
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.110
Uh,
this is,
uh,

357
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.370
often understood as a version of an evening at the Elliot's,

358
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.910
uh,
the,
uh,
female speaker,
uh,

359
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:19.490
is being satirized.
Uh,
surely she's a frightening,

360
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.560
uh,
but surely also her companion.
Uh,

361
00:26:24.561 --> 00:26:29.320
they're driving each other mad.
Uh,
it's a kind of fully,
uh,

362
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.080
uh,
the,
uh,
um,

363
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.600
first person here speaks for a kind of state that

364
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.690
other people experience in the poem.

365
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.920
And that first persons in this poem a experience that is the condition of having

366
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.930
nothing in your head.
Uh,

367
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.350
nothing almost constituting something,
uh,
again,

368
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.820
nothing being a kind of wasteland,
but in that wasteland.

369
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.450
Nevertheless,
there persist certain kinds of rubbish,
uh,

370
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.010
fragments,
bits of language as in Prufrock's consciousness.
Uh,

371
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:13.680
and this speaker recalls,
first of all,
when pressed,

372
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:20.040
those are pearls that were his eyes,
a quotation from the tempest.

373
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.090
Um,
a quotation from aerial song that

374
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.300
holds out,
uh,
some image of,
um,

375
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:31.703
uh,

376
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.580
death by water that would provide some kind of transformation,

377
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:44.280
um,
where,
uh,
eyes might become pearls.
Um,

378
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.020
this is,
uh,
uh,
by calling up Shakespeare and the tempest,

379
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:51.530
uh,

380
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:56.530
Elliot and Evokes Shakespeare's whole romance promise of transformation,

381
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.790
uh,
through drowning,
um,
through magic,
uh,

382
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.870
and,
and romance redemption.
Uh,

383
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:08.100
in the course of the poem,

384
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:13.340
that little fragment will become another motif that recurs and circulates a

385
00:28:14.041 --> 00:28:18.570
becoming almost a kind of object of collective memory.
Uh,

386
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:23.370
in the poem,
a bit of shared knowledge of,
uh,
let's say,

387
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.200
uh,
potential,
uh,

388
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.590
that is drawn specifically from the literary past.

389
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.440
You could say that here and elsewhere,
uh,

390
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.880
Shakespeare and literary tradition in general,
um,

391
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.150
stand in for sacred texts,
uh,

392
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.480
that would offer some kind of a guide to action and some source of meaning.

393
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.550
Uh,
here,
uh,
the,
uh,

394
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.840
sacred text of Shakespeare is,
um,
you know,
sooner,
uh,

395
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.680
invoked then it is parody,
uh,
through,
uh,
this,
um,

396
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.360
uh,
1912,

397
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:05.390
a jazz song that comes to mind as also in presumably the speakers had the

398
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.240
Shakespearian rag.
Uh,
it's so elegant.

399
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.280
And so in teligent,
uh,
there's a way in which,

400
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.860
uh,
well,
um,
uh,

401
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.750
Elliot's making fun of his own,
uh,

402
00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.290
uh,
wish for Shakespeare to be meaningful.
Uh,

403
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.110
there's also a way in which,
uh,

404
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:33.111
the jazz brings this speaker suddenly to some kind of manic life.

405
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:38.610
Uh,
and,
and he has a kind of energy,
uh,
uh,
fitfully,

406
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.890
uh,
for a moment.
Uh,
and uh,

407
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.870
here as an other moments in the poem,
um,

408
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.210
high culture and low culture are brought together and in a kind of rootedness

409
00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:53.890
and an interesting way,
in fact,
you could see this whole section,

410
00:29:53.891 --> 00:29:58.270
a game of chess has doing that since we moved from the drawing room.

411
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:02.800
And it's,
um,
uh,
particular,
uh,

412
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:07.630
interior decoration to the pub scene that follows,
uh,

413
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:12.630
with,
um,
uh,
the,
uh,
account of,

414
00:30:12.631 --> 00:30:17.470
um,
uh,
little's childbearing,
uh,
and,
and,

415
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:19.840
uh,
so forth,
uh,
that we,
uh,

416
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:24.330
then get to over here,
uh,
and then the palm,

417
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.030
uh,

418
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.500
or rather this section of the poem and with another quotation from Shakespeare,

419
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.120
um,
oh,

420
00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.530
fairly as a parting words in a hamlet,

421
00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.000
a good night,
sweet ladies,
uh,
and,
and so forth.
Um,

422
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.163
the,
uh,

423
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.593
<v 1>uh,</v>

424
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.430
<v 0>the game of chess here,
uh,</v>

425
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.470
well it has all sorts of complex,
uh,
resonances,

426
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.220
um,
Elliot's certainly,
uh,

427
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.680
punning on some sense of stale mating,
uh,
and,

428
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.490
and unions,
uh,

429
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:06.490
sexual unions that have gone wrong and that have left people,

430
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.510
um,
against each other.
Um,
uh,

431
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:14.270
in warring postures,
a,

432
00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:19.210
as the poem precedes in the fire sermon,
uh,
we get more,

433
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:24.160
more scenes of,
uh,
erotic impass,
um,

434
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.900
uh,
or,
uh,
or worse,
uh,
uh,
erotic,
um,

435
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.930
uh,
violence of different kinds.

436
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.290
<v 1>Um,
the</v>

437
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:42.820
<v 0>scene of,
uh,
the,
the Thames,
the water that flows through London,</v>

438
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.710
uh,
is now,
uh,
brought into focus again,
not at London Bridge,

439
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.720
uh,
precisely,
but,
uh,
just the,
uh,
uh,
sure,
uh,

440
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:53.980
where,
um,

441
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.970
well Elliot describes it as the rivers tent is broken.

442
00:31:57.971 --> 00:32:01.420
The last fingers of leaf clutch and sink into the wet bank.

443
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.450
The win crosses the brown land unheard.

444
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.050
The nymphs are departed sweet.

445
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:12.100
Tim's run softly till I and my song.
The river bears,

446
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.840
no empty bottles,
sandwich,
pab papers,
silk handkerchiefs,

447
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:17.980
cardboard boxes,

448
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.220
cigarette ends or other testimony of summer nights as it usually does a,

449
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.440
the nymphs or departed and their friends,

450
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:29.770
the loitering heirs of city directors departed.

451
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.500
Having left no addresses,
um,
here,
uh,

452
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.100
Elliot's,
you know,
conjuring,
uh,

453
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:42.200
kind of erotic debris that has been left behind by,

454
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.830
uh,
these,
uh,
businessmen and they're,
uh,

455
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:50.210
Nymphs as the,
uh,
uh,
poem,

456
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.770
uh,
progressive,
uh,
well,
uh,

457
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.920
they're more images of,
um,
uh,
erotic,

458
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.750
um,
confusion and,
and,
uh,
uh,
desolation.

459
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:07.400
Uh,
but at the back,
excuse me,
but at my back from time to time,

460
00:33:07.401 --> 00:33:12.200
I hear on the bottom of four 79 the sound of horns and motors,

461
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.570
which I'll bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
Oh,

462
00:33:17.571 --> 00:33:19.870
the moons.
I should be able to sing this way.
Oh,

463
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.510
the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter and on her daughter.

464
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.450
They washed their feet in soda water.
Aaos save.

465
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.640
Why don't phone Sean Tone Doughnut Cooper twit,
twit,

466
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.150
twit jug jug jug jug jug.

467
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.840
So rudely forced to,
uh,

468
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.360
again,
it kind of amazing,
uh,
linguistic,
um,

469
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.550
um,
uh,

470
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.360
vertigo as we pass from a body,

471
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.830
a Australian soldier ballad about Mrs. Porter,

472
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.240
uh,
which has all kinds of,
uh,

473
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:02.050
obscene stances that your editor doesn't a quote for you,
uh,
to,
uh,

474
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.590
their lens,
uh,
in a image of a children's voices,

475
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.750
uh,
singing under the Dome,
uh,
in his parts of fall.
Uh,

476
00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:16.550
introducing another narrative and theme that recurs throughout the poem,

477
00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.950
the grail story.
Um,
and,
uh,

478
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.390
the story of,
uh,
parts of fall,
uh,

479
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:28.420
uh,
the,
uh,

480
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.670
palm moves.
Then,
uh,
with those,
those,
uh,
first of all,
just the sounds,

481
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:39.870
uh,
which are the,
uh,
um,
uh,
the sounds of,
um,

482
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.400
Phil ml.
Um,

483
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.400
here,
you know,

484
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:50.600
human voice re reduced to a kind of noise almost,

485
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.940
um,
to,
um,
another anecdote.
Uh,

486
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.720
Mr Eugenic Idis,
this Smyrna merchant,
uh,

487
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:05.180
unshaven who asks the me of the poem and demotic French,
uh,

488
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.310
to,
uh,

489
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:11.590
a luncheon at the Cannon Street hotel followed by a weekend at the metropole a

490
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.880
proposition.
Uh,
it seems,
uh,
and again,
I kind of,
um,
uh,

491
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.930
uh,
sinister sexual invitation.
Uh,

492
00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:25.320
there then follows the,
uh,
extended scene,
uh,

493
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.970
between the typist and young man carbon killer.

494
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.910
Uh,
it,
um,
uh,
a,
uh,
uh,

495
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:39.540
ugly,
a scene of,
um,
uh,

496
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:44.380
sexual emptiness,
uh,
and,
and,
um,
uh,

497
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:48.330
domination,
uh,
[inaudible] and Elliot,
uh,

498
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.230
doesn't shrink from,
uh,
um,
you know,
representing,
uh,

499
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.020
this,
this man in,
in a,
you know,
the,
the most,
uh,
uh,
ugly,

500
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.690
uh,
and,
um,
uh,

501
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:06.060
both visually and morally.
It must ugly terms.
Uh,

502
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:10.440
although,
uh,
the poem was indeed a lot uglier,

503
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:14.610
uh,
yet than it is now.
Uh,
the very end of it,
uh,

504
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:19.330
after he's left,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

505
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.350
bestowed one final patronizing kiss,
um,
uh,
the,
uh,

506
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.770
poem used to,
or this section of the poem used to end with a rhyme,
uh,

507
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.540
that he then stopped outside to take a Piss,
uh,
that was excised.

508
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.400
However,
uh,
in the,
uh,
um,
uh,

509
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.920
course of the poem and there's an unnecessary,
um,

510
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.310
uh,
further,
um,
uh,
uh,

511
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.590
registering of the degradation of this scene.
Uh,

512
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.640
then the poem,
uh,
moves to,
um,

513
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.960
well,
uh,
the,
these inset lyric,
uh,

514
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:02.460
songs on four 82.
The river sweats again,
we're on the river,
uh,

515
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:07.461
and were given a kind of image of a Queen Elizabeth the first and,

516
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.900
uh,
Earl of Leicester.
Um,

517
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.730
a potential lover for the Virgin Queen,

518
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.550
uh,
who are,
are,
um,
uh,
being carried down stream.

519
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:25.770
Um,
and then,
uh,
finally,
uh,
another speaker,

520
00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:29.670
uh,
emerges,
um,
this time,
uh,

521
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:34.050
it seems a a woman,
uh,
speaking again in quotation marks,

522
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.650
trams and dusty trees.
Highbury bore me,

523
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.060
Richmond and Q,
and did me by Richmond.

524
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:46.710
I raised my knees supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.

525
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:52.170
My feet are at more gate and my heart under my feet.

526
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.230
After the event,
he wept.

527
00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:00.930
He promised a new start.
I made no comment.

528
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.880
What should I resent on marget sands?

529
00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:09.810
I can connect nothing with nothing.

530
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.170
The broken fingernails have dirty hands.

531
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.190
My people humble people who expect nothing.

532
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:23.910
This,
there's a kind of extraordinary,
um,
metamorphosis,
uh,

533
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:27.390
of speaker here.
Uh,
we're,
uh,
we,
uh,
we,

534
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.460
we begin listening to the,
um,

535
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.510
sexual anecdotes of,
uh,

536
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.200
presumably one of these nymphs abandoned by one of the city directors,

537
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.270
uh,
who,
uh,
has been had a in the park,

538
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:48.160
uh,
in Highbury Richmond and queue.
Uh,
uh,

539
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.010
there's been,
um,
it seems an event,

540
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.210
perhaps what a pregnancy and abortion,
um,

541
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.530
uh,
he wept.
He promised a new start.
Uh,

542
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.910
what should I resent?
Um,
that,

543
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:08.920
um,
uh,
experience then shifts to,
uh,

544
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.590
another,
uh,
location.

545
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.130
There's a kind of mutation of the speaker going on,
uh,

546
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.910
on Margaret Sands.
It's just that location.

547
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:25.430
And then,
uh,
I can connect nothing with nothing.
And now,
um,

548
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:30.760
the,
uh,
uh,
that phrase,
nothing,
uh,
nothing with nothing,
uh,

549
00:39:30.761 --> 00:39:34.030
what's in your head?
Nothing.
Um,
that,
um,

550
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.740
those lines and that motif recur.
Um,

551
00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:43.110
that first person is like the first person of a game of chess as if that woman

552
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:48.160
had turned into that man.
And,
uh,
Margaret Sands,

553
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.880
uh,
locate the poem at this moment at,
um,

554
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:57.280
one of the,
uh,
uh,
places where,
uh,
after,
uh,

555
00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.390
working in the city and,
uh,
succumbing to a kind of nervous breakdown,

556
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.580
Elliot went to compose,
uh,
parts of the wasteland.
Uh,

557
00:40:06.581 --> 00:40:11.560
so there's a way in which he to the poet is that first person they're merged

558
00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:12.490
with,
uh,

559
00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:17.491
these other first persons who finally then merge with Queen Elizabeth.

560
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.420
Uh,
when,
uh,
we hear that first person say,

561
00:40:22.421 --> 00:40:27.210
my people humble people who expect nothing.
Uh,

562
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.690
again,
uh,

563
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.270
there's a kind of a shifting and metamorphosis of identity,
uh,

564
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:39.300
as people are brought into relationship with each other through their shared

565
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.670
experience of erotic failure.
Um,

566
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.660
let's see,
um,

567
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:57.120
not too many minutes left to talk about the end of the poem and to give some

568
00:40:58.151 --> 00:41:01.140
sense of it's shape.
Um,

569
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.533
<v 2>yeah.</v>

570
00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.580
<v 0>Here.
Here's it.
Here's a kind of a narrative of the poem.
The burial of the dead.</v>

571
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:19.080
The title,
it comes from the Anglican Book of common prayer.

572
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.080
It's suggests that the poem will search for perhaps itself,

573
00:41:26.431 --> 00:41:31.200
try to substitute for,
uh,
the um,
uh,

574
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.180
kind of,
um,
a ritual,
um,

575
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.760
understanding of life and death,
uh,
that,
uh,

576
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:44.060
the angle can book of common prayer provides a,
again,

577
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:48.530
some kind of collective meaning a,
a game of chess.
Then,

578
00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.170
uh,
specifies the poems problem,
uh,

579
00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:57.780
as erotic impasse as a kind of stale mating as,
uh,

580
00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.030
the failure of love.
Uh,

581
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.850
the fire sermon then proposes a kind of solution,
uh,

582
00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.700
from the Buddhist teaching.

583
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.660
Self control is a way to combat lust and domination,

584
00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.450
the selfishness of desire,
uh,

585
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.030
all of which resonates,
uh,
in,
in a moral register,
uh,
with the,

586
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:27.380
with the poetic program of tradition in the individual talent where the theme is

587
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.270
self extinction,
uh,
or,
or,
um,
uh,
self submission.

588
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:34.210
Uh,
the point,
uh,

589
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.110
in the middle of the palm where I've been a dwelling for the past few minutes.

590
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.800
The point is to convert the fires of lust,
uh,

591
00:42:42.801 --> 00:42:47.750
into refining and spiritualizing fires.
Then there's a kind of scared,

592
00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:52.160
so that little section,
death by water,
uh,
where,

593
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:57.110
um,
the drowned Phoenician sailors seems to,
uh,

594
00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:02.060
well be a kind of sacrificial figure to represent,
uh,

595
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.230
again,
I cannot,
I can graphically a self extinction.

596
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.190
And then finally,
uh,
after this

597
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:16.090
emblematic sacrifice,
uh,
we are,
uh,

598
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.230
introduced to the long final section,

599
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:23.231
what the funder said when there is a return of divine speech and the promise of

600
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:29.400
rain and of water,
what the poem seems to be looking for,
um,

601
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:34.840
aligning,
um,
um,

602
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.040
the redemptive,
uh,

603
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.400
regeneration that would come with the rain with the um,

604
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.260
uh,
uh,

605
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:50.120
with the experience of divine speech made present,

606
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.710
uh,
here in that simple syllable,
da.
Well,

607
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.740
um,
let me,
uh,

608
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.990
let me say,
uh,
just a couple things,
uh,
about,
uh,

609
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:08.600
the shape of the palm as we have it.
I'd asked you to look at,

610
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:13.610
um,
um,
pounds,

611
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:17.900
um,
work on the poem in the form of,
uh,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,

612
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.680
some pages from the wasteland manuscripts,
well,

613
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.740
uh,
pound,
uh,

614
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.210
collaborated in the writing of this poem by,
um,

615
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.880
in particular,
uh,
excising,
uh,
and,
uh,

616
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:38.850
shortening the poem,
uh,
at many points.
And specifically,

617
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.710
um,
uh,
if you study the drafts,
uh,

618
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.960
by,
uh,
I think,
um,

619
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.340
isolating those moments in the poem,
uh,

620
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:55.490
where Elliot is drawn to a kind of a romantic lyricism on the,

621
00:44:56.881 --> 00:45:00.750
on,
uh,
what becomes the first page of the poem.
Uh,

622
00:45:00.751 --> 00:45:04.110
April is the cruelest month,
um,
pounds,

623
00:45:04.111 --> 00:45:08.860
circles the word forgetful with forgetful snow,
uh,
in the,
uh,

624
00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:11.230
a passage about a,
a Mel.
He's,

625
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:15.720
he circles the word inviolable for inviolable voice.
Um,

626
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:16.943
uh,

627
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.400
pound wants to get the romanticism and lyricism of the poem out of it in certain

628
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:24.730
ways.
Um,

629
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:30.050
Elliot resists that and there are ways in which these two men,

630
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.690
um,
working together and against each other,
uh,

631
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.470
to create the poem,
uh,

632
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.640
enact some of the poems own struggle with lyricism,
uh,

633
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.820
and with romanticism.
Uh,
and,
uh,

634
00:45:47.821 --> 00:45:50.730
help us to see that struggle as,

635
00:45:50.731 --> 00:45:55.260
as part of what goes into the creation of the pump,
uh,

636
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:59.520
itself.
Um,
one of the sections that proof,
uh,

637
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.220
that pound had the biggest effect on,
uh,
was a death by water,
which was,

638
00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.450
uh,
originally a long heroic,
a narrative,
uh,

639
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.520
or mock heroic narrative,
uh,
ending,
um,
uh,
in,
um,

640
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.060
the,
uh,
sailors drowning.
Um,

641
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:23.220
that short section a is,
is worth dwelling on,
uh,
for a moment,

642
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.780
um,
because,
uh,
it is,
uh,

643
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.370
an instance where,
um,
we are,
uh,
well given I think,

644
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.040
um,

645
00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:37.600
an image of what a Elliot was giving up a,

646
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.510
he is giving up,
um,

647
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:43.710
a certain investment in romance quest,
uh,

648
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:48.090
and more law,
more generally romanticism,
uh,

649
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:52.320
that's emblem metabolized by this drowned figure.

650
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.633
Um,

651
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.620
there's also in way in which this very short section,

652
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.780
uh,
points us to,

653
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:06.300
it makes us think about the shortness of the poem as a whole.
Uh,

654
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:11.280
the wasteland is the shortest long poem in the language.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

655
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:16.350
you know,
a kind of radically condensed epic.
Um,
and,

656
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.880
um,
there's,
there's a kind of,
you could say,

657
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:21.630
um,

658
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:26.630
claim made by the poems form that epic extension and duration are no longer

659
00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:28.381
possible.

660
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:33.381
Just as a romance quest is no longer possible precisely because we lack the kind

661
00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:37.990
of culturally shared vocabulary and language that would,

662
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.670
uh,
allow Elliot to create a kind of continuous form.
Instead,

663
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:47.560
what we have is a radically condensed,
uh,
and discontinuous form,

664
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.850
uh,

665
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:53.740
the brokenness of the poems form representing the brokenness of the world that

666
00:47:53.741 --> 00:47:56.990
doesn't have a sacred center.
Um,

667
00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.750
finally,
um,

668
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.800
there's the matter of those notes,
uh,

669
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.360
they are,
uh,

670
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.250
I think an important part of the poem they get kind of get lost in the editor's

671
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:16.780
notes.
Um,
uh,
in your anthology.
Well,

672
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:21.900
when Elliot first published the poem a,
it didn't have those notes when he,
uh,

673
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.260
when he published it in England in the dial magazine when he published it,
um,

674
00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:30.880
excuse me in the criteria when he published it,
a in America.
Um,

675
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.030
shortly after,
um,
uh,
uh,

676
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:37.600
he added those notes,
uh,
to,
uh,

677
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:41.180
extend the length of the poem.
Uh,

678
00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:46.120
it was asked to make a longer,
uh,
poem.
Uh,
there's a way in which,

679
00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:48.643
um,

680
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:53.410
those notes establish a particular kind of figure,

681
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:58.480
a poet who is also a scholar and an editor,
uh,
who is,
um,

682
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.440
uh,
producing a poem that needs notes,
uh,
and that,
uh,

683
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.110
needs to explain itself in these ways.

684
00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:09.090
And that draws on literary tradition and,
uh,

685
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:13.540
various forms of cultural knowledge that require annotation.

686
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:17.230
Um,
Elliot presents himself as this figure,

687
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.940
a poet who's also a kind of scholar and,
um,

688
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:27.160
uh,
this figure emerges as a kind of central modern,

689
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.660
uh,
figure replacing the,
um,
uh,

690
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:36.060
epic poet of the past.
The one who,
uh,
produced,
uh,

691
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.160
a poem such as paradise lost,
uh,

692
00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:43.660
without any footnotes.
Well,
a Hart Crane,
um,

693
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:48.400
a response to all of what I've been talking about today,
uh,

694
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:53.380
and uses it as a point of orientation to create a related but very different

695
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:56.920
kinds of poetry.
As we'll see on Wednesday.
