1
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.570
Uh,
crane is a challenge.

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.470
Uh,
he's is a challenge for you.
Uh,
he's a,
uh,

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.170
a challenge for me as a teacher.

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.180
He is the challenging poet.
He challenges his reader.
He,
uh,

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.060
challenges us and he,
uh,
uh,

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.110
he makes invitations to us.
Uh,
he,
um,

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.830
um,
well he,
he,
um,

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.050
he calls to us in various ways,
places,
demands on us.

9
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.260
Uh,
I'd like to,
um,
talk about,
uh,
a text.

10
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.290
I am not in fact holding.
I wonder if,
uh,

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.360
somebody has an ris packet handy and I could have it in my hands.

12
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.280
Thank you gene.
And that is a,
the palm legend,

13
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.640
which is,
um,
the,
uh,
poem,

14
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.410
uh,
placed first in,
um,
Crane's

15
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.070
first and only book of lyrics called white buildings.
Uh,
it's a,

16
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.940
it's a poem that he use to introduce himself to the reader as it were.

17
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:21.640
So why don't we,
uh,
use it to,
uh,

18
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.420
begin thinking about his work,
uh,

19
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.610
as silent as a mirror is believed,
reality is plunge in.

20
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:32.930
Silence by

21
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.630
the poem begins with that,
with a kind of,
um,

22
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.260
riddle or enigma,
and then the first person comes forward.

23
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.600
I am not ready for repentance

24
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.270
nor to match regrets for the moth.

25
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:59.600
Ben's no more than the still imploring flame.

26
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.690
So wonderful.
It's a wonderful idea.
Uh,

27
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.640
I'm not going to repent of anything.
I'm not going to regret anything.

28
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.500
Uh,
I have not a bent any more.

29
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:19.400
I have nothing more to regret then the,
the flame which has drawn me,

30
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.540
uh,
which,
uh,
uh,
bent as well

31
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.971
for the moth.

32
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:33.971
Ben's no more than the still imploring flame and tremors in the white falling

33
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:36.470
flakes.
Kisses are

34
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.470
<v 1>Comma Dash.
Okay.</v>

35
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.510
<v 0>The only worth all granting,</v>

36
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.803
<v 1>eh,</v>

37
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.750
<v 0>characteristically here for crane,
there's a,
uh,</v>

38
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.550
well a compressed set of images.
Um,
uh,

39
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.900
<v 1>okay.</v>

40
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.550
<v 0>Those tremors,
uh,
white falling flakes,
they're,
well,
they're almost images aren't,</v>

41
00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:07.590
they have a burnt moth,

42
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.120
a moth that's been drawn to the flame.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

43
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.050
those come to be seen as here.
Uh,
kisses,

44
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.130
kisses.
If we unpack cranes,
od Syntex,
uh,

45
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:25.140
it would see the sentence would seem to read,

46
00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:28.810
although it's maybe available to other constructions.
Uh,

47
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.830
kisses are tremors in the white falling flakes,

48
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.520
but these cases,
these cases that are,
um,

49
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.360
uh,
also emblems of,
um,
uh,

50
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.950
of flame and,
and,
uh,
extinction even a,

51
00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:50.340
are the only worth all granting.

52
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.740
That is the only value that seems to grant all I think,

53
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.110
again,
those,
those,
those,
those words all granting,

54
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.090
um,
uh,
might be construed in a couple of different ways.

55
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.440
Crane says,
uh,
it is to be learned

56
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.770
what is to be learned.
This cleaving and this burning,

57
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.490
the kind I'm talking about.
Uh,
uh,
we,

58
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.550
we must learn to be drawn to the flame and we must learn to recover from the,

59
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.870
uh,
uh,

60
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.900
recover from the flame and a renew our desires and renew our quests.

61
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.571
Uh,

62
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:41.370
it is to be learned this cleaving in this burning but only by the one who spends

63
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:44.490
out himself.
Again,
in order to do this,

64
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.470
you've got to spend yourself repeatedly over and over again.

65
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.943
Uh,

66
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.790
and then he gives us other images of this kind of repeated burning twice and

67
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:02.460
twice again.
The smoking souvenir,

68
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.990
bleeding idle on idol on is the Greek word for image,

69
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.410
uh,
in yet again,

70
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.390
this activity is repeated and repeated until the bright logic is one.

71
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.450
And whispering he returns to that initial enigmatic image on whispering as a

72
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:25.930
mirror is believed,

73
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.740
then drop my caustic,

74
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.910
drop a perfect cry shell string,

75
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:38.740
some constant harmony,
relentless caper for all those.

76
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.950
And here we are challenged and invited to meet him and join him who step the

77
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.430
legend of their youth into the noon?

78
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.910
Well,
it's a hard poem.
Uh,
and yet,
uh,
there are a few,

79
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.250
I think simple basic ideas.

80
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.700
It projects that are important to the poet that crane saw himself as,

81
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.280
uh,
and um,
uh,

82
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:09.140
the one he wants us to receive.
And an in a sense join,

83
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.630
uh,
he presents himself as an unrepentant visionary,

84
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.670
uh,
Romantic,
uh,

85
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.760
and lover since after all these roles are all held in some association here.

86
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.470
Um,
he talks about,
uh,

87
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.150
hear a willingness that's erotic,
that's aesthetic,

88
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.860
that spiritual to exhaust oneself in the pursuit of one's desires to spend out

89
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.300
yourselves again and repeatedly.
Uh,

90
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.380
there is in this,
uh,

91
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:56.381
the promise that by doing it repeatedly drop by caustic drop,

92
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.500
uh,
a kind of lyric voice will emerge that will be a perfect cry.

93
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.060
And despite this destruction and pain and blood bleeding idol on

94
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.580
a constant that is sustained harmony will be achieved a harmony invoking of

95
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:30.380
course,
more than one voice,
uh,

96
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.240
in what is this?
This is a poetic project,
uh,
and it's,
uh,

97
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.130
it's a project that he describes as a relentless Kapor,
oh,

98
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.200
relentless Caper,
uh,

99
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.520
a Cape,
a caper.
Uh,
it comes from Latin,
uh,
the sense of,
uh,

100
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.560
the,
uh,
the goat that leaps.
Uh,
it's also,

101
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:58.190
it's a word that that suggests.
Um,
uh,

102
00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:01.790
well some kind of a minor mischief,

103
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.743
uh,

104
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.230
a relentless caper for all those who step the legend of their youth into the

105
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.030
noon.
Uh,
and here,

106
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:18.410
crane presents himself as a young person who would project,
uh,

107
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.510
all of,
uh,

108
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.250
the youthful vitality of his vision and desire into this,
uh,

109
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.430
symbolically pregnant moment that he calls the noon.

110
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.950
And so it's a time very important in cranes,
imagination.

111
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.680
Uh,
I think idiosyncratically,
uh,

112
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.020
individually,
but also,
uh,

113
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.120
in a way that that alludes to a noon and Emily Dickinson's poems,

114
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.410
a Dickinson being a poet,
that a crane shares a great deal with,

115
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.690
uh,
the poetry,
uh,
of Hart Crane.

116
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.770
Uh,

117
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.770
well it proposes to approach what he calls noon,

118
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.040
which is,
uh,

119
00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.110
an experience of a fullness and,
uh,
uh,

120
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.880
absolute presence.

121
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.290
<v 1>Now,
uh,</v>

122
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.470
<v 0>what does he mean that he's not ready for repentance?
Uh,
who,</v>

123
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.580
who after all is told him to repent,

124
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.840
who has,
um,
who has told him he has something to regret,

125
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.150
uh,

126
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.150
repent and something that crane heard from the culture at large,

127
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.320
uh,
in important ways.

128
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.420
A crane is writing in the mid twenties.
Uh,

129
00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.010
W we're at this point,
uh,
I think this is a poem from 1924 or so.

130
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.960
Um,
uh,
it is,
um,

131
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.980
postwar America.

132
00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.700
A crane's sees himself as a member of a new youthful world,

133
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.360
uh,
centered in,
uh,
places like Greenwich Village.

134
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.060
Uh,
he sees himself as part of a young America,

135
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.120
uh,
uh,
bound together,
uh,

136
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:24.730
across place,
uh,
by a kind of common dedication to art.
Uh,

137
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.200
and to their

138
00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.970
will to free themselves from the sexual and economic disciplines that he calls

139
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:38.940
in this a
letter that I have,

140
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.393
<v 1>mmm.</v>

141
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.510
<v 0>Quoted,
uh,
other,
uh,
sentences from a cause.
Puritanism</v>

142
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.320
a crane
crane is,
I'm

143
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.270
writing in an era.

144
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.623
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.640
<v 0>The era of the 18th Amendment
prohibition is in effect.</v>

146
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.710
Um,
there is,
um,

147
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.850
a range of kinds of censorship
that are,
you know,

148
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:21.450
a real and present threat.
James Joyce is novel.

149
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:26.451
Ulysses has been banned from the United States shores for it's obscenity.

150
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.900
A,
there's a way in which modernist art,
uh,

151
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.880
is mixed up with questions of sexuality.

152
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.040
Crane got his copy of Ulysses smuggled from France,

153
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.550
which a friend then stole

154
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:51.540
a crane.
A crane is living,
uh,
to,
uh,

155
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.870
in,
in a,

156
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.850
a vital and nascent gay culture in New York in particular,

157
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.040
uh,
uh,
and yet within,
uh,
an nation.
Uh,

158
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.590
then as now,
uh,
that is,
uh,

159
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.670
strongly homophobic and anti gay and all sorts of ways,

160
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:18.893
<v 1>mmm.</v>

161
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.570
<v 0>Cranes,
insistence on,
um,</v>

162
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.930
his refusal to repent.
His refusal to regret,
uh,
are,

163
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.670
um,
uh,
um,
assertions of,
um,

164
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.133
um,

165
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.600
his will towards forms of sexual and imaginative freedom.
Uh,

166
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.310
they're also,
um,

167
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.700
affirmations of a romantic poetics,
uh,

168
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.000
essential to him.
Um,

169
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.333
the,
um,

170
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:04.150
there's also a literary historical context for this that's important and that I

171
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:09.110
think you can probably already,
uh,
start to,
uh,
uh,

172
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.330
uh,
guests at

173
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.850
a crane is a deep and a deeply ambivalent reader of the wasteland.

174
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.430
And Ts Elliot,
uh,

175
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.270
he says in this letter to Guam months and,
uh,

176
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.380
in January,
1923,

177
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.580
there's no one writing in English who can command so much respect to my mind as

178
00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:37.790
Elliot.
However,

179
00:13:37.791 --> 00:13:42.050
I take Elliot as a point of departure towards an almost complete reverse of

180
00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:42.884
direction.

181
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:49.220
His pessimism is amply justified in his own case.
Why?

182
00:13:49.221 --> 00:13:53.990
I don't know what crane crane had his to his fantasies about Elliot sexual life.

183
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.190
Uh,
I think,
um,

184
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.340
but I would apply as much of as area addition and technique is I can absorb and

185
00:14:04.341 --> 00:14:08.000
assemble toward a more positive,
or if I mess,

186
00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:11.150
put it so in a skeptical age,
ecstatic goal,

187
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:14.000
I should not think of this.

188
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.050
If a kind of rhythm and ecstasies we're not at odd moments and rare,

189
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.270
a very real thing to me,

190
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.820
I feel that Elliot ignores certain spiritual events and possibilities as real

191
00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:29.720
and powerful.
Now as say,
in the time of Blake,

192
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.830
Blake is very important to crane.

193
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.220
Certainly the man has dubbed the ground and buried hope as deep in dire flea as

194
00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:41.150
it can ever be done after this perfection of death,

195
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.010
which is what crane is,
is,
uh,
uh,

196
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.220
this is how he's reading the wasteland.
Nothing is in motion,

197
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:56.930
but a resurrection of some kind.
He says,

198
00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.610
well,
uh,

199
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:08.570
crane is,
um,
reading the wasteland

200
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.650
and he's reading Elliot's criticism.

201
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.780
He's responding to,
well,
he's responding to a series of,

202
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.220
of text and I'll just show you

203
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.850
some of what he's reading here.
Um,
this is,
um,

204
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.480
the criterion,
the first place,
uh,

205
00:15:37.481 --> 00:15:41.980
Elliot's poetry.
Uh,
the wasteland appeared a,

206
00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:46.160
that's an October,
1922 Elliot's own magazine.
Um,

207
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.303
the

208
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.960
first American publication of the poem was in the dial,
uh,

209
00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.820
in,
uh,
November,
1922.
And,

210
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.050
um,
then,
uh,

211
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.530
the poem appeared in,
um,

212
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.220
I don't know if you can see that very well.

213
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.163
Um,

214
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.790
the poem appeared in New York Publication in book form,
uh,
in,

215
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.630
uh,
as its own discreet,
uh,

216
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.720
text when,
um,
uh,
the,
uh,

217
00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.070
live right addition of the palm was,
was being prepared.
Uh,

218
00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:37.410
as I mentioned last time,
uh,

219
00:16:37.411 --> 00:16:41.640
Elliot was asked to make the poem a little longer because after all,

220
00:16:41.641 --> 00:16:45.030
it was a little too short,
uh,
and uh,

221
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.380
or so the story goes,
uh,
and this was impart a,

222
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.130
one of his motives for producing the notes to the poem.

223
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.020
Uh,
as I said last time,
and this is the,
uh,
uh,

224
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.470
way the poet poem looked in a America,
uh,

225
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.940
when it first appeared,
uh,
with,

226
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.850
and of course with just a few lines per page,
I,

227
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.720
last time I called it the long,
long,
shortest long poem and the language,
uh,

228
00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:20.520
you can see the way in which it's sort of drawn out.
Um,

229
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.530
here's the little section.
I,
uh,
uh,

230
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.640
ended by talking about death by water.
Well.

231
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:36.360
Um,
as I suggested last time,
Elliot's notes,

232
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.890
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
suggested,

233
00:17:40.891 --> 00:17:43.850
created a kind of,
um,

234
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.750
role for the poet where the poet was not

235
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.340
the creative lyric,
uh,
um,

236
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.950
presence at the center of the palm,

237
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.951
but was also a kind of a scholar and critic of his own work.

238
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.340
Uh,
framing,
uh,
it,
uh,

239
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.930
mastering bodies of knowledge and,
uh,
arranging,
uh,

240
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.430
meaning,
uh,
in ways that the notes,
uh,
amble Matteis.

241
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.773
Um,

242
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.070
in the process Elliot's doing a couple of things.

243
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.530
He,
uh,
that that crane is responding to.
Um,

244
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.350
he is establishing

245
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.940
himself in what I described as a new role.

246
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:43.200
Uh,
and that's very much the role you see,
uh,
Elliot,
uh,
uh,

247
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.990
embodying here.
That is the,
the poet as a,
uh,
as a kind of a,

248
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:53.060
a scholar poet,
um,
uh,
a,
uh,

249
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.173
um,

250
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:59.930
figure backed by institutional authority of various kinds.

251
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.710
And,
uh,

252
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:09.690
this figure is created specifically in the wasteland,
uh,

253
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.480
through the,
um,

254
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.730
through the poems turning away from,

255
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.760
in turning against in complicated ways,
uh,

256
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.780
its own forms of romanticism,

257
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.260
which last time I suggested,
uh,
we're,
uh,

258
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.590
emblem monetized by that drown Phoenician sailor,

259
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.760
a fleabag [inaudible],
um,
who,
um,

260
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.820
is a kind of figure for what the poem sacrifices,

261
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.480
um,
or you might say a kind of version of the self that Elliot,
uh,

262
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.470
is willing to give up.
Um,

263
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.680
crane in countering the poem I think must have been obsessed with the section

264
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.640
death by water.
Um,
must've been,

265
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.680
must've seen,
must've messed up,

266
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.700
heard Elliot talking to him when,
uh,

267
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.580
Elliot says,
consider flea bus,
uh,

268
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.160
the Phoenician sailor who was once tall and handsome as you,

269
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.640
um,
crane means to,
uh,

270
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.330
reassert the power of youth reassert,
uh,

271
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.820
the potential for romantic vision,
uh,

272
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.500
and uh,
to do so,
uh,
in a way that would,
um,

273
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.880
that he imagines as a kind of resurrection.
And as a,

274
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:53.140
as a kind of passage through and beyond death by water,

275
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:58.240
uh,
drowning,
uh,
is a,
uh,

276
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.270
important imaginative motif in a crane's work.

277
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.640
The palms that I'll,
I'll concentrate on now to,

278
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.070
uh,
explore this idea.
Uh,
all have

279
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:22.900
images of romance quest and,
and drowning,
uh,
at their,
their center.

280
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.370
Uh,
and I mean,
uh,
first of all,
the,

281
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:32.371
a very great love poem called voyages on six Oh nine,

282
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.620
um,
which,
uh,
Elliot,
excuse me,

283
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.340
which crane,
uh,
began,
uh,

284
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:46.480
in the spring of 1920 for

285
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.930
about a year,
uh,
after he's read the wasteland.
Uh,

286
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.000
and the palm is,
I think his first sort of developed reply,
uh,

287
00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:02.350
and it,
uh,
centers,
as I say,
um,
on,
uh,

288
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.660
images of drowning.

289
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.280
The poem arises from,
uh,

290
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:14.770
a love affair with,
uh,
as it happens.
A Danish sailor,

291
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.440
uh,
who was part of the,
um,
uh,

292
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.900
Bohemian,
um,
uh,

293
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.910
crowd around the province to province town players in Greenwich village.

294
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.010
Uh,
Crane's letters are full of,
um,

295
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.610
well both reflections on Elliott,
uh,

296
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.430
and also,
uh,
ecstatic,
um,
and,

297
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.330
um,
very moving,
um,

298
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.290
accounts of his love affair with Emile for,
uh,
I'll,

299
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.490
I'll read you just a few sentences from one letter to,
um,

300
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.410
uh,
his friend Waldo Frank.
He says,
Crane does,

301
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.920
it will take many letters to let you know what I mean for myself,

302
00:23:02.921 --> 00:23:07.921
at least when I say in this relationship that I have seen the word made flesh,

303
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.340
I mean nothing less.

304
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.970
And I know now that there is such a thing as indestructibility in the deepest

305
00:23:18.461 --> 00:23:23.461
sense where flesh became transformed through intensity of response to counter

306
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:27.400
response,
where sex was beaten out,

307
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.760
where a purity of joy was reached that included tears,
uh,

308
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:37.750
imagery from,
from this and other letters that crane,
uh,
wrote during the period,

309
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.650
uh,
uh,
um,
emerge in,
in voyage is

310
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.090
the very first section of,
uh,

311
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
had been in fact sitting on cranes desk for three years above the fresh ruffles

312
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:54.134
of the surf.

313
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.180
Bright striped urchins flake each other with sand.

314
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.830
They have contrived a quest,
excuse me,

315
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.360
a conquest for Shell shucks.
And their fingers crumble.

316
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:09.560
Fragments of baked,

317
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:14.561
we'd Gayley digging and scattering and an answer to their trouble.

318
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:19.970
Reflections.
The Sun beats lightening on the waves,
the waves,

319
00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:24.320
full funder in the sand.
And could they hear me?

320
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.860
I would say I would tell them,
oh,
brilliant.

321
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:30.620
Kids Frisk with your dog.

322
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.340
Fondel your shells and sticks bleached by time and the elements.

323
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.420
But there is a line you must not cross nor ever trust beyond it.

324
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.370
Spry cordage of your bodies to caresses too,

325
00:24:49.371 --> 00:24:52.160
like and faithful from two wide abreast.

326
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.130
The bottom of the sea is cruel.

327
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.530
The poem begins on shore,

328
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.130
begins with a kids playing,

329
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.200
uh,
their play.
You know,

330
00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:14.210
it's innocence seems to imply and gesture towards,

331
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:20.000
um,
ferocious energies that,
um,

332
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.700
uh,
our emblem Matteis by the sea,
uh,

333
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:29.720
in all of its thunder and lightening and power,
uh,
you,
you,

334
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.350
they fondle they flay.
Uh,
the,

335
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:38.240
the shoreline is a,
is a place where they're,
they're fragments of

336
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.620
debris,
uh,

337
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.240
proof of the CS force.
Uh,

338
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.130
the poem begins with a simple moral,

339
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.350
a injunction or,
or practical,
really,
uh,
uh,
uh,

340
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.680
practical warning to give yourself over to the sea would be to enter a field of

341
00:26:06.651 --> 00:26:10.700
unbounded energy to risk your identity,

342
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.470
to risk being overwhelmed.
Think of proof.

343
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:20.000
Rock on the shore.
Shall I wear my chowders role?

344
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.960
Uh,
crane is,
uh,
they're in the same,
same place.

345
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.590
Uh,
and having issued this warning,

346
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.790
acknowledged the cruelty of the bottom of the sea.

347
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.520
He throws it off and throws it behind and enters the water.

348
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:41.780
And yet

349
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.060
that important piece of cranium,
punctuation,

350
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:53.090
the dash a a bit of punctuation that separates and connects elements,

351
00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.210
uh,
pushes that warning away and takes us into the sea.

352
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.100
And yet this great wink of eternity of rimless floods

353
00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.610
come borderless space,
unfettered Lee wordings,

354
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.780
CMI cheated in procession to where her undying old vast belly cream images.

355
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:21.900
The see here,
uh,
as a con,

356
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:26.640
as a woman's body and as a kind of belly that bends towards the moon.
Uh,

357
00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.150
you know,
it's a kind of vision of,
of the,
uh,

358
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.940
kind of open horizon of the sea is you,
you know,

359
00:27:32.941 --> 00:27:37.120
it seems to kind of project the curve of the earth.
And,
uh,

360
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.970
her undying old vast belly moon word,
Ben's laughing,

361
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.770
the wrapped inflections of our love.
There's a,

362
00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:51.300
that's a kind of a wonderful cranium word

363
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.030
wrapped.
Uh,
it,
it's,

364
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:59.970
it would seem to mean both a wrapped in the sense of wrapped up,

365
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.470
uh,
and wrapped in the sense of held in rapture.
Uh,

366
00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.550
he's kind of combined possibly through error.
These two forms.

367
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.290
Crane makes errors.

368
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.760
He's unlike the scholarly Elliot.

369
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:21.000
He continues,
uh,
and and now gives us instructions.
Take this,

370
00:28:21.001 --> 00:28:26.001
see who's diaphysis and Nell's on scrolls of silver snowy sentences,

371
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:30.300
the sceptred terror of whose session wrens as her demeanor,

372
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.620
demeanor's motion will or ill all.

373
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:39.480
But the pieties of lover's hands,
uh,
here,

374
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:39.990
uh,

375
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:44.990
being in the space of the sea is like being in love or,

376
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:50.040
um,
in the act of love as crane imagines it.

377
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.990
It's also like being in a fabulous rhetorical world,
uh,

378
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.940
a space of gorgeous,
extravagant,
uh,
language.
Uh,

379
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:04.510
which crane unleashes here in all of its,
uh,
uh,

380
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.800
um,
terrific force.
Uh,
it's,

381
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:10.680
it's language that that,
um,

382
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.470
is I am pentameter unlike Elliot,

383
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.670
uh,
is,
uh,
uh,
language,
uh,
as rich and,

384
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.970
and or Nate,
uh,
as,
uh,
on the,
uh,

385
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.080
English renaissance stage.
Marlo would have liked this.
Um,

386
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.890
it is,
uh,
also a kind of a romantic,
um,

387
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.810
uh,
diction and,
uh,
they're,
um,

388
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:44.380
elements of serve late 19th century British and French poetry.

389
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:47.080
That crane is combining here.
He says,

390
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:49.990
an onward as bells off San Salvador.

391
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:54.880
Salute the crocus luster of the stars in these points.

392
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:59.740
Set a meadows of her tides,
a dodgy of islands.
Oh my prodigal.

393
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.940
Complete the dark confessions her veins.
Spell

394
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.143
mark,

395
00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.760
how her turning shoulders wind the hours and hasten while her penniless rich

396
00:30:15.591 --> 00:30:20.591
palms past superscription of bent foam and wave hasten while they are true,

397
00:30:21.181 --> 00:30:25.020
because they will not be true forever.
Sleep,
death,

398
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:30.050
desire close round one instant in one floating flower.

399
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:35.550
Crane understands that love like rhetoric,

400
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.340
cast a spell
and uh,
that

401
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.360
love and poetry create illusions.
Uh,

402
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.880
he does not therefore despise them.
Uh,

403
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:55.350
different from,
uh,
uh,
Elliot,
uh,
in,
in,
uh,

404
00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:00.240
in a basic way.
He acknowledges,
as it were,

405
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.660
the temporariness of,
uh,
his,
um,

406
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.450
uh,
desire.
In fact,
he says,

407
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:13.590
bind us in time.
Oh,
seasons clear

408
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.740
and all.
Oh,
minstrel galleons of carob fire.

409
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.960
What are minstrel galleons of care of fire?
Well,

410
00:31:21.961 --> 00:31:26.930
maybe were actual ships that he's imagining passing among maybe,
uh,

411
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.790
they are,
um,
um,
uh,

412
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:35.350
the lights of the moon or sun on the sea.

413
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.010
He says to the sea,
big queen us.

414
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.200
I know we're going to die,

415
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.920
but Cuiv us to no earthly shore,

416
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.700
in other words,
don't bury us,

417
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:56.240
uh,
until

418
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.510
an as in legend crane produces a funny syntactic reversal here,

419
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:09.010
but quede this to no earthly sure until is answered in the vortex of our grave.

420
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:17.180
The seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise.

421
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:23.300
Uh,
there,
uh,
the subject of the sentence comes last.

422
00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.430
Uh,
the sentences,

423
00:32:25.431 --> 00:32:30.431
the seals wide spindrift gaze is answered in the vortex of our gray.

424
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.460
What crane has done there is,
um,

425
00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:40.700
well he's reversed the syntactic quarter of subject and verb.

426
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.470
By doing so,

427
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:47.060
he's introduced first the image of death by drowning.
Uh,

428
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:51.560
that is the vortex of our grave.
Uh,
and uh,

429
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:56.540
he's put that up first and then he's followed it with the image of the seals

430
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.700
gaze,
which,
uh,
comes,
uh,
and emerges,
um,

431
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.630
after drowning,
uh,

432
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:08.160
that the seal is here kind of figure of a kind of consciousness,
uh,

433
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.800
and desire expressed through the eyes,
uh,
that is,
uh,

434
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:16.040
that survives death.
Uh,

435
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.650
look back to the poem proceeding,
um,

436
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.330
called APP Melville's tomb.
Uh,
there is a,
here,

437
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.400
this is a kind of allergy for Melville,

438
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:33.560
which seems to presume falsely,
uh,
that Melville,

439
00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.360
uh,
is,
uh,
uh,

440
00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:39.200
drowned and not buried unsure as he is

441
00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.350
a,
and there there's an image of,
again,
of drowning,
uh,
in,
um,

442
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:49.830
lines 11 and 12th,
uh,
and again,
it kind of image of,
of,

443
00:33:49.831 --> 00:33:52.430
of vortex.
Uh,
then in the circuit,

444
00:33:52.431 --> 00:33:56.090
calm of one vast coil after the storm that has wrecked the ship.

445
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.160
It's lashings charmed and those lashings remind you of the flanks of the kids on

446
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:04.880
the voyage is in slashings charmed and malice,

447
00:34:04.881 --> 00:34:08.300
reconciled frosted eyes.

448
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.360
There were that lifted altars and silent answers crept across the stars.

449
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:20.090
How do eyes lift altars
in,
um,

450
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.340
uh,
crane's letter to Harriet Monroe in defense of this poem?

451
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:30.800
Uh,
and when he calls the logic of metaphor,
crane,
uh,
says,
well,
um,

452
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:36.070
eyes lift altars in the sense that they bring the object of their desire into

453
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:41.540
being,
uh,
through their desire.
That is a,
you,
uh,

454
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.840
you,
uh,
you raise the altar,
you create the,
the,
the,
uh,

455
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:50.810
object of worship through your yearning for,
uh,
it,
uh,

456
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.640
this is,
uh,
you know,
again,
uh,
uh,
uh,
a kind of visionary act,

457
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.060
uh,
and it's,
uh,

458
00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:02.070
a version of the one that we find at the end of the second section of,

459
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.790
uh,
voyages where we see the Wa the seagulls,
or excuse me,
the,

460
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:09.300
um,
um,
uh,

461
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:14.030
the seals wide spindrift gaze toward paradise,

462
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.260
a wide,
a wide because it's a gaze that,
that,

463
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.790
that is large and takes in,
um,
um,

464
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.820
uh,
much,
uh,
space.
Uh,
why?
Because the sea is a,

465
00:35:27.821 --> 00:35:32.600
as a kind of space in which we have latitude of action,

466
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.640
spin drift.

467
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:39.520
It's a word that crane took from Moby Dick,
uh,

468
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.440
from Melville.
Uh,
replacing another word,
not such a good word,

469
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:47.730
which also came from Moby Dick Finn Rennie.
Uh,
it's a good,

470
00:35:47.731 --> 00:35:50.300
he got rid of that.
Uh,
uh,

471
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.450
spindrift is important when you are in the sea.

472
00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:57.120
It is like being in the crane poem.
You don't have the ground under your feet.

473
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.680
You spin and you drift.
Uh,

474
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.700
you spend in new drift and words mix and match and create words like spindrift.

475
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.730
Uh,
this is a condition that crane calls in the next poem,

476
00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:13.190
infinite consanguinity where there's a kind of sharing of,

477
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:18.190
of elements,
uh,
uh,
kind of,
uh,
uh,

478
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.160
transformation,
um,

479
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.310
through a exchange that goes on.

480
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.500
This is understood as what happens,
uh,
in love.
Uh,
it's also,
uh,

481
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:32.560
understood as a kind of model for poetic process.
Uh,

482
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.890
it's imaged here in this palm and in triumphant language,
uh,

483
00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:42.740
as a kind of,
um,
a transcendence of death,
uh,

484
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:47.810
here describing a moment of climactic intensity crane rights and so admitted

485
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:57.021
through black swollen gates that must arrest all distance otherwise past

486
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:02.630
whirling pillars and live pediments light wrestling there incessantly with light

487
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:08.900
star kissing star through wave on wave unto your body rocking

488
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:18.070
and where death if shed like a skin presumes no carnage,

489
00:37:19.191 --> 00:37:22.310
know a final death of the body,

490
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:27.490
but rather this single change upon the steep floor flung from dawn to dawn,

491
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.210
the silken skilled trans member mint of song.

492
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:34.203
<v 1>Okay,</v>

493
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:38.670
<v 0>permit me voyage.
Love into your hands.
Uh,</v>

494
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:45.360
the silk and skilled trans member of song.
This is cranes,

495
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:45.840
uh,

496
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.840
final fantastic line of I ambig pentameter where,

497
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:52.920
uh,

498
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.920
he proclaims a kind of a transformation that is at once a erotic and rhetorical,

499
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.120
uh,
where,
um,
uh,
elements,
uh,
uh,

500
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.740
between two parties have been exchanged just at Dick's,

501
00:38:10.741 --> 00:38:12.900
changed in reverse just as the,
uh,

502
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.160
s silk and skill,
uh,

503
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.920
give us phonemes that are held in almost to kind of mirror relation ship,
uh,

504
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:26.460
and alliteration.
The I,
l,
k,
K,
I,
l a,

505
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:31.461
and then crane introduces us to another word that he coins a trans member meant

506
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.560
a trans member meant what does Trans member meant mean?

507
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:40.510
It seems to be made out of what?
Remember Dismember,
uh,

508
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.770
transformation.

509
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:47.070
He's talking about a kind of activity that involves all of these things at once,

510
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.470
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
through it,
uh,

511
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:55.180
achieves a kind of vision of a union,
which is a,

512
00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:58.660
again,
as I say,
uh,
both,
uh,
linguistic and,

513
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.060
uh,
um,
interpersonal.
Well,

514
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.340
that seems like a good place to stop for now.
Uh,
we'll,
um,

515
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.840
carry these poems on as a,
as a way to

516
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.720
read his long poem in reply to the wasteland.
The bridge.
