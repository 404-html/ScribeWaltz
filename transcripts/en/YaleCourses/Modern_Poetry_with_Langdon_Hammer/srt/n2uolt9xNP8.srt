1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,140
I have a in the chairman's office
down the hall to photographs,

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,060
uh, one is, uh,

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,450
of the English department
in 1924 and there are, um,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,700
uh, the number of distinguished
gentlemen casually posed in it.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,830
Uh, you, you distinguished
scholars, uh, but all gentlemen,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,520
uh, and combine and take
a look at it sometime.

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,210
I also have a photograph from 1967
in which there are more distinguished

8
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:38,470
gentleman, uh, less casually
posed. In fact, a raid, uh, in a,

9
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:42,430
um, uh, you know, sort
of Phalynx, uh, and, uh,

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:47,200
seated in the middle of
these men is one woman,

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,470
uh, marine bore off. Uh, Marie, uh,

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,250
is our guest lecturer today and
I'm delighted to have her here.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,090
She has been a member of this English
department and a distinguished member of

14
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,420
this English department for a long time.
Um,

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,750
she is a medievalist,
uh,

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,030
a scholar of modern poetry,

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,520
a translator of Middle
English poetry poet herself.

18
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,800
Uh, and she views, um,
poetry or you, you Marie,

19
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:23,210
I think of, uh, as as, uh,

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,160
holding a sense of poetry as a long
tradition that reaches back to the origins

21
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:35,710
of our language. Uh, and is,
uh, alive with us today. Uh,

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,940
and that I'm writing about it,
writing it,

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,500
translating it are your
activities, uh, and uh, also,

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:49,750
uh, teaching it, uh, and, and Ray
is one of our best and, and, uh,

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,770
most revered teachers in the
history of this department.

26
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,280
So it's a really wonderful a
honor for me to get to, uh,

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,320
give the stage and the
microphone, uh, to Marie Bora.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,880
Would you please welcome here?

29
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,140
[inaudible]

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,673
thank you Lani.

31
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,370
I'm getting over a virus so I hope
my voice won't be too scratchy.

32
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:17,810
I have some water to help.

33
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,680
I think of it as it's really
all the same thing. You know,

34
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,870
Beowulf going Chaucer,
Milton Wallace, Stevens,

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,540
it's all the same thing. Nope. Innocence.

36
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,250
I want to begin this morning with a little
poem that you may never have heard of

37
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:44,560
or read by Wallace Stevens
called [inaudible], g, U,

38
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,100
B, B, I n a, l. And if you have
the poems of Steven's here,

39
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,470
you can look at it. If you
want though, doesn't matter.

40
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,350
I'm going to tell you it,

41
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,190
that strange flower.

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:03,490
The Sun is just what you say.
Have it your way.

43
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,270
The world is ugly and the people are sad.

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,340
That tuft of jungle feathers,

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,570
that animal I is just what you say,

46
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,620
that savage of fire,

47
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,100
that seed have it your way.

48
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,880
The world is ugly and the people are sad.

49
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,030
In this poem,
the voice of the imagination and Stevens,

50
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:39,031
his concept of the imagination with the
Capitol lie speaks and it addresses a

51
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,680
you that views the world
without imagination.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,100
That is you. The you have the
poem, you take the Sun for granted.

53
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,880
You aren't excited by seeing it,
by the thought of it,

54
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,380
by the fact that it has arisen on this
particular day and you hope it's going to

55
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,550
rise again tomorrow.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,510
You don't feel as Stevens
puts it in another poem.

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,260
The Sun comes up like news from Africa
and that's how one with the imagination

58
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:17,881
at work fields about the sun imagination
as Stevens conceives of it is the

59
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:25,831
incessant stream of language emanating
from the human consciousness.

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,200
As we live expressing both the state of
the world at a given time and its own

61
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,690
state, both of which states
are constantly changing.

62
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,820
Our interstate changes.

63
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,821
Our inner weather changes as the outer
weather of the world changes and as the

64
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:46,540
seasons change.

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,920
The work of the imagination as represented
in Goulburn though is the generation

66
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,090
of metaphors.
The Sun is a strange flower,

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,850
a Tuft of jungle feathers,

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,060
an animal I a savage
of fire and to seed at.

69
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:11,731
One thing that's important about this
to notice is the rapidity with which one

70
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:17,680
metaphor it gives way to another metaphor.
You don't stick with one,

71
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:19,990
you don't have a
definitive one that has it.

72
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,310
You go on and if the poem were longer,
there'd be more metaphors.

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Still the mind is in motion as
the world also is in motion.

74
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Implicit in this poem also is Stevens's
particular concept of happiness without

75
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,470
the imagination.

76
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,620
The poem says the world is ugly and
the people are sad and we can turn this

77
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:53,371
statement on its head and say
with equal validity from Stevens,

78
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,340
his point of view with the imagination,

79
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,130
when the vital imagination
isn't residence at at work,

80
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,260
the world is splendid,
exciting and the people are happy.

81
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Note that happiness has nothing to do
with personal fortune with the fact that

82
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:17,030
you've been accepted by Harvard medical
school or you perform brilliantly on the

83
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:22,031
basketball court or the football field
or got the date you're hoping to get.

84
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,670
Happiness is internal
independent self starting,

85
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,210
but also shared communal human.

86
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,160
The work of the imagination for Stevens
is the same as the writing of poetry,

87
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,380
the generation of poetry on a small
scale as in governor [inaudible] and many

88
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:50,381
other such or on a large mythical
scale as in the Aurora's of autumn,

89
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,900
a lot of Stevens,
his early poems are called by him.

90
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,010
Anecdotes. Now, an anecdote,

91
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,270
if you go back to the etymology of
the word is something unpublished.

92
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,320
It's like a draft and
what Steven's would do,

93
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:13,910
he lived in Hartford, is
you probably know, he worked
in a big insurance company.

94
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,600
It was very successful and
he would walk every morning.

95
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:22,340
It was a great walker from his home in
West Hartford to his office in downtown

96
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,690
Hartford.
As he walked,

97
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,740
he would write poems,
poems would come to him.

98
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,690
He splints said, I never like
anything that doesn't fly in at May,

99
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:39,140
through the window,
he'd get to the office,

100
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,450
he'd call his secretary and he dictate
the poems he had thought of on the way to

101
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,690
the office on separate sheets.
She would give him the poems,

102
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,580
he'd put them in a desk drawer,

103
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,170
and then about a month he'd go through
what was in the drawer and throw some of

104
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:56,090
them away and keep some,

105
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,310
and the ones he kept would go into
whatever book it was that he was writing.

106
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,670
Oh,
to have his wastebaskets is what I say.

107
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,040
I dare to think that Stevens would have
liked or at least approved of the idea

108
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,160
of the first stanza of a poem I wrote
many years ago when I was getting up early

109
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,490
enough in March to see the sun rise.

110
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,290
Black Rim pale dawn.

111
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,870
Now as to rolling drums,
son,

112
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,600
you're a great signal comes to bid me on,

113
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,400
but Stevens said at less
pretentiously and better,

114
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,710
he wrote the Sun.

115
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,090
That brave man comes through
bows that lie in. Wait,

116
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,070
that brave man.

117
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,760
I'm skipping a little fears of my bed.

118
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,120
Fears of life and fears of death runaway,

119
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,990
that brave men comes up from below
and walks without meditation.

120
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,980
That brave man. And if you can
think of the song as a brave man,

121
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,440
you're well into Stevens,
I think.

122
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,860
I'm sure Steven would have liked a
story that I'm about to tell you.

123
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,940
When I was teaching Stephens years ago
in among other poets in my course in 20th

124
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,100
century poetry,

125
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,680
I was walking on campus one day and I
ran into one of my students and we were

126
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:36,540
just reading Steven's then, and I said
to him, well, how are you? How goes it?

127
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,290
How are things? He said,
oh, I'm fine. Uh, he said,

128
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,550
all my friends are depressed.
But when I hear how depressed they are,

129
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,550
I look at them and I think,
have it your way.

130
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,830
The world is ugly and the people are sad.

131
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,320
And Stevens would have liked that
because Stevens said that strangely that

132
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:02,070
poetry should make us happy.
It should help to make us happy.

133
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,950
He also said,
and this is rather hard to swallow,

134
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:09,540
perhaps for someone who's been struggling
with the Aurora's of autumn or notes

135
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,270
toward a supreme fiction or
any of the other big ones,

136
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:17,280
people should enjoy poetry
the way a child enjoys snow,

137
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,280
and that is true. Well, in
reading, Steven's especially
reading the little poems,

138
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:28,281
I always say you shouldn't worry about
a poem you should read on and find one

139
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:29,880
that tickles you,

140
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:34,860
that that you like and make a mark there
and returned to that poem later and

141
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:35,694
read it again.

142
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,150
Though it's also important I
know to study Stephen's to study,

143
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:44,580
especially the large poems,

144
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,440
the big creations,

145
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,030
the Aurora's of autumn exists
in a sequence of seasonal poems,

146
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,950
large scale seasonal poems.
That Stevens road,

147
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,460
the earliest one and seasonal terms is
notes toward a supreme fiction and that

148
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:09,120
is a poem of the Spring
and if you read it,

149
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:12,600
you'll see a lot of things that are
associated with Spring and Connecticut.

150
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,270
You'll see the, forget me not in bloom
though. He calls it the Myo Sodas.

151
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,970
Not to be sentimental about it.
You'll hear about Forsythia,

152
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:25,260
you'll hear about yellow and
the blue sky, uh, and it,

153
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,370
it's a spring poem,

154
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,440
then comes credences of summer and
then comes the Aurora's of autumn.

155
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,240
Now these poems go chronologically,
seasonally,

156
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,710
but they also go chronologically
in Stevens, his own life.

157
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,410
He has older as he writes,
eats one of them.

158
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,990
And when he wrote the Aurora's of autumn,

159
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,050
he was in his seventies and this is the
first of the poems in which the idea of

160
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,970
death comes in dauntingly
the idea of human death.

161
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,680
Because one thing that autumn is,

162
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:05,620
is the season that procedures winter,
winter death,

163
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,070
the death of the landscape in New
England and ultimately the death of the

164
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,240
individual human being.

165
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,330
And that threat comes into the
poem and is faced in the poem.

166
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,780
Now I want to go back to
the beginning of the poem.

167
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:29,980
So if you have a copy of it,
you could look at the beginning

168
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,250
and go very quickly through a sigh
sections one through seven maybe.

169
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,060
And I'm,

170
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,010
cause I'm going to end by talking about
sections nine and 10 and then something

171
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:51,670
about section eight
in the poem,

172
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,520
we see the imagination.

173
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,960
It's work as the creator of myth.

174
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,710
This is always been true of human culture.

175
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:05,710
There have always been
great myths of the world,

176
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,100
the myth that the world rests on
a turtle or the myth of creation,

177
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:16,621
how the world was created or how the
animals first came and Steven's toys with

178
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,560
mythical creation. In the poem
in particular, in section one,

179
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,370
he writes three different myths,

180
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,350
which one of which succeeds to the
other in trustee Benzion fashion.

181
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,710
Because,
uh,

182
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,410
an essence of the world as
Steven stinks about it is change.

183
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,420
As I intimated earlier. Uh, it's hard
to imagine Stevens living anywhere,

184
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:46,330
but in a temperate climate
where there are seasons,

185
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,220
it's hard to think of him as living in
the tropics or and at Artica because he's

186
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,440
a man of the seasons
amount man of the weather.

187
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,060
He writes a lot about the weather.
One of his poems begins, lights out,

188
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,740
shades up, a look at the weather.
Let's see what the weather is tonight.

189
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,750
On this particular night

190
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,580
in the first section of
the Aurora's of autumn,

191
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,430
there are three different myths,

192
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,060
one of which succeeds to
another with equal validity.

193
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,750
They are three myths about serpents.

194
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,920
First we have but cosmic serpent,

195
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,250
the bottle is his head,
his air.

196
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:32,230
I'm reading from the beginning of
the section beneath his tip at night,

197
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,100
eyes open and six on us in every sky.

198
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,490
Clearly there he is talking about
the dawning of stars at night.

199
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,080
Eyes Open and fix on us in every sky.

200
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,120
So this is a huge cosmic
serpent that he is imagining.

201
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,540
He's imagining the heavens as
presided over by a great serpent,

202
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:58,090
which may well have something to do
with the Constellation named Drake Code.

203
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,640
DRSC Oh,
which is dragon or or snake.

204
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,540
Then we throw that one away and
Steven says, or is this another?

205
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,560
And or in Steven's always has to be
answered or responded to by saying,

206
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:18,650
yes, this is another one. Let's have
another one. We've just had one.

207
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,480
Let's throw that one out and
have another one. The stale, uh,

208
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
has to always to be thrown out.

209
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,380
So now we get a terrestrial
serpent on a huge scale.

210
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,180
This is where the serpent lives.
You could underline that at the beginning.

211
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,740
The poem, this is where the serpent
lives. Well that's in line one. Uh,

212
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,360
now we're in line seven. This is where
the serpent lives. This is his nest.

213
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,180
These fields,
these hills,

214
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:52,181
these tinted distances and the pines
above that along and beside the sea.

215
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,310
So here we have a serpent that is a trick,
terrestrial myth,

216
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,450
a myth of the whole encompassing
the whole landscape.

217
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,490
And finally at the,
almost at the end,

218
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,740
his meditations in the Ferns,
can you find that?

219
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,040
It's the next to last
tercet of that section.

220
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,560
His as clearly the serpents.

221
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,590
Meditation's his meditations in the ferns
when he moved so slightly to make sure

222
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:27,830
of sun made us no less as sure.

223
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,130
And here is a third serpent
and this is a local serpent,

224
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,070
a particular serpent,
a serpent,

225
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:40,310
visualized in sensory terms.

226
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,200
We saw in his head,
black beaded on the rock,

227
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,950
the flecked animal,
the morning,

228
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,240
the moving grass,
the Indian in his glade,

229
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
the Indian in his glade,
the Indians glade.

230
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,360
That is the native of the soil.

231
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,470
In this section we find one of the
great opposites and Steven's a great

232
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:08,690
oppositions between pairs,

233
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,040
a imagination and reality is of course
one or imagination with the capitol lie

234
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,700
versus imagination with a lower case I
and imagination that sort of produces

235
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,960
little fancies.

236
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,620
But here we have a strange opposition
which is rather idiosyncratic with

237
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:29,630
Steven's between abstraction,

238
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,920
not and not between the
abstract and the concrete,

239
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,030
but between the abstract
and the particular,

240
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,493
the local.

241
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,780
At with that very often
characteristically and Stevens,

242
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,900
there comes a flash of the sensory,

243
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,780
a detail of color.
Black beaded,

244
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,880
the black beaded head of the snake,

245
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,300
a particular glade in New England where
native Americans once lived the Indian

246
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:03,450
in his glade.
The recognition of that.

247
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:09,170
So this opening section of the poem
demonstrates the imagination at work as a

248
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:16,821
generator of myths and one myth succeeds
to another myth one there was the

249
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:23,460
cosmic serpent, the terrestrial
serpent and the local serpent,

250
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,750
the particular serpent,

251
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:28,620
the serpent that we see right
there on a particular day.

252
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,220
Now something happens that's
characteristically Steven's
Ian and occurs at the

253
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:36,660
beginning of section two.

254
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,260
And this is something that
not everyone agrees on,

255
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:44,670
but this is how I interpreted and what
I'm giving you is my interpretation of

256
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:48,000
the poem which you have to take for
better or for worse. For the moment,

257
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,610
farewell to an idea.

258
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:56,810
I take this to be the discarding of
an achieved idea and the moving onto

259
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,820
something else.

260
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,270
So what Steven's is saying farewell
to is the whole serpent mythology,

261
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,670
a cosmic tr,
terrestrial and old.

262
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,140
And from that we turned
to something different.

263
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,710
We turned to seasonal change,

264
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,530
the change from summer to autumn.

265
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,730
And another important Steve
Benzion opposition comes
into play in this section.

266
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,490
And that is the opposition
between whiteness and color
or as Stevens often calls

267
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:43,830
it candor. Candor, as you
may know, is whiteness.

268
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,550
Uh, and if we were true
to our Latin etymologies,

269
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:51,090
all candidates would wear white robes.
Of course I,

270
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,840
it's a little hard to imagine some
of the men of white robe at any rate,

271
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,310
candor is abstract quite.

272
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,290
He also uses the word
blank in this section.

273
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,320
The man who was walking turns blankly
on the sand in notes toward a supreme

274
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:11,994
fiction.

275
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,810
The poem begins with Whiteness and moves
from whiteness from that ever early

276
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,190
candour too.

277
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:24,630
It's late plural from the
abstract to the particular,

278
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:29,490
the multifarious plural here summer,

279
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,680
which is stale. It's
over. It has happened.

280
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,510
So now it's time to throw it out and
move on to something else. Namely autumn.

281
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,070
And the whiteness is
visualized as a landscape.

282
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,280
A cabin stands deserted on a beach and
as the sort of summer cabin that we all,

283
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,760
most of us probably know, a
white beach at a white cabin, uh,

284
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,770
probably, uh, white fence
and maybe a white, uh,

285
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,970
enclosure for a shower that you can
take after you've swum. It's summer.

286
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,370
The flowers against the wall or white

287
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,300
reminding of a white that was different,
something else last year or before.

288
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,740
And now the wind is beginning to blow.
Summer's over.

289
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,270
The wind is blowing the
sand across the floor here.

290
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:26,860
Being visible is being white
is being of the solid of white.

291
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,940
The accomplishment of an
extremist in an exercise,

292
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,530
the season changes. A cold
wind, chills the beach,

293
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,410
the long lines of it grow longer.

294
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Emptier a darkness gathers though it does
not fall and the whiteness grows less

295
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:49,831
vivid on the wall again and again in the
Aurora's of autumn we have some sort of

296
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:55,861
reassuring or splendid or restful vision
and then come some sort of threat,

297
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,990
a cold wind.
Uh,

298
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:03,730
in one of the sections the wind knocks
like a rifle butt against the door.

299
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,320
Uh, and this poem was written
during the decade of World War II.

300
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,510
So violence,
death,

301
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,540
the coming of winter are linked implicitly
in the poem with the idea of war,

302
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,850
the death of war.

303
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,240
And then we go to a single man who was
always the vehicle of the imagination.

304
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:25,910
In the end,

305
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,730
the imagination has to reside in
the consciousness of the individual,

306
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,170
of each one of us.

307
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Although from it we can project a great
cosmic imagination and unmoved mover or

308
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:43,270
a generator of, of images as
Stevens does later in the poem.

309
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,900
So here we have our hero,
the individual man,

310
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,230
the man imagining the man who was
walking turns blankly on the sand.

311
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,530
He observes how the north is always
enlarging the change with it's frigid

312
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,600
brilliances.
It's blue,

313
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:06,130
red sweeps and gusts
of great and killings.

314
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,020
It's polar green,

315
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,100
the color of fire and ice and solitude.

316
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,520
So here what happens is very much like
what happens to white light when it's put

317
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,640
through a prism and broken up
into the colors of the rainbow.

318
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,720
This is what happens in the beginning
of notes toward a supreme fiction,

319
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,010
and it's what happens here.

320
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,280
The whiteness of summer breaks up into
the prismatic colors of the Aurora's of

321
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:38,020
autumn. Now, you probably
have never seen them.

322
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,450
I've never seen the rowers of autumn,

323
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,650
but I happened to know
a man who was in ag,

324
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:49,651
Gail living on the old campus in the
early 1940s and he told me that he

325
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:55,931
remembered coming out of where he lived
at night onto the old campus and looking

326
00:23:56,691 --> 00:24:00,050
up and seeing the Aurora
borealis in color.

327
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,960
It could happen then.
I've seen it in Maine in the summer sky,

328
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,910
but as I've seen it,
it's been quite and dark.

329
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,620
And what you see are white pulsations
in the sky. They're very beautiful.

330
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,080
They're very wonderful,
but it's been many,

331
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:22,820
many years since I saw any colors
in the auroras. Nonetheless,

332
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,150
this is what he's writing
about the Aurora borealis

333
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,910
in its colors.

334
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,880
Section three here again,
farewell to an idea,

335
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,930
a way with the cabin way with
the man walking on the sand.

336
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:43,931
Now we moved to something else and what
we moved to in the next few sections are

337
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,370
myths. Large scale myths. First,

338
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,570
the myth of the mother,
the earth mother,

339
00:24:56,571 --> 00:25:00,590
let's say the sky mother,
the mother as nurturing,

340
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,630
as warm as tender,

341
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,650
the mother who could perhaps
be symbolized by summer,

342
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,810
by a Balmy beneficence,

343
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:12,590
summer day by the warmth
of the sun on a summer day.

344
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,120
Then we get the father,
the myth of the father,

345
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,500
and this is the kind of,
well,

346
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,160
let's say the Joe flight or
Zeus like being the, the uh,

347
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
uh, man who is in, who
presides over the heavens.

348
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,590
But first we have the mother.

349
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,530
The mother gives transparency
to their present piece.

350
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,600
She makes that gentler, that
congenital beat. But here again,

351
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,560
as in over and over.
As I said earlier in this poem,

352
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,540
the concept of something
warm, gentle, reassuring,

353
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,160
gives away to some sort of threat,
the coming of cold,

354
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,770
the wind darkness,

355
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,000
and finally the wind like a rifle.
But at the end of the poem,

356
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,040
boreal night,

357
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:09,250
I'm toward the end of section three here
will look like frost as it approaches

358
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:14,720
them and to the mother as she
falls asleep and as they say,

359
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,170
good night,
good night upstairs,

360
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,370
the windows will be lighted, not
the rooms. What does that mean?

361
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,140
That means that they've turned off the
lights and going to bed. Nonetheless,

362
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,100
there are lights appearing in
the windows and what can they be?

363
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,280
But the lights of the Aurora borealis
that shine in the windows of the house,

364
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,590
even though the light doesn't
come from within the house,

365
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:41,210
it comes from the heavens.

366
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,510
A wind will spread windy grandeur's
round and knock like a rifle butt against

367
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:53,010
the door. The wind will command
them with invincible sound.

368
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,710
So this is the temporary reassuring
togetherness. I hate that word,

369
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,410
but I can't avoid it.
Really in in this section,

370
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,650
this is where we were all together with
the mother and all was well and it was

371
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:11,340
summer, but this can't last.
It never lasts. Something more,

372
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,400
something less welcome takes his
place section for farewell to an idea.

373
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,030
Leave the mother behind, leave. We've
had her now we moved to the father.

374
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,850
The father's sits in space.

375
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,910
Wherever he sits of bleak regard,

376
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,100
he is not a warm nurturing
kind of presence. His regard,

377
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:40,101
his gaze is bleak and then we have this
curious image as one that is strong in

378
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:46,260
the bushes of his eyes. I think
that alludes to the word ambush. Uh,

379
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:50,640
he has a power that is held in
check as when someone is an ambush.

380
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:53,520
The strength is there
and is not yet let out.

381
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,683
Okay?

382
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,820
He says, no to know.
That's an affirmation.

383
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,350
He says yes to yes.
That's an affirmation.

384
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:10,770
He says yes to know that as an
affirmation he always affirms,

385
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,260
he never denies and he affirms something
new and then something new and then

386
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:21,400
something new as signified
by in saying yes,

387
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,750
he says farewell.

388
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,340
That is when you accept
and affirm the new idea,

389
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,190
the new imaginative construction.

390
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,110
You have said farewell to the one that
preceded it as he is done earlier in the

391
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:39,490
poem, farewell to the idea of the cabin
for well to the idea of the mother,

392
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,930
he leaps from Heaven to
heaven more rapidly than bad
angels leap from Heaven to

393
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:52,030
Hell in flames. This is clearly
an illusion to the Christian myth.

394
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,090
And I'm going to bring up the Christian
myth later toward the end of what I'm

395
00:28:57,101 --> 00:29:00,790
saying about,
about the poem you perhaps have read.

396
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,060
If you are English majors,
you may have read paradise lost.

397
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,620
So you've read about how the bad
angels leap from Heaven to Hell.

398
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,870
They're driven out by the
powers of God and his son. Um,

399
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,150
so the father leaps,

400
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,040
that is his imagination,
the cosmic imagination,

401
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,070
the large scale imagination that he
personifies is hugely vital and capable of

402
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:32,311
leaping from one concept to another
from one heaven to another one myth to

403
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:38,190
another.
No,

404
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,250
I meant to say a little earlier and I
will say that I think though I couldn't

405
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,750
substantiate it from this place alone,

406
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,050
that toward the end of section three,

407
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,540
the mother, she falls asleep. And
as they say, good night, good night.

408
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,650
I consider that one of a number of
illusions in the poem to the play Hamlet.

409
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,720
There are a lot of, uh, uh,
there's a lot of theater.

410
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:12,490
Theater is one of the motifs of the poem
and I haven't time to go into that in

411
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,950
detail,
but you see it again and again.

412
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:20,100
And one of the things that happens in the
poem is that a company of actors comes

413
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,480
as happens in hamlet and hamlet
welcomes them. And good night,

414
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:30,340
good night, good night. Sweet ladies.
Good night's sweet ladies. Good night,

415
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,430
good night. I think it
alludes to that, uh,

416
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,060
Elliot quotes that I think it's in the
wasteland that he, that he does it.

417
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,160
So the mask,
the masks,

418
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,930
the actors come and company.

419
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,810
Now I'm at section four toward
the end of that section,

420
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,340
the actors approach and company in
their masks. These are not human actors.

421
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:55,310
This is a super human drama
that is being played, uh,

422
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,700
and the father is inviting them.

423
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,540
And then there's a very eloquent in
vocation of the father as the master,

424
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,420
the master of the Maze,

425
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,690
master Oh master seated by the fire and
yet in space and motionless and yet of

426
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:20,251
motion the ever brightening
origin profound and yet the king.

427
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:24,130
And yet the crown.
Look at this present throne.

428
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,940
What company in masks can
choir it with the naked wind.

429
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,310
How can we celebrate?
How can there be a cell,

430
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:38,110
a theatrical celebration of the world
when the wind is blowing and autumn is

431
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:42,330
coming and darkness is coming,
uh,

432
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,850
to call the master the ever the
origin of motion motionless.

433
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,770
And yet the origin of motion is
to go back to concepts of God.

434
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:59,010
The divine as the unmoved mover applied
to the Christian God and sometimes to

435
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,590
other divinities.
So once again,

436
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:05,320
we have an illusion to religion,

437
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,060
which is nonetheless not part
of a religious presentation.

438
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,970
In section five,

439
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,010
the mother and the father give a party.

440
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,620
I don't happen to like
this section very much.

441
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:27,840
I don't think Steven's really
succeeds in jazzing it up. Uh,

442
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,320
the way he tries to,
the children laugh. The,

443
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:33,370
I don't like the,

444
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,940
the Negro buses who dance like curious
ripeness is of pattern and make insidious

445
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:43,610
tones clawing the sing
song of their instruments.

446
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:47,600
The children laugh and jangle attend
any time while he's trying very hard to

447
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,530
jazz it up. But for me it doesn't quite
work. Nonetheless. This is what it is.

448
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:55,310
This is the party that
the world stages for us,

449
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,720
that as we look out,

450
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,620
the party of spring are the party
of the colors of autumn leaves.

451
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,830
And it's kind of symbolic
representation of that.

452
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,120
The musicians strike the instinctive poem.

453
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:11,030
And so on this then is shatty Yom.

454
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,390
Do you find that that's three stances,

455
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,870
three tercets from the
end of that section? Uh,

456
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,150
I believe that [inaudible] is used here,

457
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,650
sorry as the name of a
great chateau in France,

458
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,200
there is such a chateau.
So it is uh, a palace,

459
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:37,460
a castle where there could be a
splendid party with dancers and with,

460
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,580
with music.
This then is shatter your as you please.

461
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,730
We stand in the tumult of the festival.

462
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:48,110
The world is a kind of tumultuous
festival at times that goes on around us.

463
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:53,111
Let's say on an autumn day when the trees
are very bright and color and the wind

464
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:57,710
is blowing and the sky is blue and the
leaves are drifting from the trees as the

465
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:02,030
two mode of a festival.
But all of a sudden what festival?

466
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,820
This loud disordered Mooch,

467
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,310
these brute like guests,
these musicians dubbing at a tragedy,

468
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:15,200
a dub dub, which is made up of this,
that there are no lines to speak.

469
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,280
There is no play or the person's
act one merely by being here.

470
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,120
So once again we have affirmation and
then comes threat than comes denial.

471
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,300
There really is no play.
There is no theater.

472
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,790
It's only something that we imagined.

473
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:40,030
But then immediately as if to prove
its validity and its vitality.

474
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The great imagination speaks in section
six and others at the beginning of that

475
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:47,504
section.

476
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,510
One of the most eloquent tributes to
the beauty of the cosmos that I know in

477
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:58,391
poetry in which an amazing
telescoping of time takes place.

478
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,051
What do they call it?

479
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:05,051
Fast forward photography perhaps you've
seen one where the flower grows up and

480
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:11,410
is seen blooming and here we see geology
in fast forward we see mountains rising

481
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:16,700
and falling like water,
like waves.

482
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,590
It is a theater floating
through the clouds itself.

483
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,453
A cloud,

484
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,910
although of Mr did rock and mountains
running like water wave on wave through

485
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:31,520
waves of light.

486
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,100
It is a cloud to transform to cloud
transformed again idly the way a season

487
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:44,991
changes color to no end except the
lavishing of itself than change as light

488
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,380
changes yellow into gold and gold
to it's opal elements and fires.

489
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:57,111
Delight splashed wide wise because
it likes magnificence and the solemn

490
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:02,751
pleasures of magnificent space and then
human history is seen fast forwarding,

491
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,690
as the section goes on a up capital,

492
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:09,300
it may be as emerging
or has just collapsed.

493
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:14,370
Civilization has come to as a mountain
has come and has collapsed the day new

494
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:19,470
mall has to be postponed,
but now, once again,

495
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,970
the all importance of the hero,
the human hero,

496
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,480
that is the imagining mind is affirmed.

497
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:32,510
This is nothing until in a single man
contained nothing until this named thing

498
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:37,140
nameless is and is destroyed.

499
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,480
He opens the door of his house on flames.
That's the Aurora.

500
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,190
In other words,
the Aurora Borealis,

501
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,430
the scholar of one candle sees an Arctic
effulgence flaring on the frame of

502
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,660
everything he is and he feels afraid.

503
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,810
In section seven
Stephen's visualizes as a,

504
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,230
let's say a mythical hypothesis.

505
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:09,410
Suppose that there is a cosmic imagination
that imagines the whole show and

506
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:16,560
imagination that imagines the passing
of the seasons that imagines the earth,

507
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:21,360
the solar system, the whole cosmos.
Suppose that maybe there is.

508
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,130
Let's imagine that there is. So the
answer to the questions are always yes.

509
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,440
Is there an imagination that sits
enthroned as grim as it has been? Evolent,

510
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,720
the just and the unjust,

511
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,370
which in the midst of summer stops
to imagine winter. Yes, there is.

512
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,880
Why not when the leaves are dead,

513
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:45,240
does it take its place in
the north and unfold itself?

514
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,480
Goat leaper crystal than luminous
sitting in highest night here.

515
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,430
And I have no time to go into
this aspect of the poem. Uh, it's,

516
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,940
which is another one like the theater,
uh,

517
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,530
and then the hamlet illusions
that I think are there.

518
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,950
This is part of the astronomical motifs
in the poem and there's a great deal

519
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:12,720
about the stars. I mentioned Draco
and the First Section is possibly, uh,

520
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,370
underlying the celestial serpents.

521
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,350
A great big constellation
that is across the sky for us,

522
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,700
for us in New England.

523
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:26,270
And here the goat leaper is
the constellation Capricorn.

524
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,270
A Capricorn means goat horn as,
as you know,

525
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,510
and you may also know that Capricorn
begins in the Zodiac on the 22nd of

526
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,513
December,

527
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,970
which choose to say immediately
after the winter solstice.

528
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,630
So the Constellation Capricorn
take soap, comes in, uh,

529
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:55,030
at what Steven's at the end
of the poem calls in winters,

530
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,560
Nick in the nick of winter,

531
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,950
just as the solstice comes
and the Constellation
Capricorn becomes the dominant

532
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:05,810
constellation of the Zodiac.

533
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,733
Okay.

534
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,990
But now we can't stay solemn.
We have the mood has to change.

535
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,350
And so we get at the end of this section
a change from destiny to slight cap

536
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:25,000
priests with I think an
allusion to the word Capricorn.

537
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,920
And you may know that the Capri
element has to do with leaping.

538
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,940
Uh, so the, uh,

539
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,220
leaping from heaven to Hell
is associated with that.

540
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,360
It was changed from destiny,
dislike caprice,

541
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,060
and thus it's jetted tragedy.

542
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:46,460
It's steel and shape and
mournful making moved,

543
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:49,330
defined what must unmake it and what last,

544
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:53,410
what can say a flippant
communication under the move.

545
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,790
So all this is thrown away and what we
have so flippant, something flippant,

546
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,990
but that is the way Stevens,
his, uh, imagination works,

547
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:06,090
especially on a large scale
there.

548
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Ares of autumn is not
architectonic Lee structured,

549
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:12,370
uh,

550
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:17,370
as say something like the odes of Keats
and Shelley are like at an alias or the

551
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:22,720
Ode on Melancholy or the
Ode on a Grecian Urn.

552
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:28,170
That is to say it does not move by
logical stages to a climax at the end.

553
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,460
That incorporates in is founded
on what has gone before.

554
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,170
Rather it is structured. If structure
is the word, as I've been telling you,

555
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,280
you go from one thing to another,
you go from one thing to its opposite,

556
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,840
you go from something solemn to something
flipping, you go from summer to autumn,

557
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,820
you go from day to night,

558
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:53,910
from the warmth of the mother to
the threat of death and darkness.

559
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,010
Nonetheless,
it does move.

560
00:40:57,011 --> 00:41:01,360
The poem does move toward what
I would call a culmination,

561
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,380
not an architect tonic
or structural climax,

562
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,360
but a kind of emotional climax.

563
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,050
And this happens in the
next to last section,

564
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:16,051
section nine a and is predicated on the
assertion of innocence at the beginning

565
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,610
of section eight.

566
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,070
And I should say in case I don't have
time to do justice to it at the end,

567
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,690
uh, that in section 10, the
whole thing falls apart.

568
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,690
We discard the whole thing.
Uh,

569
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:36,691
and it all becomes fragmentary and
the musical creations become trivial.

570
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:37,941
Uh,

571
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,941
and we got an ending that is completely
unsatisfactory to those of us who love

572
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,130
resonant rhetorical endings.
It's just not like that.

573
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:52,340
And we can't look in Stevens
for that kind of ending.

574
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:59,110
The term innocence is another term like
imagination that has to be thought of in

575
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,640
it's Steve Benzion sense.

576
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,643
Cool.

577
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,550
The opposite of innocence or
Stevens is either guilt or malice.

578
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,720
Uh, now you probably know, you may,

579
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,200
you may know that the origin
of the word innocence,

580
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,530
the root Latin root of the word innocence
is a Latin verb meaning to harm.

581
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,950
No,
Kara.

582
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,600
So in no sense literally
is on harming nus.

583
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,713
The

584
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:41,510
of affirmation of innocence that comes
to the speaker in section eight arises in

585
00:42:43,601 --> 00:42:46,390
a sense from all that is gone before.

586
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,240
That is from the myth making
of the early sections.

587
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:51,610
Because as we think back on them,

588
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,260
it's obvious that Stevens
is overarching myths,

589
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,560
is great. Cosmic myths,
the mother, the father,

590
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:04,120
the celestial imagination that imagines
the whole world and the passage of the

591
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,700
Zodiac.
Uh,

592
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:10,980
none of that has anything to do with
revealed religion or particularly with the

593
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:15,520
Christianity that we,
most of us know so much about.

594
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,890
As we think back,

595
00:43:17,891 --> 00:43:22,891
it's obvious that there's nothing
in them about a benevolent God,

596
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,900
a God who watches over us,

597
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,960
a god who comforts us and who will
reward us if we were virtuous.

598
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,900
There's nothing about that.
The imagination with the capitalized,

599
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:39,670
the cosmic imagination is
as grim as it is benevolent.

600
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,250
The world is as grim as it is benevolent.
We have the benevolence of summer,

601
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,900
but always after it,

602
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:51,901
the darkening of autumn and the grimness
and cold of winter and humanly we have

603
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:57,790
the change from youth
to the midst of life,

604
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:02,970
to finally the coming of death and that
possibility that inevitability is faced

605
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,920
at the end of the poem.

606
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,480
So what is innocent here is the world.

607
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,620
The world is innocent.
It means us no harm.

608
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,360
It is not malicious.

609
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:20,860
It's if there's No God who
benevolently watches over us.

610
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:26,070
There's also no god who judges us
well who can signs us to damnation.

611
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:32,310
So we can live in the world in the
state of innocence without what Steven's

612
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,680
eloquently calls.

613
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:38,520
And I hope you'll check
it out again after this.

614
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:44,040
The enigma of the guilty dream.
Christianity,

615
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:49,140
we don't understand it. It's a riddle.
It's the guilty dream, but it's a dream.

616
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,360
Uh,
like all of the dreams

617
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,400
the world operates in personally,

618
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,710
it means us no harm.

619
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,010
Now I'm going to read toward
the end of section eight.

620
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,310
So then these lights,

621
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,310
these lights are the Aurora Borealis,

622
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,480
which he's referred to by the phrase
these lights several times in the poem.

623
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,110
These lights are not a spell of light,

624
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,450
a saying out of a cloud,

625
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,720
but innocence and innocence of the earth
and no fault sign or symbol of malice

626
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,030
that we partake thereof lie down like
children in this holiness as if awake we

627
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:42,900
lay in the quiet of sleep.
I haven't time to go on.

628
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:44,430
But in section nine,

629
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:49,820
Stephen's picks up on this and says we
were as Danes and Denmark all day long,

630
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,080
hail hearted, Lansman we were brothers.
And here we have the play hamlet again.

631
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,330
Uh,
as you remember in hamlet,

632
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:04,770
there's something rotten in the state
of Denmark and here the world is Denmark

633
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,470
and there's something wholesome
in the state of Denmark.

634
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,730
And what does wholesome is us and the
world and the beauty of the world,

635
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,040
even though that beauty eventually,
uh,

636
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,200
gives way to darkness and cold shall
we be found hanging in the trees next

637
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,110
spring.
This is toward the end of section nine.

638
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:30,740
And people interpret this differently
and I think the word hanging is

639
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:32,784
misleading,

640
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,800
but I read it as meaning are we going
to come back in the spring as the leaves

641
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:40,080
come back in the spring and we're not.

642
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,660
Human life is a single trajectory,
has a single spring,

643
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:50,661
summer and winter and loss
in such a world is permanent.

644
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,330
But in this world we have
the splendor of the world.

645
00:46:56,641 --> 00:46:58,050
If we can simply see it,

646
00:46:58,051 --> 00:47:02,790
if we can allow ourselves to see it
without preconceptions and we can see the

647
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:05,820
stars putting on their glittering belts.

648
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,340
And this reminds me of the
Constellation or Ryan, uh,

649
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,540
which has a glittering belt
and a dagger hanging from it.

650
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,790
They throw around their shoulders,
cloaks that flash like a great shadows,

651
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,900
last embellishment,
but now suddenly there's a change.

652
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:25,650
There's a drop in the rhetoric to
the utmost simplicity of language.

653
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:31,730
The last tercet three part three
line stanza of section nine.

654
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,280
It may come tomorrow in the simplest word,

655
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,120
almost as part of innocence almost
as the tenderest and the truest part.

656
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:44,763
And it,

657
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:50,040
I'm quite certain his death and hamlet
if speaks memorable and extremely simple

658
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:55,750
words.
When he is about to die,

659
00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:00,220
he's about to fight a duel and which
is going to be poisoned. And Horatio,

660
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:04,240
his friend is concerned
and fears his death.

661
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,130
And hamlet says, Tosh, it's nothing. Uh,

662
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,760
if it be not today,
it will be tomorrow.

663
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,650
And who'd been out tomorrow? It will
be today. And if it'd be not now,

664
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,630
it will come. And that I think is
what is being echoed in a sense here.

665
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,300
It may come tomorrow.
And the simplest word,

666
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,780
this is almost as a part of innocence
almost as the tenderest at truest park.

667
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,460
Well, I can say only a few
words about section 10 as I say,

668
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:41,200
everything goes to hell. And section 10,
all the great concepts are discarded.

669
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,600
But in section 10,

670
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:49,060
we do return to the concept
of happiness in Steven's, uh,

671
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:49,481
we,

672
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:54,481
our humanity is and unhappy
people in a happy world.

673
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,360
That is to say we live in a world in
which there is splendor and vitality and

674
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,960
the sun is like a jungle tuft
of feathers and like an animal.

675
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,853
I,

676
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:14,130
but we're unhappy because we liked the
faculty of imagination as the EU does in

677
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:15,094
the poem,

678
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,620
the cosmic imagination
meditates the whole thing,

679
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:23,290
the history of humanity,
all of our fates.

680
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:26,200
And at the end of the
very end of the poem,

681
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,760
the mother reappears and
degraded form as a Harridan,

682
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,590
which means a kind of an ugly,

683
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,450
untidy old crone and a
haggling of wind and weather.

684
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,770
The splendors of the Aurora have
come to that buy these lights,

685
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,900
like a blaze of summary Straw in winters
snick and that's the last metaphor for

686
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,790
the Aurora borealis.

687
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,940
Winter's nick is the solstice,

688
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:55,960
the coming of con Capricorn,
the Constellation.

689
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,250
And the Auroras are like a blaze
of Straw in the midst of all that,

690
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,060
not a very grand image,
but for Stevens,

691
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,110
this is what we have.
And this is enough.

692
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,140
And I think in a poem
like the rowers of autumn,

693
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,430
he managed to convince us at least
temporarily, but it is enough.

694
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:17,860
Thank you.
