1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:02,940
First dates lecture,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,030
I was talking about a Yates
is early development and,

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:11,910
and stylistic transformation.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,623
Uh,

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,020
over the course of roughly a 20,

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,710
25 year period. Yates has a long
career, you know, really beginning, uh,

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,980
uh, in the, uh, you
know, late 19th century.

8
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,660
And when, when we, the,

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,560
the poems that matter
the most to us today, um,

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,720
are those that he starts
publishing around 1915, uh,

11
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,820
uh, in 1914, uh, and, and
later, uh, but, uh, you know,

12
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,670
that he's in really the middle
of his, his, um, uh, uh,

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,500
literary career at that point. Um, I,

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,120
I suggested in looking at
that early development, um,

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,250
that, uh, uh, well Yates is,

16
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,460
is seen as a kind of representative
figure who somehow, uh,

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,250
moves out of, um, uh, symbolism,

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,590
uh, out of, uh, kind of, uh, uh,

19
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:15,591
ordinate aestheticism towards
a kind of heroic realism.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,050
Um, but I, I insisted instead
that in fact the, the,

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,040
the way though to understand
that development is really
a transition from one

22
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:30,120
set of symbols to another. Um, uh,

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,670
as exemplified by the,
the movement between,

24
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,370
uh, uh, Angus and the fishermen in,

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,610
in Yates is a early work,
um,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,150
uh, the, uh, little poem, a coat,

27
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,230
a that poem about that
stylistic transformation, um,

28
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,690
about the, the enterprise of
walking naked. Uh, well, uh,

29
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,010
it's,

30
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,010
it's a poem that that reminds us that
Yates is development was as he understood

31
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,920
it, conditioned by his
relationship to his audience.

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,690
A Yates I said wanted to speak
for and to the Irish people,

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,970
uh, as well as, uh, to explain, uh, uh,

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,040
Ireland and Irishness to an
English speaking world, uh,

35
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,180
abroad. At the same time, uh,

36
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,250
even as he has a kind of

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,360
intense, uh, identification
with the Irish people, uh,

38
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:42,390
he also in that little poem and,

39
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:47,280
and other pumps fears being
betrayed by the crowd, uh,

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,020
fears being sold cheap,
uh, complains of, of,

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,930
uh, uh, complains of his reception.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,990
Last time I,
uh,

43
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:02,710
alluded to Yates is involvement
in the Abbey Theater,

44
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,240
uh, beginning in 1904. This is
an important phase of his career.

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,350
When with the help of
Lady Augusta Gregory, uh,

46
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,950
and John Singh, uh, Yates, uh,

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,550
tries to establish an
Irish national drama,

48
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,520
uh, sings, play the playboy of the
Western world, which you may know,

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,640
uh, it was set in the Aran Islands, uh,

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,200
in western Ireland.
Uh,

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,480
this was a kind of turning point in
the movement under misunderstood,

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,730
uh, as a, as a satire on
the Irish peasant tree.

53
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,720
A Yates is a production of the play,
uh,

54
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,050
led to riots in 1909.

55
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,400
And this is one of the,
uh, uh, events. Uh,

56
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:55,570
I think that Yates is a thinking about
in the fishermen when he speaks of great

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,350
art, beaten down, uh,

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,690
the audience that Yates,
uh,

59
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,510
disdains and turns away from in the teens,
uh,

60
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,190
is, uh, importantly, uh, uh,
middle class urban audience.

61
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:17,620
Um, and, and that, that
attitude of is, uh, it's,

62
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,530
it's a motif. Uh, we find, uh,

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,300
in other poets that we'll read and,
uh, uh, I'd like you to, to, um, um,

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,240
note it, uh, an attitude that we'll
see in pound, uh, in Elliot in,

65
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,290
in different ways.

66
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,360
The displacement of,
uh,

67
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,310
aristocratic and peasant
cultures by, uh, an urban, uh,

68
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,260
Bruges Z, uh, by that bat, the Dublin
theater going audience, the, the,

69
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,250
uh, the people at the
center of a new, uh, uh,

70
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,560
uh, Mongrel, uh, modern culture. Uh,

71
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:01,320
well these are the people that
Joyce depicts. So memorably, uh,

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
in the daily life of Leopold bloom,
uh,

73
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,890
Yates is a very different writer and
has a different relation to the world of

74
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,330
Joyce's. Ulysses, for
example, a Yates has a,

75
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:21,190
has a kind of hostility towards
this, uh, ascendant, uh,

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
middleclass world in a hostility that
you can view as a kind of anti modernism.

77
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,330
Uh, and we're anti
modernness, uh, that is again,

78
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,850
an important component in Yates,
uh,

79
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,640
or, or maybe the right way to
say it would be that Yates,

80
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:44,380
his sense of his own modernity of what
it means for him to be modern, uh,

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,700
emerges in, in, um, a defiance of, uh,

82
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,560
certain, uh, uh, new, uh,
uh, social formations.

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,160
Uh,

84
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,820
and also through a fantasy,

85
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,860
I say,
uh,

86
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,480
identification with the
aristocracy and with the peasantry,

87
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,200
uh,

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,200
with these cultures rooted in a
rural Irish Society of the past

89
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,030
like pound, uh, like Elliot, uh,

90
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,500
from a political and a
social point of view,

91
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,550
you could say that Yates is
a reactionary modernist, uh,

92
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
turning away from the ascendant social
forms of the present towards a idealized

93
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,864
past.

94
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Or rather you could say,

95
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,730
Yates seems to want to do this,

96
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:43,850
seems to want to turn
away from the present. Uh,

97
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,740
expresses the desire to, in fact, however,

98
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,720
uh,
Yates,

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,720
his eyes remain really fixed in the
kind of horror and fascination on the,

100
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:01,661
a cataclysmic events of his time on the
political life of his time in which he

101
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,960
is himself. Very much involved. Uh,

102
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,370
Yates is in fact a,

103
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,390
a far less nostalgic thinker
then either Elliot or pound,

104
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,560
at least as I understand the,
uh, the, the stance that I'm,

105
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,470
I'm trying to describe,

106
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:28,730
which is a kind of ambivalent
and complicated one, uh,

107
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,320
emerges a powerfully, uh, in,

108
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:37,580
in the Palm Easter 1916, uh, uh,

109
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,100
on page one oh five.
And in this book,

110
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,640
and I'd like to spend some
time with that with you.

111
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,620
Easter 1916, uh, the subject

112
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,640
of this poem is the Easter Uprising.

113
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,043
Okay.

114
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,460
The Irish Republican challenge to English
domination that briefly established an

115
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:15,840
Irish state that led
by Patrick, uh, Pierce,

116
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,970
uh, who, uh, along with, uh, in fact,

117
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:25,680
all but one of the leaders of
the insurrection was executed.

118
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,960
Uh, these events have, uh, you know,

119
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:34,600
still have a kind of central
and powerful place in,

120
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,700
in modern IRS consciousness.
If you,

121
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,650
you'd go to Dublin and
you enter the post office,

122
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:45,630
the one of the important
scenes of the, uh, rebellion,

123
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,813
uh,
you,

124
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,820
you find great a wall
paintings of scenes from,

125
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,800
uh, from the, the rising,
uh, almost, you know,

126
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,760
stations of the cross. Um, uh,

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,460
the, uh, uh,

128
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,870
well Dublin is an interesting place
to be with this poem and mine,

129
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,070
uh, partly because you, you realize, uh,

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,580
when you were there that that it's
the city center is a small one.

131
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,420
Uh, and that, um, well Yates has houses,

132
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,310
was not far from uh, the
post office. Uh, and,

133
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,790
uh, the um, uh,

134
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,140
world that he's writing about
a is something, uh, very, uh,

135
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,370
intimate and familiar, uh,
of which he is a part a.

136
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:40,371
And that is in fact one of the important
points of departure for this poem.

137
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,843
He says,

138
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I have met them at close of day coming
with vivid faces from counter or desk

139
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,050
among gray, 18th century houses, Dublin,

140
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,300
them being the revolutionaries

141
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I have passed with a nod of the head
or polite meaningless words or I've

142
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,350
lingered a while and said polite,

143
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,980
meaningless words and thought before I
had done of a mocking tail or a jibe to

144
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,980
please a companion around
the fire at the club.

145
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,730
Being certain that they in I but lived
where motley is worn all changed,

146
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,330
changed utterly.
A terrible beauty is born

147
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,330
motley signifying their
Irishness as if Yates and,

148
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,290
and these men and women.

149
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,440
He speaks of shared only their Irishness.

150
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,390
In the second stroph fee of this poem,

151
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:59,391
he proceeds to talk about
to isolate individuals,

152
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,780
uh, particular, uh, figures,
uh, of the revolt, which, uh,

153
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,350
uh, your, uh,

154
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,250
editor identifies at the bottom of the
page that woman's days were spent in

155
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:16,980
ignorant goodwill.

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,810
Her nights in argument
until her voice grew shrill.

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,750
What voice more sweet than hers. When
young and beautiful she rode to Harriers.

158
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,150
This man had kept a school in Rhode,
our winged horse,

159
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,550
this other, his helper and
friend was coming into his force.

160
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,580
He might've won fame in the end.

161
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:47,090
So sensitive is nature seemed
so daring and sweet is thought.

162
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,890
This other man I had dreamed
a drunk and vainglorious loud.

163
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,400
He had done most bitter wrong to
some who were near my heart mud gun,

164
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,970
yet I number him in the song.
He too has resigned his part.

165
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,290
He in the casual comedy,
he too has been changed in his turn,

166
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,550
transformed utterly a
terrible beauty is born

167
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,700
gates. This is describing his interaction
with uh, uh, and his distance from,

168
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,530
uh, purse, uh, and the
others in that first stanza.

169
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,130
And then in the second he's
saying something like, uh,

170
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,130
I used to see these people all the time.
Uh,

171
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,570
I was proud,
however,

172
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,990
I kept myself apart from them.

173
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,690
I felt we had nothing in common
but motley, uh, our Irishness.

174
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,820
But all that is changed by events.

175
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,100
They have become political
martyrs to the future Irish state.

176
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,280
And I am obliged to remember
and honor them in my poetry.

177
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,280
Even those I disdained my poetry,

178
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,400
uh, which, well,

179
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,930
the dedication to which had defined
Yates's difference from them up till now.

180
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,000
The poems,
extraordinary refrain,

181
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,790
a terrible beauty is born.
Uh,

182
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,950
it returns in the poem like,
uh,

183
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,010
uh, like a chorus, uh,

184
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,360
like the voice of some kind of
abstract and impersonal chorus.

185
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,880
Uh, and it, it, um,

186
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,920
suggests a,
almost a strangely impersonal event.

187
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,640
Something that happens,
uh,

188
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,880
without agents making it happen.
A terrible beauty is born

189
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,440
a passive construction.
Uh,

190
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,080
take the first part of the
refrain first all changed,

191
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,000
changed, utterly, all changed,

192
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,530
changed utterly.

193
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:29,650
I think they've really three strong
metrical accents in a row there.

194
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,920
Uh,
by all

195
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,780
that three letter word,
uh,

196
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,800
highly [inaudible] word and word Yates
loves to use. You'll see, you'll see him,

197
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,570
uh,
use it often.

198
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,520
Yates means all of all of those people,

199
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,950
all the people I've been describing,

200
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,750
he also means my relation to them,

201
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,630
the way I kept myself apart from them.
Uh,

202
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,770
he also means all,
uh,

203
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,860
everything plain and simple awe in
the sense of everyone and everything,

204
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,240
all conveying a kind of
apocalyptic apical event.

205
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,680
That wonderful pile up of
stress in that line all changed,

206
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,630
changed utterly.
A terrible beauty is born.

207
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,910
Another two, two strong, three beat
lines in a row, they become a kind of,

208
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:45,580
well, what a bell ringing in the poem, uh,

209
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,610
peeling, uh, and, and, uh, uh, uh,

210
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:54,611
announcing the coming of the
birth of a new and terrible age.

211
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,920
How can something be
changed utterly? Uh, it's,

212
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,360
it's how can, how can something
be changed utterly? Uh,

213
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,620
it doesn't that mean destroyed,
uh,

214
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,460
to be entirely changed.
Uh,

215
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,960
Yates is,
is

216
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,590
talking about an event that has
brought forth a destruction,

217
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,720
a destruction of the world
before the Easter uprising.

218
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,270
And Easter is an important resonance here.
Obviously a Easter,

219
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:39,530
another moment, uh, of
death and transfiguration,

220
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,880
Trans Trans Formation, uh, here.

221
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,983
Uh,

222
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,180
this destruction brings forth a new order,

223
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:53,930
a new form of life that
Yates cause terrible beauty.

224
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,060
Uh, this may be the most memorable, uh,

225
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,990
sentence in modern poetry.
A terrible beauty is born.

226
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,690
I said that, that Yates
looks on, uh, uh, the modern,

227
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,000
uh, with a sense of both the
whore and, and a fascination of,

228
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:16,550
of compulsion. Uh, almost, uh, well, uh,

229
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:21,460
it's a terrible beauty. He sees
that, that that draws him. Uh,

230
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,530
in this way he sees the specifically
the passion of the Revolutionaries Act.

231
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,290
Any fines that beautiful Yates
aestheticizes their political action.

232
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,070
He finds beauty in it.
It seems even,

233
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,460
or especially because it is terror filled

234
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,020
when the change, uh,
that it enacts is utter,

235
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,020
uh, which is to say, ah,

236
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,220
a change.
That means blood

237
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,320
define bloody events. Beautiful.
What do you think about that?

238
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,510
How do you, how do, how do you describe
the, the, uh, the politics, uh,

239
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,010
if he like, uh, of, of such a position?

240
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,070
Uh,
well,

241
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,870
how does the gates stand in relation
to the events he's describing?

242
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,690
Easter 1916, equivocates, uh,

243
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,830
like that phrase, terrible beauty. Uh,

244
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,120
the palm is full of contradictions
of contradictory feelings.

245
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,080
It takes the side of the nationalists.

246
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,550
It also makes the ante nationalists the
English or pro English or unionist case.

247
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,480
It sees the dead as heroic martyrs.
Uh,

248
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,620
it also sees them as,
uh, uh, ideologues, uh,

249
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,230
as a,
uh,

250
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,640
as a Stoney hearted,
uh,

251
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,410
um, uh, uh, political activists,

252
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,960
uh,
it sees the dead as lovers to,

253
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,200
uh,
it sees them as dreamers.

254
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,840
A Yates looks at them with pity,
with admiration,

255
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,670
with scorn. Uh, he speaks of them

256
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,860
as a mother would
have her children.

257
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,160
Uh,
all of these attitudes and others to are,

258
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:49,940
are, uh, are held in suspension
in the palm. And, uh,

259
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,950
you can hear them together. Uh,
Yates moving from one to another,

260
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,270
uh, with Oh, uh, uh,

261
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,260
uh,

262
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,260
incredible speed and agility in
that final straw fee of the poem.

263
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:06,800
On the,
the next

264
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,153
Paige,

265
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,850
listen to, uh, to how quickly
Yates modulators from one,

266
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,690
one feeling, uh, one image, uh,

267
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:21,730
to another in these really very short,

268
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,730
a quick three beat lines.

269
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,290
Too long a sacrifice can
make a stone of the heart.

270
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,110
Oh,
when may it suffice?

271
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,540
That is heaven's part our part to murmur.

272
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:45,541
Name upon name as a mother named her
child when sleep at last has come limbs

273
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,630
that had run wild. What
is it? But nightfall,

274
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,430
no, no, no, not night,

275
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,700
but death was it needless death after
all for England may keep faith for all

276
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,470
that has done and said,

277
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,820
we know their dream enough to know they
dreamed in our dead in what if excess of

278
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:16,390
love bewildered them till they died.

279
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,630
I write it out in a verse,

280
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Mcdonough and Mcbride and Connolly and
Pearse now and in time to be whatever

281
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,780
green is worn are changed,
changed utterly.

282
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,800
A terrible beauty is born.

283
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,020
This is really moving poetry.
Uh, you know, remarkably so.

284
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,210
Uh, and that may be the most
important fact about it.

285
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,913
Uh,

286
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,330
when Yeats aestheticizes the political,

287
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,060
uh, he makes it moving, uh,

288
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,780
moving in the literal sense of,
uh,

289
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,130
I think emotionally engaging in Cathartic,
uh,

290
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,630
he can specifically converts the
political into tragic action,

291
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,520
tragic action, which as spectators, uh,

292
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,480
the poet and the reader, ourselves, uh,

293
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,810
are meant to be passionately
and imaginatively engaged.

294
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,600
Uh,
which is also to say implicated

295
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,290
through hates his poem. Uh,
Easter 1916 goes on, happening,

296
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,060
uh, happening, uh, in a sense,
uh, uh, in and, and, and,

297
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,380
and even to us,

298
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,580
the poem makes us see the political as
a space of passion and of contradictions

299
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,230
like art. Uh, and it requires
us to understand history,

300
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,030
not in moral terms, uh,
such as good and evil,

301
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,640
but rather in aesthetic terms,
a pity and terror.

302
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,950
These become crucial terms.
Uh, the terms that, uh,

303
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,870
Aristotle in his poetics
used to define tragedy.

304
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,090
Uh, when the, when the bombs went off in,

305
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:22,930
in London last year, uh, I
thought about, Yay, it's,

306
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:27,790
and, and, and, and, uh, what he might
have thought or written about this as I,

307
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:32,590
as I said last time when I showed
you that letter to pound his, uh,

308
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,000
uh, Yates is, um, London apartment, uh,

309
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:41,830
is essentially across the street
from where the number 30 bus blew up.

310
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,360
Uh, and interestingly, um,

311
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,480
strangely make of it what you
will, the man who, uh, uh,

312
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:54,630
detonated that a bomb, uh,
as I understand it, uh,

313
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,860
had studied the aids, uh,
at school and in leads.

314
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,320
Uh,
there's a,

315
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,760
there's a way in which he hates
his poetry of this period,

316
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,170
uh, goes on resonating in, in, uh,

317
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,290
the world we're, we're
living in Yates's Yates.

318
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,930
His sense of his own
implication in, in history, uh,

319
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,640
well it's something that we see in the,
uh,

320
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,060
intensive stylistic transformations
that his writing undergoes

321
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,280
a part of the resonance and
power of that famous refrain,

322
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,130
a terrible beauty is born.
Uh,

323
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:37,100
is that this beauty is being born not
only in the world, but in Yates is poetry.

324
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,980
Uh, something remarkable is
happening, uh, to, uh, the poet, uh,

325
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,230
and to, uh, his, his language.

326
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,590
At the same time a Yates is saying,

327
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,460
even simply on one level, I will
write differently. Henceforth,

328
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,020
I must, uh, Yates is stylistic.

329
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,910
Changes in this way,

330
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:03,911
are coordinated with respond to the
historical changes he witnesses and

331
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,680
participates in, uh,
in particular, uh, uh,

332
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,720
coordinated with the violent,
uh, emergence of, uh,

333
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,540
through civil war of,
of the Irish state,

334
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,070
which Yates would serve as a senator,
uh,

335
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,270
in the 1920s.

336
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,150
Yates in this period makes and
remakes his work out of passion,

337
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,620
uh, sort of as he images
to malt in the breast,

338
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,910
uh, uh, a, uh, uh,

339
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,210
to Molt from which new modes of poetry,
new modes of self knowledge,

340
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,400
uh,
emerge for Yates.

341
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,650
Yates is poetry is full
of images of birth, uh,

342
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:59,000
and he tends to represent
birth as an explosion,

343
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,540
a bursting forth, a bursting
forth of, of energy,

344
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,240
uh, or presence, uh,

345
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,250
in some sense that can't be contained
or constrained in existing forms.

346
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,310
Uh,
I'll say,

347
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,870
I'll say more about this next time
with reference to Yates is late poetry.

348
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,533
Uh,

349
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,520
what I want to stress now is
that Yates sees passion at work.

350
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,620
Uh, in the same way in history. Uh,

351
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,980
powerful superhuman forces emerge from
or invade a human actors and change.

352
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,110
Uh, one consequence of this
view is that for Yates,

353
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,670
a history starts to look
like a palm, uh, or, uh,

354
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:58,671
it starts to conform to laws of
poetic imagination or of tragedy,

355
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:00,330
if you like,

356
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,160
uh, of myth. Uh, it, uh,

357
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,180
well,
uh,

358
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,440
in the Easter rising,

359
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,383
uh,

360
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,950
purse and the other's for Yates,
uh, invoke, uh, as, as they,

361
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,360
the revolutionaries themselves
deliberately and rhetorically did, uh,

362
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,270
invoke ancient Irish
heroes, uh, uh, purse,

363
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,800
uh,
is seen as in Yates,

364
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:34,801
as poetry and in popular lore as
Hoolan as a kind of Avatar of,

365
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,720
of, uh, um, uh, you know, the, uh, um,

366
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,270
uh, mythic Irish hero,
uh, at the same time,

367
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:47,830
uh,

368
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,830
as the superhuman enters these
historical characters in this way,

369
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,860
uh, there's also, uh, well, um, uh,

370
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,020
um, an energy that you would have
to call subhuman, uh, be steel.

371
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,490
Uh, that does, uh, as
well. Uh, in his late poem,

372
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,220
the statutes, which you
don't have, Yeats says,

373
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,490
um, uh, um,

374
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,350
what, uh, when, when, um, uh, Paris, uh,

375
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,690
summoned Coolin to his side,

376
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,700
what stopped through
the post office as if,

377
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,710
uh, the revolutionaries action, um, uh,

378
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,900
brought forth at once,
uh,

379
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,930
the presence of a legendary
hero and a beast that might,

380
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,870
uh, be stocking, uh, through his,

381
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:46,210
his embodiment in his presence.

382
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,700
Yates saw history in symbolic
and mystical terms. Uh,

383
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,460
this is a poet who, with his
wife, practiced automatic writing,

384
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,510
who believed that the dead
spoke through the living this,

385
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,490
this a cult.
Yates is,

386
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,230
is a genuinely and wonderfully
strange thinker. Uh,

387
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,980
he elaborated a systematic,
a account of mind in history.

388
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,930
Uh, and as I said last time talking
about the song of Wandering Angus, uh,

389
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,550
and, and Yates is interest in
Alchemy, which was developed. Uh,

390
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,050
it isn't in fact necessary
for you to grasp.

391
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,990
Yates is system which
you'd have to go to his,

392
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,970
a book called a vision,
uh, to begin to do.

393
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,110
It doesn't necessary,
uh,

394
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:43,390
for you to grasp is a cultism in order to,
uh,

395
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,080
read his poetry. Uh, well, uh,

396
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,540
Yeats said that the,

397
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,570
the voices that he communicated with a
on the other side gave him a metaphors

398
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:57,610
for poetry. This is what they,
this is what they deliver him. Uh,

399
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,710
they also gave him, as he put it,
stylistic arrangements of experience.

400
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,450
Uh, this, the,

401
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,190
the cult gives

402
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,900
Yates aesthetic forms for understanding,
um,

403
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,110
individual psychology and
historical event. This is,

404
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:24,130
I think, uh, how we need
to understand, uh, the, uh,

405
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,780
the various, a cult
symbols, uh, in, in, uh,

406
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,720
another great, uh, poem, uh,

407
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,630
from this phase in his career.

408
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:39,280
A little bit further on the
second coming, uh, on page one 11.

409
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,873
Hmm.

410
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,230
Uh,
turning and turning in the widening gyre.

411
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,700
The Falcon cannot hear the falconer.
Things fall apart.

412
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,800
The center cannot hold.

413
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,280
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.

414
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,820
The blood dimmed tide
is loosed in everywhere.

415
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,940
The ceremony of innocence is drowned.

416
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,730
The best lack all conviction,

417
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,710
while the worst are full
of passionate intensity.

418
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,070
Surely some revelation is at hand.

419
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,650
Surely the second coming, is
it hand? The second coming?

420
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,650
Hardly are those words out.

421
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:44,651
When a vast image out of
Spiritus Mundi troubles my site,

422
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,650
somewhere in sands of the desert,

423
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,980
a shape with lion body
and the head of a man,

424
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,050
a gaze blank.

425
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,100
And Pinellas as the sun is moving,

426
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:01,610
it's slow thighs while all about it.

427
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:05,150
Real shadows of the
indignant desert birds,

428
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,660
the darkness drops again.

429
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,940
But now I know the 20
centuries of stony sleep,

430
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:19,510
we're vexed to nightmare by a
rocking cradle and what rough beast,

431
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,120
its hour come round at last slouches
towards Bethlehem to be born.

432
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,920
Another poem of birth.
Uh,

433
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,940
notice how very casual Yates is in that
second stair OFI how self consciously

434
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,180
fantastic and speculative he is.

435
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,420
He doesn't insist that the apocalypse
is at hand only that some revelation is,

436
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,550
uh, in fact, uh, this poem's power, uh,

437
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,990
lies I think in it's, uh,
not only its inability,

438
00:32:56,991 --> 00:33:01,100
but it's unwillingness to specify
the content of that revelation.

439
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Yates suggests that we think of this
historical moment as the second coming,

440
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:15,670
but this is not the return of Jesus that
Christianity prophesizes Yates sees the

441
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:22,760
second coming as an image, as
a myth and idea, a metaphor,

442
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:25,790
a certain stylistic
arrangement of experience.

443
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,100
It comes out of what he
calls spiritus. Mundi. Okay.

444
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,610
Semi technical term a Yates is name
for something like the collective

445
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,410
unconscious of all peoples. A kind
of repertoire of, of archetypes,

446
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,510
uh, from which the symbols that we
use to understand the world derive,

447
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,720
uh, it is, uh, um,
this, uh, this is, well,

448
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,710
this is really I think a,
um,

449
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,830
a radical if not heretical idea for the
national poet of a Christian people.

450
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,340
Uh,

451
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,990
Yates is saying that Christianity is
only one symbolic order among others.

452
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,750
It has a history.
Uh,

453
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,290
it is now passing away as
it once came into being.

454
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:18,130
And he's also saying that the birth of
Christ in Bethlehem was a nightmare for

455
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,114
the world.

456
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,320
It altered the world
that it changed utterly.

457
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,070
It change that Yates sees as the end
now of the Christian ear and not its

458
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,083
fulfillment.

459
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,850
There's isn't there to the disturbing
suggestion that Christ himself was a rough

460
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,950
beast.
Uh,

461
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yates developed this idea or develops
another version of it in a somewhat

462
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,870
earlier pump. Uh, that's interesting
in relation to this one. And let's,

463
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,950
let's turn back and look at
it. Uh, on page one of three,

464
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,760
uh, that the Madge I, um,

465
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,520
uh, again, visionary poem,
uh, where Yates is saying, ah,

466
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,950
I see,
I see in my mind's eye,

467
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:14,570
this is the action of the poem
takes place in Yates is imagination.

468
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,820
Now, as at all times, I can
see in the mind's eye in there,

469
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,450
stiff, painted, close, the Pale,

470
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,510
unsatisfied ones appear and disappear
in the blue depth of the sky with all

471
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:32,120
their ancient faces like rain,

472
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:37,121
beaten stones in all their Helms
of silver hovering side by side,

473
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,440
and all their eyes still fixed.

474
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,860
Hoping to find once more being by
calvary's turbulence unsatisfied.

475
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,300
The uncontrollable mystery
on the beast steel floor,

476
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,670
the Madge I hear are again, a, an image,

477
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,970
a kind of visionary symbol,
uh,

478
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,950
an image available in the
mind's eye at all times.

479
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,360
Uh,

480
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,360
they are unsatisfied by
calvaries turbulence,

481
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,710
Calvary's turbulence.
Uh,

482
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,450
remarkable phrase,
uh,

483
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,170
unsatisfied by the scene
of Christian martyrdom,

484
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,443
uh,

485
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,860
because they recognize
that history is cyclical,

486
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:32,791
uh,

487
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:37,791
and that the cycle that they saw coming
to being can only be completed by

488
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:41,210
another such birth,
uh,

489
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,760
not by Christ's death and resurrection.

490
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,970
Notice here how, um, uh, Yates images.

491
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,100
Okay.

492
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,640
What does that, the core
of Christ's birth? Uh,

493
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,950
it is an uncontrollable mystery

494
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,600
on the beast steel floor on the floor,

495
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,470
uh, on the bottom, uh, on the ground,

496
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,380
uh, where the animals dwell. Uh, okay.

497
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,910
The second coming, uh,
it seems is a, is, um,

498
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,990
as Yates imagines that I kind of similarly
unclear controllable mystery and the,

499
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,390
the, uh, the energy, uh, the,

500
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:35,210
the new presence that it
releases into the world, uh, is,

501
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,140
uh, is that of a beast. The, uh,

502
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,320
the divine enters the human
in these poems of Yates,

503
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,680
uh,
through the beast steel.

504
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,660
It's a powerful and disturbing idea.

505
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,990
Uh, there's a, uh,

506
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,900
another very powerful and disturbing poem,

507
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:12,140
uh, that literalize as this idea. Uh,

508
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,140
and that is later.
And the Swan on page one 18,

509
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,750
a, a, a poem that is a sonnet though.

510
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:24,240
It doesn't quite look like it at first.

511
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,450
Uh,
a mythological poem,

512
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,790
uh,
that

513
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,260
seeks to give a

514
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:44,210
mythological image two or for the kinds of

515
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,303
okay.

516
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:53,740
Epical and apocalyptic
historical change that,

517
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,920
uh, Yates is living through, uh,

518
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,070
in the 1920s in Ireland.

519
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,740
Uh, it's a, it's a, in
certain ways it's a,

520
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,690
it's a beautiful palm and a grotesque one.
Uh,

521
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,600
at the same time,
uh,

522
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,470
a sudden blow

523
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:21,830
the great wings beating still
above the staggering girl,

524
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,820
her thighs caressed by the dark
webs her nape caught in his bill.

525
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,560
He holds her helpless
breast upon his breast.

526
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,840
How can those terrified vague fingers
push the feathered glory from her

527
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,160
loosening thighs?

528
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:50,110
And how can body laid in that white
rush but feel the strange heart beating

529
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:55,580
where it lies
a shutter in the loins,

530
00:39:55,581 --> 00:39:57,980
in genders there,
the broken wall,

531
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,270
the burning roof and
tower and Agamemnon dead

532
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,690
being so caught up,

533
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,640
so mastered by the blood of the air.

534
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,950
Did she put on his
knowledge with his power

535
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,880
before the indifferent
beak could let her drop

536
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,493
history?

537
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,190
What makes history happen is imaged here
in the form of the rape of the human by

538
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:40,190
the divine
in the form

539
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,640
of a beast.
The form of a Swan,

540
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,360
the myth that Yates takes up is a of
Zeus is rape of, of the maiden later,

541
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,370
uh, whom he attacks, uh, as a swan. Uh,

542
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,990
the offspring that the rape
in gender, uh, includes Helen,

543
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,600
the terrible beauty for whom
the Trojan war was fought.

544
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,890
Uh, also quite Clytemnestra, uh,

545
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,160
the wife of the Greek Lord Agamemnon,

546
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,420
whom Clayton Nestra murders
on his return from Troy.

547
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:28,480
Uh, those future events, our,

548
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,970
our, uh, our, our glimpsed in the, in the,

549
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,230
the, uh, [inaudible] of this
poem and the final six lines, uh,

550
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:42,310
they are in a sense a compressed and
imaged and contained in the rape itself.

551
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,100
Uh, there's a, there's a kind
of radical foreshortening of,

552
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:57,150
of temporal experience at a what a Yates
images as the orgasmic union of the

553
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:04,700
divine and human. A
shutter in the lines, uh,

554
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:08,970
bringing about the sack of Troy,
uh,

555
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,550
the murder of the king. Uh, all
of that future contained in this,

556
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:18,710
uh, generative ambiguous violence, uh,

557
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:23,740
in the presence that the poem describe
the present that the poem describes,

558
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,840
uh, in effect in the, that
middle part of the poem, uh,

559
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,160
Yates collapses creation and destruction,

560
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,410
uh,

561
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,410
suggesting that the same beast steel
energy flows through both of these acts,

562
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:40,760
uh,
here,

563
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,020
a divine force reduces to brute power,

564
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:50,630
uh, in somewhat the same way
as it does in the match. I,

565
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:53,470
and the second coming,
uh,

566
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,280
one result of this is Yates is this is
interesting. His, his lack of interest,

567
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,610
uh, in the God, this
isn't a poem about Zeus.

568
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,280
It's not a poem about the Swan.
Uh, he doesn't name the Swan,

569
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,800
uh, just as he doesn't name the rough
beast, uh, in, in the second coming, uh,

570
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:17,090
what the swan thinks or feels or intense.
It doesn't matter.

571
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,330
Uh,
the swan is really only a force

572
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,390
and Yates is concerned, is rather with
the human experience of that force.

573
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,850
Uh,
which is again,

574
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:32,570
another manifestation of terrible beauty.

575
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,670
Uh,
Yates explores that experience,

576
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,733
uh,

577
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,330
which is an experience of
suffering here and a violation,

578
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:49,080
uh, through a series of
rhetorical questions, uh,

579
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,450
which are a crucial
poetic device for Yates.

580
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,560
Yates is a poet who asks
questions, questions, well,

581
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,580
they're different. Even rhetorical
questions are different, aren't they?

582
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,790
From statements of fact.
They're more like, uh,

583
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,940
propositions like speculations,
uh,

584
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,400
that were asked to test through
empathic identification with,

585
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,520
in this case, uh, the
poem subject Lita, uh,

586
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,260
uh, this, this is, this is what the
form of the question invites I think,

587
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,530
uh,
in eastern 1916,

588
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:39,531
I talked about Yates as partial
complicated identification
with the suffering

589
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,480
martyrs, uh, of that poem. Uh,

590
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,530
well that identification here is
reimagined and we're invited into it too.

591
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,220
Troublingly I think,
uh,

592
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,210
the frightening,
uh,

593
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:59,211
experience that Yates evokes here is the
imposition of the divine on the human,

594
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,550
uh, helpless breast on breast. Uh, it's a,

595
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,310
that's a wonderful phrase.

596
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:13,230
The repetition of breast links them,
uh,

597
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,710
makes us see them together side by side,

598
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:20,580
one on top of the other. It even, I think,

599
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:25,581
identifies the divine and the human makes
them hard to tell apart a binds them.

600
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,060
Uh, even while we are being
confronted with their difference, uh,

601
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,680
lead leader feels the
beating of the swans heart.

602
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,300
And that heart is strange to her.
That simple,

603
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,750
powerful word,
the poems.

604
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,130
A great final question, uh,
concerns that perception.

605
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,720
Did she put on his
knowledge with his power?

606
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,500
Did she know the heart she
felt or could she only feel it?

607
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,960
What difference would it make
between those two things,

608
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,240
between knowing that heart
and merely feeling it? Uh,

609
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:13,020
it's the difference between,
uh, knowing, uh, history,

610
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,350
understanding its patterns
and motivating forces, its

611
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,610
causes,
intentions,

612
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,140
and merely feeling it merely suffering it,
uh,

613
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,170
serving as its instrument or vessel in
object to be dropped when it's no longer

614
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:36,260
useful, uh, to know
history, to be able to,

615
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,280
to put on the God's knowledge with
his power would be to have access to

616
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:43,640
histories meaning,
uh,

617
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,400
and therefore it to be more
than merely subject to it,

618
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,890
subject to it's capricious
and, and, uh, violating, uh,

619
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,550
forces. Uh, Bill Gates doesn't
answer the question. Does he?

620
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,120
Uh, well, uh, why not?

621
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,640
Probably because there isn't an answer.
Uh,

622
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,700
the further implication is I think that,
um,

623
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,210
whether or not we can have
access to historical knowledge,

624
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,320
the only path to such knowledge is through
submission to it's the steel or brute

625
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:31,540
power, which is a kind of
shattering experience in this poem.

626
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,980
Uh, well on, on Monday, we'll,

627
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:40,510
we'll look at some of the
figures in Yates is late poems,

628
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,700
uh, who represent a kind of
knowledge to be had through, uh,

629
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,650
an experience of well violation,
uh,

630
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,010
or of shattering power,
uh,

631
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,990
characters such as the mad
old men, uh, or, uh, uh,

632
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,900
crazy. Jane, uh, in the
eights is late poems.
