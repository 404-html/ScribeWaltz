1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,420
Pound, uh, how many of you
have ever read pound before?

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,250
So yeah.
Uh,

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,510
w unlike frost,
you,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,430
you are unlikely to have read
much, uh, uh, pound. I think, uh,

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,900
up to this point in your educations, uh,

6
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:29,590
and probably you are,
you are an, uh, uh, uh,

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,670
unlikely to have much of a view of
him in contrast to foster even Yates,

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,660
uh, who, uh, uh,

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,360
cuts such a particular and,

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,940
and a remarkable public
figure. A pound, uh,

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,110
can be hard to put together.
A, he can be hard to, um,

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,040
get a, get a picture of
what is pound like. Um,

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,600
what was he like? Uh, well,
uh, this is a, uh, uh,

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:04,601
a hard question for some of the
same reason that the poems are hard.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,350
Uh, that is, uh, pounds, poetry projects,

16
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:14,820
no determinant identity,
uh,

17
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:19,710
no determinant poetic voice.
Unlike those,

18
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:24,340
those distinctive voices of Yeats
and pound. All right. Excuse me.

19
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:28,620
He hates and frost.
Instead a impound,

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,010
you encounter a
multiplicity of identities,

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,920
a multiplicity of voices,
right?

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,620
There's an interesting
contradiction in this.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,420
Pound is a kind of fierce individualists.
Uh,

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,430
he believes in, he wants to honor
as a political thinker and as a,

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,470
uh, as a poet, a as a
reader. He wants to honor

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,890
heroic and sovereign idea
of the individual. Uh,

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,060
at the same time
in his writing,

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,660
pound repeatedly divest
himself of identity,

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,150
of particular identity,
uh,

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,390
in order to enter or to be
entered by other identities,

31
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,640
other poets, other voices,
uh, creators, a heroes.

32
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,510
This is what he wants to
give us access to as readers.

33
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,270
Pounds, uh, Sim,

34
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:35,271
Travelocity and modern poetry repeats
the kind of paradox I'm describing a that

35
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,330
is, he is the one poet on the syllabus
whom all the other poets, new,

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,700
uh, had some kind of relationship
with some kind of contact.

37
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,670
Um,
on the one hand,

38
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,970
a pound was an individual of extraordinary
personal charisma and force someone

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,990
who liked to and who had power
to tell other people what to do,

40
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,160
tell other people what to
think and what to value.

41
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,900
On the other hand, uh,
when you, uh, study pound,

42
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,220
you're studying someone a
remarkably open to others. Uh, uh,

43
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,940
in friendship, uh, as
a reader, a as a, uh,

44
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,823
thinker.

45
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,150
He's someone who openly
seeks alliance with others.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,750
Uh, he has, uh,

47
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:32,770
we've already talked in our first lecture,
uh,

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,670
had an important relationship to
frost. Uh, you remember for us,

49
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,550
speaking of his sometime friend pound,

50
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:43,600
who wants to write as he puts it,
caviar to the crowd.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,070
Um, well, uh, pound is, is credited. Uh,

52
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:53,400
as I also suggested with in
many ways modernizing Yates, uh,

53
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,330
helping Yates become, um,
the, uh, uh, particular, um,

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,990
uh,

55
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,990
voice that he did a in the teens
and twenties in [inaudible].

56
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,490
There's a little letter,
uh, a handwritten pencil,

57
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,310
a letter from pounds to Hart Crane,

58
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:16,360
which Hart Crane received when he was 18,
I think around your age.

59
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:20,260
After he had sent his poems to
the little review. And this is,

60
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:25,150
this is a letter from
pound, which says about, um,

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,690
Crane's poems.
It is all very egg.

62
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,150
There is perhaps better egg,

63
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,320
but you haven't the ghost of a
setting hen or an incubator about you.

64
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,430
I'm not sure what that
means. Uh, uh, but, uh,

65
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,700
this was a rejection slip. Uh, and
crane kept it all his life, uh,

66
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,840
like a kind of diploma, uh, that,
uh, you know, in some way. Uh,

67
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,841
he was a member of modern poetry because
he had gotten a rejection from Ezra

68
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,550
pound. Um, in fact, cranes first
book, if you go over to buying a key,

69
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,470
um, uh, and you, you turn
it over, it has, uh, a, um,

70
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,230
a picture. Uh, it has a
portrait, a not of Hart Crane,

71
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,340
but of Ezra pound, uh, because it has a,

72
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:21,100
an ad for pound and his
book persona. Um, and,

73
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:25,480
and I, I like this fact because it's
representative I think of, uh, of,

74
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:30,400
of pounds, importance and
dominance and prominence, uh, in,

75
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,290
uh, the poetic, uh,

76
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,120
culture of the 1920s and thirties.

77
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,160
He was part of the world that
a younger poet like Hart Crane,

78
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,840
uh, had to, uh, uh, get to
know and make his place in.

79
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,540
Um, uh, one of the famous
books about modern poetry,

80
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:52,990
uh,

81
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,920
one by Hugh Kenner is called simply the
pound era as if modern poetry was all

82
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:02,510
about ends or pound. Um, as we're pound,

83
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,290
uh, born in Hailey, Idaho, uh,

84
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,940
in 1908, uh, I like it that this, uh,

85
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,940
uh, wildly a cosmopolitan, uh,

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,880
ex Patriot intelligence
was born in Idaho. Uh, he,

87
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,230
uh, left the United States. Um, um, oh,

88
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:27,050
he wasn't born in 1908.
When was Pam born?

89
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,390
He left the United States
in 1908 look in your,

90
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:36,440
your 18. Yeah, 1885. Thank you. Um,

91
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,590
uh, he, uh, uh, he left, um,

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,160
the u s in 1908, uh, and
lived mostly in London, uh,

93
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,720
where, um, at that point, um,

94
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,860
where he acted as the foreign
editor of a poetry magazine.

95
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,370
Uh, and the little review too little
magazines that I've shown you,

96
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,200
a pictures, uh, of, uh,
and that, uh, were, um,

97
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,710
important in bringing modern
poetry to the United States.

98
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,890
A pound is the central figure.
In that process.

99
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:13,100
He goes out and finds and
interprets and explains,

100
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:17,280
and even in the case of images
of names, the poetry that, uh,

101
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,710
he is, uh, uh, bringing,
um, to American readers.

102
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,840
He is the, uh, the
entrepreneur, if you like,

103
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,450
behind images. Um, and then, uh,

104
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:34,451
when Amy Lowell takes over images
and vorticism becomes his thing,

105
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,460
uh, and, uh, uh, the magazine
blast becomes for a while.

106
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,860
Uh, his Oregon, uh, he,

107
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,700
he writes a manifestos,
uh,

108
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,890
he organizes groups all the time,
uh,

109
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:52,100
abandoning them to his poem.

110
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,750
Hugh Selwyn Moberly,
uh,

111
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,400
composed in 1920 looks back on this whole,
uh,

112
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,330
period in London, um, and, um, uh, is a,

113
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:09,940
is a kind of, um, um,
uh, well summary, uh,

114
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,840
of, um, the poetry of this period,
uh, and his involvement in it.

115
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,250
Uh, and, uh, it is itself a kind of, um,

116
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,850
early model for another great
poem, the wasteland, uh,

117
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,040
which, um, Elliot would, uh,

118
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,190
as he composed it bring two pound to,
uh,

119
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,890
edit and we'll talk about
that process in a bit.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,620
In 1924, a pound moved to Italy. Um,

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,490
there, um, he, uh, became, uh,

122
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,700
urgently concerned with economic reform
in the United States and in the West.

123
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,910
Uh, generally, uh, he, uh, uh,

124
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,560
is in this period, uh,
working on his great poem, uh,

125
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,670
his long poem, which I'll be
discussing today, the Qantas,

126
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,340
uh, he became, uh,

127
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:09,780
increasingly involved in Italian fascism,
uh,

128
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,500
which he, uh, found a, um, um,

129
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,750
powerful,
uh,

130
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,520
vehicle of his own economic
ideas. Uh, in particular,

131
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,440
uh, he made broadcasts in support of, um,

132
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,970
Mussolini's government, uh,
on fascist, uh, radio, uh,

133
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,170
in the 1940s.

134
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,760
And in 1945 at the conclusion of
the war was arrested for treason,

135
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,150
uh, by the United States army. Um,

136
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,220
the charge of treason was,
was dropped, uh, when, uh,

137
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
he was, uh, uh, found to be

138
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,810
insane and, um, hospitalized, uh, at, uh,

139
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,650
Saint Elizabeth's hospital
in Washington DC, where,

140
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,360
uh, he would in a very
peculiar way hold court,

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,220
uh, a great man of letters,
uh, at the, uh, center, uh,

142
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:12,630
of, um, uh, well, um,
the American capital,

143
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,790
uh, entertaining, uh, Elizabeth
Bishop, uh, and other, uh,

144
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,690
figures whom we will read, um, at this,

145
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,690
at the time of, um, uh,

146
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,680
pounds institutionalization.
Uh,

147
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,940
his poem,

148
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,941
the piece and Cantos a late stage of
the cantos a was selected as the first

149
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:39,280
winner of the Bollington
prize. Uh, and, uh,

150
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,550
award initially given by
the Library of Congress, uh,

151
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,490
when pound, um, trader to the nation, uh,

152
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
was awarded this prize for
the best American poetry.

153
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,260
Uh, an enormous, uh, literary
and cultural controversy, uh,

154
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,990
sprang up. Um, uh,

155
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,670
which people go on arguing
about. Um, well, uh,

156
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,460
here is, um, uh, a, a, a poet, uh,

157
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,130
who by his own declaration and example,
uh,

158
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:18,870
seems to be, uh, a fascist
sympathizer and anti-semite.

159
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,130
Could he write great poetry,
uh,

160
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:28,131
even great poetry that expressed
fascistic and antisemitic,

161
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,860
uh, views, uh,

162
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,730
if he could write that
great poetry of that kind,

163
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,760
should we honor it?
Um,

164
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,750
if he was mad,

165
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,610
is there some way in which his
poetry might not be mad? Well,

166
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:52,560
these are our questions that, that, uh,
have, uh, uh, persisted. And as I say,

167
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:56,670
people go on arguing
about them. Um, the, um,

168
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:02,140
um, uh, controversy, uh,
created so much trouble.

169
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,650
The library of Congress didn't want
any thing to do with the award anymore.

170
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:08,930
And it moved to Yale.
Uh, and, uh, the, uh,

171
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,350
Beinecke library has
been administrating this,

172
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:16,351
the arguably the most prestigious
of a poetry prizes ever since.

173
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,380
Uh, and in fact, um, the judging
for this year's award is, uh,

174
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,843
going,
uh,

175
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,170
strong at the moment and there will be
a new winner at the end of the week.

176
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,170
Well,
uh,

177
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,540
pounds anti-capitalism his,
uh,

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,310
uh,
uh,

179
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,330
his economic ideas I think are a,

180
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,380
in some ways the intellectual origin
of both his interest in fascism,

181
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,500
uh, and the antisemitic views that, uh,

182
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:58,000
he expresses both in
poetry and often in prose,

183
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,220
uh,
anti-capitalism for pound.

184
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,750
Uh,

185
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,750
this derives from a really a
specific cultural setting that is,

186
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,320
um, late 19th century
American culture. Uh, uh,

187
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,210
a culture where as pound
experienced it and, and, and,

188
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:22,060
and sought a art was conceived
as a decorative art, uh,

189
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:27,061
subject to the editorial tastes of
popular magazines like the Atlantic

190
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,330
or Harper's. Um, uh,

191
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,280
a culture in which poetry was
a kind of commodity, uh, uh,

192
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,210
which status destroyed, uh, the, uh, uh,

193
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,240
potential for originality and
which subordinated art to,

194
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,940
uh, to money when, when
pound expatriates, when he,

195
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,530
when he leaves the United States,
uh, he's fleeing not only America,

196
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,980
but he's as he understands that he's,
he's fleeing American money.

197
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,770
Uh,
and what he is entering a,

198
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,790
what he's going to,
um,

199
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,160
he conceives as a particular
kind of tradition,

200
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,540
a kind of historical community,
uh,

201
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,540
which he describes a in that
first a quotation on your handout,

202
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,310
uh, a, uh, a quotation that, um,

203
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,730
in which pound replies in a,
in a,

204
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,780
a wonderfully hottie way to
the motto of Poetry magazine,

205
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,570
a motto that comes from the
Great American poet Whitman,

206
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,850
uh, to have great poetry. There
must be great audiences to

207
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,830
two,
which pounds says,

208
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,710
it is true that the great artist
always has a great audience.

209
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,360
Even in his lifetime,

210
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,850
but it is not the Volvo that's us.
Uh,

211
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,780
but rather the spirits of
irony and if destiny of humor,

212
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,790
the great authors of the past
sitting beside him a pound,

213
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,340
I think in, in a, in a very, uh,

214
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,320
almost a literal sense conceived
of his audience as, uh,

215
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,420
uh, a, uh,

216
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:28,421
kind of distinguished community of
readers and writers existing across time.

217
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,810
I kind of trans historical
community of artists,

218
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,610
um, ideas that we'll want to compare
with Elliot's ideas of tradition,

219
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,250
which are related but a little
different. Uh, next week. Well,

220
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,920
um, let me move to, uh,

221
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,480
the second quotation also
from the same period.

222
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,620
1914 pounds has,

223
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,740
there's no use in a strong
impulse in poetry, strong impulse.

224
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:08,180
I think he means a strong
feeling, strong motive, uh,

225
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,240
emotion if it is nearly all lost in
bungling transmission and technique.

226
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,010
This obnoxious word that I'm always
brandishing about technique means nothing

227
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:26,330
but a transmission of the impulse intact.

228
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,950
Impound.
There's an emphasis,

229
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,250
as we saw last time in looking
at his rules for writing images,

230
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:37,544
poetry.

231
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,380
There's an emphasis on the
priority of poetic technique, uh,

232
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:46,910
and the importance of technical
knowledge. Uh, but, uh,

233
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:51,140
as this quotation suggest, and it's
important to keep in mind technique.

234
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Impound is always in the
service of intensity,

235
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,520
immediacy or what he calls the impulse

236
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,920
there. Further quotations from pound, uh,

237
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,810
describing his technical aims. Uh,

238
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:19,930
as I suggested a few minutes ago,

239
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,890
pound moves on from images and
to what he calls vorticism.

240
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,680
Uh, now, uh, instead of, uh, um,

241
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,700
wanting to get at a poetry
that is centered on the image,

242
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:39,470
he imagines a poetry centered on
now the vortex as he calls it.

243
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:42,830
And there's a, there's a kind of
definition of the vortex there.

244
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:45,230
In the third quotation,
uh,

245
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,260
not so much later he would replace
idea of the vortex with another related

246
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,340
image, uh, which is the video. Graham, uh,

247
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,280
we talked about some of pounds,

248
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,210
translations from the Chinese
and Japanese last time.

249
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,610
Pound was interested in,
um, uh, Chinese writing, uh,

250
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,700
systems, uh, as well.

251
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:15,701
You can imagine how the ideogram appealed
to a poet who wanted to imagine a poem

252
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,450
as, um, an image of a thing, uh, here, uh,

253
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:25,290
as pound understood it. Uh,
not always, uh, with, uh,

254
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,570
a superb scholarly, uh, uh, precision. Uh,

255
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,950
the Chinese, uh, uh, word, uh,

256
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:38,070
was in fact an image of
a thing. And, and this,

257
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:42,660
this is very much a kind of
aesthetic ideal for pound who wanted,

258
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,710
um,

259
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,710
language to give us a kind of immediate
access to the things of the world.

260
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,730
Well,
um,

261
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,753
yeah,

262
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,430
I asked you to read for
class today. One of, uh,

263
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,090
pounds poems from the teens,
one of his famous poems. Uh,

264
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,963
a poem.

265
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,533
Okay.

266
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,530
Uh, called the seafarer, um,
identified in your Ras packet,

267
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,160
uh, as from the angle of sacks.
And I'll, I'll read just the,

268
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,050
the beginning of it for you.

269
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,170
Okay.

270
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,060
May I, for my own self songs,
truth, reckon, journeys,

271
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:28,270
jargon, how I, in harsh days,

272
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:32,470
hardship endured oft bitter breast cares.

273
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,650
Have I abided,
known on my Keel.

274
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:38,260
Many a cares hold and dire,

275
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:43,261
see surge and their eye off spent narrow
nightwatch nigh the ship's head while

276
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:49,660
she tossed close to cliffs.
Coldly afflicted.

277
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,440
My feet were by frost.
Benumbed chill.

278
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:56,920
It's chains are chafing. Size. Whew.

279
00:19:56,921 --> 00:20:01,921
My heart round and hunger be
got mirror weary mood last man,

280
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:06,760
no, not that he on dry
land. Loveliest liveth list.

281
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:09,460
How I care Richard on ice cold.

282
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:14,461
See whether the winter wretched
outcast deprived my kinsmen and so on.

283
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,500
Uh, I ambig pentameter. Uh,

284
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:26,180
you've been working on
it. Uh, no. Uh, it's not,

285
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,970
uh, what you're listening to is
something very different. Uh,

286
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,930
the sound is rough like frost.

287
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,420
Okay.

288
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,060
And to like frost,
uh,

289
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:46,061
in this poetry pound is writing against
the beautiful sonorous forms of late

290
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:53,140
19th century poetry. Uh, but pound's poem,

291
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,220
unlike Frost,

292
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,520
is the very furthest from the
vernacular that we could possibly get.

293
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,000
Uh,

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
what we have here is pound translating
from the Anglo Saxon and providing a

295
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:11,401
contemporary equivalent of a
old English alliterative verse.

296
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,460
A particular, uh, verse form, a
dead poetic form. You could say,

297
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,120
uh, uh, although pound revives it
and, and in fact brings it into,

298
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,470
um, a usage, uh, in,
in 20th century poetry.

299
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,430
Uh, this, uh, verse form, I've
given you John Hollander, um,

300
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,730
um,
helpful self descriptive definition,

301
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,241
uh,

302
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:45,241
at the bottom of your handout where
Hollander says the oldest English accented

303
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:50,020
meter of for unfailing,
fairly audible,

304
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,000
strongly struck stresses,

305
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,710
seldom attended to anything other than
definite downbeats. In other words,

306
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,840
in, uh, uh, old English verse,
you don't count syllables,

307
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:06,400
you just count strong stresses.
And,

308
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,460
uh,
there are as a rule for per line,

309
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,010
and the line's like Hollander's here,

310
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,990
like pounds that I just read
tend to divide a in the middle,

311
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,680
uh, there's a Sisera
that breaks the, uh, uh,

312
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,420
the line into a and, and Hollander
goes on, uh, describing it.

313
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,560
Um, in addition to these
strong stresses, the um,

314
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,640
uh, line is held together
by alliterative links, uh,

315
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:40,570
that join, um, the words, um, you know,

316
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:45,130
strongly and audibly, uh, in
the, uh, across the six zero

317
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,880
lb is an avant garde poet.
He's an experimentalist, uh,

318
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,960
here we have the strange and very
interesting spectacle of the self.

319
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,770
Consciously modernist,

320
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,940
avant garde artist writing in in archaic,

321
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,360
Dead Poetic Form,
uh,

322
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,890
in the teens.
Uh,

323
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,920
pound is writing a kind of experimental
poetry that in many different ways,

324
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,000
um,
seeks alternatives to 19th century.

325
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:26,800
Norms of poetic practice seeks
alternatives to romantic sentiment,

326
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,200
uh, poetic diction, a smooth musicality,

327
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,390
uh, all, all of the, the, the
virtues and vices that you find in,

328
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,600
in early Yates.
Uh,

329
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,340
what he does is open poetry to a range
of styles and many of them are a Keck.

330
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,790
Uh, many of them, uh, from
languages outside of English.

331
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,080
Uh, you see pound writing,
his version of the province,

332
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:01,970
Sal troubadour song can a,
uh,

333
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,780
we talked last time about,
um,

334
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,550
pounds version of Chinese
or Japanese poems. Uh,

335
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,530
he writes his own versions of
Roman poetry or here, old English,

336
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,550
uh, through technical means, uh,

337
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,900
through pounds technique.

338
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,330
He gains access to cultures and voices.

339
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,850
Uh, he revives past voices
like the seafair poets,

340
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,440
uh, revives and implicitly
identifies with them.

341
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,390
Here is an ex patriot
poet writing about, um, a,

342
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,224
uh,
uh,

343
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:50,260
writing in the voice of
the Anglo Saxon wanderer,

344
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,500
a figure deprived of his kinsmen,
uh,

345
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,570
who is out in the elements,
um, uh, far from land, uh,

346
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,140
far from, uh, his nation and home,

347
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,590
uh,
writing in the voice of the seafair pound,

348
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,390
um,
ally's himself with what is historically,

349
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,080
um, prior. Uh, and in fact, in English,

350
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:22,080
he aligns himself with what
is historically primary, uh,

351
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,610
with the oldest English, uh, poetry. Uh,

352
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,940
here he claims it for himself,
uh,

353
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,430
carries it a forward
or as he would put it,

354
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,830
transmits the impulse,
uh,

355
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,480
in an act of translation,
uh,

356
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,890
pounds slogan, make it new, uh,

357
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,570
kind of motto for modernism.
Uh, it's important to, uh,

358
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,400
uh, to hear that injunction
to make it new, uh, as, uh,

359
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:57,401
specifically historical mission
to revive and transmit a,

360
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,180
the past in a living way.
Uh,

361
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:07,160
the phrase itself make it new
was translated from, uh, the,

362
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:11,090
uh, the ancient Chinese, uh, and, uh, uh,

363
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,940
is itself a in that sense.
Um,

364
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,290
an instance of what it describes a pounds

365
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,080
conception of the poet is as one who
brings the impulse as he calls it,

366
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,010
a forward across time. Um, uh,

367
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,130
does so in a kind of imaginative
act of seafaring if you like,

368
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:41,320
uh, leaving home, going
out, crossing over, uh,

369
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,160
pound is, um, a distinctive, uh,

370
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,380
and in a sense,
quite peculiar thing.

371
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,140
He a kind of visionary scholar.

372
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,790
He is an epic poet of the library.

373
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,900
There's a certain kind of contradiction
in this that is a contradiction or

374
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,950
tension. At any rate, um,

375
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,170
between pounds drive towards immediacy,
uh,

376
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,740
towards, uh, um,

377
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:21,060
well his wish to convey,
uh,

378
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,920
an emotional impulse and
the highly mediated nature,

379
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,290
uh, of his vision, um, pound,

380
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,160
uh, pounds. Poetry is
full of, uh, learned, uh,

381
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:39,840
and abstruse reference.
Unlike the Norton Anthology,

382
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:43,110
if you pick up a volume of pound,
you'll find no footnotes.

383
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,970
He just gives you the thing. Uh,
he gives, you know, help with it.

384
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Um, because I think there is, um,

385
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,610
an intention in the poetry to somehow
give you a kind of unmediated access to

386
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,490
the materials that pound is,
is drawing on.

387
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,850
He wants us to feel the excitement he
feels when he sits down in the library and

388
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:12,480
opens a book. Um, directness,

389
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,500
intensity, purity, immediacy, uh,

390
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,330
these are all pounds ames.

391
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Any achieves them through an intensely
mediated display of technique.

392
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,130
Um, well, uh,

393
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,980
you might contrast again,
frost.

394
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,360
Frost is always concealing
as it were. His, um, uh,

395
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:43,560
his expertise, uh, his, uh,
his technical knowledge,

396
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,770
whereas a pound is always showing it.

397
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,370
In the case of the seafarer
pound has used a suites,

398
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,700
Anglo Saxon reader, his college
textbook, uh, to write this poem.

399
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,330
It's one he's taken to
Europe with him. Now, uh,

400
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,040
there are several consequences
for all of this. Uh, one impound.

401
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,610
There is the idea that

402
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,550
there are no dead forms.
There are no dead languages.

403
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,370
There are only derivations variations,
translations,

404
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,320
uh, through which the past is
continuously being made. Present,

405
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,103
uh,

406
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,550
to that is the past is
continuously available for
those who can recognize it and

407
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:41,450
sees it. Uh, specifically
through technical, uh,

408
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,080
powers,
uh,

409
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,970
technical power switch yet in the
process must be transcended in order to

410
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:53,230
achieve the kind of immediacy,
uh, empower that he seeks.

411
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,960
Um,
in effect,

412
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,260
pound makes technique
a form of inspiration.

413
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,110
This is, this is an interesting
turn in literary history. Uh,

414
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,700
the visionary poet
impound is a scholar poet.

415
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,660
A literary technique is in pound a
secular means of evoking literary

416
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,320
inspiration,
uh,

417
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,390
literary inspiration in the
form of prior literature, uh,

418
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,030
prior literature seen and felt as sacred,
uh,

419
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,640
uh, as sacred, not as in
Milton, a divine authority,

420
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:38,080
but rather an authority, um, uh,

421
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,770
to be recognized in felt
and seized in books.

422
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,990
The footnote,
the scholarly index,

423
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,240
the Library Archive.
Uh,

424
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,320
these are the muses that pound
appeals to the used bookstore.

425
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,060
Uh, these are the places
that his poems come from. Uh,

426
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,220
the result is a body of work,
uh,

427
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,490
that is always a returning us.

428
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,970
It's readers to it's sources.

429
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,310
Um,

430
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,730
in the very first lecture I referred to,
uh,

431
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,200
what I see as two very general,
uh,

432
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,460
in different,
uh,

433
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,720
competing drives or forces in,

434
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,590
in modern poetry. Uh, one, uh,

435
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,170
centripetal, uh, the
other centrifical, uh,

436
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,770
one, uh, kind of, uh,

437
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,620
will on the part of modern
poets to order poetry itself.

438
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,750
Uh,
on the other hand,

439
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,110
a will to order the world,
uh,

440
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,610
order society,
uh,

441
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:01,000
the artist must be concerned
with arts own problems.

442
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,890
On the one hand, uh,
on the other hand, uh,

443
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,220
in lb and in others,
uh,

444
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:13,060
the artist is a kind of well
legislator to use Shelly's image.

445
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,860
Uh, he, uh,

446
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:19,861
has a truth that he wants to promulgate
a that will order society properly.

447
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,240
Um, pound embodies these, these,

448
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,780
that too drives as I'm calling them,
uh,

449
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,440
more clearly better than anybody. Uh,
and they're, they're part of his, uh,

450
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,710
interest, uh, and, and power. Uh, and,

451
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:43,880
and some of the challenge that
he, uh, gives us, uh, both, uh,

452
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,920
uh, aesthetic, uh, challenges
and, and moral and, and, and, uh,

453
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,150
political ones as, as we
think about his career. Uh,

454
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,810
on the one hand, uh, in
impound, uh, there's,

455
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:01,811
there's a kind of drive to identify that
which is most essential to literature,

456
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,890
uh,
and to tell pound pounds,

457
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:10,220
readers how to write poems.
This is, this is the,

458
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:14,570
the pound who wrote those remarks about
images and that we talked about last

459
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:18,860
time. On the other hand, uh, there is, uh,

460
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:23,300
the pound who wants to extend the
reach of literature, who wants to,

461
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,140
who writes letters to
statesmen, uh, who, uh, uh,

462
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,760
goes on fascist radio, uh,
to, uh, tell the world,

463
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,680
uh, how things should be
a, this is also the poet,

464
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,740
uh,
who in his poem,

465
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:44,180
the Cantos wish to create a
poem that would, as he calls it,

466
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,380
include history. That
what an ambition, right?

467
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,580
Extraordinary. Um, uh,

468
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,800
so on the one hand you have have the, the
poet of, uh, in a station of the metro,

469
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,430
the shortest poem, uh,
in, in modern poetry.

470
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,190
And then you have the poet of the
Qantas, the longest poem, uh, in, uh,

471
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,610
modern poetry. Uh, uh, pound
is both of these things,

472
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,650
uh, and, uh,

473
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:18,790
these impulses that we see in that poem
and in that Short pump and in that long

474
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:22,130
pump,
they don't just compete in him.

475
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,760
They exist, I think, uh,

476
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:29,380
in some kind of collaboration.
Um,

477
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,290
the,
in a station of the metro

478
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:40,150
identifies the image as the primary
unit of a poetry and impounds practice.

479
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:47,390
It becomes a kind of building block
for larger forms. Uh, and, uh,

480
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:52,330
for, uh, the epic itself. Uh, he says, uh,

481
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,060
here, um, and your handout
a in a letter to Joyce,

482
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,263
um,

483
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,320
I have begun an endless
poem of no known category,

484
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,230
true, uh, Fan Upia or something or other,

485
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,450
all about everything true.
I wonder what you,

486
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,330
Joyce will make of it. Uh, well,

487
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:21,020
fan of Pia means
specifically image making a,

488
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:25,970
and you could understand the Qantas
as they unfold as a kind of, uh,

489
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,290
um, series of images, poems, um,

490
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,090
uh, eh, as the image becomes this,

491
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,950
uh, fertile, um, principal, uh,

492
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,780
that produces and generates
more and more images,

493
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,930
more and more voices.
Uh,

494
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,190
the cantos had, um, well

495
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,860
he says, have no known
category. Uh, it's, it's true.

496
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,370
Uh, it's hard to identify
the genre of the Cantos,

497
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,140
although I've been calling
it an epic so far. Uh,

498
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:10,190
there's a sense in which in each canto
pound is inventing the form of the poem,

499
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,510
a new, um, uh, inventing it, uh,

500
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:19,650
in response to the
demands of new materials.

501
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,890
The way to understand this great and,

502
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,880
and maddening and somewhat mad poem,
uh,

503
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:30,330
which is one of the great
works of modern poetry, uh,

504
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:35,220
in which we're reading just the smallest
fragment. One way to understand it,

505
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,210
uh,
is as the record of one man's reading,

506
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,520
uh,

507
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,520
one man's a encounter with many voices
and his incorporation of them and

508
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,930
engagement and conversation with them.
Uh,

509
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:56,910
the title of the poem is worth perhaps
dwelling on for a moment. The cantos,

510
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,180
uh, the songs really is what it means. Uh,

511
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,420
the title foregrounds
literary activity itself, uh,

512
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,530
foregrounds acts of
singing, uh, which are, uh,

513
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:15,390
here as pound imagines it a kind
of renewable, uh, practice, uh,

514
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:19,950
or process, uh, that can't be reduced
to a particular image or symbol.

515
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:24,690
So in that sense, this poem is
unlike the wasteland or the bridge,

516
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,170
uh, which, you know, PR produce these, um,

517
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,970
specific central symbols around
which, uh, all of the poems,

518
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:37,790
ideas and images are organized.
Pound, uh, instead gives us, uh,

519
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,660
something more like a
process, a pound, uh,

520
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:47,520
as I say, uh, spoke of it as a
poem, including history. Uh, well,

521
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,060
um, uh, this makes it sound as if the
poem where, you know, larger than history,

522
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:56,220
somehow a kind of frame for history that
would help us understand in order it,

523
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,450
uh, well maybe pound wish this, but
that's not what he produced. Uh,

524
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,620
the poem lacks in organizing view of
history such as you find in Milton or

525
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:10,890
Virgil, uh, or homer or Dante. Uh,

526
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,750
it would be therefore it much more
accurate to call it a poem that is in some

527
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:19,710
sense continuous with history.
That's like history. Uh,

528
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,780
uh, in that sense, uh, a poem
that is structurally unbounded,

529
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,700
uh, uh, uh, this, this is I
think the view of history.

530
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:34,701
It projects history not
as a story of progress,

531
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,830
uh, or, uh, Yates and
apocalypse and cycles. Uh,

532
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,140
but history rather as something like the
palm itself, something that accumulates,

533
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,831
uh,

534
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:49,831
and repeats itself with variations
in without a definite aim and view.

535
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,730
Um, history in this sense is
something that can be entered,

536
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,940
uh, but not begun. Uh,

537
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,100
and it can't ever be completed either.
Uh,

538
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,660
and this is true of this poem.

539
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,050
And then went down to the ship,

540
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,250
set Keel to breakers
fourth on the Godly C,

541
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,380
and we set up mass and sail on
that Swerte ship. Borsch sheep,

542
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:22,381
a board her and our bodies also heavy
with weeping and wins from stern word

543
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:29,410
Boris onward with bellying canvas.
Searcy's this craft,

544
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,680
the trimmed quaffed goddess then sat
we amid ships when jamming the tiller.

545
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,000
Thus with stretch sale,
we went over,

546
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:43,001
see till days and son to his slumber
shadows or all the ocean came.

547
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:50,341
We then to the bounds of deepest water
to the chameleon lands and people,

548
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,240
cities covered with close web,

549
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:55,900
midst and pierced ever
with glitter of sunrays,

550
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,130
nor with stars stretched nor
looking back from heaven.

551
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,700
Swore this night's stretched
over wretched men there.

552
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,070
The ocean flowing backward came we
then to the place aforesaid by Searcy.

553
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,320
When I was a student, I, I said
to, um, uh, my teacher, uh,

554
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,060
I don't really get pound. It's, and
it's not very beautiful, uh, either. Uh,

555
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:28,600
and he said, well, take
a look at this. Uh, and,

556
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:33,400
and produced those lines I just
read, which are magnificent, heroic,

557
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,620
uh, poetry. Um,

558
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,850
they begin with that word and they begin
with the conjunction and they begin

559
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:47,620
with a conjunction and
without a grammatical subject,

560
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,480
and then went down to the ship,
who went down to the ship.

561
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,010
Pound doesn't say,
uh,

562
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,700
he introduces the poem with
an action, an action, uh,

563
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,960
that is itself part of a series.

564
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,960
The action that we are being introduced
to here is Odysseus is journey to hell.

565
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,550
Uh, in search of Tyree,
uh, the profit, uh,

566
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:22,510
among the souls of the dead.
He wants to learn.

567
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,670
A deceased wants to learn his,
uh,

568
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,530
future course and decide how to act a dcs.

569
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,230
We learn as the poem unfolds.

570
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,600
A is first speaker,
uh,

571
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,430
pound accesses and, and,
and, uh, gives to us.

572
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,163
Um,

573
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,460
which is to say that we're
reading a translation again.

574
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,500
Uh,

575
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,500
and how does a speak not
like Tennyson's Ulysses,

576
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,500
uh,
in sonorous blank verse,

577
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,600
but rather as I think you could
hear, uh, readily enough, uh,

578
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,630
in the Anglo Saxon alliterative verse
form of the seafarer pounds doing

579
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:12,530
something very interesting,
uh, an exhilarating,

580
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,560
he is translating what he
conceives of as the, uh,

581
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,950
oldest passage in the Odyssey,
uh,

582
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,540
that most archaic,
uh,

583
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:28,340
of poetry in the West and translating it,

584
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:33,770
uh, using, um, that poetry most, uh,

585
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,780
archaic in English, uh, the,
uh, language and rhythms, uh,

586
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,840
and patterning of the seafarer.
This is a kind of, you know,

587
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,060
overlay in technique, uh, again, uh,

588
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,330
of old English, a litter to verse, uh,

589
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,270
and Homer's Greek.
Um,

590
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:57,500
these linguistic forms
in the poem are merged

591
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:03,680
as if by a kind of pair of taxes,
which I talked about last time,

592
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,180
uh, to produce what pound calls, uh,

593
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,830
when he's writing about
the image as a complex, uh,

594
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,630
uh, a complex of elements that
are held together in an instant,

595
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,673
uh,

596
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,770
an instant that as he understood it
transcends space and time limits.

597
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,820
Uh, this is all set out again
in the doctrine of the image.

598
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:33,470
Uh, and, and we, we talked
about another instance of that,

599
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,560
a kind of cultural overlay,

600
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,040
a of materials in,
uh,

601
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,480
the little poem in a station
of the metro contrast.

602
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:49,200
What pound is doing here with
what Joyce does in Ulysses, uh,

603
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,110
in Ulysses, uh, Joyce is
in a sense caring, um,

604
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,570
uh, Homer's texts, uh, into
contemporary Dublin. Uh,

605
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:03,160
he's, you know, naturalizing
it, modernizing it. Um,

606
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:08,090
pound in a sense is doing just
the opposite. Uh, he is, uh,

607
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,080
going back, uh, and indeed
here the sea flows backward.

608
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,180
Uh, and it, it takes us back to a, again,

609
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,950
primary terms, uh, Archaic
Greek, uh, archaic,

610
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,060
uh,
English.

611
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,090
He is seeking to reappropriate,
uh, the heroic mode,

612
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,780
uh, through translation, uh, in, uh,

613
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,840
yet, uh, contemporary idiom.

614
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,420
This is a kind of raising of the dead,

615
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,940
a kind of journey to the
literary and cultural underworld,

616
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,420
uh, that brings pounds,
adventure as a poet,

617
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,070
a interline with Odysseus's. I
mean, you can see, in other words,

618
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:56,700
what a deceased is doing now as he goes
to the underworld and seeks prophetic

619
00:44:56,701 --> 00:45:00,120
speech from [inaudible] as a
version of what pound is doing,

620
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,140
as he seeks to translate the Greek,
uh,

621
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:09,141
at the inception of his epic
pounds own display of technique.

622
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,990
You can understand as a kind of a
version of the ceremony to honor and pay

623
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:18,920
tribute to through blood sacrifice,
uh,

624
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,690
that a deceased practices here,
uh,

625
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,270
in the pages that follow a,

626
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:29,220
as he induces Tyree Ceus to appear and,
and speak,

627
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,310
um, literary tradition here, uh,

628
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,350
has itself taken the place
of the transcendental
source of authority that was

629
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:44,490
classical, uh, or the Christian Muse, uh,

630
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:49,560
here pound, uh, in a sense
turns back upon poetry itself,

631
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,120
uh, as a sacred source
here, uh, at a moment, uh,

632
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,000
in the epic where in vocation
would ordinarily a stand, uh,

633
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,960
at the point of inception, uh, here, uh,

634
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:08,850
technique is imagined a as a
kind of process of translation,

635
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,110
uh, through which a speech
from elsewhere is, uh,

636
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:17,550
brought forward in time.
Uh, and in some sense,

637
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,470
um, carried across, uh, waters. Um,

638
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,270
again, there's a sense of
contradiction, however,

639
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:32,271
or tension pound wants to elicit
speech from the dead to make,

640
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,840
uh,
the traditions language new.

641
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,790
He wants to transmit the impulse.
He also insists,

642
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,650
however,
Cannelly and,

643
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:48,651
and provocatively on the
mediated quality of his words.

644
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:54,990
Uh, Tyree Sia speaks,
uh, at the, uh, uh, uh,

645
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,630
top of page three 70,
uh,

646
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,710
towards the end of the poem he says to
a deceased when he sees him a second

647
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:04,764
time,

648
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,800
why man of ill star facing the sunless
dead and this joyless region stand from

649
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:15,630
the fos. That is the ditch a leave
me, my bloody beaver for through say,

650
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,500
and I stepped back and that I,
there is the,

651
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:24,120
I have a deceased and he
strong with the blood,

652
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:29,121
said then Odysseus shall return through
spiteful Neptune over dark seas,

653
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,450
lose all companions.

654
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:36,060
And then Anta Claya a deceased.

655
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:40,870
His mother came and then a
remarkable thing happens.

656
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,760
Someone says, lie quiet, diverse,

657
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,660
I mean, and now the eye is the eye
of pound. The narrator, the speaker,

658
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,670
not Odysseus.
I mean,

659
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:57,860
that is Andrei has diverse in a fit.

660
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,630
Kina Vecoli 15,
38 out of homer.

661
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,570
This is pound stepping
into the poem saying,

662
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:08,800
I have been translating all of this from
homer and I have been using the first,

663
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:13,540
uh, uh, well the, the, the
Latin translation, uh, uh, of,

664
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,870
uh, Andrei Us Davis, uh, that, uh,

665
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,870
I bought in a Paris bookstand.
Uh,

666
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:22,840
and this has been my source for this text,

667
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,060
and it is a diverse that I have the
translator that has been my, uh,

668
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,090
Muse, uh, and who has
been speaking here, uh,

669
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,990
through Tyree Ceus, uh, if you like.

670
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,140
And it's his soul that is
laid back and to rest. Uh,

671
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,560
and at this moment, um,
pound continues, uh,

672
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:48,280
now speaking of a deceased in
the third person, then he says,

673
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:53,490
and he sailed by sirens and events
outward in way and unto Searcy.

674
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:00,070
Um, finally, uh, the journey continues,

675
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,550
uh, here, uh, uh, again, um, uh,

676
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:08,370
deceases journey being
analogized implicitly to the, uh,

677
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:13,570
journey that the translator is
affecting as he brings the text, uh,

678
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:18,080
forward in time across from
oral culture to print, uh,

679
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,990
from Greek to Latin and Latin
to English and old English. Uh,

680
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:27,290
and then, uh, in a, uh,
remarkable efflorescence that, uh,

681
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,850
ends this first Canto, uh, with, uh,

682
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,180
a macro ironic display of languages.

683
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:38,380
Pound says vendor on dumb.
In the Cretans phrase again,

684
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:43,000
he's opened his, his book, uh,
uh, and, and at the back of, uh,

685
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,280
a diverse as translation, he's
found, um, uh, the, uh, uh,

686
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:53,310
Homeric hymns and now he's going to
give them to us with the Golden Crown

687
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:59,610
Aphrodite kip pre Muna Menta sore Tita
s mirthful or Kalki with golden girdles

688
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:05,920
and breast bands, thou with dark eyelids
bearing the Golden Bough of Argus Sita.

689
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,470
So that colon,

690
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,160
the poem ends here with a
prayer to the goddess of beauty.

691
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:19,690
Aphrodite,
who is invoked here in Greek and Latin,

692
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,690
uh, who is, uh, brought forward
and who is named Artists Sita,

693
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,610
a killer of the Greeks,
a slayer of the Greeks,

694
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:32,030
presumably because she has, uh, uh,

695
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:36,590
had her hand in, uh, uh,
the abduction of Helen.

696
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:41,570
And, uh, the war in Troy, uh, um,

697
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,670
here, uh, pound has, um, uh,

698
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:49,730
invoked the goddess,
uh, in these ways, uh,

699
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,730
and then concluded his Canto,
uh,

700
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:55,010
with the interesting grammatical form.

701
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,190
So that and the interesting
punctuation colon, um,

702
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,870
in effect,
it's a poem began with,

703
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,530
and it now ends with,

704
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,770
so that where the colon is a kind of a
gateway through which the rest of the

705
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:17,930
poem and implicitly,
uh, following a homer,

706
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,010
the rest of history, uh,
we'll pass. Uh, and here,

707
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,980
pound has established his poem
and established his own role. Uh,

708
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:31,580
as in some sense a
mediator I'm conducting,

709
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:37,130
uh, a, a process by
which, um, the, the, uh,

710
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,960
uh, sources of the past are, uh,

711
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,600
brought forward into the future,
uh,

712
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:49,620
relaying what he calls the impulse
and in the process making it new.

713
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,450
Well, uh, let's stop. Uh, and
we will, um, uh, go on to,

714
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,290
as I say, the related and different, uh,

715
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,660
poetry of Tsla at next week.
