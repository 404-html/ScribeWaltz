1
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,860
Well,
let's,

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,860
let's turn to a page
five 27 in your anthology

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,020
where you find a famous
poem by Wilfred Owen

4
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,240
called Bell K at Decorum S.

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,010
And uh,
your footnote explains,

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,050
that's that phrase is the beginning of
a line from Horace completed at the end

7
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,500
of the poem,
uh,

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,030
that isn't the last lines of
the palm pro Patrizia Mori,

9
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,020
uh,
translated as a,

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,950
it is sweet and proper sweeten right

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,990
decorous to die for one's country.

12
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,400
Bent double like old beggars under sacks,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,760
knock kneed coughing like hags.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,410
We cursed from sludge till
on the haunting flares.

15
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:19,411
We turned our backs and towards
our distant rest began to trudge.

16
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,260
Men Marched Asleep.
Many had lost their boots,

17
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:29,370
but limped on bloodshot.

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,610
Yeah,

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,550
all went lame.
All blind drunk with fatigue,

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,030
death even to the hoots of tired out
stripped five nines that dropped behind

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,380
gas,
gas quick boys.

22
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,130
An ecstasy of fumbling fitting
the clumsy helmets just in time,

23
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,680
but someone's still was yelling,

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,280
yelling out and stumbling and
floundering like a man in fire or lime,

25
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,370
dim through the misty pains and
thick green light as under a green.

26
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:18,550
See,
I saw him drowning

27
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,430
in all my dreams before my helpless site.
He plunges at me.

28
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,910
Guttering, choking, drowning.

29
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,550
Yeah.

30
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,170
If in some smothering dreams,

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,890
you too could pace behind the
wagon that we flung him in.

32
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,760
Okay.

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,580
And watch the white eyes
writhing in his face,

34
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,510
his hanging face like
a devil's sick of sin.

35
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,750
If you could hear at every jolt,

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,950
the blood come gargling from the froth,
corrupted lungs,

37
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,880
obscene as cancer,
bitter as the cud of vile,

38
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,040
incurable sores on innocent tongues.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,930
My friend,

40
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,120
you would not tell with
such high zest to children,

41
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,460
ardent for some desperate glory,
the old lie Dole k at the core.

42
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,030
I'm asked Cro.
Patrizia Maury.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,233
Okay.

44
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,500
Paul Fussell,
uh,

45
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,660
a literary critic who wrote
a brilliant book about,

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,510
uh,
the literature and,

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,690
uh, uh, culture, uh, of,
of the first world war.

48
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,430
Uh, he speaks of irony as, as the, uh,

49
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,080
essential trope or rhetorical figure,
uh,

50
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,970
of this body of literature,
World War One poetry.

51
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,910
Uh, here is in this poem, uh, a, uh, uh,

52
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,940
example of irony of a really
comparatively simple kind,

53
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,540
uh,

54
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,490
what our school by school boy
lines from Horace Lines that, uh,

55
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,590
oh, and then many others would
have learned in school, uh,

56
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,780
to recite, uh, to have memorized that,

57
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,100
uh,
uh,

58
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,110
poetry is here held up
as propaganda, uh, as,

59
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,110
as a,
as a kind of murderous lie.

60
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:31,520
It is sweet and right to
die for one's country.

61
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,000
Uh, uh, you, you, you,

62
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:39,290
you can feel it in the marvelous
texture of this poetry,

63
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,090
uh,

64
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,710
against horses decorous and elegant Latin,

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,910
uh,

66
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,910
there is placed Owen's Anglo
Saxon alliterative inflected,

67
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,720
strongly stressed, uh, language,
uh, with, it's a rough,

68
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,500
uh, and, uh, actual, uh,

69
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,790
vernacular diction.
Uh,

70
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,810
the power and authority to, of, of, uh,

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,100
uh, Owens writing, uh,

72
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:21,050
is well certified. We feel, uh,

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,740
by that first person, uh, that
speaks to us, that, that I,

74
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,400
who speaks from as a, as
a witness, uh, to, uh,

75
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,960
war, uh, as a describer, uh,

76
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:37,670
as someone telling a reader elsewhere,

77
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,200
uh, what he has seen in
speaking specifically for,

78
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,950
uh,
one fallen soldier.

79
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,643
Uh,

80
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
the reception of Owen's poetry
has always been attached to,

81
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,690
um, uh, a sense of, oh,

82
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,880
and as a soldier and witness to war,
uh,

83
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:05,420
and indeed as a victim
of war, uh, who, uh, uh,

84
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,270
died a week before the armistice.
Uh,

85
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,430
this, uh, these poems, uh,

86
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,870
that you see the cover for here,
um,

87
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,780
excuse me, poems by Wilfred Owen, uh,

88
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,490
originally appeared posthumously,
uh, uh, after, uh, uh,

89
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,920
Owens death, uh, introduced by Sigrid Sas,

90
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,810
soon a comrade fellow
poet, fellow soldier. Uh,

91
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,900
and, and as you can see, uh, it, uh,

92
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,310
in addition to the introduction, um, uh,

93
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,470
the cover advertises also
a portrait of the art,

94
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,750
not a portrait of the artist at portrait
of the author. And there is oh and, uh,

95
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:57,740
in uniform, uh, a handsome young man.

96
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,790
Um, this is, uh, all, as I say,

97
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,810
very much part of the
transmission of Owen's poetry.

98
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,270
A doll k et decorum asked,
uh, is a, is a great poem.

99
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,900
But the kind of irony that it puts
forward is I think a simple one.

100
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,050
Uh, it is, uh, well, and it's
a poem. There are lots of them,

101
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,790
uh, that are, are great poems, uh, that
when I first started teaching this course,

102
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:33,680
I decided I wouldn't teach. Uh,
and, and for a number of reasons,

103
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,680
uh, including, um, well,
uh, the sense that, uh,

104
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,300
g Yates, Steven's, uh, uh, Elliot, these,

105
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:49,200
they're hard poets and we need as
much time on them as we can, uh, in,

106
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:53,690
in order to read their work.
And, and, uh, this poem,

107
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,240
uh, seemed, uh,

108
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,310
like one you might find and
be able to read yourself,

109
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,950
uh, without me there to explain it. Um,

110
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,970
it also is the case that probably probably
many of you have already read it, uh,

111
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,700
and possibly studied it in school
and talked about it. So, at any rate,

112
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,620
this seemed to me to be, uh, when
I started teaching this course. Um,

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,720
uh, you know, uh, uh, reasons
not to teach it, uh, besides,

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,200
besides, uh, well, I think the
first time I taught this course,

115
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,770
uh, the, uh, um, well, uh,

116
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,680
was a few years after the Gulf War,

117
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,240
the first Gulf War. Uh,
and, uh, it seemed, uh,

118
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,850
to me, uh, in, in my, uh,

119
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,520
historical innocence that, uh, uh,

120
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,980
the irony that,
uh,

121
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,960
Owen is playing upon here,
uh,

122
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,120
that he's putting forward to us, uh, was,

123
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,740
was not one that I would need to
talk about a in a classroom. Uh,

124
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,360
it seemed to me, uh, as though, uh,

125
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,150
no one would ever quote Horace
again as anything but a lie.

126
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,040
Um, of course, that's not the case. Uh,

127
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,340
you know, uh, as our present, uh,

128
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,950
war has gone on.
Uh,

129
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,320
how many times have we heard people,
uh,

130
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,640
you know, in many different
forms, uh, speaking, uh,

131
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,120
of justification for the
death of young men and women,

132
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,040
uh, on behalf of the nation? Well, um,

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,970
uh, you know, uh, as
we watch our, our, um,

134
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,690
as we watch our president's approval
ratings for his conduct of the war drop,

135
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,840
uh, one wonders, well,

136
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,520
could any of us really
be surprised by this? Uh,

137
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,470
and we'll,
uh,

138
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,870
certainly Wilfred Owen
would not have been. Uh,

139
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,380
and it seemed to me as
though, uh, in fact, uh,

140
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,610
it was important to read
well for doe and, and to, uh,

141
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,650
go on thinking and talking about his
poetry and not only own of course,

142
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,100
but, uh, really the extraordinary,

143
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,060
uh,

144
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,910
rich body of British World War One poetry,
uh,

145
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,400
as a whole, uh, writing that
is not by any means, uh,

146
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,280
all about battle though.

147
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,170
Much of it is like that poem I just read,
uh,

148
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:54,171
today when I want to do is give you
have some sense of this body of writing.

149
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,350
Uh,
and unlike a,

150
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,910
the last few lectures where I've
concentrated on a single poet and,

151
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,980
and tried to make arguments about,
uh, that poet and, and have, uh,

152
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,070
you know, thesis. Uh,

153
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,520
today what I want to do is really
just show you different poems, uh,

154
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,340
and different, uh, poets.
Uh, you know, a range of, of,

155
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,600
uh, uh, brilliant, uh, writing, um,

156
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,050
in addition to an opportunity
to think about poetry and war.

157
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,240
Uh,

158
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,240
it's also a good opportunity to start
to fill out a little bit our sense of,

159
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,120
of what modern poetry is or, uh, was, um,

160
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,510
uh,
what it is or was

161
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,040
also what it did not
become a world war one,

162
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,760
uh, destroyed, uh, in
English generation. Um,

163
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,860
you know, uh, modern poetry as we

164
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,560
study it in this class. And,
uh, you know, I think, uh, as,

165
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:10,240
as you see it in this, this anthology
is an international phenomenon.

166
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:14,560
It's not, uh, um, well, uh,

167
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,850
we don't have a lot of English
poets on his syllabus. Um,

168
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,410
there is a ts Eliot,
uh,

169
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,260
the only great English
poet born in America. Uh,

170
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,120
there is, uh, uh, wh Auden, uh,

171
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,480
in English born poet who moved to America.
Uh,

172
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,370
most of the figures that we study
are in fact Americans. Uh, there's,

173
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:43,560
there's Yates to, uh, all of them
are in a sense internationals.

174
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,290
Uh, and there, there's
a, uh, uh, you know,

175
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,730
a range of,
of important cultural reasons for this,

176
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,890
but there's also the simple fact
of, of the war. Uh, arguably, uh,

177
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,220
the great modern English
poets died, uh, in,

178
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:05,221
in the teens in France in 1915 and 1917.

179
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,400
Uh, or, uh, they survived, uh,

180
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,080
like Ivor Gurney who you have some
samples from in a wounded, uh,

181
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,910
and, and, uh, um, uh, injured, uh, state.

182
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,530
Um,
I also think it's important for us to

183
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,400
think about the war, uh, as, as,
um, uh, an important context,

184
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,350
uh, when we go on to read
pound and Elliot, uh,

185
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,210
when we, uh, encounter,
uh, in their poetry,

186
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:45,010
a sense of a apocalyptic, uh, change,

187
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,020
uh, of civilization in crisis, which
can seem pretty vague sometimes.

188
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,180
Uh, well, um,

189
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,010
and this is true for the Yates poems
that we've been talking about as well.

190
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,300
A Yates is obviously writing, uh, in
the context of an Irish civil war,

191
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:04,850
but it's also the case that
he's riding in the, uh,

192
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,580
a shadow of the first world
war as well. Uh, you know,

193
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,230
uh, on July 1st, 1916, uh,

194
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,740
more than a 57,000 English troops,

195
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,610
uh, were, uh, wounded or dead, uh, uh,

196
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,780
I think, uh, almost
20,000 on that day, um,

197
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,400
died. And, uh, in the, in
the battle of the Somme, um,

198
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,700
as it unfolded, uh, there were
a million casualties. Uh, this,

199
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,570
this is a, you know, a
scale of, of, uh, uh,

200
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,140
human suffering, uh, and, and, uh, uh, um,

201
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,880
uh, kind of, um, well, uh,

202
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,970
a scale of human suffering that is
enormous and hard to comprehend and leaves

203
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:01,580
its shadow across the writing
that we will be reading.

204
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,770
Uh, I, uh,

205
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,570
all the parts we will be
talking about today are men.

206
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,410
Uh, not quite all soldiers,
but most of them, uh,

207
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,120
I've given you some quotes, um, uh,

208
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,550
from Virginia Woolf,
uh,

209
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,660
partly to remind us that,
uh,

210
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,430
the war did not only exist
for men, uh, or soldiers,

211
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,380
uh, and that it existed in
England, uh, as quite as,

212
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,790
uh,
much as it existed on the continent.

213
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,240
Uh, well, uh, w with all of
that, uh, said by preparation.

214
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,010
Uh, let me show you some more poems. Um,

215
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,460
beginning with Thomas Hardy

216
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,310
on page 51,

217
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,600
hardy is, uh, this is, this is, uh,

218
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,470
a little pamphlet, uh, of, uh,

219
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,700
war pumps hardy published, uh, in, um,

220
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,940
1917. And that, that, um, uh,
you can find in the binary, keep

221
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,390
a hardy,
arguably the greatest English poet,

222
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,860
um, modern English poet, uh, is,

223
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,820
is a figure we don't study in
this course. Otherwise. Uh,

224
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,760
he is a poet from another
century. He's born, uh,

225
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,830
in fact, 20 years before
the American civil war, uh,

226
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,180
when World War One
began, uh, he was 74. Uh,

227
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,330
he wrote a, his poems from
the perspective of, uh,

228
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,590
uh, the rural England. That was the
setting for almost all of his novels,

229
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,050
almost all of his poetry,
uh,

230
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,730
and channel firing on the
bottom of 51, uh, is, um,

231
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,250
uh, also set in the west of England, uh,

232
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,650
Hardy's home country, uh, and, uh, is,

233
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,830
is set right on the verge
of the first World War.

234
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,830
It's a poem about gunnery
practice. Uh, yeah.

235
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,140
Uh, it's a, it's a,

236
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,640
a dramatic monologue spoken by one of
the dead in a graveyard that night.

237
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Your great guns unawares shook all our
coffins as we lay and broke the chancel

238
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:41,490
window squares.

239
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,930
We thought it was the judgment
day and sat up. Right.

240
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,560
I heard it already has.
It has.

241
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:57,561
It has various gothic and supernatural
fancies that he asks us to imagine and

242
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,990
vivid homely terms.
While dreary some arose,

243
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,100
the howl of wakened towns,

244
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,070
this is all is this wonderful
observed detail of rural life.

245
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,900
The mouse let fall the altar crumb,

246
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,420
the worms drew back into the mountains.
The Glebe cow drooled

247
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,230
till God called.
No,

248
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,520
it's gunnery practice out at sea.

249
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,590
Just as before you went below
the world is as it used to be.

250
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,080
This is not the second coming
all knit kind of reply to Yates.

251
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,130
Although Yates hasn't written this poem.
Yup.

252
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,440
All nation striving strong
to make red war yet redder,

253
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,950
mad as hatters they do no
more for Christie Sake.

254
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Then you who are helpless in such matters
that this is not the judgment hour for

255
00:18:56,341 --> 00:19:01,341
some of them is a blessing thing for if
it were that have to scour health floor

256
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,970
for so much threatening.

257
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,420
Ha Ha was hard.
He's God laughs like that.

258
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,220
It will be frostbit have understood it.
Uh,

259
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,920
it will be warmer when I blow the trumpet.

260
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,750
If indeed I ever do for you are men
and rest eternal. Sorely need this.

261
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,770
This is God so cruel that he will not
deliver the Second Coming Day of Judgment.

262
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,070
So down we lay again.
I wonder,

263
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,130
will the world ever seen her be said one?

264
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,910
Then when he sent us under
in our indifferent century,

265
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,870
in many,
a skeleton shook his head.

266
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,330
Instead of preaching 40 year,
my neighbor Parson thirdly said,

267
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,770
I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer
again.

268
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:57,600
The guns disturb the hour,

269
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,840
roaring their readiness to event as far
inland distort and tower and Camelot and

270
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,720
starlet Stonehenge.

271
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,453
Okay.

272
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,800
Gunnery practice, uh, disturbs
the dead, uh, disrupts the ground.

273
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,950
Uh, you know, here, here, war refuses
to let the deadline piece, uh,

274
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,910
with the notion that not even
the dead are safe from it,

275
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,960
unaffected by it.
Uh,

276
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,230
the church windows shatter well

277
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,391
in some sense,

278
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:40,391
this is exactly what modernity might be
seen to be doing to traditional English

279
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,200
culture. Uh, heart hardy is,
is full of all this quaint,

280
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,260
Gothic, uh, archaic, uh, Dixon's, uh, and,

281
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:53,360
and fancies,
uh,

282
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,570
the dead or raising their
objections here to two guns, uh, uh,

283
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,530
that will be a used very
shortly in the great war.

284
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,230
God reassures them though, of
course, what he says here is,

285
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,500
is not reassuring.
Uh,

286
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,680
he says that although red
war is getting redder,

287
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,480
it's really as it always has been.
Uh,

288
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,500
this is not the end of the
world that it appears to be a,

289
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,580
he's not about to let Manheim mankind
off the hook with Judgment Day.

290
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,290
Uh, the speaker narrate or
lies back, uh, and wonders, uh,

291
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,510
if the world will ever be
saner. Uh, his neighbor,

292
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,820
uh, says, well, I don't
think so. I wish I had, uh,

293
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,250
uh, you know, pleasured myself
and, uh, uh, rather than,

294
00:21:51,251 --> 00:21:54,820
uh, serving that, uh, wicked God,

295
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,590
uh,
in the last stanza,

296
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,600
then there is that extraordinary
shift of perspective.

297
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,800
Uh, the sound of the
guns carries inland, uh,

298
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,330
into the heart of England.
Uh, and as it does,

299
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:18,331
it carries back also in time to
Camelot and to starlet Stonehenge.

300
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,690
Uh,
what happens when that happens?

301
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,310
What is the meaning of, of
this, the power of this,

302
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:37,030
of the sound of the guns to,
to echo back in time,

303
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,420
uh,
as hardy evokes Camelot and stonehengey.

304
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:47,590
You might, you might, uh, read
this, understand this says, um,

305
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,600
as,
as what,

306
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:53,800
as dignifying and legitimate
dating the present,

307
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,220
uh,
uh,

308
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,770
present firing the present conflict
or in some sense does it go just the

309
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:06,820
opposite? Does it, uh,

310
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,920
does it suggest that England's history
and its heritage and its honor,

311
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,900
uh,
are in jeopardy?

312
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,100
Uh,
uh,

313
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,200
does it in some sense
demythologize the past,

314
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,970
demystify it,

315
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,010
make us see Camelot and Stonehenge
as part of a bear barbaric,

316
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,050
uh, uh, history, um, uh,

317
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,000
such as is about to unfold in 1914.

318
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,760
Uh, there are a couple other, uh,
hardy poems in your anthology,

319
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,240
uh, memorable and powerful, uh,

320
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,900
that are war poems, uh, including, uh,

321
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:01,901
on page 59 in the time of
the breaking of nations.

322
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,210
And then on the next page, uh,
I looked up from my writing,

323
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,210
interesting to look at
these together. Uh, in,

324
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:17,010
in the first poem,

325
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,790
a hardy affirms the endurance
of rural life, and it's,

326
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,200
it's cycles.
Only a man harrowing.

327
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:31,210
Claude's
in a slow,

328
00:24:31,211 --> 00:24:36,211
silent walk with an old
horse that stumbles and nods
half asleep as they stock.

329
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,020
Yeah.

330
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,460
Only thin smoke without flame
from the heaps of couch grass,

331
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,430
yet this will go on word the same though.
Dynasties pass,

332
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,360
okay.

333
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Beyond or a maid and her
white come whispering by wars,

334
00:24:58,401 --> 00:25:02,910
analysts will fade in tonight,
air their story, die. Uh,

335
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,720
rural life including, uh, um,

336
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,960
rituals of love and courtship,
uh,

337
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:13,961
here are represented as poetry's truest
subject and as a kind of enduring,

338
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,470
uh, uh, source of, of, um,

339
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,420
uh, social life and meaning, uh,

340
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,590
you could compare this poem to,
uh, the poem place last and,

341
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,950
and Yates is, uh, uh, last
poems called politics. Uh,

342
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,410
that might seem to say something similar,
uh,

343
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:41,030
in hardy here. And in
other pumps, there's, uh,

344
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,530
the serve wonderfully self,
consciously archaic language.

345
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,110
Uh, hardy wants to use really old, uh,

346
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:54,030
dialect words when he can. Um, and,

347
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,360
and there's, there's, there's,
there's power in that.

348
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,720
And this is a poem composed in 1915,
uh,

349
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,500
when we read the love song of J.
Dot.

350
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:07,460
Alfred Prufrock when we
read pounds first Canto, uh,

351
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,810
remember that those poems are written,
published at just the same time.

352
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,330
This poem is being written,
uh,

353
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,030
palms with a very different, um, uh,

354
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:24,970
ways of, of proceeding, uh, in
different kinds of language. Uh,

355
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,550
in the second poem here, I looked
up from my riding, uh, the poet,

356
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:33,350
the first person is being interrupted
a at his desk, uh, at night.

357
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,700
Uh, he's, he, uh, his startled, uh,

358
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,610
to see the moon's full gaze on me.
Uh,

359
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,950
her meditative misty head was
spectral and it's there and I,

360
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:46,720
and voluntarily said,
what are you doing there?

361
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,410
And Hardy Hardy works in these,
uh, song forms that, well,

362
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,460
they sound like popular
ballads. Uh, and, and he, he,

363
00:26:56,461 --> 00:26:59,040
he wants you to, uh, uh, you know,

364
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:03,090
hear them as part of almost a kind of
folk literature, which he draws on.

365
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:08,340
Uh, the, uh, Moon says to him, Oh,

366
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:13,341
I've been scanning pat pond and whole
and waterway hear about for the body of

367
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:17,310
one with a sunken soul who
has put his life flight out.

368
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,000
Did you hear his frenzy tattle?

369
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,450
It was sorrow for his son who
is slain and brutish battle,

370
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,920
though he has injured none.

371
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,270
Okay.

372
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,100
And now the moon says,

373
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,160
I am curious to look into the blinkered
mind poet of one who wants to write a

374
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:42,400
book in a world of such a kind

375
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,490
her temper.
The poet then says,

376
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,020
overwrought me in I edge
to sh to shun her view,

377
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,640
to get out of the moonlight for I felt
assured she thought me one who should

378
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:59,490
drown him to, uh, here. Uh,

379
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,190
a neighbor father, a crazed with
grief at the death of his son,

380
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:09,290
uh, has drowned himself,
uh, uh, killed himself.

381
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,170
Uh, and the moon, uh, implies, uh,

382
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,820
in its gaze that the
poet should do so too.

383
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,210
Uh, in such a world, uh,

384
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:24,260
it seems writing poems
is, is a, a kind of, well,

385
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,670
even surviving as a kind
of guilty privilege.

386
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,280
You could compare with this
poem a Kipling's. Uh, uh, poem,

387
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,510
a Kipling, one of the great
apologists of empire, uh,

388
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,380
saying on page one 53 of,
of your, your book, uh,

389
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,970
in the voice of a soldier,

390
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,780
a if any question why we soldiers died,

391
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,420
tell them our father's lied.
Uh,

392
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,900
a statement that is, uh,
uh, poignant, uh, uh,

393
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,960
pointing and powerful in part because
Kipling's own son died in the war.

394
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,410
This is the volume of poems
published in 1917 by Edward Thomas

395
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,670
and a portrait of Thomas,
another soldier, poet, uh,

396
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,220
not represented. However, as a
soldier here, uh, represented,

397
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,830
uh, rather as a, uh, uh,

398
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,630
English citizen in Tweed,
a man out,

399
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:38,940
in and of nature.

400
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,770
Thomas born in 1878.

401
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,300
So he was 36 when the war began.

402
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,870
He began almost at the same time
as the war began to write poems.

403
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,890
Uh, he begins writing, uh,

404
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:03,850
under the influence of
his friend Robert Frost.

405
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,330
Frost and Thomas have a
fascinating relationship, uh,

406
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,250
an important, uh, transatlantic
exchange, uh, for us.

407
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,460
Famous poem, the road
less traveled by, uh,

408
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:20,890
he,
uh,

409
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,890
sometimes described as being about Thomas
and Thomas' own sense of regret and

410
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,910
hesitation and indirection.
Uh,

411
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:35,320
to which frost contest it himself.
Uh,

412
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,600
frost became an England, uh,
uh, a poet of New England

413
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,170
whom Thomas was reading at that moment
in such a way as to help enable him,

414
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,870
Thomas to become a great poet of England,
uh,

415
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:59,650
and of England's, uh, uh, landscape and,

416
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,190
and countryside, uh, and uh, nature.

417
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,110
Uh, there are, um, there,

418
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,250
there's a good selection from
Thomas, uh, in your anthology. Uh,

419
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:17,170
I will, uh, read my
favorite poem by Thomas,

420
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,760
uh,
which is the first one called adol strop

421
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,940
on to 31.

422
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,703
Uh,

423
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,543
yes,

424
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,530
I remember adults strop

425
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,350
the name because one afternoon of heat,

426
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,080
the express train drew
up their unwantedly.

427
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,210
It was late June,
the steam hist

428
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,240
someone cleared his throat,

429
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,170
no one left and no one
came on the bear platform.

430
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,680
What I saw was adol strop

431
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,330
only the name and willows,

432
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,020
willow herb and grass and
meadow sweet and hey Cox dry,

433
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,410
no witless less still and lonely.

434
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:26,460
Fair than the high cloudlets in the sky.

435
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,260
And for that minute,

436
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:35,261
a blackbird saying close by in round
him mistier farther and farther,

437
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,020
all the birds of Oxford Shear
in Gloucestershire year.

438
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,800
It's a wonderful poem in its simplicity,
modesty,

439
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,940
directness and
reticence,

440
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,060
which yet provides the most expansive
and exhilarating a since of the English

441
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,500
landscape and of the power
of a moment in time to uh,

442
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,800
uh, enlarge and, and, uh, be uh,

443
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,410
pregnant with meaning a notice,

444
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,860
a notice Thomas's really
superb nonchalance and
offhandedness and simplicity.

445
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,110
It was late June.
The steam hist.

446
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,120
I mean, there, there's a kind of a
colloquial clarity and confidence, uh,

447
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,140
quite different from the,
uh,

448
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,060
vernacular language in um,
uh,

449
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:52,400
the hardy palms. I was just reading,
which are also poems of the countryside.

450
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,800
A here, the name, the name that odd name,

451
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,230
adults strop prompts a memory,

452
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,340
prompts a memory in such a way
that a moment in time stands out,

453
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,420
separated from other moments just as
the odd and poetic and beautiful name

454
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,060
adults strop seems to stand out there.

455
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:24,020
There's a kind of poignant pension
between the beautifulness of the name,

456
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,540
the awkwardness, and yet
the dignity of the name, uh,

457
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,550
and the sense of natural beauty
that the poem will unfold

458
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,310
here.
The stopping of the train is like the,

459
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,460
the interruption by memory
of normal consciousness.

460
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,080
That's the basis of the poem.

461
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,470
There's a sense that in this memory
of the poet, somehow saw the name

462
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,460
presumably, I suppose, saw
it on a sign board, uh, in,

463
00:34:58,461 --> 00:34:59,270
in the,
uh,

464
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:03,800
station as you roll into a
station and you see where you are.

465
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,530
Uh, but there's, there's more
suggestion in it than that.

466
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:10,640
Uh,

467
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,640
it says if this moment we're one
in which the name and the place,

468
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,180
the word and the thing,
uh, fully coincided,

469
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,980
uh, fully coincided in
a experience of, of, uh,

470
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,170
uh, uh, presence and,

471
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:32,960
and immediacy where the
world is all there. Uh, and,

472
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:38,100
and named, located, placed, uh,

473
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:43,410
the figure,
the metaphor for this semiotic unity of,

474
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,930
of word and thing, uh, is bird song. Uh,

475
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,880
hear bird song a is a
kind of natural language,

476
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:55,380
a language in which nature speaks,
uh, and speaks in such a way,

477
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,380
uh, that the particular voice
carries a, the import and, uh,

478
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:05,340
authority of the general, uh, uh, just as,

479
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:10,320
as the one bird seems to sing with many
bird's songs by the end of the palm.

480
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,620
And so adults strap itself suddenly seems
to signify more a calling to mind in

481
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:21,450
the kind of rippling and
radiating circles. Uh, uh,

482
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,860
Oxford Sheer Gloucester
sheer, uh, England,

483
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,970
all of it,
the poet's home.

484
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,970
Uh,
at the same time,

485
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,750
it's also clear that this epiphany
is a remembered experience.

486
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,070
It's recalled, uh, the
poet's first word, yes,

487
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
wonderful affirmation.
Ah,

488
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,360
situates the poem in a dialogue
as if someone had just said,

489
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,190
have you ever been to adults strap,
uh,

490
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,270
whether this dialogue is, is,
you know, actual or in internal,

491
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,200
it doesn't really matter.
Uh,

492
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:06,460
the pump part of the poems
forced derives from, uh, uh,

493
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,400
the, uh, status of this moment
is something remembered, uh,

494
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,230
and remembered, um, uh,

495
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:18,520
within the context of a nation at war.

496
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,580
Although I believe, uh,
Thomas wrote the palm, uh,

497
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,190
the year he enlisted. But I
think before his enlistment, uh,

498
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,330
you might feel as though Thomas
is already on the train, uh,

499
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,520
for France. Uh, there,

500
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,390
there's a way in which the context
of the war to shadows the poem,

501
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,870
uh, and, and remains
present in it. Um, uh,

502
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,550
don't you feel it? Uh,
in certain, uh, details,

503
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,790
uh,
the Erie lack of people in this place,

504
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,770
no one left and no one came.
Uh,

505
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:01,160
in a sense,
uh,

506
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,680
it is an image of the English countryside
at a moment in which it is being

507
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,860
emptied out. Uh, uh,

508
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,900
it's young men sent to France to
die a kind of no man's land already.

509
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,640
This is Siegfried soon in uniform,
uh,

510
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,410
in 1916,
uh,

511
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,300
Sas soons poetry,
uh,

512
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:35,330
centers on a hallucinatory overlays
of homefront and battlefront.

513
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,680
Let's look at blighters on,
on page three 89,

514
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,303
uh,

515
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,850
a
wonderfully angry poem.

516
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,533
Uh,

517
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,150
a poem that is situated in a music hall,

518
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,960
I guess,
presumably a London Music Hall.

519
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,380
The House has crammed tier beyond tier.

520
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:19,381
They grin and cackle at the show
while prancing ranks of harlots,

521
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,990
shrill,
the chorus drunk with dyn.

522
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,590
We're sure the Kaiser
loves the dear old tanks.

523
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,420
I'd like to see a tank come down the
stalls lurching to ragtime tunes or home

524
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:35,344
sweet home.

525
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,510
And there'd be no more jokes
in musicals to mock the riddle.

526
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,310
Corpses Round Bowl Palm.

527
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,633
Okay.

528
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,510
Here,

529
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:52,250
there's an analogy between the
music hall and the theater of war.

530
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,153
Uh,

531
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,320
it's as if the English populous were
spectators only consuming as entertainment

532
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,220
war propaganda,
which makes the poet hate them.

533
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,390
He imagines here the eruption of the real,
uh,

534
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:15,600
into this representational space, uh, and,

535
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,470
and imagines it as a kind
of attack on the, uh, uh,

536
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:24,270
working in middleclass audiences of the,
of the music hall. Uh, the, the, uh,

537
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,350
the soldier becomes a in fantasy here,
uh,

538
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,970
the spectator as the war turns
around and comes back, uh, uh,

539
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:37,380
reversed by kind of evil charm
or spell, uh, coming home

540
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,890
and home is here made to
rhyme with [inaudible],

541
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,893
uh,

542
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,850
bringing battlefront and
homefront together as a rhyme.

543
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,773
Uh,
there,

544
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,800
there's an aggression towards the urban
crowd here that recalls and exaggerates

545
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:02,970
a Yates his attitude at the same
time, uh, really in the same, uh,

546
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:07,440
years, uh, in poems like
a coat or the fishermen

547
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,350
in other Sasoon poems,
the, the war comes home.

548
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:17,820
And in other ways, uh, for example,

549
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,320
uh, well, uh, in the rear guard, uh,

550
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,230
just just down the page here,
uh,

551
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,320
or repression of war experience,

552
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:30,600
which is about a

553
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,490
traumatic repetition of, uh,

554
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,480
uh, battle, uh, or in dreamers, uh, where,

555
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,990
um, there is, um, uh, again,

556
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:49,991
a kind of juxtaposing of a life in
the trenches in life in the city,

557
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,600
uh,
rather than dwell longer on them though.

558
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:04,010
And to make sure I get time
for a couple more poems,

559
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:07,310
I want to move on and,
uh,

560
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,800
consider this is a festoons poem,

561
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,230
poems, um, counter attack.

562
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:18,610
And this is the poetry of Isaac Rosenberg.

563
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:24,050
Uh, here's a frontest piece
with, with Rosenberg in a,

564
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:28,640
a, um, a military coat.

565
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:34,070
A Rosenberg was all besides a poet,
was also an artist,

566
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,170
uh, and, uh, uh, created
these self portraits,

567
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,570
self portrait in France in 1915.
Uh,

568
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,190
Rosenberg in contrast to Sasoon was poor.

569
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,490
Uh, Jewish, uh,

570
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,750
and rights are rather different kind of
poem from those we have been looking at

571
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:10,250
today. Uh, one of the most famous, uh,

572
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,010
and extraordinary is Laos
hunting on page five oh six,

573
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,630
a little bit further on in your book.

574
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:20,523
Okay.

575
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,890
Nudes stark and glistening,

576
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,610
yelling and Lurid [inaudible] grinning
faces and raging limbs were all over the

577
00:43:33,101 --> 00:43:37,870
floor. One fire for a
shirt. Verminous Lee,

578
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:41,690
busy yon soldier tour
from his throat with oath.

579
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:45,250
God had might shrink app but not the lice.

580
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,280
And soon the shirt was a flare over
the candle. He'd lit while we lay.

581
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,730
Then we all sprang up and stripped
to hunt. The verminous brewed

582
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:04,690
here. The, the soldiers are, uh,
stripping their clothes off and,

583
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:07,960
and, and attacking the lice
that are attacking them

584
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:14,590
soon like a demon's pantomime.
The place was raging.

585
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,110
It's nighttime and, and, and the

586
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,230
candles and flares, they're throwing
shadows. See the silhouettes of gate.

587
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,660
See the Jib bring shadows mixed
with the battled arms on the wall.

588
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,410
See Gargantuan hooked fingers.

589
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:36,411
Pluck in supreme flesh to
smuch supreme littleness.

590
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,740
See the Mary limbs and hot Highland
fling because some wizard vermin charmed

591
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:46,230
from the quiet.
This rebel when our ears,

592
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,860
we're half load by the dark
music blown from sleeps trumpet,

593
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,230
a strange place for this poem to end.
Uh,

594
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:04,270
nudes, the poem begins.
Uh, it's a, uh, uh,

595
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,050
shocking, uh, and, and,

596
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,410
and comic and pleasurable
to see the armored men.

597
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,630
Uniformed men suddenly
exposed just naked bodies

598
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,140
to see them, uh, here.

599
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:23,580
Bedeviled not by a gas
attack or machine guns,

600
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,120
but lice,
fleas,

601
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,700
uh,
Rosenberg is writing,

602
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:36,620
not in those little
crafted stands as of um,

603
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,800
hardy or of, um, for that
matter of Thomas, uh,

604
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,060
he's riding in a kind
of strongly stressed,

605
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,320
a free verse with a variable line lengths.

606
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:54,050
Uh, lots of, uh, well the, the,

607
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:59,010
there's a sense in which the poetry
itself is exuberant and naked and full of

608
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:03,260
life and, uh, by uh, vital, uh,

609
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,010
and naturalistic,
you could say in its

610
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,760
representation.
Uh,

611
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,980
Rosenberg is giving us an
anecdote from the trenches

612
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,330
and yet it's slips very
quickly into a sense of fable.

613
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,140
Uh, uh, the, the louse hunting

614
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,720
where these big men hunt these
little things, these fleas,

615
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,470
uh, it becomes, uh,

616
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:38,880
when it's thrown by shadow as it kind of
flickering image on the tent or trench

617
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:43,130
wall, uh, uh, when it becomes
represented, so to speak. Uh, it,

618
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,200
it becomes a battle scene where gigantic
forces smuch supreme littleness.

619
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,360
We are put in mind of how men
are to the gods as flies to men.

620
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,810
Uh, this is an analogy as old as
and found in homer [inaudible].

621
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,110
Uh, we are also put in mind
of how the wars, in fact,

622
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:05,860
anything but a revel,

623
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,360
a though it too may have been provoked
by a cause as insignificant and hard to

624
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:15,500
trace as some wizard vermin.
Uh,

625
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,490
those last lines then are
so ominous and strange.

626
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,740
Uh, though these men have been
brought to life, uh, from sleep,

627
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,331
uh,

628
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:32,331
there's a sense that the trumpet
will sound for them again.

629
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:38,250
Uh, and they will enter a dark
sleep from which they won't wake a,

630
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,870
which is just the, the point
of, uh, the next poem, uh,

631
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,430
returning.
We hear the Larks,

632
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,880
I won't take time to read it though.
Uh, or, or talk about it. Uh,

633
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,090
but instead,
uh,

634
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,760
I'd like to conclude
this is, uh, another, uh,

635
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,650
great poet of the war who
survived though, um, uh, in,

636
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:06,460
as I say, uh, uh, uh, wounded, uh, uh,

637
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:10,060
condition mentally Ivor Gurney.
Uh,

638
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,790
I want to conclude with a,
uh,

639
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,370
a poem by Owen. Um, there's, uh,

640
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:25,840
let's see. This is, this is page five, 28,

641
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,220
uh,
just following Dulcie at decorum asked,

642
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:34,480
uh, strange meeting. Uh,

643
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:37,990
this is a poem that,
um,

644
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,780
well, uh, if the first
poem demystifies, um, uh,

645
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:48,510
one crucial threat of war ideology,
uh,

646
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:53,000
that it is right and good
to die for the country. Uh,

647
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:55,740
this poem takes on, uh, another, uh,

648
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,110
crucial element of war ideology that,
uh,

649
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,220
the enemy is another,
the enemy is unlike me.

650
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:11,120
Uh, like Rosenberg, uh,
like a Rosenberg's poem.

651
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,610
Uh,
this one

652
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,660
comes out of and, and, and returns
eventually to, to sleep. Uh,

653
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,470
it is, uh, a kind of dream vision, uh,

654
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,180
Don Teske in its, uh, uh, mode,

655
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,590
uh, and, and, and full of 'em here. Um,

656
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,130
powerful. Uh, I am Beck pentameter.

657
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,100
It seemed that out of battle,

658
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:44,000
I escaped down some profound dult tunnel.

659
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,260
Long sense,
scooped through granites,

660
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,830
which titanic wars had groined

661
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:56,930
yet also, they're
encumbered sleepers, groaned

662
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,850
too fast and thought
or death to be bustard.

663
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,960
Then as I probed them,

664
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,190
one sprang up and stared with
piteous recognition in fixed eyes,

665
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,720
lifting distressful hands as if to bless
and by his smile I knew that selling

666
00:50:22,761 --> 00:50:26,810
hall by his dead smile,
I knew we stood in hell

667
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,480
with a thousand pains. That
vision's face was grained, hit.

668
00:50:32,481 --> 00:50:37,400
No blood reached there from the upper
ground and no guns thumped or down.

669
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,690
The flues made Moan,
strange friend. I said,

670
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,120
here is no cause to mourn.

671
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,700
None said the other.
Save the undone years,

672
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,430
the hopelessness, whatever
hope is, yours was my life.

673
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:56,264
Also,

674
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,730
I went hunting wild after the
wildest beauty in the world,

675
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,300
which lies not calm and
i's or braided hair,

676
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,900
but mocks the steady running of the
hour and if it grieves grieves rich lear

677
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,410
than here for by my glee might.

678
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:19,580
Many men have laughed and of my
weeping something had been left,

679
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,470
which must die now. I
mean the truth. Untold,

680
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,160
the pity of war,
the pity war distilled.

681
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:33,740
Now men will go content with
what we spoiled or discontent,

682
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,620
boil bloody and be spilled.

683
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,090
They will be swift with
swiftness of the Tigris. None.

684
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:44,960
We'll break ranks though
nations trek from progress.

685
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,180
Courage was mine and I had mystery.
Wisdom was mine,

686
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:55,210
and I have mastery to miss the march
of this retreating world into veins

687
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:57,890
citadels that are not walled.

688
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,380
Then when much blood had
clogged their chariot wheels,

689
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:06,590
I would go up and wash
them from sweet wells,

690
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,640
even with trues that
lie too deep for taint.

691
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,870
I would have poured my
spirit without stint,

692
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,640
but not through wounds,
not on the assess of war.

693
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:25,420
Foreheads of men have bled where
no wounds were I and the enemy.

694
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:28,460
You killed my friend.

695
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:34,630
I knew you in the star for so you frowned
yesterday through me as you jabbed and

696
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:42,881
killed I parried but my
hands were loathed and cold.

697
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,150
Let us sleep now.

698
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:55,780
We'll stop now and move on to poems
written during the same period and

699
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:02,600
associated with images them on Monday.
