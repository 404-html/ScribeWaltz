1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,310
Let's see. I, uh,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,270
last time I wanted to talk to you about,
uh,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,270
more as a woman poet, uh,
as an American poet, uh,

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,860
and as a nature poet,
um,

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,270
I didn't get very far,
uh, with the ladder. Uh,

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:22,770
I started talking about
that long, uh, really, uh,

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,790
a tough palm and octopus
about Mount Rainier.

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,080
I'd like to go back there, uh, and to, uh,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,970
work through a little bit of
that poem with you. Um, I, uh,

10
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,380
suggested that,
um,

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,020
this octopus that, that, uh,
more is writing about, um,

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,080
this mountain is that once something, uh,

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,230
other, something out there, uh, uh, a,

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,570
an emblem of the power of the
natural world. And on the other hand,

15
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:02,430
something that more identifies
with a certain qualities of,

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,390
of the mountain, uh, it's
energy. It's forced, uh,

17
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:09,330
the image of the octopus
itself. Uh, there,

18
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:13,410
the glacier on top of Mount Rainier
has I think, sort of eight arms. Uh,

19
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:18,390
and that's what she is,
um, uh, playing with, uh,

20
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,890
and I suggested that there's something
octopus like about Marianne Moore too,

21
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,150
with those long lines that,
that snake, uh, out, uh,

22
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:31,570
in seem to grasp onto all sorts of stuff,
uh,

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,900
producing this poetry of
collage and in multiple voices.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,100
Uh, more. Uh, let me see
if I work through the,

25
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:47,380
the end of the poem with you,
uh, from around. Well, there's,

26
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,350
there's a long last stanza or paragraph,
uh,

27
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,420
whatever you would like to call it.

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,040
That begins on four 44
a at the bottom line,

29
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,120
one 61.
Um,

30
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,820
more is, uh, uh, talking about here,

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,240
uh,

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,240
maybe confusingly or unhelpfully
Greek aesthetics a while.

33
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:19,630
She's also talking about, um, the, um,

34
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,630
um, uh, creatures and, uh,

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,530
people that inhabit this place that
she's writing about Mount Rainier.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,670
Uh, she, uh, she says on
the middle of four 45,

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,870
uh, about the, the Greeks.
It's all right. It's hard.

38
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,490
It's hard to quote from this poem.

39
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:46,690
It's hard to enter it at any point
because each thing is kind of connected to

40
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,660
the other. And to make sense of anything
you have to kind of work back. Uh,

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,490
she says, well, uh,

42
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
how do you,
how do you approach nature in a sense?

43
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,300
That's the great question of the poem.

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,070
A here the brochure is
telling us, well, we,

45
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,090
we shouldn't approach it with
guns, nets, uh, et cetera. Uh,

46
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,890
we won't be welcome there.
Um,

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,260
more was going to develop this idea
a little bit further. She says,

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,040
in a sense,
why bother putting all that down

49
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,720
more prodigious Lee includes
these quotations from, well,

50
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:33,010
you know, uh, hiking handbook,
uh, and then, uh, uh,

51
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,520
lyrical language like the spousal flower,

52
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,550
concise without a shiver,
uh,

53
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,440
shifting between these registers
of diction. Uh, and then,

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,250
um,
uh,

55
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,840
seeing the mountain as in that sense
as some kind of special flower,

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,270
a intact when it is cut,

57
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,920
and then she calls the mountain damned
for it's sacrosanct remoteness. That is,

58
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,420
she's, if she's saying
people, people, um, uh,

59
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:06,421
damn this mountain because it's
too high and far and remote to,

60
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,950
uh, climb sacrosanct remoteness. Uh,

61
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,160
that's a suggestive a phrase.
Uh,

62
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,270
it would seem to imply that,
um,

63
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,050
the mountain were with being
dammed for possibly, um,

64
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,160
uh,

65
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,160
what we would recognize as ethical
qualities in a person that is some kind of

66
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,310
eliteness, uh, in some
kind of reserve in fact,

67
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,270
properties that you might find
in an author like Henry James,

68
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,860
damned by the public for
decorum here, uh, more, uh,

69
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,890
makes the kind of strange
and Wild Association of the
mountain and Henry James,

70
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,181
uh,

71
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:54,181
as if the mountain where somehow I kind
of image of a that great sort of early

72
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,680
modernist,
a prose writer,

73
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,710
a damned by the public for decorum,
uh, that is damned for his,

74
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,700
uh, uh, elite, uh, posture,

75
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,670
the demands he placed upon the reader,
uh,

76
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:13,360
and his high level of decorum in writing.
Uh,

77
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:17,740
and then she corrects herself. She
says, not decorum, that's wrong,

78
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,080
but restraint. That's what James
exemplifies and that's what the mountain,

79
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,650
it seems exacts to.
Uh,

80
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,660
she continues and now she's talking about
Henry James. It is the love of, well,

81
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,170
and moving out of Henry James into,
into a general,

82
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,210
a general principle.
It is the love of doing hard things,

83
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:44,470
whether it's climbing the mountain or
reading late James that rebuffed and wore

84
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:48,700
them out the public, uh, public
out of sympathy with neatness,

85
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,730
neatness, uh, she, uh, arrives here, uh,

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,780
uh, substituting one
term for another. First,

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm a remoteness than decorum,
decorum,

88
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,530
but restraint, not restraint
precisely necessarily or only,

89
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:10,910
but neatness, a kind of
aesthetic, uh, quality,

90
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,110
uh,

91
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,310
neatness of Finnish neatness of finish.

92
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,520
She says she exclaims those two
exclamation points following a,

93
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:26,270
as if, well, how did she say
them? Uh, is it, is it a,

94
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:31,160
in a spirit of exasperations with this
public that's worn out by the demands

95
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,350
placed on them by a certain kind of
writing or by a certain kind of mountain?

96
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,300
Uh, uh, I mean, uh, she, uh, uh, uh,

97
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,670
here mocking the idea of
a neatness of finish or,

98
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:50,330
or raising it as a kind
of banner and battle cry.

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,120
Now she moves back, uh,
again, uh, to the mountain,

100
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,950
a relentless accuracy. And
here she'll name it, uh,

101
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,480
the octopus.
Again,

102
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,660
relentless accuracy is the nature
of this octopus with its capacity.

103
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,280
For fact, she's talking
about the mountain. Uh,

104
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,030
but the mountain itself seems now to be a,

105
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,700
the embodiment of a certain kind of mind,

106
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,730
a certain kind of imagination
that grasps at and absorbs,

107
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,850
uh, and, uh, comes to assimilate fact.

108
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,790
And then, uh, she will,
um, turn herself over, uh,

109
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,550
in these closing lines to, um, uh,

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,400
a series of quotations

111
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,150
that described the mountain and do so,
uh,

112
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,610
with,
uh,

113
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,340
a kind of lyric exhortation
that that climbs

114
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,180
to the, uh, uh, romantic,

115
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:01,181
sublime and does so out in
this strange collage form.

116
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,780
It's an extraordinary kind of a
celebration and a declaration celebration,

117
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,190
uh, of, uh, the, uh, uh,

118
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,640
frankly savage forces that the mountain
both embodies and endures a at its

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,130
altitude. And, uh, as she does,

120
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,570
uh, she, uh, um,

121
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,410
suggests that there are,
uh,

122
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,210
similar forces of primal violence
and intensity that are contained,

123
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,301
uh,
and,

124
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:46,130
and indeed expressed in
the writing of Henry James,

125
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
uh, in the, uh, uh, aesthetic,

126
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,080
a project of a restraint,
uh,

127
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,770
that she herself,
uh,

128
00:08:55,771 --> 00:09:00,450
engages in and that she calls us to and
calls the love of doing hard things,

129
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,850
whether that's climbing a
mountain or reading poems. Um,

130
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,470
this, um, uh,

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,500
closing passage is so powerful
and interesting because more,

132
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,630
uh, moves from, uh, a kind of writing,

133
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,640
which is often a ascribe to her or,

134
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:24,810
or identified with her
that his description,

135
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,940
precise observation of the natural world,
um,

136
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,211
uh,

137
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:35,211
kind of writing that is those frequently
seen as limited in its ambition and its

138
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,720
emotional power,

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,670
but amassed here in this sequence in fact,
uh,

140
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,400
takes on a kind of, um, uh,

141
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,830
well remarkable force and
in lyric a intensity, uh,

142
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,100
and makes more seem,
uh, uh, not at all. Uh,

143
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,480
like the restraint or prudish,
a virginal,

144
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,360
a poet that, um, uh,

145
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,370
many of her peers in subsequent
readers have found her to be.

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,550
Um, the, uh,

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,650
fastidiousness decorum
restraint. These, uh,

148
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,670
aesthetic and ethical values, uh,
in short are here attached to,

149
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,440
um,
uh,

150
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,970
powers and intensity that we don't
ordinarily associate with them.

151
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,810
Um, the volcano, uh, its whiteness,

152
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,610
uh, that's important. The white volcano
with no weather side because the,

153
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,803
uh,

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,000
the weather side of the volcano
has been broken off, uh,

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,790
in, uh, in ancient blast. Uh,

156
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,670
the volcano signifies a kind of,
um,

157
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,280
virginal force.
Uh,

158
00:10:56,281 --> 00:11:01,281
it is a specifically female version of
elemental power and of the sublime a of

159
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:08,140
Emersonian self-reliance,
uh,

160
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,500
that comes to more,
uh,

161
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,970
via Emily Dickinson who
has her volcanoes to,

162
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,480
uh, self-reliance, uh,
by, by self reliance,

163
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,560
I mean, uh, more, uh,

164
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,320
hardy American insistence
on self sufficiency,

165
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,040
on independence and on originality.

166
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,750
And she is again, the most
radically original of all the poets.

167
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:41,400
We read the least like anybody
else. Uh, in this, interestingly,

168
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,330
despite her reliance on
quotation, uh, as, uh, her, uh,

169
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,330
uh, distinctive, um, uh, um, uh, medium

170
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,240
there, there's, uh, uh, um, powerful, um,

171
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,530
tradition of American romanticism
that's present in a more,

172
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,780
uh, with feminist, uh, ramifications.

173
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,090
Uh,
and it's interestingly,

174
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:15,091
in more joined to a modernist and
Ellie odic aesthetic of impersonality,

175
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,940
um, which, uh, we've seen, uh,

176
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,800
defined and Elliot's essay on tradition
and the individual talent and elsewhere,

177
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,680
uh, uh, Elliot's modernist
aesthetics were, were,

178
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,940
uh, attractive to more,
I think in part because,

179
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,373
uh,

180
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,270
Elliot's idea of impersonality was
compatible with female modesty,

181
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,280
uh, with, uh, Christian virtue. Uh,

182
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,750
let me, uh, turn to, uh, another
poem, a poem in your Ras Packet,

183
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,790
uh, as, uh,

184
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,820
helpfully concise as an octopus is long.
Uh,

185
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,300
and that's the pumps silence.
Uh,

186
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,240
and you'll hear a kind
of echo of the lines. I

187
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,603
just read

188
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,790
another I think powerful poem.
Uh,

189
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,120
we saw more correct herself,
uh,

190
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,820
in an octopus saying,
uh,

191
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,710
not decorum but restraint.
Uh, here she says,

192
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,200
not in silence,
but restraint.

193
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,460
The deepest feeling she says,

194
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,640
shows itself in restraint shows itself
in restraints somehow by through a very,

195
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,180
the very act of restraint

196
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,770
is allied to an expressive
act of self disclosure.

197
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,750
Paradoxically, perhaps, uh,

198
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,240
the keys to our,

199
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:02,241
our deep identity are disclosed in some
of the ways in which they are withheld.

200
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,550
Uh, this is a theme from one
of the poems behind this poem,

201
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,950
which I've quoted, uh, uh, for you, uh,

202
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,420
on your handout from Longfellow,
from his palm of grief, uh,

203
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,810
called resignation by silence.
Sanctifying,

204
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,230
not concealing the grief
that must have way,

205
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,530
uh,
Moore's writing though,

206
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,150
remote in form from Longfellow or,
um,

207
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,240
uh, Emerson for that matter or homes. Uh,

208
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,410
another part we'll look at later
today, uh, is nonetheless, uh,

209
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,220
deeply involved in, in, uh,
19th century American poems.

210
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,010
Um, here, uh,

211
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,820
the poem silence itself seems to

212
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,880
be an example of what it's talking about.
That is,

213
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,920
it reveals something about more silently,
uh,

214
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,220
through what is not said or,
uh,

215
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,280
rather through the ways that what is
said gesture towards what is not a,

216
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,930
it's a poem that,
uh,

217
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,920
presumes to or presents
itself, uh, as speaking,

218
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,370
uh, for the poet, uh,
in, in the first person.

219
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,630
My father used to say,
well,

220
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,530
uh,
curiously more.

221
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:44,531
It's really not in at least an
explicit way speaking about her father,

222
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,700
uh, or what her father said. Uh,

223
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,150
more included in her
selected poems, notes, uh,

224
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,700
that disclose some of the sources,
uh,

225
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,700
that she was quoting from
borrowing from collaging with, uh,

226
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,130
and this particular, uh, poem, uh,

227
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,750
bears and note that,
uh,

228
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,400
attributes much of this
quotation to a certain, uh,

229
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:17,400
am Homans, uh, who is in fact a,

230
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,500
a distant relative of my
colleague Margaret Homans.

231
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,120
Uh, this, uh,

232
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,800
Miss Homans who sort of supplies most
of what's in the quotation there is not

233
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,430
Marianne Moore's father.
Uh,

234
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,440
so she's sort of borrowed words for
her father from a another source.

235
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,260
Uh,
and yet at the same time,

236
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:43,720
there's real poignant in
this expressive points. Uh,

237
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,510
more is, is, is telling us
something about her, her self.

238
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,510
She's being silent,
uh,

239
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,920
about the very early death
of her own father. Uh,

240
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,070
who was therefore in fact
a silent presence in her
life who told no stories to

241
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,220
her and said, no sings,
uh, who she couldn't.

242
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,390
In fact, quote in this manner, uh,

243
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,330
silence this short poem,
uh,

244
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:18,810
is it once a modernist poem that,
uh,

245
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,290
Elliot would have understood and admired,
uh,

246
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,870
and close to a 19th century
poems, uh, in its, um,

247
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,330
uh, ethical, uh, values and concerns.

248
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,080
Uh, it suggests too, I think
some of, uh, more is perhaps,

249
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,710
um, uh, ambivalent, uh,

250
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:44,690
certainly complex relationship to
her male peers. The topic that I, uh,

251
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,250
talked about last time with, um, um,

252
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,430
her poem a grave, uh, in
front of us, uh, which, uh,

253
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:56,010
it was connected to that
correspondence with pound.

254
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,770
I also mentioned a, her correspondence
with, with Hart Crane, uh,

255
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,050
uh, who, uh, um, um,

256
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,510
um, submitted his poems to
her in her role as editor, uh,

257
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,620
at the dial, uh, where she was in
fact in a very powerful position in,

258
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:20,340
in literary culture. Uh, and you know,

259
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:23,930
in certain ways, um, you
know, more had a kind of, um,

260
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,470
established authority and that
culture that crane never had. Uh,

261
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,150
here she had an important job
picking poems, editing, um, uh,

262
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:37,340
writing, uh, reviewing,
uh, and otherwise, um,

263
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,340
uh,

264
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,140
shaping the tastes a of American
readers through this important magazine,

265
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:48,090
the dial in yet at the same time more has,
um,

266
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,970
always has a kind of, um, uh,

267
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,740
marginal and a combative relation to,

268
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,020
uh, her, uh, major male peers, uh,

269
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,040
that is suggested in a grave and in her
irritation at the man who's blocking her

270
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:08,880
view. When you read, uh,

271
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,350
Elizabeth Bishop's memoir of
more, uh, Elizabeth Bishop,

272
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,360
uh, more as great protege, uh,

273
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,370
that, uh, really wonderful, um, uh,

274
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,480
a bit of both biography and autobiography,
uh,

275
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,550
that I asked you to read this, uh, for
this class called efforts of affection.

276
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,340
Uh, in there, you, you, you, you
see more interacting with the,

277
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,350
uh, male poets of her, uh, era, uh,

278
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:43,270
in interesting and comical ways.
Uh,

279
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,370
remember how some of them appear.
Uh,

280
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,660
bishop notes the presence of, of, um,

281
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:56,040
answer a pound in, um, the
Moore's apartment, uh, when,

282
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:00,360
uh, more notes that, uh, uh, uh,

283
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,280
pound had burned the
banister with his cigar. Uh,

284
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:10,260
you know, he had to keep a cigar out of
Mrs. Morris, uh, uh, apartment and, and,

285
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:13,710
uh, you know, this sort of flaming
Phallic object, uh, you know,

286
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:17,790
Burns the staircase. Uh, there's a,

287
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,350
uh,

288
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,180
bishop also tells about seeing a
Valentine that Tsl Elliot had written to,

289
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,630
um, uh, uh, Marianne Moore, you know,

290
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,700
pound with a cigar and Elliot
with his Valentine. Uh, and,

291
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:35,670
and then there's an account
of a reading, uh, where, uh,

292
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,710
bishop, uh, heard more read
with William Carlos Williams,

293
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,200
uh, who, uh, Williams did,

294
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,130
made loud and realistic sea monster wars.
Uh,

295
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,000
you know, all of these
are kind of comic, uh,

296
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,240
in yet suggestive symbolic, uh, uh,

297
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:01,030
representations of Phallic
power through display,

298
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,070
uh, uh, in position, condescension, etc.

299
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,080
All of which more seem to
manage to keep it arm's length,

300
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,460
uh, through, uh, her distinctive, uh,

301
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,600
life choices, which entailed
living with her mother, uh,

302
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,190
in a, in an apartment in the
village. And then in, uh,

303
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,690
uh, on Cumberland Street
in, in Brooklyn, um,

304
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,090
Moore's literary life, her
imagination was, was rooted in this,

305
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,990
uh,

306
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,990
domestic space that Bishop
describes a powerfully,

307
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,830
uh, in, in a minute,
Lee and in her memoir,

308
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,450
a domestic space that had
all sorts of eccentric, uh,

309
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,080
rituals in charms,
uh,

310
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,550
at specifically female centered a world,
uh,

311
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:02,080
where, uh, more could admit, uh,

312
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,610
men like pound, uh, but where
a mother and daughter, uh,

313
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,670
could lead their culture literary
lives a very much on their own terms,

314
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,710
uh, without any men to answer to, uh,

315
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,210
Moore's home, uh, evoked
in, in bishop's essay

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
is a version you could say a of the many
shelters that you find a or shells or

317
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:37,120
protective armor that you
encounter in Morris poems. She,

318
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:41,650
you know, she admires is always fascinated
by armored animals. Uh, and they're,

319
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,660
they're, they're the kinds of, um, uh,

320
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,700
protection they seem to carry with them.
Uh,

321
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,870
the Pangolin is, is, is
one, uh, example, uh,

322
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,980
poems are also for more, um, uh,

323
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,750
forms of shelter, I
would say, uh, there, uh,

324
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,790
spaces in which she could construct
a world or parts of a world,

325
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:09,970
again, very much on her own
terms according to her own rules,

326
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,870
uh, like her home. Uh,

327
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,420
her writing was made,
uh, safe, uh, habitable,

328
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,200
uh, strong, uh,

329
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,070
pleasurable by virtue of the
limitations that, uh, uh,

330
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,490
she imposed upon herself.
Uh,

331
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:35,491
this is connected powerfully to a more
ethical ideas and to her feminism,

332
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,890
uh, Bishop writes about, uh, more in,

333
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:46,210
in that efforts of
affection, uh, well, um,

334
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,020
often with, with, uh,

335
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,930
expressing ways in which she
bishop as a young writer,

336
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,300
a chafed under the,
uh,

337
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,340
curious rules and disciplines
of the more household. Uh,

338
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,690
and yet,
uh,

339
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,700
she seems to understand the
power that was in those, um,

340
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,840
uh, rules for more. Uh, and, and, uh,

341
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,720
bishop defends Moore's,
um,

342
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,310
feminism specifically against
the kinds of, uh, attacks, uh,

343
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,520
made on more or dismissals of more,
uh,

344
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:26,480
by specifically sort of 60s and 70s,
a feminism.

345
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,880
Uh, Bishop says, um, you know,

346
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:32,714
uh,

347
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,810
do they know that that is a
feminist? Critics have more, uh,

348
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,710
that she was a feminist in her day,
uh,

349
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,360
or that she paraded with the suffragettes.
Uh,

350
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,440
once Marianne told me she climbed a
lamppost in a demonstration for votes for

351
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:54,950
women, which she did up there, what speech
she delivered, if any. I don't know.

352
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,320
Uh, but climb, she did in long skirt
and petticoats and a large hat.

353
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,660
Uh, she, uh, uh, bishop, uh,

354
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:10,190
continues now that everything
can be said and done.

355
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,240
Have we anyone who can
compare with Marianne Moore,

356
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,540
who was at her best when she made up her
own rules and when they were strictest,

357
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,650
the reverse of freedom. Uh,
she puts that as a question,

358
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:28,230
but it's not really a question,
is it? Uh, she's, uh, really, uh,

359
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,520
making a strong defense of more and of
the ways in which more used rules and

360
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:38,480
disciplines to exercise a
certain kind of freedom,

361
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
uh, and certainly to, uh, uh,
obtain a certain kind of power, uh,

362
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,390
more has her own version
of that, uh, statement,

363
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,600
uh, in that, uh,

364
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,730
essay at the back of the
anthology called humility,

365
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,170
concentration and Gusto.
Gusto is the sort of,

366
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:05,420
uh, uh, virtue of, of uh, let's say, uh,

367
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,500
uh, energy, uh, that,

368
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:11,240
that more approves in writing and
art above all in certain ways.

369
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:14,000
And she says at the bottom of the page,
uh,

370
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,110
Gusto thrives on freedom and
freedom in art as in life,

371
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,440
in art and life are always
versions of each other.

372
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:26,441
From war is the result of a
discipline imposed by ourselves.

373
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,323
Uh,

374
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,440
freedom in art as in life as the result
of a discipline imposed by ourselves.

375
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,120
I've been talking today
so far, uh, about, well,

376
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,870
forms of self effacement or, um, uh,

377
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,800
a restraint that one finds,
let's say thematically, uh,

378
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:54,030
in, uh, more where she is, um, uh,

379
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,950
impersonal in herself presentation
where she, uh, quotes,

380
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,720
creates her own voice by
quoting others where she, um,

381
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,060
uh, seems to, uh, withhold a,

382
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,930
the first person, uh, in,
in, uh, multiple ways,

383
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,220
the most obvious and, and, and vivid, uh,

384
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:21,990
and visible a form of the rules
that she sets herself is of course,

385
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,310
the way these poems look.
Uh,

386
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,920
an octopus and silence are very unusual.
Poems from where, because they are free.

387
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,840
Verse Poems, uh, by and large,

388
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:35,100
more Moore's poems are always,
uh,

389
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:39,960
organized into these complex
syllable counts, uh, and,

390
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:44,250
and the crazy patterns
that they, uh, produce, uh,

391
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:48,640
such as in, well, let's say,
uh, uh, just to look at the,

392
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,670
the steeple Jack or the
Pangolin on four 47, four 49,

393
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,440
um, or, um, uh, the paper Nautilus,
which I'll talk about in a moment.

394
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,490
Uh,

395
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,840
poems that have intricate
visual patterns on the page.

396
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,070
Um, they are, uh,

397
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:13,071
examples and instances of more making
a Peruvian rules in finding freedom in

398
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,030
them.
Uh,

399
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,770
they are also images of what she calls
in an octopus neatness of finish.

400
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,750
You could say they, they, they
present the poems as highly crafted,

401
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,920
almost a, not just visual,
but almost tactile objects.

402
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,830
Um, uh, ecstasy affords the, uh,

403
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:42,600
occasion, uh, expediency
determines the form. Uh,

404
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,800
she, uh, said about her
poems. Um, uh, again,

405
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,780
referring to those two different moments
of composition that she mentions in her

406
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:55,470
letter to pound that I talked
about last time, where, uh,

407
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,060
poems seem to come in a
kind of, uh, uh, Vadric, uh,

408
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:02,610
inspiration,
producing a certain pattern,

409
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:06,780
which then she determines quite
consciously to reproduce an extent.

410
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,900
Uh, the, uh, well let's, let's
look at the, the fish for a moment.

411
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,900
It's one of the most intricate and
distinctive and strangest on four 36.

412
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,290
And wait a minute. Whoa.
She's rhyming. Uh, the,

413
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:29,300
this is actually a rhymed poem to a
something you might not immediately here,

414
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,380
but yeah,
but look at it.

415
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:36,330
The fish wade through black
jade or an injured fan.

416
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,960
This is, this is really adding, um, uh,

417
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,780
an extra twist of the rules,
uh,

418
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,530
making the challenge of
writing that much harder. Uh,

419
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,880
and in so doing,

420
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:53,881
you might say to quote an octopus ex
expressing the love of doing hard things.

421
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,730
Um, more, uh, you
remember, remember pound,

422
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,340
uh,
his idea of the image.

423
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:08,170
He wanted to give you direct
presentation of the thing. Uh,

424
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,990
w what do they think about this?
Uh, hear you. You've got, um, uh,

425
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,300
poems that are so conspicuously
artificial that that stress, uh,

426
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,340
kind of discontinuity between form and
content that really present themselves as

427
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:25,880
arbitrary and constructed,
uh,

428
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,710
rather than given an necessary,
uh,

429
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,010
in this way more is, is, uh,

430
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,460
calling attention formally to the
contingency of all her statements and

431
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,210
utterances.
Uh,

432
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,360
she's also a calling attention to well,

433
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:48,040
to the fact that these are made objects,
uh,

434
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:52,000
and that they are the record
of their making their,

435
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,460
the record of a motive,

436
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,620
what I called the love of doing
hard things or, uh, which,

437
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,330
uh, more, uh,

438
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,960
just as often might
refer to simply as love.

439
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,000
Um, let me, uh,

440
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,943
uh,

441
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,960
point us to a couple other more poems,
um,

442
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,150
to a snail. For example, on four 46,

443
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,300
um, a, a, another short,

444
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,930
free verse poem,
uh,

445
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,950
in the written in the two or three year
period where she wrote Free Verse Poems

446
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,360
Around 1924,
uh,

447
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,330
if compression is the
first grace of style,

448
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:45,030
you snail habit, uh, Eh,

449
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,950
compression contractility,
uh,

450
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,530
these are virtues as modesty,
uh,

451
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,350
is a virtue in their forms of modesty.

452
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:59,590
What we value in writing in style is
the principle that has hit a kind of

453
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:04,260
animating motive, uh, that
informs what we have, uh, what,

454
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,650
what's there before us,

455
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,800
but which is necessarily
in some sense a silent, um,

456
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,890
uh, expressed through
restraint, uh, as it were, uh,

457
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,410
a compressed style such
as more as, uh, uh,

458
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,760
seems to compress and contain,
uh,

459
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,070
an important human motive.
Uh,

460
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,060
another poem about

461
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,730
the aesthetics of style, uh, that again

462
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,010
moves between principals and
art and principles in life. Uh,

463
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,400
is the poem in your Ras Packet
called when I buy pictures,

464
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,150
uh,
in which more says,

465
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,970
and then she gives a number
of different, uh, examples,

466
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,430
uh, further down, she starts
to generalize again. She says,

467
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,550
the shelters, the objects,
the artworks that more fines,

468
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:10,970
exemplary, uh, that she
wants to care about,

469
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,860
that she wants us to care about and
that she wants her poems to exemplify,

470
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,190
uh,
would be forms of acknowledgement.

471
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,190
Acknowledging the spiritual forces
that have brought them into being the

472
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:26,870
principles that are hit in them,

473
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,140
those forces about which they are
ultimately and can only ever be ultimately

474
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,910
silent.
Um,

475
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,013
the,
uh,

476
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,580
those spiritual forces, they, uh,
uh, they have a kind of energy,

477
00:33:46,581 --> 00:33:51,581
they have light lit by piercing
glances into the life of things that,

478
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:58,430
that life of things. That phrase
that's Wordsworthian, uh, uh,

479
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:01,820
rich simple phrase.
Uh,

480
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:06,320
she means by it,
the life of things,

481
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,890
those things that have life and
that sense are not merely things,

482
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,090
uh, but creations that are infused
with, with creative force, uh,

483
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:22,540
artworks for more like God's
creation, uh, carry a, uh,

484
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:26,480
kind of burden of acknowledgement to,
uh,

485
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,110
uh,
give us access to an honor,

486
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,820
the forces that bring them into being,
uh,

487
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,020
the, the, uh,

488
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,120
really great poem I think on this theme
is the paper Nautilus. And let me,

489
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,590
uh, and our, uh,

490
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,740
contemplation of more
with this pump on four 51,

491
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,890
um,
it suggests a,

492
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:57,891
a way to understand the specifically
female artists that Moore is,

493
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,340
uh, is a, um,

494
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,240
it's a kind of shell
left behind, uh, that,

495
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,220
uh, protects the eggs of,
uh, the, uh, sea animal. Uh,

496
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:18,410
the, uh, the paper Nautilus. Uh, it's a,

497
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:23,030
it's a beautiful object. And, and I,
I wish I had, uh, the images of it to,

498
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,350
uh,
show you.

499
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,030
She begins in this first stanza,

500
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,410
maybe a little confusingly, uh, by saying,

501
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,410
in other words,
uh,

502
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,920
why does paper Nautilus
Make It's beautiful art?

503
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:41,940
That is its shell.

504
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,380
Does it do so for celebrity money?

505
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,700
Uh, uh, uh, tea time fame.

506
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,760
The Comfort of commuters? No, no. None
of these things. None of these, uh,

507
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,450
potential, uh, and base
motives for making art.

508
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,700
No. Uh, the paper Nautilus
Shell is something else.

509
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,440
The shell is first of all made not
for popular or genteel reasons.

510
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,910
Uh, it is, uh, specifically
a perishable because all art,

511
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,650
everything we make is perishable.
It is a perishable souvenir of hope.

512
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,820
It's,
it's such a beautiful phrase,

513
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,960
souvenir of hope. Uh, it is, uh,

514
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
a memory of our desire and wish
an aspiration for a future.

515
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,790
This is what the shell holes and contains.

516
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,860
It's not immortal. It's material.
It's delicate, imperishable.

517
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,350
It carries a memory of desire,

518
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:54,470
of hope that strives towards the future
in of a belief in the worthiness of

519
00:36:55,441 --> 00:37:00,270
striving. It exemplifies the
love of doing hard things.

520
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,520
Carries this into the future.
Uh, the shell is maternal,

521
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,340
uh, or the sign of the
maternal, let's say,

522
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,170
rather it is a kind of
shelter for the future.

523
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,540
Uh, it carries hope, uh, in the
specific form of the creatures. Eggs.

524
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,030
Uh, this is, uh, this
is, you could say is a,

525
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:26,970
is a kind of revision of the earlier image
of female power is a volcanic, again,

526
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:31,920
there's something inside, uh,
of, of uh, great power, uh,

527
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,420
but it's another way of rendering
or imaging, uh, this power.

528
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,310
Uh, and, and you know, interestingly,
this creature like the,

529
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:46,050
the mountain, uh, is an octopus, uh,

530
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,970
viewed as,
as,

531
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:52,740
as if it were a poem or as a kind
of version of what a poem is.

532
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,850
You could say that the shell more
is writing about like a more palm,

533
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,320
a gets birth to

534
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,840
images of heroic action in her
poems are full of heroic characters.

535
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Uh, some human, some many more animal, uh,

536
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,421
all of whom in,

537
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:19,170
in certain ways like Hercules
here are hindered to succeed. Uh,

538
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:23,370
and that's a wonderful and an
interesting phrase, hindered to succeed.

539
00:38:23,371 --> 00:38:26,850
I think it means, uh, hindered, uh,

540
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,180
hindered to succeed in the sense
of held back or restrained,

541
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,410
but when something is, uh,
restrained in such a way,

542
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:38,800
it is restrained in order that it succeed,
uh,

543
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,940
hindered to succeed in that sense. Uh, uh,

544
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,430
restrained in order to succeed.

545
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:48,460
To overcome it's hindrance
to overcome itself,

546
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:53,260
self imposed rules and
guidelines or stands a forms, uh,

547
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:57,190
in order to, uh, produce the, um,

548
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,560
the future that it dreams of,
uh, ultimately those eggs,

549
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:07,510
they freed themselves and free
the shell at the same time. Uh,

550
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,650
the shell, uh, in its freedom,
uh, is, is a model of,

551
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,470
of the poem as a kind of
autonomous object. A thing
stands on its own impersonal,

552
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,490
uh, uh, taken away and
apart from the maker, uh,

553
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,260
it is strong and it's delicate.

554
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,540
It acknowledges and points
to the spiritual forces
that made it or illuminated

555
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:32,350
it.
Uh,

556
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,620
the paper Nautilus is actively revising
the famous poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes

557
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:43,310
that I've given you a copy of the
chambered Nautilus, uh, which, uh,

558
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,340
celebrates, um, the maker. You could say,

559
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,960
uh, uh, the, uh, and the, the energy
of the maker that, that, that,

560
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:57,430
that moves on to, uh, uh, it's
ever a more beautiful mansions,

561
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,680
uh,
more celebrates rather the made object,

562
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,500
uh, because it refers us back
to the process of making,

563
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,230
which is not a process of we'll only
a but a process in which the will is

564
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:18,670
hindered or restrained in which
aspiration meets resistance.

565
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:25,420
Look at the, the final lines of
the poem there. Very beautiful.

566
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,110
Uh, the shell is described as being a, uh,

567
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,460
having wasp nests,
flaws of white on white

568
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,200
and clothes laid ionic Khaitan folds.

569
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,801
And there,
you know,

570
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:46,330
she's seeing the white shell
as if it were a Greek marble

571
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:52,830
and it puts her in mind of the Elgin
marbles that decorated the Parthenon.

572
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:00,010
The shell is ultimately
compared to the, uh, a horse,

573
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,620
uh, which, um,

574
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,490
has lost its writer whose
arms no longer, uh, uh,

575
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,380
Gore around it and, and,
and restrain it. Uh, the,

576
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,700
the, uh, uh,

577
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:18,120
well there's an analogy between the
Horse in an implied absent writer

578
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,130
and the shell in the creature
that was once inside it.

579
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,470
And the poem in the poet who wrote it,
uh,

580
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,490
hope, uh, here at the end of the
poem is renamed love, uh, uh,

581
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,060
force, uh, imaged again
through a kind of silence,

582
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:41,420
through its absence or rather,
uh,

583
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,070
through the traces that of its continuing
presence, which are the, uh, uh,

584
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,390
traces that we see in the
strength and beauty of the object.

585
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,930
Uh,
which is,

586
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:57,410
I think ultimately the difference
between silence and restraint

587
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,580
that is
a

588
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:05,430
love is present in the palm.
It's not merely silent, uh,

589
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:09,660
it's present through it's
restrained expression,

590
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,390
uh, in what remains in
the poem in the Shell, uh,

591
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,710
in the Parthenon.
Horse is a,

592
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:20,360
is a kind of acknowledgement
of the spiritual forces. Yeah.

593
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,353
That

594
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,940
brought these objects into being,

595
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,553
well,

596
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:36,950
we will go on and talk about Morris,

597
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,140
great peer while a Stevens next week.
