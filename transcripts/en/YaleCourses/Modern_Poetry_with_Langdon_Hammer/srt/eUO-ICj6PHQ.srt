1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,400
Talking about pounding and the Cantos
last week I was talking about translation

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,720
a lot. Uh, in the case of Elliot, uh,

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,730
I'll be talking about quotation,

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,800
a related but different practice.
Uh,

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,880
and one that we'll see
again, uh, in Marianne Moore,

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,630
uh,
impounds case,

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,350
there is,
uh,

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,590
a wish in poetry for immediacy for some
kind of seemingly natural language.

9
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,090
Pound doesn't want and doesn't use
quotation marks just as he doesn't use

10
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,520
footnotes. If you, um, if you
look at pound in any of the,

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,360
uh, additions of his
work from the Cantos, uh,

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,120
uh, backward, you will find that

13
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,210
the high, uh, uh,

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,970
you will find that the, uh, uh,

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,920
the poems are presented without notes,
without any kind of apparatus,

16
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:30,810
without any kind of help.
Uh, that's because I think,

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,973
um,

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,300
pound once to in some
sense give you a kind of,

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,390
he doesn't want to get
in your way in any sense.

20
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,080
He wants you to have a kind of immediate
experience of the writing that he's, uh,

21
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,740
uh, presenting, uh, even, uh, uh,

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,750
when it comes in the form of quotation.
Uh,

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,890
but as I suggested a for,
for Pan,

24
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:57,870
that sort of central practice,
uh, is one of, uh, translation,

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,180
which he also describes
as transmitting the,

26
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,130
the impulse. Uh, I and I, I spoke, uh,

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,060
last time as if the impulse meant,
uh,

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,050
the motive or the emotion, uh, in, uh,

29
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,100
a piece of writing.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,900
I think that pound also had a kind of
scientific or technical sense of that,

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,470
that process of transmitting the impulse,
uh,

32
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:30,060
and that what he wants
to do is, uh, carry,

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,100
uh, you want, he wants
writing to carry energy. Uh,

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,640
he wants it to carry a kind of pulse,
uh,

35
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,770
and he wants to give you a
kind of direct access to this.

36
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,070
Uh, the, uh, contrast
with Elliot is a striking,

37
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,640
I think, uh, instead of, uh, translation,

38
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:54,780
you find an Elliot more often quotation,

39
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,590
quotation, um, uh,

40
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,990
which implies a certain
relation to the literary past,

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,020
just as pounds practices of translation
imply in relation to tradition.

42
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,110
I think about the difference
between these, these forums,

43
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,450
translation and quotation.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,660
It's a way to understand the differences
between Elliot and pound, uh,

45
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,470
and through them, uh, to
think about modern Po,

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,990
at least two of modern poetry is possible.

47
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,770
Relations to the literature of the past.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,220
Remember too, that modern
poetry, uh, and that's,

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,840
that's a word or a phrase
that Elliot and Pam both used,

50
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,480
that modern poetry is a
specifically historical category.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,480
Uh, it's, you know, it's a historical
way of naming what it is. A,

52
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,360
you could contrast this with
the, uh, romantic poetry, say,

53
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,510
um, or images him. Um, yeah,

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,630
which are names or labels that identify,

55
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,890
um, a Oh, uh, uh, something more like, um,

56
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,520
a, an aesthetic project or a, a, a, um,

57
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,850
uh, uh, a tendency, uh, here, uh,

58
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,900
to call a modern poetry modern is
to choose as it's defining quality,

59
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,820
uh,
its position in history.

60
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,110
It's a place, uh, in literary history

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,683
and it does

62
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,390
place modern poetry in history.
Ambiguously

63
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,120
is modern poetry is, it
is, it's modernness, uh,

64
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,390
an index of,
um,

65
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,960
the way it extends the past or

66
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,960
is it rather modern because
it breaks with the past?

67
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,760
Does modern mean some kind of
renewal and continuity? Uh,

68
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,510
or more does it, uh, does it mean rupture

69
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,420
a translation in quotation
suggest? Uh, well, as I say,

70
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:21,421
different relations to the
past pound aims to make it new,

71
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,180
uh, itself. I suggested a
translated phrase from the,

72
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,570
the ancient Chinese
pound.

73
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,120
In doing this aims to carry
culture forward, uh, to, uh,

74
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:41,710
you know, handed over to us as a kind
of, uh, living in immediate thing.

75
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,300
Uh, the past is, is
renewable, uh, in translation.

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,440
It is a communicable that
that's part of the premise of,

77
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,470
of translation. Um, for pound.

78
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:56,720
The past is something that
can be reembody lead, uh,

79
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,950
continually a needs to be reembody.

80
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:03,951
We'd continually over and over
again in new forms in this sense,

81
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,700
uh, translation envisions
a past that is metamorphic,

82
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,050
uh, and, and mobile, uh, and
durable. Uh, it, you know,

83
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,420
it's something that is always
essentially itself. Uh,

84
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,050
it's something that you know, is capable
of being carried forward. Uh, and,

85
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,370
and you can, you'd think about
pounds, um, voyagers who's seafarers,

86
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,320
a deceased or the seafarer
poet, uh, as being, um,

87
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,810
well agents or, or, uh, uh,

88
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,130
representatives of acts of
translation they embody.

89
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,960
Um, uh, the action of
carrying something across,

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,450
journeying in quotation, however,

91
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,890
uh,
the past is something to be preserved,

92
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,970
which is different, uh, preserved, uh,

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,580
or maybe mocked,
uh,

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
in the sense of mocked in the
sense of copied or parodied

95
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,370
quotation seems to imply to
possible relations to the past.

96
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,510
When you think about it,
deference to the past,

97
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,550
deference to what has been said
or some kind of violation of it,

98
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,530
uh, when you quote someone, uh,

99
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,230
especially maybe your
parents or a teacher, uh,

100
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,910
well, what are you doing? Uh,
probably, uh, you mean, uh,

101
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,800
either to honor them, uh, or to mock them,

102
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,000
right. Uh, to, uh, uh, uh,

103
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,460
in a sense,

104
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,740
defer to their authority or to
take it away, to empty it out.

105
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,240
Both of these are our possible, uh, uh,

106
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,030
empty it out by parroting it,
uh,

107
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,890
treating it as if it were
merely iterable and formulaic.

108
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,820
Uh, and therefore, uh,
without substance, uh,

109
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Elliot quotations,
uh,

110
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,910
teeter a ambiguously a
between these two options.

111
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,000
And sometimes you may feel he's doing
the one thing and sometimes you may feel

112
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:27,500
he's doing the other,
that is somehow deferring to the past.

113
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,730
And honoring it,
or he's doing something quite subversive,

114
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,730
uh, something periodic,
uh, and, and in pound,

115
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,310
I don't think there's any
of that ambiguity ever. Uh,

116
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,800
it's a very striking a contrast.

117
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,740
If you listen to a pound online, uh, you,

118
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:51,240
you hear a voice, uh,
that is a fierce, uh,

119
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,950
in melodramatic, uh,
and, um, uh, in earnest,

120
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,710
uh, you listened to Elliot, you, you
hear another voice, uh, entirely, uh,

121
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:06,711
one dry diffident hard to place tonally.

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,150
Uh, this has all worked
into the poetry, uh,

123
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:17,150
in our encounters with it on the page.
Um,

124
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,413
again,

125
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,950
you might contrast the heroic
figures that you meet in pound,

126
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,270
uh, whether they're Odysseus or, um, uh,

127
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,940
troubadour poet, um, or, um,

128
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,070
one of the political leaders
that pound a fastens on.

129
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,270
These are men of will
and willpower and action.

130
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,310
These are the people that attract
pounds, admiration, and imagination.

131
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,530
Who Do you meet in
Elliot j Alfred Prufrock,

132
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,010
uh, this figure of, uh,

133
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,480
extraordinary in
decisiveness. Uh, and, uh,

134
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,010
um, uh, indeterminate will, uh,

135
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,640
someone who's diffident. Um, well,

136
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,040
Prufrock is surely aversion
of Elliot, uh, and, and,

137
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:14,550
uh,

138
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,550
we encounter in Elliot generally
some of the problems that Prufrock,

139
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,450
uh, raises for us, um,
through his, um, uh,

140
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,930
meandering, uh, mode of speech, uh,

141
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:31,380
and difficult to place tone.

142
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,990
Let's, um, let's look at
some pictures of Elliot. Um,

143
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,290
maybe my favorite one,
uh,

144
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,510
especially since we're going
to be thinking about and
talking about a Elliot's

145
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,930
age, uh, in how he, how he
projects himself. This is, uh,

146
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,660
this is Tom at eight. Uh, he,

147
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,710
he was born in Saint Louis,

148
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,290
the only major British poet
born in Saint Louis. Uh,

149
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,820
in 1888, uh, he went to Harvard. Um,

150
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,130
uh, this was a, uh,
uh, not a surprise, uh,

151
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,910
and a, a and a sense
of family mission. Um,

152
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,700
uh, he spent his summers, uh,
importantly in Massachusetts, uh,

153
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,590
and on the coast of
Massachusetts, the, uh,

154
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,660
north shore of Boston and these
places return and recur in his poetry,

155
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,070
uh, as a graduate student at Harvard. Uh,

156
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,620
in 1910,

157
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,720
he IX patriated to, uh, Europe.

158
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,270
Let's, this is Elliot. In 1910,

159
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:54,970
1911, he's, he had studied

160
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,720
philosophy at Harvard.
Um,

161
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,840
and he went on to study philosophy
at Cambridge with Bertrand Russell a.

162
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,060
He wrote his master's
thesis on Fh Bradley. Uh,

163
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,330
that's an association I'll say more
about when we get to the wasteland.

164
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,330
Uh,
in 1915,

165
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,610
he met and married Vivian. Hey, would,

166
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,980
uh,
a,

167
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,470
a charismatic and volatile English woman.

168
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,010
Uh,

169
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,010
this romance produced for Elliot kind of
dramatic conflict with his family over

170
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,020
his wish to marry her, uh, his, uh,

171
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,570
wish to take up residence in,
in England.

172
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,530
And, uh, behind all of
this and with all of this,

173
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,890
his sense of vocation is desire to become,

174
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,220
to establish himself as a poet and man
of letters rather than the more easily to

175
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:02,620
be approved. Uh, career of
a professor and scholar,

176
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:02,950
uh,

177
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,950
that he had seemed to have been
made for a pound was a Elliot's,

178
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,810
uh, older friend and mentor.
Uh, very quickly, uh,

179
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:14,760
upon there,

180
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,630
a meeting in Europe and pound,
uh,

181
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:24,100
always putting his fingers
in everything, uh, wrote, uh,

182
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,150
quite an extraordinary letter
to Elliot's father. Uh,

183
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,690
and I've got that on the, uh,
your handout in the top page,

184
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,450
a little quotation from it. Uh, it says,

185
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,390
it says a lot about pounds and
says something about Elliot to, uh,

186
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,580
this is, uh, a letter in which, um, uh,

187
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,290
pound felt the need to probably
with some encouragement,

188
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,690
but probably also some embarrassment,
uh,

189
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,220
from Elliott felt the need to,
um,

190
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,580
defend Elliot's, uh, expatriation, uh,

191
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:02,581
to the family patriarch and a pound says
as to his Elliot's coming to London.

192
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,380
Well, anything else is a
waste of time and energy.

193
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,870
No one in London cares a hang
what is written in America, uh,

194
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,500
after getting an American audience
and man has to begin all over again.

195
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,710
If he plans for an international
hearing and who wouldn't plan for an

196
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,260
international hearing? Uh, he,

197
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:25,720
he even begins at a disadvantage.

198
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:30,580
London likes discovering her own gods.
Again,

199
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,170
in alliterate career,
mediocrity is worse than useless either.

200
00:14:35,171 --> 00:14:40,000
A man goes into go the whole hog,
uh,

201
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,870
or he had better take to selling
soap and gents furnishings. You can,

202
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,180
is this the right way to write Mr
Elliot? I don't know. He must've felt so,

203
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,650
uh, the situation has been very
well summed up in the sentence.

204
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,790
Henry James stayed in Paris and
red [inaudible] and flo bear.

205
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,990
Mr Howell's returned to
America and read Henry James

206
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,670
and then, and then, uh, he, he
says in the, in another, uh,

207
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,430
important sentence,

208
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,230
a literary man's income depends very
much and how rigidly he insists on doing

209
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:19,520
exactly what he himself wants to do.
It's interesting,

210
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,230
uh,

211
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,230
the idea is that by establishing
some kind of independence from,

212
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,550
uh,
tastes in a literary market,

213
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,260
Elliot will in fact

214
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,820
come to establish his position in that
literary market and his ability in fact,

215
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,660
to create taste. Uh, and,
and so in fact, he did

216
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,000
a, at this early point in Elliot's
career, there is a kind of, um,

217
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,180
important conflict between
conformity and revolt,

218
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,710
a conformity, uh, to, uh,

219
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,130
his parents wishes social
expectations were revolt from them.

220
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,320
Uh,
which is also,

221
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:11,321
I think another way to
describe the tension between
two different senses or were

222
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,150
aspects of quotation.

223
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,030
A pound wants Elliot's father to
see that his son's revolt is okay.

224
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,770
Uh, because in fact, he's
also going to conform.

225
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,950
He's going to conform to a certain ideal
of tradition to professional standards.

226
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,460
Uh, he's going to, um, uh,

227
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,090
he's not just going to have a wild time.
Uh,

228
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:42,680
he's going to work hard, uh,
and, and do what a literary man,

229
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,590
uh, should do a Elliot,
uh, you'll see, uh,

230
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,270
takes up these themes in different terms,

231
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,070
but a related ways in tradition,
in the individual talent,

232
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:59,500
which I'll talk about
later. Uh, like pound, uh,

233
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,830
Elliot we'll see,
wants to ally himself with tradition.

234
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,890
I wants to ally himself with tradition
over against their Lieber, uh,

235
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,030
Amy lol and Amy Chism, uh, and uh,

236
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:18,320
at the same time, um, his
relation to tradition,

237
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,240
even from very early on

238
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:27,370
what's potentially subversive and his
poetry was very new and disturbing.

239
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,250
Now, there are all sorts of interesting
things and buying a key, uh, including

240
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,900
here. Here he is again,
the offer of proof fraud,

241
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,840
including PSLE.
It's waistcoat

242
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,810
hds death mask. I showed you last
time. Here's, here's the, uh,

243
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,500
Elliot's waistcoat. Um, I
like this, uh, as an object,

244
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,630
uh, as, as part of, um,
uh, the literary archive.

245
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,750
We have, uh, also, uh,

246
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,680
well it's interesting, isn't it? It's a,

247
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,620
it's a piece of Elliot's costume.

248
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,410
Costume was very important for Tsla.

249
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:20,130
I think it's also a potentially a kind
of emblem of quotation in his work,

250
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,183
uh,

251
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,340
is Elliot taking on the past and the or
of propriety in order to parody it or

252
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,670
empower himself. Uh, these are,

253
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:40,170
these are questions we might ask
even about the waistcoat. Uh,

254
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,650
is it, uh, is it some kind
of disguise? Is it, uh,

255
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,970
uh, is it, um, uh, a, um,

256
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,990
costume through which he, um, uh,

257
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,340
conforms to social forms and expectations?
Uh,

258
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,120
or is it again,
something he puts on?

259
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Uh, all of these questions
are at, uh, for me,

260
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:09,530
the center of Elliot's interest
in, in, in power, uh, and,

261
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,780
and also I think,
uh,

262
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,870
some of the lasting power
that he, uh, exerts,

263
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,790
um, uh, in schools, uh, and for students.

264
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,100
I will,
um,

265
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,680
I will confess that my high school
yearbook carries a quotation from Tsl,

266
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:31,770
yet in fact, from the love song of j
Alfred Prufrock, which I won't, uh,

267
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:36,300
identify for you. Uh, and
as I think about that,

268
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,830
why I cared about Elliot,
uh, when I was 17 or so,

269
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,110
um, I mean, not that I
don't now to, uh, uh,

270
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:48,770
when I think about that,
it seems to me that I'm,

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
his special combination of
ambition and aggression,

272
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:02,010
uh, expressed as it is
very often by young people,

273
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,150
uh,

274
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:08,150
through parody or satire or diffidence
was powerful for me too as a young

275
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:13,110
person. Uh, all of this is,

276
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,110
is I'm on display in,

277
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:20,250
in Elliot's great poem,

278
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:24,540
the love Song of J. Dot. Alfred Prufrock
or just what I'll concentrate on today.

279
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,930
Um,
um,

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,730
Prufrock is, uh, a poem

281
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,470
composed, uh, initially at Harvard

282
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,940
and carried with something Elliot
carried along with him, uh,

283
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,370
in the years, uh, after, uh,

284
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,490
a poem created out of
pages and pages of drafts,

285
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,590
which Elliot kept adding to
a and going back over and,

286
00:20:56,591 --> 00:21:01,591
and recombining and recomposing them
somewhat like his repetitive and wayward

287
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,370
speaker. Uh, you, you, you can find, um,

288
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,730
uh, early versions of
the poem, uh, in, um, uh,

289
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,160
a book of, uh, uh,
Elliot's, uh, uh, early, uh,

290
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:23,161
and otherwise on collected work that
Christopher ricks edited a few years ago

291
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,350
called the inventions of the march
hare. It's a very interesting book. Uh,

292
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,710
and you can see Elliot,
uh,

293
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,580
exploring different ways
to write this poem, uh,

294
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,400
which hung around for a long time.
Uh,

295
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,430
it was eventually published
in 1915 in poetry magazine,

296
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,000
uh, and in this way, just like mowing a,

297
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:50,200
just like a Yates is the fishermen,
uh, which also appeared there. Then,

298
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,630
uh, also, uh, a poem we'll get to in
a couple of weeks, Marianne Morris,

299
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,370
a grave, uh, and, and some of the
images, pumps we discussed last week.

300
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:04,720
All of these, uh, appearing thanks
to pound, uh, in poetry magazine.

301
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,820
Uh, the poem became the title
of Elliot's first volume.

302
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,310
Uh, interestingly, this is
the cover of the book. Um,

303
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,170
uh, it leaves off or the, um, uh,

304
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,120
it leaves off the full title,

305
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,870
which was Prufrock and other observations,

306
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,670
uh, which is an interesting title. Uh,

307
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,600
first of all is Prufrock
and observation. Uh, that's,

308
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,250
Elliot was treating this character
as if he were an observation.

309
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,920
You could think about
what that might imply. Uh,

310
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,520
and then think about that
word observations. Uh,

311
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,540
it suggests something seen of course,
as well as some kind of a speculation.

312
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,600
Um, uh, it's also, um, uh,

313
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,440
a way of defining and
presenting Elliot's pumps.

314
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:01,150
He doesn't say Prufrock and other poems
he says Prufrock and other observations,

315
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,190
uh, in, in observations
is in fact, uh, then, uh,

316
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,480
a word that,

317
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,070
that Marianne Moore would use to title
her first book of poems a few years later.

318
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,400
Uh, on that cover, uh,

319
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,430
we see Elliott's name and Prufrock's,
uh,

320
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,880
in some kind of a alteration,
uh,

321
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,680
alternation rather, uh, Prufrock being
a little bit bigger than TSL yet.

322
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,820
Uh,

323
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,820
but I'm raising for us
graphically the simple question,

324
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,730
what is the relationship
between these two? Uh,

325
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,110
uh, are they, uh, yeah, uh,

326
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,060
the one man created the
other thing, uh, Prufrock uh,

327
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,050
are they the same thing?
How different are they? Uh,

328
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,820
here, um, uh, the, uh, uh,

329
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,380
interior of the book. Uh, you can
see, although, well you can't see,

330
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:08,330
but if you get a better look at this
online, you will see, uh, that this book,

331
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:13,130
which is in buying a key, uh, it
has a signature on it. Wu Steven's,

332
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,830
uh, and why? Uh, October 17th, 1917.

333
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,190
So this is, this was Stephen's copy, uh,

334
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:26,630
at which he as he was a young man
wandering around the streets of New York,

335
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,430
uh, picked up, uh, and, and kept. Um,

336
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,140
it was, uh, like a frosts early, uh,

337
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,330
work published in London in 1917 now,

338
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,700
um, in, in Bloomsbury by
the egoist pressed. Uh,

339
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:50,630
and there's the table of
contents. Um, the, uh,

340
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,470
first and long poem,
uh,

341
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,430
included in the volume being the
love song of j Alfred Prufrock.

342
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,153
Well,

343
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,420
what do we expect from a poem that
calls itself that the love Song of J.

344
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,170
Dot. Alfred Prufrock. Uh, first of
all, what do we expect from this genre?

345
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,910
The love Song, a love song. What is a
love song? What is it love song? Like,

346
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,050
presumably it would be a romantic poem.
Uh,

347
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,090
even a poem about romance. Uh, uh,

348
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,480
what we get is perhaps something more
like a parody of a romantic palm,

349
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,820
uh, and something much stranger.

350
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,530
Uh, this is going to be
familiar to very many of you.

351
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,500
Let us go.
Then you and I,

352
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,960
when the evening is spread out
against the sky, like a patient,

353
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,550
he theorized upon a table,

354
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,410
let us go through certain
half deserted streets,

355
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,130
the muttering retreats of restless nights
and one night cheap hotels and sought

356
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,750
us restaurants with oyster shells,

357
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,500
streets that follow like a
tedious argument of insidious
intent to lead you to

358
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:17,330
an overwhelming question. Oh, do not ask,

359
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:20,900
what is it?
Let us go and make our visit

360
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,160
in the room. The women come
and go. Talking of Michelangelo

361
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,360
cool
meter.

362
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:34,923
Uh,

363
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,670
it's a topic we've, we've
raised before. It isn't,

364
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,420
uh, I am the pentameter. Um, the, uh,

365
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:50,160
it's notably importantly
not I ambit pentameter. Uh,

366
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,820
instead,
uh,

367
00:26:51,821 --> 00:26:55,830
you are introduced to another
kind of rhythm of speech,

368
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,830
which you can work at to scan a,

369
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:02,640
but without even going
into any detail about it,

370
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,190
I think we can describe
that rhythm is Languid, uh,

371
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,180
as open to variation, uh, as,

372
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,043
um,

373
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,800
including hesitancy and
sometimes abruptness.

374
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,120
Uh, it is, uh,

375
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:27,690
a way of speaking that
is interrupted often,

376
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,910
uh, is, uh, alternately, um, uh,

377
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,590
voluble, uh, and nervous, uh,

378
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,760
the, um, uh, the poems,

379
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,480
initial disc continuity's of rhythm
and pattern and image introduce us to,

380
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,473
um,

381
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,800
really a new kind of structure
in poetry that would include,

382
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,790
um, well, uh, kind of, um,

383
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:08,610
uh, almost, uh, almost a principle
that anytime you establish a pattern,

384
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,170
you must quickly break it.
Uh, let us go. Then you and I,

385
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,680
when the evening is spread
out against the sky,

386
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,720
sounds like this character is going to
speak in couplets like a patient ether

387
00:28:25,131 --> 00:28:29,880
rised upon a table. Where
did that come from? Uh,

388
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:35,700
uh, let us, you know, we could
supply another third line. Uh, uh,

389
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,220
uh, uh, that would be a
very different, I think, um,

390
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:44,340
immediately we are invited to, um, well,

391
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,160
uh, realistically conjure, um,

392
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,280
a prone, uh, patient, um,

393
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,000
uh, someone, uh, someone sick, uh,

394
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:02,870
and being attended to and ether
rised unconscious, uh, uh,

395
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,560
an objectified, uh, uh,
upon a table. Uh, if,

396
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,560
if, um, we felt as though
we were going to be in, um,

397
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,320
a romantic crepuscular atmosphere,
uh,

398
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,850
we are suddenly confronted
with an image quite disturbing,

399
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,000
uh, and ugly and note
that it doesn't rhyme. Uh,

400
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,320
there,
I suppose you could,

401
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,090
you could connect table to
hotels and shells below. Um,

402
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,800
but, uh, it's not, uh, a
strong connection and, um,

403
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,510
there has been, uh, no, um,
uh, preparation for it before.

404
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:48,450
Uh, so immediately we are
given an image, uh, and, uh,

405
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,220
a rhyme decision if you like,
uh,

406
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,230
that complicates any kind of sense of
a pattern that we might have predicted

407
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,510
from the first two lines. That rhythm. Um,

408
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,960
well, um, uh,

409
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,700
the contrast to a Nim big poem, uh, is,

410
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,770
is strong and should be emphasized.

411
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:16,330
And I want to draw your
attention to, um, uh,

412
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,380
an example that would have been in
the ears of Elliot's listeners. Uh,

413
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,650
and that is a, the Elliot's listeners
Elliot's readers, that is, um,

414
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:32,200
uh, the end of a Tennyson's Ulysses, um,

415
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,940
a poem well known in the 19th century,
the long day wanes.

416
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,780
The slow moon climbs the deep
moans round with many voices.

417
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,630
I quote it too because,
uh,

418
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,110
Elliot love this passage and it
returns in his late poetry, uh, in, um,

419
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,000
uh,
interesting echoes come my friends.

420
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,940
Tis Not too late to seek a newer world.

421
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,000
It may be that the
gulfs will wash us down.

422
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:02,800
It may be we shall touch the happy isles
and see the Great Achilles whom we knew

423
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:08,410
though much is taken, much abides. And
though we are not now that strength,

424
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:12,100
which in old days moved
earth and heaven were older,

425
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,630
that which we are,

426
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,690
we are one equal temper of heroic
hearts made weak by time and fate,

427
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:24,190
but strong in will to strive, to
seek, to find and not to yield.

428
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,050
Where uh, echoing I think, uh, Milton's,

429
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,070
Satan, uh, the, uh, the blank
verse suddenly, you know,

430
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:37,840
becomes a kind of heroic
medium of the will. Uh,

431
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,700
well the contrast is important,
uh,

432
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,100
with the poetry that Elliot
is presenting to us, uh,

433
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,850
because here, uh, the
question of the speakers will,

434
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,910
is so much at issue and his manner of
speech is so different from the example

435
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:56,560
that Tennyson gives us

436
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:03,250
a Tennyson specifically in this
dramatic monologue as in others,

437
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,350
uh, of, uh, his, uh,

438
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:10,380
erv or other important 19th
century examples introduces
us to a dramatic speaker

439
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:16,720
who has a kind of coherent
character, uh, and, and, uh,

440
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,730
um, uh, who's unity of
character, if you like,

441
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:26,680
uh, is allied to the unity
of the verse form itself.

442
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,270
Elliot gives us something very different.
Uh,

443
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,460
he creates in frog,

444
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,050
I would say not a character,
rather,

445
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:42,630
he creates something more
like a consciousness. Uh,

446
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,890
he creates a, uh,

447
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,910
a fragmentary consciousness,
uh,

448
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,040
that rises and falls,
uh,

449
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,490
take shape and disperses before us.

450
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,430
John Stuart Mill said,
uh, in, in, uh, memorable,

451
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,250
uh,
uh,

452
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,010
passage that poetry lyric poetry is what
he was thinking of is overheard speech,

453
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,310
overheard speech. Well, and you can think,

454
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,530
uh, if you have some sense of, uh,

455
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,380
the romantic poetry of
Wordsworth, uh, or, or, um,

456
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,190
uh,

457
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,930
Coleridge as examples before you
have of what mill had in mind,

458
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,070
the way in which in those poems
we listened in on, um, uh,

459
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,960
uh, soliloquies, ing, uh, poets, thoughts,

460
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
listening to Prufrock is much less like
listening to someone speak on the street

461
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,720
or on the stage,
uh,

462
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,950
than it is like closing
your eyes and remembering,

463
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,820
uh,
or inventing voices in your mind.

464
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,970
Elliot is creating a kind
of overheard inner speech.

465
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,570
Uh, he's, he's, uh,

466
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,630
he's letting us listen in on a mind,

467
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,110
uh,
that we don't see whole.

468
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:28,340
We don't feel whole. Uh,
we only get parts of it,

469
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,790
uh, fluctuation. Uh,

470
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,300
this is the,

471
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:40,010
this is the medium and the rhythm,
uh,

472
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,460
that, uh, we, we entered
when we entered the poem.

473
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,900
Uh, there is, uh, as I
was already suggesting,

474
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,260
no overarching pattern
for the poems verse form.

475
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,320
Um, I think this is probably
true for, uh, other, uh,

476
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,170
dimensions of organization,
uh, as well. Um,

477
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,620
there are rather,
uh,

478
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,840
in this poem what I would call a kind
of set of unfolding local systems of

479
00:35:14,481 --> 00:35:18,860
organization. Um, there are, uh, couplets.

480
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,650
We see couplets in that first paragraph,

481
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,950
but then they're not
systematically pursued. Um,

482
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,230
instead what you get in the
poem or a lot of loose ends,

483
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:31,910
uh,

484
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,710
pauses a bits and pieces of language,

485
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,740
a language that is almost
always full of quotations,

486
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:46,110
which your editor will give you,
uh, the source for some of them.

487
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,480
Uh, what we have then in the poem as he
moved through it as though it's a lot of

488
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:56,310
shifting improvised orders,
uh,

489
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,770
this formal instability
in the palm is related to,

490
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:05,670
and it constructs a
special sort of speaker,

491
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,560
a one who is performing for us,

492
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,000
uh, his, his thoughts,

493
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,740
his thoughts, uh, experienced as a
set of routines or rifts or acts.

494
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,520
Uh,

495
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,520
and they come and go without a
very definite aim or conclusion.

496
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,040
Looking at the cover of,
of Prufrock,

497
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,360
I asked you to think about
the relationship between
Prufrock and ts. Eliot,

498
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,820
uh,
you think you can think about,

499
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,460
uh,
Prufrock the name itself,

500
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:50,930
Jay Alfred Prufrock,

501
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:55,910
almost a kind of parody of t s Elliott.
Um,

502
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,830
the, the name suggests a
kind of upper class, uh,

503
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,460
English or Anglo file person.
Uh,

504
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,110
those formal initials are, are,
uh, uh, pretentious in a way.

505
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,443
Um,

506
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,140
I think it's proper to think of Prufrock
as in some sense a kind of comic

507
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:18,030
figure,

508
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,400
a almost like a cartoon
or a caricature or device.

509
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,570
Um,
on one level a,

510
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:31,550
he is a kind of parody
of a romantic singer.

511
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,900
Uh, he is bourgeois. He
is intellectualizing, uh,

512
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,930
he's incapable of grasping and expressing
what we expect from a love song that

513
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:45,520
is strong emotion.
Uh,

514
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,650
the poem can be seen to as a,

515
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:53,651
as a kind of critique
of romantic egotism and,

516
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,000
uh, of the Wordsworthian ideal
of, of expression. This is,

517
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:03,250
uh, something that, uh,

518
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,970
Elliot a theorizes polemically,
uh, in his essay, uh,

519
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,300
tradition and the individual
talent. Uh, and in fact,

520
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:16,301
why don't we look there for a few minutes
to get more sense of a Elliot's ideas.

521
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,890
Uh, nine 46 at the back
of your book there. Uh,

522
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,780
he says,

523
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,690
I'm quoting Wordsworth in the
preface to lyrical ballads.

524
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,960
We must believe that emotion
recollected in tranquility is an exam,

525
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,990
is an inexact formula for it as
neither emotion nor recollection,

526
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,120
nor without distortion of meaning
tranquility that you get in in Eliot poem.

527
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:59,371
At least it is a concentration and a new
thing resulting from the concentration

528
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,610
of a very great number of experiences,

529
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,610
which to the practical inactive person
would not seem to be experienced as it

530
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,420
all.

531
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,560
It is the concentration which does not
happen consciously or of deliberation.

532
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,000
Uh,
these experiences are not recollected.

533
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:17,550
Okay.

534
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,270
And they finally United in an atmosphere
which is tranquil only and that it is a

535
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:23,160
passive attending upon the event.

536
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:26,883
There's a,

537
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,340
Eliot is trying to describe poetry here
as having a kind of generating a kind of

538
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:38,071
experience in and of itself that is
distinct from any kind of recollected

539
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:40,810
experience.
Uh,

540
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,740
and it is curiously impersonal
as he imagines that.

541
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:48,250
And he continues and there's a
great deal in the writing of poetry,

542
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,400
which must be conscious and deliberate.
In fact,

543
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:56,530
the bad poet is usually unconscious where
he ought to be conscious and conscious

544
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,390
where he ought to be unconscious.
We know what he means. Uh,

545
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:06,630
both errors tend to make him
personal and am now Tsla.

546
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:11,110
It will say poetry is not
a turning loose of emotion,

547
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,640
but an escape from emotion.
It is not the expression of personality,

548
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,800
but an escape from personality.

549
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,870
But of course,

550
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,070
only those who have personality and
emotions know what it means to want to

551
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:27,920
escape from these things.
Uh,

552
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:32,310
which is a extraordinary
kind of Coda to this, uh,

553
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,220
polemical passage.

554
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,080
Okay.

555
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,700
Ah, and, and revealing of course,
uh, the, the way in which Elliot,

556
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,730
even as he's polemicizing
against a romantic poetry
that would be too personal,

557
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,200
uh, is deeply invested in, uh,
the personal, uh, and personality,

558
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:54,970
uh, and conflicted about it. Uh,

559
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,850
I've been,
uh,

560
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,050
talking about ambiguity in Elliot. Um, uh,

561
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,590
well we can speak of ambivalence,
uh,

562
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,620
this essay a retains even while it is
critiquing a certain romantic story of,

563
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,740
of creation.
Uh,

564
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:19,870
and we could say something similar
about Elliot's Love Song Prufrock,

565
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:21,790
uh,

566
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,790
is a kind of pretext or a device through
which Elliot can speak of himself.

567
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,313
Uh,

568
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,660
Prufrock becomes a way of
writing the self when to Elliot.

569
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,170
It no longer seems plausible
to write as oneself

570
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,300
as a Wordsworth had felt it to be.

571
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,700
You can think of Prufrock as a,

572
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:51,701
as a kind of mask behind which you hear
a young poet asking questions about

573
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:56,510
himself and his art.
A list,

574
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:01,550
the poems, questions there.
Prufrock asks questions throughout.

575
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,050
Uh, do you recall them?
They are. Do I dare?

576
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,070
Do I dare disturb the universe?

577
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,410
So how should I presume?
And how should I begin?

578
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:21,110
Shall I say?
He says that pretty often.

579
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,090
Shall I say this?
Shall I say that

580
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,040
daring presuming beginning,

581
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,110
what shall I say?
These are,

582
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:35,850
are they not an ambitious young poets?

583
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,520
Questions about how to write poetry.

584
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,040
The question is,

585
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:47,960
why should beginning be something
that you really have to dare?

586
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,370
Uh, what does that imply? Uh,

587
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,920
why should it be frightening?

588
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:00,460
Why should it give you pause in y if
these are a young man's questions as I'm

589
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,063
suggesting,

590
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,210
does Prufrock seem as old
as old and weary as he does?

591
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,250
In fact,
how old do you think he is?

592
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,320
I don't know. Uh, ask
yourselves that question. Uh,

593
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:27,440
ask yourselves what evidence you
would have for one answer. Another.

594
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,540
Uh, it's hard to pinpoint
his age. Prufrock is,

595
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,580
isn't he a kind of old young man

596
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,920
or young old man?
Uh,

597
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,760
he is cautious and
aggressive at the same time.

598
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,830
Uh,
old and young.

599
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,080
These paradoxes I think point
to Elliot's sense of his place,

600
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:55,420
his own place in literary history,

601
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:59,920
in some sense of what it meant
to be modern for Elliot. Uh,

602
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:05,990
Prufrock is burdened by the question
of how to begin in dd begins exactly by

603
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,800
deferring beginning a by failing to
come to the point by putting it off,

604
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:15,190
by delaying.
Because by implication,

605
00:44:15,191 --> 00:44:18,910
beginning is indeed something threatening,
something that must be dared.

606
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,960
But this only makes sense if Prufrock
really does want to disturb the universe

607
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,300
or at least the system of
culture as he found it.

608
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,780
It only makes sense of beginning
really does require disturbing things.

609
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:39,360
Uh,

610
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:44,360
the implication is that the universe
is already complete without Prufrock,

611
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,310
without Tsa,

612
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:53,100
Elliot and anything
that he might do or say,

613
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,680
you can extend this to
Elliot's idea of culture. Uh,

614
00:44:58,681 --> 00:45:02,430
and in particular to his sense
of the literary past, uh,

615
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,270
you see the idea in tradition,
in the individual talent, uh, uh,

616
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:09,000
nine 42,
nine 43,

617
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,310
he speaks of a, towards the
bottom of the page on nine 42, uh,

618
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,520
tradition as a kind of
ideal order of monuments.

619
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,600
Tradition is in some sense,
well,

620
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:29,601
it's monumental and it's already
complete as he imagines it to add to it,

621
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:35,040
to enter,
it would be to change it to disturb it.

622
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,700
Uh,
in fact,

623
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,870
Elliot evolves here a quite ingenious
and complicated argument for how the new

624
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,620
could indeed be introduced to a
tradition conceived in the terms I just

625
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:59,820
described. Elliot says, uh, on
the bottom of the page about,

626
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,140
uh, the, uh, any, any new poet,

627
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,770
the necessity that he shall conform.
And there's that word conform.

628
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,790
Think of the waistcoat,
the necessity that he shall conform,

629
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:19,530
that he shall cohere and remain
put together is not one sided.

630
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,770
This was quite an extraordinary argument.
He's saying

631
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,160
it's not only necessary for a new poet
too, in a sense, conform to tradition.

632
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,220
What happens when a new work of art is
created as something that's happened

633
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:38,640
simultaneously to all the works of art,
which proceeded it.

634
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,820
Something which happens simultaneously
to all the works of art,

635
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:44,670
which proceeded it.
This is quite a claim.

636
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,150
The existing monuments form an
ideal order among themselves,

637
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:50,670
which is modified by the
introduction of the new,

638
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,580
the really new work of art among them.

639
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,180
The existing orders complete before the
new work arrives for order to present,

640
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,180
persist after the Super
Vientiane of novelty.

641
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:09,270
Novelty comes as something
that supervenes it has force,

642
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,220
it's a leopard and the temple.

643
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,250
The whole existing order must
be if ever so slightly altered.

644
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,470
And so the relations,

645
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:23,850
proportions values of each work of art
toward the whole a readjusted and this is

646
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:28,830
conformity between the old
and the new. It's, uh, uh,

647
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,530
here Elliot is,
is struggling with,

648
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:37,360
with an idea of tradition as something
that is static and, and fully,

649
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,220
uh,
uh,

650
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:44,250
present in and of itself a sense of the
new as something that is revolutionary,

651
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,040
uh, and that threatens tradition
or is threatened by it.

652
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,010
How can he bring them into alignment?
Well,

653
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,420
through this very complicated
process, uh, that he describes,

654
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,070
which, uh, gives the
modern, gives the new, um,

655
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:02,390
okay,

656
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,390
an extraordinary power to make us see and
in fact to realign the relations among

657
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,750
all the works of the past.

658
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,290
Okay.

659
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,820
And this is, uh, uh, as I say,
quite an extraordinary power.

660
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:22,080
Uh,

661
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,080
the implication is the new poet must in
some sense rest authority from all those

662
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,160
who have come before through a kind of
imaginative and rhetorical violence,

663
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:37,020
uh, kind of, uh, insurrection
in, in the temple of culture.

664
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,460
Prufrock's sense of age,
uh,

665
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:46,461
expresses for him a feeling of relatedness
and anxiety that he's already a run

666
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:48,780
out of time is very youth.

667
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:52,950
The fact that it's the only
just now starting makes him old,

668
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,030
uh,
to presume would be to reverse this order,

669
00:48:57,031 --> 00:49:01,000
to dare to come before
and to claim priority, uh,

670
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,000
for his own work. Uh, as
I say these sentences,

671
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:10,890
I sound a whole lot like Harold
bloom, uh, as, uh, uh, he,

672
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:15,570
uh, describes, uh, the,
uh, uh, mission of any,

673
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,860
uh, poet in his work on
the anxiety of influence.

674
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,240
And that is because a Bloom's work is a
deeply indebted precisely to Elliot and

675
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:30,640
to tradition and the individual
talent. But these are questions, uh,

676
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:35,190
I'll say a little bit more
about, um, uh, next time, uh,

677
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,570
as we, uh, uh,

678
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:41,571
finish discussing
Elliott's a love song and,

679
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,050
uh, begin to, uh, talk
about the wasteland.
