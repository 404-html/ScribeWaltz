1
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,050
Second and lecture I was
reading last time from,

2
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:24,180
uh, uh, poems from the
30s, uh, those love poems.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
Um, uh, lay your sleeping
head, my love and

4
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,610
this lunar beauty. Uh, the,
the ballad, uh, that I,

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,540
uh, read for you as I
walked out one evening. Uh,

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,520
also a poem about love a
also comes from the, uh,

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,540
later thirties. Uh, it is
collected though in this book, uh,

8
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,750
called another time a book,

9
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,350
odd and published in 1940.
Uh,

10
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,500
and I wanted to, well, let's
see. I'm afraid I've got
my order all mixed up here.

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,153
Um,

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,180
I wanted to show you what I'm [inaudible]
just the table of contents of this

13
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:16,230
book because it's, it has a
number of masterpieces in it, uh,

14
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,270
that you are reading.
Uh,

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
it's also significant that it's
organized in the way that it is.

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,530
The first section is called humbly,
I guess,

17
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:32,070
or practically, uh, people and places.

18
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,660
A edit includes a in it, um, the poem
I'll be discussing. Yeah. Shortly.

19
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:42,250
Museo de Boza. Uh, there's, um, uh,

20
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,530
another, uh, couple of sections,
a section called lighter poems,

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,340
uh, includes, um, uh,
well all kinds of, um,

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,930
song forms, a refugee blues, uh,

23
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,180
different kinds of blues and some, uh, uh,

24
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,440
kind of a gothic satirical ballads.
Uh,

25
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:10,290
Miss G, uh, James Honeymoon, um, uh,

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,910
poems that are antecedents for a
song like Maxwells silver hammer.

27
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:19,420
This is the kind of
thing Auden was riding a,

28
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:22,000
and then there's also something
else called occasional poems.

29
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:26,760
And in this box od and has
put Spain 1937, that, uh,

30
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,810
uh, great political poem,
uh, from the civil war.

31
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,940
Um, and, uh, these, uh,

32
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,920
palms that I'll be discussing today
and memory of WB Yeats and in memory of

33
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,690
Sigma Freud,
uh,

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,160
I wanted to call attention to
this, uh, uh, book. First of all,

35
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:51,050
because it shows us these poems embedded
in the actual context in which they

36
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:55,880
first appeared. Uh, but also to
point out the way in which Auden, uh,

37
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,870
has organized his, his book,
uh, that is to say has, um,

38
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,260
thought of his poems as belonging
to specific categories, uh,

39
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,130
and, and place them
accordingly. Uh, and they, uh,

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,130
they have different genres,
different forms,

41
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:16,350
suitable to different purposes in
occasions. And this is very much, um,

42
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,430
the, uh, uh, way in which od and
imagines himself as a poet, I think,

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,380
uh, that is, um,

44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,650
someone I'm writing with a kind
of a technical mastery with,

45
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,850
uh, access, access to a whole
repertoire of traditional forms,

46
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,590
which are suitable to different
purposes and different occasions. Uh,

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,740
this general perspective on, um, uh,

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,170
on his work, uh, is related to, uh,

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,390
the topic that I introduced in, uh,
discussing as I walked out one evening.

50
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,430
And that is the whole
question of perspective, uh,

51
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,480
in on are you remember I talked
about how that poem seems to include,

52
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:05,400
well, at least three different, uh,
perspectives. That is the, um, uh,

53
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,180
quoted Song, uh, of the lover, uh,

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,280
who tells his beloved
that he will love her, um,

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,350
uh, until the end of time. Uh, then, uh,

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,060
there's the voice of the clocks who
speak from the point of view of time, uh,

57
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:26,650
and, uh, uh, correct.
Uh, his, his, uh, claims.

58
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,161
Uh,

59
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:32,161
and then finally there's a kind of a
narrative voice that seems to frame the

60
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,260
whole thing,
um,

61
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,800
with that image of the river running on,
um,

62
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,450
uh, as in that poem, uh, odd and seems to

63
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,870
be able to incorporate in his poetry,
multiple perspectives,

64
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,520
each of which,
uh,

65
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,720
comment on or are framed or
conditioned by the others,

66
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,710
but each of which has its
independent truth. You could say.

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,380
Um, this is a topic that
we'll explore more today.

68
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:10,070
Looking at other poems. I wanted to
show you some, uh, photographs. Um,

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,730
in the, in the 1930s during the, um,

70
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,910
uh, Japanese, uh,

71
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,830
Chinese war, a prelude to
the Second World War, um,

72
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,600
on, uh, went with his friend
Christopher Isherwood, uh, to China,

73
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,350
uh, and created a book together
called journey to a war,

74
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,640
which includes Isherwood's pros
and Auden's, uh, poetry. Uh,

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,170
it's quite a remarkable book.
It also includes a photographs,

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,180
uh, which are presented
in an interesting way. Uh,

77
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:50,740
we have here, um, two
different photographs of boys,

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,700
uh, boys, uh, uh,

79
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,150
who are classified here
as soldiers. And, uh,

80
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,950
and then, uh, grimly, um,
uh, are identified, uh,

81
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:08,910
as with legs and without, uh, there's, um,

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,080
a kind of interest in these photographs
and in their presentation of how,

83
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,000
in the ways in which in war,
uh,

84
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,890
who we are is a matter of
perspective and point of view.

85
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,050
Um, the, um, um, war gave
a Auden an issue with, uh,

86
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,520
a opportunity to, um, uh,

87
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,680
experience what it is like
to be on the ground when, uh,

88
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,680
planes or overhead, uh, bombing
you. Um, and, and here's,

89
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:46,950
uh, here's one, a
photograph, uh, of that, uh,

90
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,800
condition, uh, in here
is, is another, uh, uh,

91
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,210
illustration of this general
point I wanted to make. There's a,

92
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:01,040
there are n a d unidentified
corpses, uh, under blankets.

93
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,170
There, uh, there are then, um,

94
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,590
uh, scattered human
remains and debris. Uh,

95
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:14,591
and the one photograph is identified
as the innocent and the other as the

96
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:18,410
guilty.
Well,

97
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,730
the great poem, uh, on
this general theme, uh,

98
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:27,930
in Auden's work is a music day. Boza. Uh,

99
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,840
it is a poem that

100
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,190
Auden wrote a after
returning from China, uh, in,

101
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:41,130
uh, December, uh, I believe, um,

102
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,630
1938,
ah,

103
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,480
contemplating a,
a,

104
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,450
a return to the United
States where he had, um, uh,

105
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:57,470
uh, visited, um, a short time before,

106
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,960
uh, contemplating in fact,
expatriation also contemplating,

107
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,600
uh,
an imminent war,

108
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,990
a world war that would,
uh, extend the, um,

109
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,520
horror that he had witnessed in China,
uh,

110
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,890
to all of Europe and beyond,
uh,

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,370
suffering in other words,
uh, was on his mind. And, uh,

112
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,020
it's the subject,
uh,

113
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:31,430
or rather arts relation to suffering
is the subject of this poem.

114
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,380
The poem, uh, has as its occasion, uh,

115
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:41,120
a visit to the museum. They
bazaar in Brussels, uh,

116
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,100
where um, odd and saw among
other works, uh, this painting,

117
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,630
uh, the fall of Icarus,
um, uh, that, um, uh,

118
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,240
is painted by Peter [inaudible].
Uh, this and other, uh,

119
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,520
Roy Eagles are referred
to in the course of, uh,

120
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:03,521
of the poem which precedes almost as a
kind of imaginary gallery tour or walk,

121
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,140
uh, in which, uh, Aaden,
uh, as our companion,

122
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,333
uh,

123
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,490
takes us to a different
works and contemplates their
commentary on the general

124
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:21,480
issue that, uh, he is,
uh, uh, raising here.

125
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,500
What is arts relation to
suffering about suffering?

126
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,930
They were never wrong.
The old masters,

127
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,630
how well they understood
it's human position.

128
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:37,980
He's concerned with how you
position suffering in human life

129
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,740
and use taking Roy goal
and, and uh, uh, as a,

130
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:48,741
as a model how it takes place while
someone else is eating or opening a window

131
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:55,761
or just walking Deli along as this line
of poetry itself seems to how when the

132
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:02,700
aged ar reverently passionately
waiting for the miraculous birth.

133
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,370
Now he's contemplating Nativity scene.

134
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,900
There must always be children who
did not specially want it to happen.

135
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,290
Skating on a pond at the edge of the wood.

136
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,190
Yeah.

137
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,190
They never forgot the old masters
that even the dreadful martyrdom.

138
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,500
And now he's looking at
[inaudible] painting the
massacre of the innocence that

139
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:35,501
even the dreadful martyrdom must
run its course anyhow in a corner.

140
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,470
Some untidy spot where the dogs go on
with their Doggie life and the torturers

141
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,733
horse.

142
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,353
Okay.

143
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,030
No more innocent or guilty than
those boys, I suppose. Scratches.

144
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,190
It's innocent behind on a tree.

145
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,900
The old masters, no, the human,
the human position of suffering,

146
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:04,520
it's positioned in human life.
Uh, position is important.

147
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:08,780
It's an important word for odd.
And here he's concerned with, uh,

148
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,930
how experiences placed.
Uh,

149
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,390
sometimes he calls this
geography. Uh, it is a, um,

150
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,550
uh, tote posts, a Motif, a,

151
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:24,020
an idea in his poetry that Elizabeth
Bishop will take over quite directly from

152
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:27,320
him, uh, and develop and
make central to her poetry.

153
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:33,490
The idea is that things
have meaning in relation to,

154
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,880
uh,
in their connection with,

155
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:40,850
but also their separation from each other.

156
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,060
Suffering is part, uh, but only a part,

157
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,450
not the center of human life.

158
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,440
A repertoire of actions and conditions
and states of being that is much larger,

159
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,130
uh, in, uh, um, embroil, uh,

160
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,820
in his massacre of the innocence. I
won't try to find it. Now, among my,

161
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,850
my slides for you,
uh,

162
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,870
odd and focuses on the
torturers horse, the, uh, uh,

163
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,560
the animal, uh, that is
a part of the scene, uh,

164
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:25,240
and that, uh, motivated by an Itch,

165
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,140
scratches, uh, it's, uh, behind, uh,

166
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,050
while the dreadful
martyrdom runs its course,

167
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,530
uh, in this poem, uh, as an
other, uh, uh, Auden poems,

168
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,870
a note, the pros, rhythms, uh,

169
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,090
the poem does seem to at
times walked Deli along,

170
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,420
uh, Auden like more is riding
in an expository manner,

171
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:56,440
I guess. Essayistic manner. Uh,

172
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:59,350
this is a part of the tone of the poem.

173
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,960
Uh, Auden is getting
into his poetry, uh, uh,

174
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,480
kind of neoclassical,
uh, 18th century, uh,

175
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,430
aesthetic, uh, uh, an ability
to talk about ideas, uh, in, in,

176
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,070
in poetry, uh, in, in, uh, again,

177
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:22,330
a discursive expository
manner that includes humor,

178
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,180
uh, and that, uh, uh,

179
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,730
is matter of fact is observant,
uh,

180
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,770
pain like the tiers that I talked about
last time that had dried on Auden's

181
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,590
pages. Uh, pain is part of the picture,

182
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,300
but it is just a part, it's
in a sense, been put aside,

183
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,820
all of this is a function of what
I'm calling Auden's perspectivism.

184
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,130
Uh, any scene borders on other scenes
where other people are positioned,

185
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:54,790
uh,

186
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,620
looking at the same thing differently
or not looking at it at all.

187
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,810
Uh, and this is one of the, uh, uh,

188
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,430
themes of the,
uh,

189
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,120
second section of the poem
where a odd and specifically,

190
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,870
uh, describes this painting. He says,

191
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,310
embroils ICARUS for
instance. Uh, and you know,

192
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:22,660
this is a poetry in which the poet
says, for instance, just as a,

193
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,170
um, uh, more might've said, however,

194
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,680
how everything turns away quite
leisurely from the disaster. And he's,

195
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,100
he's talking about a shepherd
who's looking up to the sky.

196
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,260
He's talking, uh, about, uh, the Plowman,

197
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,210
uh, who, uh, has his
back turned to, uh, um,

198
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,330
the fall. Uh, and, and where is it?
It's hard probably for you to see,

199
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:57,620
but it's hard to find in any case because
this dramatic event that is the center

200
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:00,410
of broils pictures,
in fact,

201
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,240
these bare legs disappearing
into the sea as the, uh,

202
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,190
uh, overreaching son of Daedalus
plunges into the water, uh,

203
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,270
not at all. Uh, in the
center of the picture,

204
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,830
how everything turns away
a lot and observes quite
leisurely from the disaster.

205
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,430
The Plowman may have heard the splash,
the forsaken cry,

206
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,490
but for him it was not an important
failure. He's not concerned with,

207
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,560
uh, flying to or beyond the son. For him,

208
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:43,100
the son merely shines it. It, uh, uh, uh,

209
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,140
helps him cultivate the land,

210
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,530
the sun shone of necessity as
it had to on the white legs,

211
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,160
disappearing into the green water,

212
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,580
the white legs disappearing into the green
water and the expensive delicate ship

213
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,990
that must've seen something amazing.

214
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:10,991
A boy falling out of the sky had
somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on,

215
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,340
well here,
uh,

216
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,380
odd and wasn't thinking about Hart Crane,
but he might've been a,

217
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:26,190
it's almost as if this,
uh,

218
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,740
figure has leaped off
the back of the boat. Uh,

219
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,330
as crane did, uh, he is,
however, thinking I suppose,

220
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,070
uh, about Romanticism in
general and its ambitions,

221
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,250
uh, here the sun shines as it had to, uh,

222
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,860
what it illuminates our white legs.

223
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,510
There's a kind of objectivity in
that there's a kind of naturalism,

224
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,440
uh, it shines on green water. Uh,

225
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,480
it's as if from a certain perspective,
from the perspective of aesthetic form,

226
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,390
these elements of the picture are,
uh, merely elements of a picture,

227
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,220
uh, colors, uh, uh,
which have meaning, uh,

228
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,320
as they are placed in a
system of relationships and
the system of perspectives.

229
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,580
Well, there's a great deal
more to be said about this, uh,

230
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,440
uh, painting. Um, I think, um,

231
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,130
one, uh, idea that, uh,

232
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,410
is worth emphasizing, uh, is the, uh, uh,

233
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:39,530
way in which the plow men,
uh,

234
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,970
in Auden's account as in
goals, uh, painting, uh,

235
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:48,770
has prominence, uh, has a greater
prominence than the, uh, uh,

236
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,380
heroic,
a romantic figure plunging into the sea.

237
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,970
The Plowman is going about
his ordinary daily work.

238
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,360
And as he turns these furrows,

239
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,570
we are reminded as odd and surely was
reminded of the ancient classical,

240
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,220
uh, uh, connection between verse, uh,

241
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,390
meaning the turning, uh,
of, um, in Latin, uh,

242
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:20,360
from one line to another. And
the, uh, uh, uh, shaping, uh,

243
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,340
action of the plow that,
uh,

244
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,330
creates these furrows in the earth,
uh,

245
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,990
committing the poet as he identifies
with the plowman to a kind of poetry of

246
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:38,730
craft and of the earth that involves,
in a sense,

247
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,200
turning away from a disaster.

248
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,330
Well,
uh,

249
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,480
this poem was written
in Europe. Uh, it is,

250
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,690
um, a, um, a poem that

251
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,870
Auden. Um, let me find this picture here,

252
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,700
uh, with which Auden in a
sense turns his back on,

253
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,660
uh, Europe and for the
moment at least the, uh, uh,

254
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,310
imminent world war,
he comes to the United States,

255
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:19,050
he immigrates to the United
States, uh, in January,

256
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,010
uh, 1939, um, this, uh,

257
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,800
personal, uh, uh, turning point, uh,

258
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,130
in a poetic career, um, uh,

259
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,400
comes at a moment when, um, uh,

260
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,670
the world is about to be split in war.
Uh,

261
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,030
it also, um, uh, comes a,

262
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,830
at a significant moment
in literary history, uh,

263
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:48,810
when Yeats dies.

264
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:54,030
And Auden recognizes this occasion as,
as a moment to

265
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,370
celebrate the poet, uh, uh, contemplate

266
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,810
the achievement in modern poetry
that he represents Yates, uh, and,

267
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,830
uh, in a sense, um, um,

268
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,690
provide a kind of a epitaph for, um, uh,

269
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:19,200
poetry now, uh, in the past, uh,

270
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:24,000
in behind us that positions on a,
in the present.

271
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,060
Let's look at the, the view of, um, uh,

272
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,540
Yates and of Yates is
poetry that emerges here.

273
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,830
Uh, the, um,

274
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,990
the poem extends the questions of
Music Day. Boats are by asking,

275
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,190
uh, not so much. What is arts
relation to suffering as,

276
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,770
what is the place of art
in society generally,

277
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:50,950
or poetry in particular?
Uh,

278
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,290
Arden begins, he disappeared in the
dead of winter. The bricks were frozen.

279
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,000
The airport's almost
deserted and snow disfigured.

280
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,200
The public statues,

281
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,570
the mercury sank in the
mouth of the dying day. Oh,

282
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,460
all the instruments agree.

283
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,570
The day of his death was a dark cold day.

284
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,210
Uh, there's, there's
a, a sense as odd and,

285
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,290
uh, elaborates these ideas that, um, um,

286
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,613
mmm,

287
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,990
well,
the natural sciences here mocking the,

288
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:36,991
a pathetic fallacy that all nature
should more when the poet dies,

289
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,600
uh, and reflect, uh, the, uh, um,

290
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,620
grief of this, uh, event, uh,

291
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:50,010
he's saying is it was a cold day and we
had instruments to measure it and that's

292
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:54,130
what it,
it was kind of a factual way.

293
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,500
Uh, he continues, Arden does.

294
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,580
Um,
uh,

295
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,090
now he Yates is scattered among a
hundred cities and wholly given over to

296
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:11,050
unfamiliar affections.
Uh,

297
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,340
the words of a dead man are
modified in the guts of the living.

298
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,660
Yates is passed on to us. Uh, and yet

299
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,550
to whom is he passed on?
What difference does he make?

300
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,373
Uh,

301
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
odd and doesn't want us to,
uh,

302
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,200
make the mistake to a thinking that Yates
is too central figure that he matters

303
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:41,310
too much. But in the importance
and noise of tomorrow,

304
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,020
he continues when the brokers are roaring
like beasts on the floor of the Boris

305
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,740
and the poor have the sufferings to which
they are fairly accustomed in each and

306
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,350
the sell of himself as almost
convinced of his freedom.

307
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,080
A few thousand,

308
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,730
we'll think of this day as one thinks of
the day when one did something slightly

309
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,510
unusual.
This is,

310
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,730
this is a attempt to, in some
sense, uh, plays poetry. Uh,

311
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,720
realistically, uh, in culture. Uh,

312
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,110
it doesn't matter to the brokers worrying
like beasts on the floor of the Boris.

313
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:19,621
Uh,

314
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:23,610
it doesn't matter to the poor who have
their suffering to which they're fairly

315
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:27,750
accustomed manner as well,
perhaps to a few thousand people,

316
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,540
not a negligible number. Uh,
but not a large one either.

317
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,750
There's a kind of a modesty,

318
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,100
a in Odense claims for Yates
for poetry. Uh, you could,

319
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,190
you could contrast pound at the same time.
Uh,

320
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,230
is this poem is written a broadcasting
his ideas on fascist radio.

321
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,340
Uh, or you could think about, um, uh,

322
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:55,280
Stevens at the same
time dreaming up a poem.

323
00:23:55,281 --> 00:24:00,230
He will call notes towards the supreme
fiction. This is a rather different, uh,

324
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,820
claim for what poetry might do.
Uh,

325
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,620
it, uh, returns to a theme
of the wasteland somehow. Uh,

326
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,610
the world that Auden,
um,

327
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,580
is describing is one in which we are
each imprisoned in the cell of ourselves.

328
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,670
Uh, recalling the, the
locked chambers, uh, of,

329
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,590
um, uh, Elliot's poem. Um,

330
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,320
in the second section,
Auden moves to address Yates directly.

331
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,940
Uh, now, uh,

332
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,560
Yates is in a sense
claimed for us. Uh, his,

333
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,490
his difference, uh,
the, the, uh, that Hick,

334
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,740
uh, powers of language,
the visionary ambition,

335
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,360
uh, the, uh, a cult learning,
uh, all of that, uh,

336
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,950
that would distinguish and
separate him from us, uh, is, um,

337
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,820
um, put aside. And, uh,

338
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,470
what he shares with us,
uh, is, um, emphasized.

339
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,800
You were silly,
like us silly.

340
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,920
Your gift survived at all.
It had to survive a lot.

341
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:22,820
It had to survive the parish
of rich women who doted on him,

342
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,490
uh,
his own physical decay himself.

343
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,190
Arden says Mad Ireland
hurt you into poetry.

344
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,810
Now Ireland has her madness and her,
whether still you did not affect it,

345
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,960
uh, you did not affect it because
you are a man and only a man.

346
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,750
In fact,
poetry makes nothing happen.

347
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,550
This is a, um, hmm.

348
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,690
One of the most quoted
sentences in modern poetry.

349
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:05,330
Poetry makes nothing happen. Uh, it, uh,

350
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,930
is almost always quoted.
However, out of context,

351
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,960
it is part of a long sentence. Uh, it,

352
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,930
it comes first as a, as a,
uh, uh, qualification on,

353
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,400
on what Yates and the difference
Yates has made in the world

354
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,800
pod and saying in a sense, no, you,
you haven't made a difference, uh,

355
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:32,390
for poetry makes nothing happen.
Uh, but the poem continues.

356
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,880
Then the sentence continues.
Uh,

357
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:38,060
Auden says colon,

358
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,250
it survives poetry makes nothing happen.
It's survives

359
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,530
where it's survives.

360
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:51,531
In the valley of it's saying where
executives would never want to tamper.

361
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,320
It flows south from ranches of
isolation and the busy griefs,

362
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,620
raw towns that we believe in.
Diane,

363
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,840
it survives a way of happening.
A mouth

364
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,950
poetry. It doesn't make
things happen. What it does,

365
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,070
it has a different kind of action.
It's survives.

366
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,930
It lasts. A, how does it
last? Where does it lasts?

367
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,931
It lasts in the valley of it's saying a
kind of imaginary landscape or kind of

368
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:32,250
world that is created through speech here.
Uh,

369
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,910
the Valley of its saying, uh,
perhaps a rich place to live,

370
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:40,620
but also a space that evokes
a kind of absence or hollow,

371
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,090
right. Uh, or we're kind of
opening, uh, perhaps, um,

372
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,770
or gap, uh, as odd and develops this idea.

373
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,490
Uh, the, uh, um, uh,

374
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,410
poetry becomes what he calls,
um,

375
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,040
a way of happening,
a mouth.

376
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,860
And then that valley is
refigured as a mouth, uh,

377
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,670
and open mouth, I'm sure a mouth
open, uh, where words are coming out,

378
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,970
uh, where, uh, more words will, uh,

379
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,480
follow and flow like a kind of river,

380
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,510
uh, poetry in that sense. It
doesn't make anything happen.

381
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:26,620
It is rather a way of happening.
Uh,

382
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,510
that is a kind of method or model,
a path or discipline, uh, way.

383
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,600
Uh,
not a deed a,

384
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:39,601
but something more like the symbol of
the deed or the figure of a kind of

385
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:45,241
potential action and nothing
that is somehow something to,

386
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,100
uh, again, uh, I think, um, uh,

387
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:54,270
an image implying an open
mouth, uh, that is, uh,

388
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,620
the mouth of a river, the mouth
of a poet, uh, through which, uh,

389
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,250
language flows.

390
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,630
Then the poem moves into, um, I think, uh,

391
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,640
a kind of illustration of the kind
of action that poetry engages in.

392
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,551
Uh,

393
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:23,530
and that comes with the movement
into the ceremonial quite trains,

394
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,880
uh, in, uh, I am Vick,
uh, uh, Ted Transmitter,

395
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,810
essentially. What does that,
what it is? Well, uh, uh, it's,

396
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:36,520
it's definitely a tet
tram runner. Um, the, um,

397
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,590
uh, rhyme mentors, uh,

398
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,600
the rhythms of the palm up to now
a give way to a kind of ceremonial,

399
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,120
a lyric language, uh, here, uh,

400
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:57,150
poetry is identified with
praise and with prayer.

401
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,123
Uh,

402
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,940
the poem gives us a kind of performative
language of human ceremony that,

403
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,730
uh, honors, uh, Yates that, uh, uh,

404
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,210
lays him to rest, uh, and yet, uh,

405
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:21,211
also absorbs and affirms
the power of poetry,

406
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,570
uh, that was, um, in him earth.

407
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,400
Receive an honored guest.
William Yeats is laid to rest.

408
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,500
Let the Irish vessel
lie empty of its poetry.

409
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,030
Oh, hadn't goes on to,
uh, uh, describe the, uh,

410
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,190
uh, way that, um, time

411
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,430
we'll honor poetry and we'll honor Yates,
uh,

412
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,350
that time. Uh, we'll even,

413
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,243
he says,

414
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:07,270
Auden does forgive Yeates for
the right wing politics that,

415
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,790
uh, Yates is a later career
is marked by and that,

416
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,830
uh, Auden, uh, separates
himself from and, uh, uh,

417
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,740
needs to come to terms with in this poem,

418
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,900
he says a time that with
this strange excuse,

419
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:31,870
pardon Kipling and his views and
we'll pardon Paul Claudel, uh, uh,

420
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,560
Kipling for his imperial
jingoism, uh, Cadel for his, uh,

421
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:40,700
you know, Prodo Fascist,
uh, uh, uh, ideas,

422
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,080
pardons Yates also for writing. Well, uh,

423
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,950
odd. And looking back on this
poem, uh, would ask himself,

424
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,220
how could I possibly presume to, um, uh,

425
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,770
judge Yates and forgive him
morally for his politics?

426
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,850
Uh, and, uh, struck these, uh, uh,

427
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,220
condescending lines from his poem

428
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,390
so you won't find them
in the collected pumps,

429
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:15,710
but you will find the powerful lines that,
uh,

430
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,120
proceed from them in the
nightmare of the dark.

431
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:24,620
All the dogs of Europe bark
and the living nations wait,

432
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,950
each sequestered in it's hate.

433
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Intellectual disgraced stares from
every human face in the seeds of pity.

434
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:38,330
Lie locked frozen in each eye.

435
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,850
What does the poet do in this condition?

436
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,590
Follow poet.

437
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,910
Follow right to the bottom of the night.

438
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:57,120
Poet descends and descends into night,
uh,

439
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,980
uh, a night that is a, um,

440
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,240
this nightmare in which, uh, uh, Europe

441
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,520
barks ready to attack itself

442
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,060
with your unconstrained voice.

443
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,140
Still persuade us to rejoice

444
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,500
with the farming of a verse.

445
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:24,580
And remember the plowman now
as a figure for the poet.

446
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,980
Make a vineyard of the curse.

447
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Sing of human unsuccess in a rapture of
distress in the deserts of the heart.

448
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,180
Let the healing fountains start
in the prison of his days,

449
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,030
teach the free man how to praise.

450
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,500
This is what poetry can
offer. Uh, these, uh, uh,

451
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,400
it can offer a lesson in how to praise.

452
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,220
This is not a, this is not
making something happen, uh,
politically in the world,

453
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:02,140
perhaps, uh, but it's making
something happen in the heart. Uh,

454
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:06,760
and, uh, perhaps within
the eye of each of us,

455
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,510
uh, who, uh, look, uh, locked and, uh,

456
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,000
staring with our pity,
uh, frozen there, uh,

457
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,730
poetry would, um, uh,

458
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:24,720
would be a kind of farming in the
desert of the heart that would,

459
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,550
um, uh, break open a that
which is locked there, uh,

460
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,370
and, uh, free feeling. Uh, it's a, uh,

461
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,590
it's a powerful and very traditional
a claim for what poems can do.

462
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,800
Uh, and, uh, you know, in, in
talking about the wasteland, I,

463
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,100
I stressed,
uh,

464
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:53,101
the ways in which Elliot
sought a language of,

465
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,760
of public ritual that might, um, uh,

466
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:02,770
join people, uh, separated
in the cells of themselves.

467
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,450
Here Auden is working through the same
ideas and providing a kind of model for

468
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:11,740
how that might work.
Uh,

469
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,600
let me, uh, turn ahead with
you to, uh, another, uh,

470
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,150
great poem from this period.
Uh, in memory of Sigmund Freud.

471
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,630
Uh, fried, uh,

472
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,210
is a kind of plowman. Uh, he is, uh,

473
00:35:31,211 --> 00:35:35,800
another model for the poet
for Auden. Uh, and this poem,

474
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:36,960
uh,

475
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,610
proposes still other ways to understand,

476
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,450
uh,

477
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,450
poetry's relation to suffering a
represented here by Freud's humanistic

478
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,030
therapeutic technique.

479
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,260
Yeah.

480
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:53,690
Uh,

481
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:58,690
what sort of hero is Freud a and calls
him and important Jew who died in exile?

482
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,690
Uh, it's significant that
he has called that by, uh,

483
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,480
on, uh, at this moment. Uh, if you,

484
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:13,070
if you look for the figure of the Jew
in Garanti and Eliot's early palm,

485
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,910
you'll see that, uh, the, uh, uh,

486
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,300
figure is not dignified
with the capital j. Uh,

487
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,820
antisemitism is a, uh,
uh, crisis in Europe. Uh,

488
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,540
and it's certainly a
pervasive current, uh, in, uh,

489
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,340
modern poetry, whether, uh,

490
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:36,230
it is actually a theme or
Motif as it appears in Elliot,

491
00:36:36,231 --> 00:36:40,760
or a pound or a simply a, uh, um,

492
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,860
kind of, uh, uh,

493
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,690
voluble prejudice as you would find
it in Williams. His letters, uh,

494
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,460
antisemitism is, is, uh,
powerful. Uh, and here, uh,

495
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,470
Aaden is identifying himself with
Freud as a Jew and as a Jew in exile.

496
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,790
Uh, and, uh,

497
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:06,791
it seems as though Freud in this
way represents a figure for people,

498
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,600
uh,
uh,

499
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,180
who are in some sense
extracted from the nation,

500
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,880
uh, and, uh, who are international
in their perspective.

501
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:20,481
Uh,

502
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:25,481
and Auden himself is writing in
America from a similar point of view.

503
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:30,950
Um,
as in the Yates allergy.

504
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:35,090
Auden is reluctant to single
fried out when, uh, as he says,

505
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:38,510
death is so common and
suffering is so common.

506
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,520
But Freud's point of view for Auden,
uh,

507
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,580
is powerful and valuable precisely because
it emphasizes the common placeness of

508
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,580
human suffering. Uh, its ubiquity,

509
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,470
uh,
um,

510
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,080
he's praised, uh, Freud is,
uh, as the palm a unfolds,

511
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,160
uh,

512
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,600
specifically for the ways in
which he responds to suffering.

513
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,670
Um, his, uh, uh, how does
he, how does he do it?

514
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,103
Well,

515
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,210
uh, around line 28 or so, on
page eight of eight Oh four,

516
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,273
mmm

517
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,380
Oh, Adam says all that he did
was to remember like the old,

518
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,390
and be honest, like
children. He wasn't clever

519
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,070
at all.
He was silly like us.

520
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:43,790
He merely told the unhappy present to
recite the past like a poetry lesson

521
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:50,930
till sooner or later it faltered at the
line where long ago the accusations had

522
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:56,181
begun and suddenly new by whom it had
been judged how rich life had been and how

523
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,630
silly. There's that word again and
was life forgiven in more humble,

524
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,310
no wonder the ancient cultures of
conceit in his technique of unsettlement,

525
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,750
that's what he hadn't called
Freud's therapeutic technique,

526
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:19,390
the talking cure.
It's a technique of unsettlement

527
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,690
the ancient cultures of conceits
seeing it, the fall of princes,

528
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,650
the collapse of their lucrative
patterns of frustration.

529
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,270
If he had succeeded Freud, why the
generalized life would become impossible.

530
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:39,271
The monolith of state be broken and
prevented the cooperation of Avengers.

531
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,760
Of course,
they called on God,

532
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,250
his Freud's detractors,

533
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:53,850
but he went his way like the poet who
follows right to the bottom of the night

534
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,230
down among the loss. People like
Dante down to the stinking fast,

535
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,500
where the injured lead the
ugly life of the rejected

536
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,110
and showed us what evil is, not as we
thought deeds that must be punished,

537
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,340
but our lack of faith are dishonest.
Mood of denial.

538
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,520
The king Coupa since of the oppressor,

539
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,940
odd emphasizes,
ah,

540
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,403
okay.

541
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,650
Freud's, uh, um, um,

542
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,230
literary dimensions, uh, uh,
the talking cure, uh, is,

543
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:38,340
is like a poetry lesson. Uh, it,

544
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,440
it puts faith in speech and
the powers of true speech to,

545
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,620
uh,
correct and reshape and heal human life.

546
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,413
Uh,

547
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,440
it is a technique of unsettlement that
is a threat to princess all worldly

548
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:02,380
authority because it questions authority,
uh,

549
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:07,430
and empowers the individual speaker
to take life into his hands,

550
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:12,720
uh, like Dante or like
pounds Ulysses and Canto one,

551
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,520
uh, uh, like the poet, uh,
in, uh, the end of, of, uh,

552
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,560
the eights elegy. Uh,
Freud in Auden's poem,

553
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,760
uh, goes down among the last people, uh,

554
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,050
goes into the stinking fos,
which is a powerful word.

555
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:33,060
It's a word that appears in Canto.

556
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,400
Yeah.

557
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,570
Uh, where are you list these,
uh, uh, pounds Ulysses goes to,

558
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,190
to seek Tyree cs a foss,
it's an Anglo Saxon word.

559
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,720
Uh, it reaches back in that
sense and cultural history, uh,

560
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,060
to suggest, um, you know, that
are our present mystery. Uh,

561
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,720
excuse me. Our present misery is, um, uh,

562
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,380
one with continuous with that of the past.

563
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,390
Uh,

564
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,390
and yet history is something
here that can be intervened in,

565
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,980
in,
uh,

566
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,920
an individual way through the kind of a
true speech that a Auden celebrates in

567
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:23,340
Freud, uh, and that he
aspires to in poetry,

568
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:26,510
uh, as, uh,

569
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,970
the LG builds towards its conclusion.

570
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,350
Yeah.

571
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,540
Uh,
on page eight Oh six,

572
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,340
again, the night appears, uh,

573
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:46,090
Freud would have us remember most of all
to be in the ass dick over the night.

574
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,910
And it's lost people ourselves,

575
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,920
not only for the sense of wonder
that it alone has to offer night the

576
00:42:54,921 --> 00:42:55,820
unconscious,

577
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,480
but also because it needs our love
for,

578
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:03,530
with sad eyes.

579
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:08,360
It's delectable creatures look up and
beg us dumb Lee to ask them to follow.

580
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,020
That is all the properties
here of the unconscious who,

581
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:19,370
uh, that are identified at
the same time, uh, with, uh,

582
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,360
all those who are lost in
society, uh, and need to be, uh,

583
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,760
represented, uh, and
claimed they are like Freud,

584
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,980
a exiles who long for the
future that lies in our power.

585
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,910
Again, power of speech. Uh,

586
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:42,320
they too would rejoice if allowed to
serve enlightenment like him, like Freud.

587
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:43,190
Uh,

588
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:48,190
even to bear our cry of Judas as he
did in all must bear who serve it.

589
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,240
Uh, Freud here, uh, is uh, uh,

590
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,790
uh, an exile and he brings insight, uh,

591
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,440
but he also brings love.

592
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,033
Uh,

593
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,860
Arden is imagining a kind of
general state of homelessness, uh,

594
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,570
which Freud's technique of unsettlement,
uh, isn't meant to redress,

595
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:19,620
but rather to recognize and accept
and help us adjust to and live in.

596
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:25,630
Uh, Arden's own technique here, uh,

597
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:29,170
is, um, uh, I, uh,

598
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,390
well his verse form is
a simple syllable count.

599
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:37,230
11 syllables, 11 syllables,
nine syllables, 10.

600
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:43,500
The normative 10 syllable line comes
last and fourth and gives a kind of

601
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,560
resolution to each quad train.
Uh,

602
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,980
this a simple pattern.
Again,

603
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,830
accommodates and promotes
a kind of pro speech,

604
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:57,780
a kind of ordinariness that identifies
Freud's work and the poet's work with a

605
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:02,760
kind of ordinary ongoing
work, uh, and, uh,

606
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:07,761
that accommodates rationality
and irrational voice,

607
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,340
uh, as, uh, uh, uh, odd.

608
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,350
And we'll describe Freud's as being,

609
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,630
and yet also accommodates
feeling at the same time.

610
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,390
Uh,
accommodates love.

611
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,760
One rational voice is dumb.
Freud's,

612
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,140
he's silent in over a grave,

613
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,250
his grave to household of impulse.

614
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,770
Morin's one dearly loved

615
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,070
because he understood
how to love our impulses,

616
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:50,210
sad as Erath builder of cities
and weeping in our kick Aphrodite.

617
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,080
Uh, it's, uh, uh, eventually a, a,

618
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,440
a, a, a powerful, uh, uh, moving, uh,

619
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,470
conclusion arrows and Aphrodite
have lost their champion.

620
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,870
Um, I'm gonna, uh, conclude, uh, by, uh,

621
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:17,640
commenting very quickly since
we're almost out of time. Um, uh,

622
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,310
on one last poem, uh, arguably
Auden's, uh, greatest, uh,

623
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,210
in praise of limestone,
a poem written

624
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,530
from the perspective of the postwar,
uh, in the United States, uh, but,

625
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,210
uh, about, um,

626
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,840
a kind of imaginary landscape
that combines elements of, uh,

627
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,750
his childhood, uh, landscape in
northern England. Uh, and the,

628
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,220
uh, Italian landscape, uh,
where, uh, he returned, uh,

629
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:54,660
in the postwar period, uh, and, um, uh,

630
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:59,650
became increasingly, uh, attached
to, uh, it is a kind of, uh,

631
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:04,380
allegorical, uh, space. Uh,

632
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,490
and it represents a kind
of home, I suppose for, uh,

633
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,960
the homeless for, uh, uh,
we, the inconstant ones,

634
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,880
uh, as he describes us. Uh,

635
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,090
it is this limestone landscapes
something to be praised.

636
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:25,520
And it is a poem of praise. Uh, it is, um,

637
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,690
uh,
an image of the world

638
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,940
without another transcendental
world beyond or behind it,

639
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,060
uh, to be in the world as
described in this poem, uh,

640
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,990
is to be in an entirely earthly realm.
And again,

641
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:48,370
you might think of the Plowman,
uh, turning away from, uh, the, uh,

642
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,120
uh, overreach or, uh,

643
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,850
who tried to fly to the sky
and turns rather to, uh,

644
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:58,680
the earth. Uh, it is, uh,

645
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:02,260
a landscape like that of
Steven's in Sunday morning.

646
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,840
Uh, it is, uh, uh, a landscape, um,

647
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:13,350
that Arden can only describe
as a kind of imaginary place,

648
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,930
uh, as a, uh, through
counterfactual, uh, statements. Uh,

649
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:24,610
it is, uh, uh, well,
uh, porous. It's rich.

650
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,700
It's fertile. Uh, it's moderate. Uh,

651
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:31,030
it is not a place of extremes and,
uh,

652
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,440
hermits and Caesar's, they don't
belong here. They go elsewhere.

653
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,460
Uh, it, it's rather, uh, a, uh, uh,

654
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,420
a place in which ordinary
life and ordinary people, uh,

655
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,300
might live. Uh, the very
end of the poem, uh,

656
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,340
is extremely powerful because it looks
towards a kind of a redeemed human life,

657
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:01,260
sees it in this landscape,
uh, and yet represents it. Uh,

658
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,380
in the conditional, uh, Auden says

659
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:07,871
a,

660
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:12,790
insofar as this is an eight oh eight w
in so far as we have to look forward to

661
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:16,960
death as a fact,
something he will never let us forget.

662
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,030
No doubt we are right.

663
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,140
But if sins can be forgiven,

664
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,960
if bodies rise from the dead,

665
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:30,130
and you note the
conditional in both phrases,

666
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,140
these modifications of matter
into innocent athletes,

667
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:40,141
the people that he people's
this landscaped with and
just stipulating fountains

668
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:44,440
made solely for pleasure,
make a further point.

669
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:50,890
The blessing will not care what angle
they are regarded from having nothing to

670
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:53,530
hide deer.

671
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:57,940
And now he speaks to a beloved dear.

672
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:01,750
I know nothing of either.
What?

673
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,820
Uh, what that is, what it would mean to
be blessed or to have nothing to hide.

674
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,250
I know nothing of either of those things,

675
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:14,251
but when I try to imagine a faultless
love or the life to come when I hear is

676
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:18,490
the murmur of underground streams,

677
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,700
what I see is a limestone landscape,

678
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:27,400
a landscape that is Auden's
version of an earthly paradise. Uh,

679
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:32,270
our only image of these
ultimate, uh, uh, promises,

680
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,460
uh, ardent manages somehow here to, uh,

681
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,560
make us see and feel what the
life to come might be like,

682
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:47,590
what it might be like to be blessed while
still acknowledging that we can only

683
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:53,180
live in and be in and speaking,
uh, the world before us.

684
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,260
Uh,

685
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:59,260
which is the one that Auden remains
throughout his poetry dedicated to,

686
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:01,930
well,
uh,

687
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:06,830
we'll go on to a poet closely,

688
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:11,750
uh,
identified with Auden,

689
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,890
uh,
Elizabeth Bishop on Wednesday.
