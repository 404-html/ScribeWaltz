1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,890
Uh, today, uh, last,
last Steven's lecture,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,860
uh, late Steven's Steven's, um,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,600
Steven's after after World War II,
uh,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,210
in the late forties and early
1950s at the end of his life.

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:23,160
That that's my subject really, uh, the,

6
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:27,870
the latest writing that we
will have, um, chronologically,

7
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,750
historically that we will
have discussed so far. Uh,

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,890
one of the general themes
of, of what I had to say, uh,

9
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:42,840
has been modern poetry's, um, uh,

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,910
uh, role in, in a, in
a secularizing culture.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,170
Uh,

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,170
how the general decay of
personal religious belief
and practice enters into the

13
00:00:56,191 --> 00:01:00,480
way in which these poets
imagine what poetry is, uh,

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,320
what it means for them, uh,
what they can do with it.

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,200
Uh, it is a habit with me to be thinking
of some substitute for religion. Uh,

16
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,610
Steven says in a letter,

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,740
my trouble and the trouble of a great
many people is the loss of belief in the

18
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:19,680
sort of God when we were
all brought up to believe.

19
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,180
Stephens, however, uh, responds
to this problem, vigorous like,

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,260
uh, he tends to see it as I've
been saying as an opportunity,

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,150
power and freedom that were
formally assigned to God

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,920
are claimed for man,
uh, for the human, uh,

23
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,050
for the poet in particular.
Uh, but the poet, uh,

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,500
viewed in Steven's not as a
kind of exemplary individual,

25
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,700
but as a kind of a model of the human,
uh,

26
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,720
and have, uh, in fact, uh, common, uh,

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,760
properties and powers
within us. Uh, in general,

28
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:07,761
I would say that the poet stands for
the kind of general human capacity to

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,450
create the world in the act of seeing,
in describing it

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,120
very much as Marie was
arguing, uh, last Wednesday,

31
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,100
uh, Stephens, as I began by saying,

32
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,760
it's very much a poet of this world,
uh,

33
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,690
we are an unhappy people in a happy world.
Uh,

34
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,290
the world however, is, uh, as, uh,

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,220
the origins of autumn suggests
without malice towards us.

36
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,340
Uh,
original sin went,

37
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:46,230
Stevens calls the enigma
of the guilty dream. Uh,

38
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,460
this is a kind of exhausted
fiction that Steven's throws off.

39
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,780
Uh,

40
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,780
he lives in a world that's full of sensual
seasonal pleasures and perceptions,

41
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:02,990
including the primary pleasure
of perception itself. Uh,

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,791
the,

43
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,791
the seasons providing at once a
kind of climate to use his words,

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,150
a circumstance, uh, um,

45
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,510
as well as a kind of
symbol for this way of, uh,

46
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,310
being and, uh, knowing,
um, knowing our experience.

47
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,420
Um, the seasons are kind of a answer. Uh,

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,790
you could save in Stevens
for traditional myth, uh,

49
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,490
providing a kind of a structure
of, of a recurrence, uh,

50
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,190
and, and recovery. Well,

51
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,210
how does such a poet imagine the end of
life of his life in particular can't a

52
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:53,011
vision of the world that's so focused
on happiness really include death and

53
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,280
loss. Uh, can it, can it really, uh,

54
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,730
include in its account of
the world that is so right?

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,610
Can it really, uh, include grief?

56
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,850
Stephen's wants not an alternative
to religion, but as he says,

57
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,060
a substitute for it and
particular a substitute for
the solutions religion gives

58
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,520
to death.
Poetry is a means of redemption.

59
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,180
Steven said, and that, that
adage, uh, and he meant it,

60
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,090
but what exactly did he mean by it?

61
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,670
We'll look at a number of poems that that
suggest answers beginning with on page

62
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,590
two 60,

63
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,050
a poem called large red man reading,

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,730
uh, a, uh,

65
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,950
a palm included in a written after but
include a written after the rowers have

66
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,200
autumn but included in the uh,

67
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,930
volume called the roars of autumn.

68
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,120
There were ghosts that returned to earth
to hear his phrases as he sat there

69
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:20,800
reading aloud the Great Blue Tab.
You lie,

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,580
they were those from the Wilderness
of stars that had expected more.

71
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,900
Those that have come to hear him read.

72
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,570
There were those that returned to
hear him read from the palm of life

73
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,160
of the pans above the stove,
the pots on the table,

74
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,070
the tulips among them and other
sort of domestic still life,

75
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,760
a little like that in
poems of our climate.

76
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,130
They were those that would have
wept to step barefoot into reality.

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,760
They would have wept and been happy,

78
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,050
have shivered in the frost and
cried out to feel it again.

79
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,740
Have run fingers over leaves and against
the most coiled thorn have seized on

80
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:18,251
what was ugly and laughed as he sat
there reading from out of the purple,

81
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,430
Tabula. Now the tab you live have
gotten redder. They were blue.

82
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:25,264
Now they're purple.

83
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Has he sat there reading from out of the
Purple Tabby lie the outlines of being

84
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,580
and it's expressing the
syllables of its law.

85
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,470
Pollicis pollicis,
the literal characters,

86
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,150
the Vac wines,

87
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,760
which in those ears and in those thin,

88
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,590
there was spended hearts took on color,

89
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,370
took on shape and the size of things as
they are and spoke the feeling for them,

90
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,190
which is what they had lacked.

91
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,990
This is a version of the,

92
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,280
the hero poet in Stevens as
a kind of creative force,

93
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,190
uh, uh, figure that appears in Stevens,

94
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:21,160
his poems in many guises
as a scholar of one candle,

95
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:25,510
as the single man, uh, as a rabbi,

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,780
as a, uh, as a giant, uh,

97
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,400
in notes towards the supreme fiction.
He's called the McCullough.

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,280
In what sense is however
this creative force,

99
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:45,220
this giant,
this figure of the poet or reader,

100
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,960
what sense does it mean?
Does it make to call the poet a reader

101
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,090
with the poet does here is read the
world writing as a kind of reading for

102
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:03,850
Stevens. He reads the world
as if it were a poetic text.

103
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,840
His poem is kind of reading.
It's kind of reading, uh,

104
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:09,460
in the sense of interpretation as,

105
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:12,070
and in the sense of reading
aloud is I've just been doing,

106
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,130
it's a vocalization of

107
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,200
the outlines of being and it's
expressing to use Stevens, his phrase,

108
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:27,120
it's a kind of putting into
speech of the world of experience.

109
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,470
The suggestion is that
the poets utterance,

110
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,820
which is something that sounds,
that sounds in the ear,

111
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,730
is it kind of decoding of the
primary text of the world,

112
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,230
suggesting that the world
is a kind of poem, uh,

113
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,300
something that can be and must be read,
uh,

114
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,130
in just the same way that we read
poems on the page. Uh, and in fact, uh,

115
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,470
it's one thing that reading poems on
the page can help us to do for Steve

116
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:04,320
instead is in a sense,
learn how to read the world.

117
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,770
Let's look this figure a
little more closely. Uh, the,

118
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,090
the Creator Stephen's describes
here as elsewhere is large.

119
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,880
Why? Well, uh, Steven's
himself was, he was a big guy.

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,640
Uh, he's, he's, he's a large
too because he's a parent.

121
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,850
He's a grownup.
Uh,

122
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,851
he's a kind of consoling and
comprehensive figure in this poem.

123
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,940
And, and others. He's also large, uh,

124
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,530
because he is an abstraction.

125
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,070
He's in that sense of generalization.

126
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,780
When Steven speaks of the abstract,
uh,

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,180
he doesn't mean the substantial or
invisible, but rather the general,

128
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,140
a kind of representative and,

129
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:01,770
and summative figure
made out of many parts

130
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,290
in this sense.
Uh,

131
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,550
the large red man is large because
he is a kind of abstraction.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,230
He is the sum of many parts.
Uh, he represents, as I say,

133
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,570
a general human capacity.
He's read moreover,

134
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,210
because he's vital,

135
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
primitive in the sense of
primary and our aboriginal.

136
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,200
He is a native American,

137
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,520
a native in the sense that he's
a kind of projection of a place,

138
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,480
uh, located in it, rooted
in, uh, uh, the place,

139
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,640
uh, uh, Adam after all,
uh, means red clay,

140
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,450
doesn't it? He's read also, uh,

141
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,340
because he is red blooded.
He's healthy.

142
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,580
Uh, and, and, and, uh, uh, you
know, keep in mind that all these,

143
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,150
these,

144
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,150
these are properties that are sort of
metaphors for figures or figures for human

145
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,920
capacity,
for aspects of voice and if soul.

146
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,560
Uh, and finally he's read because
he's a reader, a Stevens's punning.

147
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,240
Uh,
he's,

148
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:26,241
he's suggesting that to be a reader to
read is to be able to recognize and speak

149
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,670
the language of the world.
Uh,

150
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,290
and it is in the process
to be reddened, to be, uh,

151
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,220
filled with vitality and
life and native strength, uh,

152
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:39,054
in blood.

153
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,380
What Steven's calls in this poem feeling,

154
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,520
he spoke the feeling for his auditors,

155
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:51,690
which is what they had lacked.
Think of those, those auditors,

156
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:55,540
those ghosts who come to hear the poem,

157
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,180
the poem that he's chanting as,

158
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,730
uh, well as well. There they are.
There are figures of the dead.

159
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,950
You could think of them as a

160
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,640
representing dead parts of ourselves.
Uh,

161
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,050
are ourselves, uh, uh,
living in dead ways.

162
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,170
Uh, you can see them representing
anyone who comes to poetry,

163
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,890
uh, in some, uh, uh, state of,

164
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,270
of death or of deadened feeling,
which is of course the feeling

165
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,760
that, uh, uh, the people
in the wasteland have

166
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,270
a think of them as anyone
who comes to poetry, uh,

167
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,630
seeking to know life and to be creative.

168
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,800
Uh,
renewal regeneration.

169
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,590
This is what the poem gives them.
A, it's what Steven's wants a,

170
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
that's Williams.
This theme,

171
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:04,921
it's Stevens is to pollicis that Greek
word means making a poetry is a means of

172
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,120
redemption because it speaks feeling,

173
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,110
uh,

174
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,110
in feeling in Stevens as a
matter of sense of sentiment.

175
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,440
Some of Stephen's his detractors,
which he has,

176
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,720
it must be admitted a view him as,
as a a, as a kind of sterile, uh,

177
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:36,280
intellectual list. Uh,
this is not true. Uh,

178
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,970
Steven's is fundamentally a poet
of sentiment and in this way is a,

179
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,250
in quite a conventional ways.
A romantic poet.

180
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,090
He has has many defenses against the,

181
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,280
the obvious danger of,
uh,

182
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,560
of being a poet of sentiment
that is sentimentality.

183
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,110
How does he avoid being sentimental?
Well, there's all that nonsense.

184
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,190
And Steven's, there's
the impersonality. Uh,

185
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,840
there's continually, uh, kind
of acute self consciousness.

186
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,290
There's abstract discourse.
Uh,

187
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,990
Stephens is often called because
of that abstract discourse. Uh,

188
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,640
a philosophical poet, uh,
any is a philosophical poet.

189
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,250
However, uh, we need to understand
what that means. Uh, in Stevens,

190
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:31,084
his case,

191
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,820
his work raises philosophical problems
and often does so explicitly that is

192
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:41,050
problems of knowledge, problems of being,
which are problems of epistemology,

193
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:45,860
problems of ontology,
but it's misleading, uh,

194
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,070
to, um, focus on these
dimensions of his work without a,

195
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,880
also at the same time addressing
the question of sentiment,

196
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,050
uh, again from his Adagio, uh,

197
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,550
Steven says a poem should be
part of one sense of life.

198
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:10,030
A palm should be part of one
sense of life since in two senses,

199
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,060
sense in the sense of
understanding is always implicated,

200
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,090
uh,
incense as feeling for Stevens,

201
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,880
the, uh, the priority of, of
sound in Stevens, his poetry,

202
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,210
which is the primary sense
in poetry for Steven's, uh,

203
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,670
the priority of sound and Stevens.
This is emblematic of, of this, uh,

204
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,800
of the priority of feeling,
uh, in Steven's, uh,

205
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,370
emblematic of the priority of
aesthetics for Steven's, uh, aesthetics,

206
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:50,330
the domain of the senses and of feeling,
uh,

207
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,750
the priority of aesthetics over
and against philosophy. Uh,

208
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,660
Stephens is a philosophical poet who
includes philosophy as a kind of partial

209
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:04,140
knowledge within the larger
total knowledge, uh, that, uh,

210
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:09,220
is a knowledge of feeling that the
aesthetic that poetry provides an imparts.

211
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,980
Uh, let's look together at, at, uh,

212
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,960
three palms that,
that give her a sense of,

213
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,720
of this total knowledge
that I'm talking about,

214
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,660
a total knowledge representing
a kind of unity of,

215
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,800
of mind and body for Stevens
that incorporate feeling,

216
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,410
uh,
incorporate sense.

217
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,650
For example,

218
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,450
the poem that took the
place of a mountain.

219
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,030
I'm page two 64.

220
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,203
Uh,

221
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,850
Stephen's like, like his great
inheritor, John Ashbury, I think, um,

222
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,190
uh,
rope titles and collected them,

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,880
uh, and is the author
of, uh, uh, you know,

224
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,910
not just great pumps with great titles.
And here's one

225
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,330
here and in other late,
uh, Steven's poems,

226
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,660
poems that he wrote specifically
having in mind, uh, uh,

227
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,320
producing or reflecting
on his collected poems.

228
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,990
And incidentally, the, this is a
kind of dream, uh, that Stevens,

229
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:34,420
his whole career,
uh,

230
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:39,040
is characterized by that is the sense
of creating a body of work that would be

231
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,590
in some sense total. Uh, his, you know,

232
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,770
his first book is called harmonium
and it's an enormous book,

233
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:49,570
which he waited a long time to
publish. Uh, and, uh, he, um,

234
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,370
uh,

235
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,290
imagined perhaps producing a book
called the whole of harmonium.

236
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,510
Uh, his, his poem notes
towards a Supreme Fiction, uh,

237
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,180
suggests that ambition to produce again,

238
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:07,410
a serve supreme fiction to
kind of total, uh, poem, uh,

239
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:11,050
even as that title also, uh, um,

240
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,640
admits the impossibility of doing so well,

241
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,390
uh, here, uh, late in life, uh, in 1952,

242
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,650
uh, he is, uh,

243
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,700
contemplating his career as a whole
in the body of work he has produced.

244
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:33,960
Uh, and this is a, uh, a
poem reflecting on that

245
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,940
there it was word for word,

246
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,030
the poem that took the
place of a mountain.

247
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,110
He breathed its oxygen.

248
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,070
Even when the book lay turned
in the dust of this table,

249
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,410
it reminded him how he had needed a
place to go and his own direction when he

250
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,374
began,

251
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,960
how in the process of
creating that body of work,

252
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,060
he had recomposed the pines,

253
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,820
shifted the rocks and
picked his way among clouds

254
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,940
for the outlook.
That would be right

255
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,820
where he would be complete
in an unexplained completion.

256
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,870
The exact rock where his inexact
misses would discover it lasts.

257
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,850
The view toward which they had edged,

258
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,840
where he could lie and gazing down at
the sea recognize is unique in solitary

259
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:43,470
home here, producing a poem,

260
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:45,960
producing a body of poetry.
Uh,

261
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,990
living in poetry in the way Stevens
has done is like climbing a mountain or

262
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:57,150
rather it's like both creating
and climbing the mountain.

263
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,850
Both those things step
by step or word for word.

264
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,770
That's that interesting phrase
that the poem begins with. Uh,

265
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,630
usually we use that phrase to
describe what a kind of transcription,

266
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,560
it was a word for word
transcript, uh, or a translation.

267
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,390
It was a word for word translation.
Uh,

268
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,900
it suggests that the poem that Stevens
is talking about is in some sense a

269
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:29,700
transcription or
translation word for word,

270
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,690
which suggests in turn that the world
was even before it was put into language

271
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,140
already a kind of language,
a set of words,

272
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,573
a text.

273
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,170
And this developed the idea that
the poet and Stevens is a reader.

274
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,480
Uh, writing here, uh,

275
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,320
is an act of rendering
the words of the world,

276
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,770
making them over into the poet's words,

277
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,000
making them in this process available in,

278
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,460
in through his words,

279
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,250
what is the nature of this
translation or substitution?

280
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,070
The phrase took the place of,
uh,

281
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,380
connotes both displacement
and compensation.

282
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,720
The poem took the place of a mountain.
It displaces it,

283
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,730
it also compensates for the loss of it.

284
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,710
The world is somehow lost,
always inexperience.

285
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,390
But then also found again in writing,
uh,

286
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:45,391
in the act of creation
that Steven's refers to as
expressing his need of a place

287
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:47,950
to go in his own direction.

288
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,470
It reminded him how he had needed a place
to go and its own direction that that

289
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:57,940
could almost be frost. Uh, that's, that's
the kind of phrase for us might've used.

290
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,540
It suggests both a kind
of public ambition,

291
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,510
perhaps a also personal or
private escape, some kind of, uh,

292
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,480
in any case claim for
independence and originality,

293
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,270
eccentricity, even. It says that in, uh,

294
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,403
um,

295
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,030
remaking the world in language in the
act of going in his own direction.

296
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,340
Uh, the power, this created
a certain point of view, a
perspective unexperienced.

297
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,710
It's what Steven's will call
his unique and solitary home.

298
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,550
Uh, the world according to himself, uh,

299
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,820
which is as it must be for all of us.

300
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Steven says he would be complete
in an unexplained completion

301
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,563
completion,

302
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,740
meaning the end of the climb that is
creation must go beyond explanation.

303
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,260
In the same way that poetry,

304
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,520
the aesthetic must pass beyond philosophy.

305
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,810
Okay.

306
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,810
Even says in another poem that poetry
must resist the intelligence almost

307
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,420
successfully. He, he's,
he's interested in it.

308
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,180
Unexplained completion.

309
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,830
He values poetry's in exact nurses.

310
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,630
It's an interesting word.

311
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,980
His inexact Mrs. Carry Him along.

312
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,410
As he climbs edgewise.

313
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,250
He edges with the implication
that I suppose on a mountain top,

314
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,380
which is a precarious place where
the ground is steep and unstable. Uh,

315
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,260
you can only proceed carefully.
Uh,

316
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,240
you can only proceed by edging along.

317
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,830
Poetry's path in Stephens is a bleak,

318
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,260
tell all the truth, but tell
it slant. Emily Dickinson said,

319
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,850
Stephen's is telling,
is oblique slanted.

320
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,550
He moves edge edgewise in his poems.

321
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,310
He goes up the side of his high subjects.

322
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,030
Yet in this way,

323
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,870
he gives a poetry in the end,

324
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,640
a view of the whole, uh, in,

325
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,650
for all of its imaginings and for all of
its celebration of imagining for all of

326
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:34,310
its celebration of,
of poetry's power to displace the world,

327
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,530
to take the place of the mountain.

328
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,600
The Palm rests on a rock that is real.
Uh,

329
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,640
the rock of the real,

330
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,530
which is a metaphor that recurs over and
over again in Stephen's is late poetry.

331
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,710
You could keep in mind another one of
Steven's is adages and whenever it's late

332
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,400
adage is the real,
he says is only the base,

333
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,600
but it is the base. Uh, this,

334
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,040
this can be a kind of epigraph
for this palm and, and,

335
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,300
and many other Stephen's pumps.
And it's,

336
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,070
it's an important idea
to keep in mind as you,

337
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:14,600
as you try to think about the relationship
between imagination and reality.

338
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,340
In Steven's,
along with the idea,

339
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,370
in fact that Stevens is a philosophical
poet and a kind of intellectual list.

340
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,890
Uh, there is the idea that he
has an idealist, uh, who, uh,

341
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:35,891
because he believes in the power of the
mind to bring reality into being denies

342
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:41,600
the reality of the physical world.
This is another mistake,

343
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,250
uh, as that adage about the real and, and,

344
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:50,090
and the base suggests Stevens,
his last book of poems is called the rock.

345
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,190
Uh, there are many images of,
of material reality, uh, in, um,

346
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,550
uh, uh, late Stephens and
they're important. Uh,

347
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,030
look at the plain sense
of things on to 66,

348
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,700
another late poem.

349
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,660
Think of how many of these pumps focus
on moments of seasonal transition.

350
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,230
Here's another,
after the leaves have fallen,

351
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:24,940
we return to a plain sense of things.
And there's that word sense again,

352
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,150
in all of its multiple senses.

353
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,740
It is as if we had come to
an end of the imagination,

354
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,160
inanimate in an inert savoir.

355
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,330
Okay,

356
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,330
any continues yet the absence of the
imagination had itself to be imagined.

357
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,000
The great pond, the plain sense of
it without reflections leaves mud,

358
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,130
water like dirty glass,

359
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,790
expressing silence of a sword,

360
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,150
silence of a rat come out to see the
great pond. And it's waste of the lilies.

361
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:11,151
All this had to be imagined
as an inevitable knowledge
required as a necessity

362
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:16,170
requires,
uh,

363
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,300
here Steven's is imagining at the,
at the end of the fall,

364
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,140
uh,
imagining what is beyond imagination,

365
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,350
uh,
imagining to where imagination ends,

366
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,510
where it tends it's goal.

367
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Compare this to have a late poem
like a circus animals' desertion in,

368
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:44,751
in the eights were the poets descends
from the ladders of imagination into the

369
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,220
foul rag and bone shop of the heart.

370
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,300
Stevens is treating this theme himself in,

371
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,430
in somewhat different terms.

372
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,570
You could also compare this poem to
Palmer's bar climate, uh, and the, uh,

373
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,443
uh,

374
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,940
will to come to primary terms,
uh,

375
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,450
in that poem or the man and the dump.
Uh,

376
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,750
just as in poems from our climate as
Stephens does arrive at something like

377
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,270
primary terms, what do you call it
here? The plain sense of things,

378
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,010
what might be a limit
or base for imagination,

379
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,803
the real,

380
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,940
his poem moves to recover and
reassert the power of imagination.

381
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,840
Even the end of imagination,
he says,

382
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,150
had to be imagined as an
inevitable knowledge and
inevitable knowledge of phrase

383
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,840
that that equivocates,
uh,

384
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,530
as to whether this knowledge
had to be imagined of necessity,

385
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,900
uh, or whether it's necessity
had itself to be imagined. Uh,

386
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:02,580
which is an idea that that reasserts the,
the dominance of the mind.

387
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,740
Uh, even in its, in its defeat you
could say. Uh, and in this sense,

388
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,071
uh,

389
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:13,071
the poem is a small example of that
long tradition of the Conti and sublime

390
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,550
where the mind is somehow, uh, uh,

391
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,200
checked and odd by natural
a force or natural powers,

392
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,710
something greater than
itself. Uh, and then, uh,

393
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:30,150
recovers its strength as it
recognizes, uh, that, uh,

394
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,180
this defeat is itself a kind of
mental representation or construction

395
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,280
external reality. It's, it's
endurance in its materiality.

396
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,320
A is in fact a kind of
consoling fact for Steven's,

397
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,300
uh, which he a affirms, uh, in

398
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,660
another poem upon, not in your
anthology, but one of my favorites, uh,

399
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,640
placed last in his collected
poems. Uh, and in your Ras packet,

400
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,470
it's called not ideas about the thing,
but the thing itself,

401
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,901
again,

402
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:15,901
a kind of the title suggests encounter
with reality in its primary forms

403
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,930
placed here, uh, at, uh, at, at the
very end of his collected palms.

404
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:33,970
It was a, you know, a
kind of, uh, well, um,

405
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,670
last poem though, it was not by any
means. The last poem, he would right

406
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,780
at the earliest ending
of winter and now it's,

407
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,330
it's not the end of fall,

408
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:50,800
but rather the end of winter that
Stevens is writing about in March,

409
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,980
a scrawny cry
from outside.

410
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,480
And that's a wonderfully
resonant phrase outside the room.

411
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,490
Outside the mind

412
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,270
seemed like a sound
nonetheless in his mind.

413
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,420
He knew that he had,

414
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,450
he knew that he heard it a bird's cry
at daylight or before in the early March

415
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,920
wind, the sun was rising. It's six,

416
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,580
no longer a battered notch above snow.

417
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,150
It would have been outside.

418
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,090
It was not from the vast
ventriloquism of sleeps faded paper.

419
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:41,170
Mashay wasn't something I dreamed
or made up. It can't have been.

420
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,830
The Sun was coming from
outside that scrawny cry and
he comes back to that word,

421
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,140
that scrawny cry.
It was a chorister who see,

422
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,550
proceeded the choir.

423
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,880
It was part of the colossal son surrounded
by it's coral rings still far away.

424
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,140
It was like a new knowledge of reality.

425
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:10,980
Yeah.

426
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,940
The poem begins with a kind of
confusion of inner and outer. Uh,

427
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,940
the cry that the poet hears he wants to
say is outside and it's important for

428
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:24,130
him to say it's outside of y.

429
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,980
If it's not outside
him, then, uh, the, uh,

430
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:34,070
the sign of life that it gives and the
promise of lives continuance would be his

431
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:39,890
own projection, uh, and
would be, uh, something, uh,

432
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,680
uh,
liable to die with him.

433
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,680
He wants proof that the
world will go on without him.

434
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,620
That spring will come again.

435
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,480
The cry is a kind of elemental noise.

436
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,150
The noise of the elements themselves,
uh,

437
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,510
the sound of the seasons changing.
It is a complaint,

438
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,810
a lament alarm,

439
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,630
exclamation shout for joy.
Uh,

440
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,980
it's the sound of daytime
returning and with it spring

441
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,310
at the earliest moment,
kind of emergence from winter and death.

442
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,550
Stephens is a poet of change,

443
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,540
but if change within regenerative cycles
of which night and day in the seasons

444
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,800
themselves are our primary
instances and symbols,

445
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,390
uh,

446
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,390
notice also that the world makes
itself known here in and as sound.

447
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,540
It's something, uh, life
is something you hear a,

448
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:57,380
this also is like frost. The world
is again, a kind of language.

449
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,520
It's speaking to us. Uh, Steven's, uh,

450
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,690
in describing it through metaphors and
similes and finding words for it, uh,

451
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,730
is performing an act of reading again,
of transcription of translation.

452
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,440
Uh,
in particular he is

453
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,520
providing figurative language
for understanding it.

454
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,550
He calls the CRI scrawny. It's
a great word. He uses it twice.

455
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,740
Uh, what kinds of things are scrawny? Uh,

456
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,860
babies are scrawny,
right? Old Manor, scrawny,

457
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,960
uh, both, uh, here. Uh, both ideas are,

458
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:43,961
are held together at this
moment of seasonal transition
when the year is old and

459
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,570
the year is new. At the same time, uh,

460
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,190
that single bird
that gives that cry,

461
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,980
uh,
is the poet's double kind of Echo.

462
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,270
Uh, maybe each are
echoes of the other. Uh,

463
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:07,271
the birds suggests an image of how the
poet himself is integrated into the

464
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:09,890
creative event.

465
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,470
That is the simple ordinary
return of the world with dawn.

466
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,760
The poet like the bird is merely a
chorister of voice among other voices in a

467
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:29,300
kind of harmonium that is total and whole.

468
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,220
In this case,
his c precedes the choir.

469
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,510
That is all other voices that are going
to follow this first one in the morning

470
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:46,080
that see tunes them
here.

471
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,680
Alliteration is important.
Uh,

472
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,710
it links the cry and the choir and the
chorus stir in the coral rings and the

473
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,080
colossal son,

474
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,970
the generates all of them
in a series of rings,

475
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:05,690
coral rings, vocal rings. Uh,

476
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,970
and it's a wonderful image of synesthesia.

477
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:13,971
This is light coming as sound
and sound as light at once.

478
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,420
A kind of total sensory experience.

479
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,440
A Stevens is imagining morning,
uh,

480
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:26,460
imagining it as a kind of
synesthetic event. Uh, and as,

481
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,140
uh,

482
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,140
the arrival of a series
of linked creativity's all
derived from the colossal son

483
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,670
of which the poems bold
and somewhat, uh, simple,

484
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,830
uh, playful, almost childlike
alliteration and punning.

485
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Our instances are simply
forms of this choral music,

486
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,160
the poems linguistic play in other words,
uh,

487
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:04,370
displays the poet's power to link the
things of the world through sound,

488
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,900
to produce connections between
them through words, uh,

489
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,950
and is itself a kind of model and a case
of those coral rings through which the

490
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:19,680
world is coming into being Stevens poem,
in other words,

491
00:37:19,681 --> 00:37:23,250
is a small version of the
creative event it's describing.

492
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,060
It is like a new knowledge of reality.
He says

493
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,090
new because refreshed,
uh, newly experienced,

494
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,710
newly activated.

495
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,380
It's also a knowledge of reality
existing exactly in its newness.

496
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,920
The real is what is new,
what is emerging,

497
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,430
what is fresh carrying change to us?

498
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,810
Uh, pay attention to, to the sun,

499
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:56,850
and in all of of Steven's his palms,

500
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:00,640
but especially in these late poems where,
uh,

501
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,310
the sun is a kind of a mythic presence.
Uh,

502
00:38:05,311 --> 00:38:10,280
the poet waits for the sun,
uh, with the, uh, uh, with,

503
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,400
with the heroin. Penelope, uh,
in the world is meditation.

504
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,260
Uh, Penelope, there's the son's bride, uh,

505
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,850
Ulysses wife, uh, look at
that poem. Is it kind of late,

506
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,010
sublime version of Sunday morning.

507
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,060
Another version of the sun,
uh,

508
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:35,170
of this heroic creative
figure is the giant in,

509
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,970
uh, the poem called a
primitive, like an orb.

510
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,130
This is a summit longer palm.

511
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,970
And I'd like to look at
some of its parts with you.

512
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,400
Uh, the question in this poem,
which is in your iis packet is

513
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,520
it's really the

514
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,280
same question as is posed by,
uh,

515
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,570
not ideas about the thing.

516
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:06,571
And that is what is the
relationship between Stevens's
poem and the poems of the

517
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:09,330
world.
Uh,

518
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,790
what is the link between his creativity
or our creativity in this larger system

519
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,750
of creation that,
uh,

520
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,940
Steven's is poetry evokes or uh,
in the language of this pump?

521
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,070
What is the relationship between Steven's,

522
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:31,000
his poems and the essential
poem at the center of things?

523
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,200
Let me read the second section first.

524
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,040
The essential palm at the center of
things as the, you know, the first line,

525
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,920
it's kind of the,
the theme that he will now explore

526
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,950
and he says about it,
we do not prove the existence of the poem.

527
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,500
We, we don't, we don't,

528
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,630
we can't prove this kind of bigger thing.

529
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Rather it is something seen and
known and lesser poems in parts.

530
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:12,830
It is the huge high harmony that sounds
a little in a little suddenly by means

531
00:40:13,571 --> 00:40:18,010
of a separate sense.
It is and it is not.

532
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,740
And therefore is

533
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,710
in the instant of speech, the breadth
of an accelerando moves captives,

534
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:31,210
the being widens and was there,
you can't grasp it. It passes

535
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,820
that separate sense is the
sense that that Stevens,

536
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:40,660
his poems want to get at
in their inexact misses.

537
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,830
Sometimes in their nonsense, they're,
they're gesturing towards it.

538
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,770
It's uh, uh, it's uh,

539
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:53,920
the existence of that separate sense,
which is a sense of the whole,

540
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:57,430
of a kind of totality,
uh,

541
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,480
is affirmed precisely
through its invisibility.

542
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,000
It's nonexistence.

543
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,950
It is and it is not in therefore is a,

544
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:13,060
it exists in its, in accessibility, uh,

545
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,230
in the fact that it is always gone.

546
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,780
It was always just there.
We feel it only ever in its parts,

547
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:28,530
which are snack Dickies linked to the
whole like the scrawny cry and the coral

548
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,200
rings of the colossal son.

549
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,670
They are parts that point to a whole,
uh,

550
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,820
Steven's carries this idea
forward then in a section for

551
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,381
here,

552
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:50,381
he is a rewriting Theseus lines
from a midsummer night's dream.

553
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,240
Um, the, uh, lunatic, the
lover, um, or excuse me,

554
00:41:56,241 --> 00:42:00,860
the poet, the lunatic and the lover of
imagination all compact. Here he says,

555
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,600
our poem proves another and
the whole while, excuse me,

556
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:09,830
one poem for the clairvoyant men,
the need no proof.

557
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,550
Who are they? The lover,
the believer and the poet.

558
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,200
The words are chosen out of their desire.
That's important.

559
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:21,620
And Stevens and remember,
desire is hot in us.

560
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,600
What is desire?
It is the joy of language.

561
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,920
Is it something apart
from us? No, it's in us.

562
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,460
When it is themselves with these,

563
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,000
with these words, the words chosen out
of desire, the lover of the believer,

564
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,650
the poet celebrate the central poem,

565
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,060
the fulfillment of fulfillments
and opulent last terms, largest.

566
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,810
And now he's going to start
to get a little carried away.

567
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,100
Bulging still with more comma,

568
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,170
moving on to the next stanza until they
used to earth and sky and the tree and

569
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:04,040
cloud, they used to tree and used to
cloud. What was their moment before?

570
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,100
Lose the old uses that
they made of them and they,

571
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:12,430
these men and earth and sky inform
each other by sharp information,

572
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:16,400
Sharp, free knowledges,
secretive until then,

573
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,940
breaches of that which held them fast.

574
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,910
It is as if the central
poem became the world

575
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,790
and the world.
The central poem,

576
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,890
each one, the mate of the other.
And you can think about how, uh,

577
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,790
often when fines, uh,
images of wedding, uh,

578
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,220
we're of mating in Steven's,

579
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,280
such as in the world as meditation,

580
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,690
as if summer was a spouse
espoused each morning,

581
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:55,400
each long afternoon, and the mate
of summer, her mirror and her look,

582
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,130
the essential poem begets the others.
It creates the others.

583
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,420
The light of it is not a
light apart, uphill, rather,

584
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,510
it exists down below in
all of its component parts.

585
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,063
Uh,

586
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:18,870
let me read now sections
seven and following, uh,

587
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,780
it is one of the great sentences in,
in modern poetry.

588
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,950
Uh, it's a, it's a, well,

589
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,320
the poem begins with a declaration.

590
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,360
The central poem is the poem of the hole.

591
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,650
This might seem to say at all,
but rather this declaration, this,

592
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:45,651
this principle is a generative one
that will now go on generating a verse,

593
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,840
a much as this principle in,
uh,

594
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,930
the world goes on generating
the world that we experience.

595
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,300
The central poem is the poem of the whole,

596
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,430
the poem of the composition of the whole,

597
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,430
the composition of blue sea and of green,

598
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:06,690
of blue light and of
green as lesser poems.

599
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,440
And the miraculous multiplex of
lesser poems. And again, by poems,

600
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:16,110
he means well, he means
individual, uh, poems.

601
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:20,080
He also means individual perceptions,
individual creative acts. Uh,

602
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,100
all our forms of making in the world

603
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,600
the miraculous multiplex of lesser
poems are brought then not merely into a

604
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:32,640
hole,
but a poem of the whole,

605
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,980
the essential that is compactive.

606
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:39,600
It's part the roundness that pulls tight,
the final ring,

607
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,820
and that which in an altitude
would soar of this, uh, power, uh,

608
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:49,821
principal or it may be the
meditation of a principal or else.

609
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,650
And here's Stephen's is incredible,
uh, a rhetorical and imaginative,

610
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,161
uh,

611
00:45:56,161 --> 00:46:01,161
ability to keep going and say or and go
on imagining things or else and inherent

612
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:07,020
order active to be itself a nature too.
It's natives,

613
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:11,160
all beneficence, a repose, utmost repose.

614
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,490
The muscles of a magnet aptly felt.

615
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,430
This is what this total being,

616
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:20,550
this total poem that he
is imagining is like.

617
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:25,110
And as he imagines it as a totality,
he starts to imagine it as a person,

618
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,550
a giant on the horizon,
glistening and in bright excellence.

619
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:34,551
Adorne crested with every prodigal
familiar fire and unfamiliar escapades.

620
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,040
We're oohs and [inaudible] sizzling,
such as children,

621
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:43,041
like vested in the serious folds of
majesty moving around and behind a

622
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:47,550
following, a source of
trumpeting Sarah F's in the eye,

623
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,250
a source of pleasant
outbursts on the year. Uh,

624
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,450
it's a wonderful vision. Uh, it
calls to mind the great appearance,

625
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:01,260
the great spectacle of the
appearance of the world scene here.

626
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:06,210
Suddenly as a kind of
majestic giant figure, uh,

627
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:09,750
approaching us, uh, with, um, uh,

628
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,790
the folds of a royal garments.
Uh,

629
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,620
that's what appearance is
like for Stevens. And I think
of, uh, the weather. Uh,

630
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,370
the hills of Connecticut
of sleeping giant, uh,

631
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:26,280
itself as a Stevens
imagines a, uh, kind of,

632
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,580
uh, uh, experience of the
landscape and of the world, uh,

633
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:34,670
as humanized, a kind of
humanize totality, uh,

634
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,790
that is this like a I kind of generalized
and abstract image of the human,

635
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,033
uh,

636
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,090
an image of the human that is realized
for Stevens in and through play.

637
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,590
Uh, it's, uh, uh, the, the,
these, these garments. Uh, there,

638
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,690
there, there's something that pleasure
children and that pleasure us as children.

639
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:03,530
Our pleasure. Uh, the
giant is a kind of, uh,

640
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,360
image of the essential
poem as he calls it. A,

641
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:13,000
and he will go on to describe it
a little bit, uh, further. Uh,

642
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,030
he now says here,
then in section 11,

643
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:21,090
is an abstraction when he's talking
about this general poem that it's given

644
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:24,760
head, uh, in the sense of allowed to,

645
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,930
to go to, uh, uh, to, uh, um,

646
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,510
uh, um, uh, expand and,
and, um, uh, have its way,

647
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,600
but also a anthropomorphized,
uh,

648
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:41,440
becoming a giant on the
horizon given arms. In fact,

649
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,650
a massive body and long legs stretched
out a definition with an illustration

650
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:48,820
that is,

651
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,820
the world is at once a definition with
an illustration not to exactly labeled a

652
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:58,240
large among the smalls of it,

653
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:01,870
a close parental magnitude
at the center on the horizon,

654
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:04,480
consent from grave and prodigious person,

655
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,340
patron of origins. Uh, here,

656
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,770
man is not created in God's image,

657
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:16,610
but rather this image of God in Man's,
uh,

658
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,660
brought into being through play
through all the senses of sense.

659
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,800
Uh, uh, representing a
definition with an illustration,

660
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:31,930
picture and word. Uh, again,

661
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,280
abstract and concrete.
Uh, anesthetic whole, uh,

662
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:38,620
that includes, uh, uh,

663
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:42,030
includes a kind of philosophical
knowledge in it. Uh,

664
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,670
this is what all art for Steven's aims at.

665
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,500
He says simply, that's
it. The lover writes,

666
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:54,730
the believer, hears the poet mumbles
and the painter sees each one,

667
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:58,900
his faded eccentricity as a part.

668
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,150
Everything we do is apart
only apart but apart.

669
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:08,260
But tenacious particle of
the skeleton of the ether,

670
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,430
this big giant thing,
perceptions,

671
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,210
clods of color,
the giant of nothingness.

672
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,600
Each one,
each one of us,

673
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,720
each one thing that we do
and the giant ever changing,

674
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,470
living in change.
That's it.

675
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,790
Meaning that's the end of imagination.

676
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:40,040
It's the sense of, uh, its ending,
its terminus, it's goal. Uh,

677
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,390
but it turns out to be
not no ending at all,

678
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,630
but rather an experience
of a whole that is ongoing.

679
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:53,390
There's an experience of
change that includes death,
uh, includes our own deaths,

680
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:58,370
uh, uh, in a kind of totality, uh, that,

681
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:03,350
uh, is ever changing and
living precisely in change.

682
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,600
Well, uh, we'll go on
to a very different poet

683
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,810
on Wednesday.
Wh.
