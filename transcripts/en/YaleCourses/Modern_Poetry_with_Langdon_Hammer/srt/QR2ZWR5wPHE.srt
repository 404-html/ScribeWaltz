1
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,530
I imagine that you all have images of
Robert Frost and actual images in your

2
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:20,520
mind. Uh, when you, uh, when you,
when you think of this, this poet,

3
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,850
he's a familiar face in
American literature, uh,

4
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,920
and I gathered some of them that
seemed representative, uh, here,

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,460
here is,

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
this is frost and old age as an
American barred from a magazine.

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,350
Uh,
this is,

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,760
this is the frost that you probably
know as if he were born with white hair,

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,900
right? Uh, and, uh, uh, kind of, uh, well,

10
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,840
kindly, uh, and, uh, monumental, uh,

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,910
and yet approachable a
figure, uh, that, uh,

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,690
is familiar from American
school rooms. Uh, here's a,

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,610
another image of that Same Guy,
Robert Frost,

14
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:07,380
painted by Grandma Cox,
uh, uh, reminding us of,

15
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,970
of frost as a kind of linked
to 19th century life, uh,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,590
to, uh, to rural Vermont. Uh, another,

17
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,770
uh,
another image of froth.

18
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,640
This one from the time it's
just a little story. Uh,

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,090
President Hails Bond with Frost. That
president would be John F. Kennedy,

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,190
uh,
on TV.

21
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:36,030
He extols poet who calls new frontier,

22
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,730
age of poetry and power.
Uh,

23
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,640
and perhaps you have seen images of,

24
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,340
of frost reading his poem,

25
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:48,450
the gift outright at
Kennedy's inauguration. Uh,

26
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:52,800
it was a kind of powerful moment
in American culture where, uh,

27
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,880
the president allied himself
with poetry, uh, in this way,

28
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,430
uh, oh, more pictures. This is,
you know, Frost with grandchildren,

29
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:05,250
frost with his pet calves.

30
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,190
He was kind to animals.
Uh, uh, and if farmer,

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,350
uh, this one I like, this
is frost with a stick, uh,

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,650
uh, for us or the branch. You can think
about that. Uh, when you read Birches,

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,280
uh, this is, uh, uh, you know,

34
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,140
a frost boyish even in
age, uh, for us, uh,

35
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:34,890
who also likes to play and even
who looks just a little bit,

36
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:37,540
don't you think malevolent?
Uh,

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,680
all of these images would
seem to make for us,

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,110
not a modern poet at all,

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,860
not a modern poet in the sense that
Elliot and pound established that is

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,730
difficult poet in ways that
I suggested last Wednesday,

41
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,250
a poet resistant to ordinary language
and common frames of Reference, uh,

42
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,940
formerly innovative,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,320
disorienting or Bain metropolitan,

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,370
I think of 19th century art as,
as being horizontal.

45
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,580
Uh, and, and, you know,
stretched out, uh, uh, like a,

46
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,690
a agricultural life in New England.
Uh,

47
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,800
and modernism is all about verticality.
Uh,

48
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,730
from a certain angle.
This is the Stieglitz, uh,

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,480
picture city of ambition.
I showed you last, uh,

50
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,400
last Wednesday, uh, another
pairing, uh, this, this, uh,

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,200
wonderful,
uh,

52
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,230
landscape by Martin Johnson heed
and we could contrast it with,

53
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,840
uh, these images of Brooklyn
Bridge by Walker Evans,

54
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,580
where even underneath the bridge, the
bridge seems to, you know, a, a, a,

55
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,280
a figure of crossing, uh,
themes here to rise up, uh,

56
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,770
and out of, um, uh, the,
uh, the city and the river.

57
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,060
Uh, this is, this is frost.
Before he had white hair,

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,410
a frost at, at 18, uh,
which is I, I believe, uh,

59
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,890
uh,
1892 or so,

60
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,663
uh,

61
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,350
boyish. And his, his first book, uh, is,

62
00:04:22,351 --> 00:04:26,510
is entitled a boys will, uh, uh,

63
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,210
Boys Will Robert Frost.

64
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:33,211
This is a cover of the first edition that
you can go over to a key and see when

65
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:38,830
you, when you open it up and
look at the table of contents,

66
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,600
you see, uh, titles of poems. Uh,

67
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,950
and underneath those titles are
little legends. Uh, and Moralization,

68
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,080
uh, into my own title, uh, Legend.

69
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,440
The youth is persuaded that he will
be rather more than less himself.

70
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:01,300
We're having forsworn
the world, uh, or, uh,

71
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,860
storm fear. He is afraid
of his own isolation. Uh,

72
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,660
uh, these, uh, these are our, our poems.
In other words that, uh, uh, you know,

73
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,050
come with, with little labels to tell
you what they mean and what they're about

74
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,090
bout,
uh,

75
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,520
modernism in Elliot and pound is in,
in some ways is,

76
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:28,290
is founded on expatriation on,
on, on a kind of internationalism.

77
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,190
Frost's poetry seems
resolutely American or,

78
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,920
uh,

79
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,900
at any rate it seems to be there
is in fact a another frost,

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,940
a modern and modernist frost,

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,590
a a frost that is in fact as
international, uh, as pound.

82
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,030
And Elliot, uh, who began his career,

83
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,580
in fact,
uh,

84
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,480
beside them as a London ex patriot.

85
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,910
This is, uh, this, this is
more of a table of contents.

86
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,000
You can see how it's
laid out. Uh, this is,

87
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,950
this is the frost who published
that book. Uh, this is frost at 39,

88
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,290
uh, frost. In a suit
made by a London Taylor,

89
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,600
uh, in London. Uh, and when we
go to the title page of a boys,

90
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:25,010
will we see that, uh, this, uh,

91
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:29,960
New England poet publishes his
first book, in fact, in London, uh,

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,040
in 1913, uh, they're a new Oxford Street,

93
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,970
interesting north of Boston.
Uh,

94
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,700
a a great a book that follows a boys will,

95
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,980
uh, uh, is, uh, it's, you know, is a,

96
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,390
is a title that locates these
poems in a specific place in, uh,

97
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,490
northern New England. Uh, it to, uh,

98
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,960
is published in London, uh, this time, uh,

99
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,790
on Bloomsbury street. You don't really
think of frost as part of Bloomsbury,

100
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:09,740
do you? Uh, but there he is publishing
his book, uh, in that place.

101
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,580
Just like Prufrock,
uh,

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,280
also published I'm Bloomsbury
Street, uh, this in 1917,

103
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,710
uh, north of Boston in 1915, uh,

104
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,670
you remember that table of contents
page I showed you a moment ago with the

105
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:33,671
titles and the moralization
that a frost has,

106
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,600
her boys will well, Uhm,
here's the, here's the, the

107
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,680
modernist table of contents of,
of Prufrock.

108
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:45,080
And of course you and we know,
well,

109
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:48,190
what would the legend for the
love song of j l for Prufrock be?

110
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,090
He wanders around in a melancholy
way quoting hamlet for, well,

111
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,990
no, it, it, it, it, uh,
uh, Elliot didn't do that.

112
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:03,200
Uh, when we look at the table
of contents of this book,

113
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:07,670
which is north of Boston, well, it
looks a lot like Elliot's, uh, those,

114
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:12,170
those little tags that seem
to explain the poetry, uh,

115
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,100
have disappeared.

116
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:18,101
And instead we simply have the titles
of these very great poems mending wall,

117
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,040
the death of the hired man,
the mountain, uh, home burial.

118
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,620
Uh, there's something, uh, in, in, uh,

119
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,930
Elliot's the presentation of Elliot's
work and indeed in the work itself that is

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
a fronting resistant, uh, impersonal, uh,

121
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:41,300
and the topography, the presentation
of the book, uh, is part of that.

122
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,640
Um, it, it's, it's part of, uh,
Elliot's whole aesthetic, uh,

123
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,960
but, uh, north of Boston.
Well, you know, uh,

124
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,280
when we start looking at
these two books together,

125
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,900
it seems to share some of the
properties of Elliot's book. Uh,

126
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,780
and indeed the poems that we find when we,
um,

127
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,290
opened that book, uh, also have,

128
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,330
have things in common with
Elliot's. The other frost, uh,

129
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,040
not the simple, uh,
familiar monumental frost.

130
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,460
But the frost who is a modernist poet
who begins writing in London, uh,

131
00:09:17,461 --> 00:09:22,050
is really quite as cosmopolitan,
quite as learned,

132
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,890
uh, as, as pounds and
Elliot at this moment. Uh,

133
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,390
and yet he uses his
learning, uh, differently.

134
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,520
He uses it very often by concealing it.
In fact,

135
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,403
well,

136
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,310
let me turn from

137
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,520
pictures to text

138
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,870
on your handout today. The
handout number two. Uh,

139
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,740
we have, uh, well there's several
quotations from a frosts letters.

140
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:04,970
And, uh, let's look at the,
the first one first, uh,

141
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:09,620
for us says, uh, at the time that
he's publishing a boys will, uh,

142
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,280
to a friend. Uh, you mustn't
take me too seriously.

143
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:16,490
If I now proceed to brag a bit
about my exploits as a poet.

144
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,360
There was one qualifying
fact always to bear in mind.

145
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,930
There is a kind of success
called of esteem and butters.

146
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,950
No parsnips.
Uh,

147
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,850
it means a success with the critical
few who are supposed to know,

148
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,070
but really to arrive where I can stand
on my legs as a poet and nothing else.

149
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,600
I must get outside that circle to the
general reader who buys books and they're

150
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:47,040
thousands. I may not be able to
do that. I believe in doing it.

151
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,110
Don't you doubt me there? I want to
be a poet for all sorts and kinds.

152
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,770
I could never make a merit of being caviar
to the crowd the way my quasi friend

153
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:02,010
pound does.
I want to reach out and would,

154
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,220
if I were a thing,
I could do it.

155
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,890
If it were a thing I could
do by taking thought.

156
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,743
Well,

157
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,450
frost wishes to be so subtle as
to seem all together obvious.

158
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,170
It's not just that he seems obvious,
but it's really subtle. Rather,

159
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,580
his subtlety shows itself in his
deliberate concealment of it,

160
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,880
in the ways in which he masks himself
and obviousness the problems that that

161
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,990
Frost's poetry poses for us as,

162
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:42,960
as readers are not problems of reference.
Uh, they can't be solved by footnotes.

163
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,760
Compare the footnotes in the
frost poems to the footnotes, uh,

164
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,620
in, in the Norton that you
find next to, uh, Elliot or,

165
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,630
or Palms and the problems that frost
poses are problems of interpretation,

166
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,400
uh,

167
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,260
problems that provoke you to ask
not what does he mean exactly,

168
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,560
uh, but how does he mean that, uh,

169
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,930
is he joking or is he serious?

170
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Is there something on his mind that
he's not saying the wonder of frost is,

171
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,580
is really in his tone,

172
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,380
his way of saying things without
saying them in so many words.

173
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,020
Now, uh, this guy, all of his, uh,

174
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,340
because that's what it entails.
This guile is something temperamental.

175
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,220
I think it came naturally to him,

176
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,140
but it also reflects a
specific literary situation.

177
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,400
The popular old fashioned frost
in the elite modern frost.

178
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,910
These roles point to a division in the
audiences for poetry that emerges clearly

179
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,770
in this period. Uh, the,

180
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,380
the frost to,
uh,

181
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,310
writes a familiar crafted lyric that
would have been easily recognizable as

182
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:10,630
poetry. Uh, and, and that we could
give a little tag to after its title.

183
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,190
Uh, well, contrast this with, um, uh,

184
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,490
the poet of the wasteland,
uh, say, uh, whose work, uh,

185
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,290
would not have been
recognizable to, uh, uh,

186
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,810
many readers as poetry,
uh,

187
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:29,740
and indeed was not a PA.
On one level,

188
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,250
frost was spoke for and to,
uh,

189
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,600
in audience trained by the genteel poetry
of late 19th century America readers

190
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,970
who loved Longfellow,
uh, the fireside poets,

191
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,170
poets who published in Victorian
popular magazines and wrote those guilt

192
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,160
embossed books that,
uh,

193
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,270
cultured families kept behind
glass bookcases and that
you can still find at tag

194
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:00,040
sales on a New England Greens.

195
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,520
That's the obvious frost,

196
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:07,420
the one that the subtle frost
in many ways constructed, uh,

197
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,300
aiming all the time,
not at a general reader at all,

198
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:15,301
but at an elite reader of the new tiny
circulation little magazines where,

199
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,220
uh,
the work of Elliot Williams',

200
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,670
Steven's Moore and others
were first published.

201
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,530
Those magazines I showed you last week.

202
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:28,531
Magazines like Broome or blast or
a rogue or the criterion a frost.

203
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,650
There's duplicity in Frost's
poetry. Uh, and there's, uh,

204
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,370
there's a certain doubleness
in the, uh, um, uh,

205
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,890
figured that he projects,
uh, as a poet, uh,

206
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,320
I like to think of his
obsession with double meanings,

207
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,440
which he has as,
as a,

208
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:55,441
as a way of responding to a division
in culture between popular in elite

209
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,910
readers, uh, uh, division
that he saw as expressive of,

210
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,070
um, uh, uh,

211
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:07,670
division in American culture between well,

212
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:12,320
money in esteem business and art.
Uh,

213
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,090
in that quotation I,
I read for you a few moments ago,

214
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,200
a frost opposes two kinds of success,
one of esteem,

215
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,990
uh, that success with the critical
few that butter's no parsnips.

216
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,910
You can see he brings in the
kind of folksy term to, uh,

217
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,070
well to what, to um, a
disdain that kind of, uh,

218
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,710
success or put it in its place.
And on the other hand,

219
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,310
a success with the general reader
who buys books in their thousands,

220
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,940
uh, frost, one at both.

221
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,690
The opposition is between poetry that
makes money and poetry that precisely

222
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,330
because it is good poetry is
modern poetry defines it does not,

223
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,320
uh,
notice that the latter kind of poetry,

224
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,150
the good kind that butter's note.

225
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,500
No parsnips a is
associated here with frost,

226
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:11,501
quasi friend pound instead of
butter pound rights caviar.

227
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,780
Uh, but you know, it kind of a
European thing, right? Uh, caviar,

228
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,500
uh,

229
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,500
by contrast a frost as declaring his
ambition to reach out to a large audience.

230
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,900
Uh,
it is for frost,

231
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:31,901
a frankly economic ambition by becoming
a poet for all sorts in kines frost,

232
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:39,791
intense as he says to arrive where I can
stand on my legs as a poet and nothing

233
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:45,590
else. Uh, this is this
ambition for a career,

234
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,870
but it's also a desire for
personal autonomy for frost.

235
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,000
Poetry is invested with a,

236
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:57,830
with a longing for autonomy and in
well both simple and complex sense.

237
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,723
Census.

238
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,200
He wants to use poetry to
stand on his own two legs.

239
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,960
He sees it specifically.

240
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:11,110
And this is important as a form of
work that will allow him to be self

241
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:11,954
sufficient.

242
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,140
And self-determining frost was
born in 1874 into a working family.

243
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:21,860
Uh,

244
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,860
his father's death when frost was a
boy represented among other things in

245
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:30,080
economic crisis for his family.

246
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,580
Cross gluing was erratic.
This is impressive.

247
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:39,470
He dropped out of both Dartmouth
and Harvard, uh, and he did so,

248
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,940
uh, to take laboring jobs, uh,

249
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,950
each time enacting a conflict between
intellectual life and manual labor that

250
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:52,830
would be a persistent and
central theme of his poetry.

251
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,210
He worked at all sorts of
jobs, uh, in factories,

252
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,410
a mill on a newspaper. He
was a school teacher. Uh,

253
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,000
and of course he was a farmer too.
Uh,

254
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,150
when his grandfather
gave him a farm to work,

255
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,750
which he did for 10 years
in Derry, New Hampshire. Uh,

256
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
it's in fact at the end of this period
that frost moved himself and his family

257
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,670
to England,
uh,

258
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,830
in a last ditch bid to make literary
contacts and advance his career as a poet.

259
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,210
It was first in England that frost
publish the books that established his

260
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,450
reputation as the pasture
poet of New England,

261
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,610
a poet whose authority seemed to rest
on his being rooted in his region

262
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,740
once he returned to New England in 1916
after north of Boston success followed

263
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,110
on success.

264
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,220
Poetry was a way for
frost out of manual labor,

265
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,850
but it was also a form of work for
frost that was opposed to manual labor.

266
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:08,930
It was an escape from it, a way
of transcending it, but also, uh,

267
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:14,180
in many ways allied to it valuable
because it could be a form of productive

268
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:19,410
labor. Something he could
use to butter is parsnips.

269
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,650
Uh, these concerns that I'm
laying out all inform his poetry.

270
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,463
Uh,
they,

271
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,550
they structure frosts work as a poet
and his ongoing inquiry into that work.

272
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,810
Frost poems perform a kind
of phenomenology of work,

273
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,703
of labor.

274
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,800
They say what it is like to
work at something in so doing,

275
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,350
uh,

276
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,350
they are always also brooding on what
it is like to read and write poems.

277
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,170
Uh,
this is the case with mowing a,

278
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,710
which is in your packet
from Ras. Uh, and, uh, uh,

279
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,140
is an example of one of these
frosty and poems about work.

280
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,490
Let me read it for you.

281
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,450
There was never a sound beside the
wood but one and that was my long side

282
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,970
whispering to the ground.
What was it?

283
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,650
It whispered.
I knew not well myself.

284
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:36,180
Perhaps it was something
about the heat of the sun,

285
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,250
something perhaps about the lack of sound.

286
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,510
And that was why I
whispered and did not speak.

287
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,260
It was no dream of the gift of idle
hours or easy gold at the hand of Fay or

288
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,323
Elf.

289
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Anything more than the truth would have
seemed to week to the earnest love that

290
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:04,420
laid the swale in rows,

291
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,580
not without feeble pointed
spikes of flowers, Pale,

292
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,780
orchesis and scared a bright green snake.

293
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,400
The fact is the sweetest
dream that Labor knows

294
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,190
my long side whispered
and left the hey to make.

295
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,630
This is a, uh, a monologue
by, uh, a worker, a mower,

296
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,700
a,
it is a sonnet to,

297
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,470
to sort of song of song of a worker.

298
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,000
Uh,
notice that

299
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,460
frost is interested at once
in the presence of a sound,

300
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,490
the sound of a solitary worker,
uh,

301
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,620
or to be more precise the sound
of the tool of the worker.

302
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,520
The sound is the sign of his work.

303
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,160
And it raises a specifically
a interpretive question.

304
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,950
What is the message of the work
that the man does? What does it,

305
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,040
what is it saying and what is its meaning?
What was it?

306
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,950
It whispered.

307
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,860
The side is one of many tools in frost.

308
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,710
I asked you to pay it
tension to two tools in his,

309
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,760
his poetry as you read it over the
weekend to work in frost is to use a tool,

310
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,690
tools mediate the worker's
relation to the world.

311
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,523
Uh,

312
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,220
it's what the worker uses to
do things and to make things.

313
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,970
Things are not made up in frost,
uh,

314
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,260
not made up in the sense of imagined
called up out of thin air like fairies and

315
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:12,970
elves. Instead, things in frost are,

316
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,980
are made in the sense of constructed.

317
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,800
There are the products of specific
acts, the acts of, of a worker.

318
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,110
I think of of other tools in
those poems. Uh, there's the,

319
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,730
the spade in home burial,
uh,

320
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,170
the spade that's used to bury
the couple's little child.

321
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,930
I'll talk more about that palm next time.
There's the,

322
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:42,610
uh, the ladder to heaven in after
apple picking a, it's a ladder,

323
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,620
you know, uh, use to, um, uh,

324
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,650
send the tree kind of tool of a scent
that's kind of tool for getting fruit.

325
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,270
Uh, and then there's the
terrible chainsaw and out out,

326
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,163
uh,

327
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,560
in mowing the size makes
a sound as it cuts.

328
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,050
Uh, and that sound is delicate.
It's a, it's quiet, it whispers,

329
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,800
but cutting is something
fearful and forceful.

330
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,560
It's a kind of controlled violence.
Uh,

331
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,780
frost takes it for granted that we will
remember that the side as a conventional

332
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,560
image for time,

333
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,370
which harvests all of us to death,

334
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,500
time and death. Uh, these
are the forces that the, uh,

335
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,770
worker works against, uh, and
tries to Marshall, uh, in,

336
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,550
in,
uh,

337
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:45,550
the process of working his will in
the world to make his way in it,

338
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:49,040
to earn his living,
to stand on his own two feet.

339
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,430
But these, these forces are not
something that, uh, the man,

340
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,040
uh, controls, uh, as a, as a
simple extension of himself,

341
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,890
tools in frost are tricky.

342
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,000
You have to learn how to use them.
They have in frost to kind of, uh,

343
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,870
independent objective existence.
Uh,

344
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:18,020
remember out, out this is, if you look
on page two 13, and your, your Norton,

345
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,720
uh, well I'll, I'll read from
the middle of the, the poem.

346
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,950
A boy is out, uh, sawing. Uh,

347
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:32,480
his sister stood beside them.
The group, he's not alone.

348
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,540
He's with others in her apron
to tell them supper at the word,

349
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,050
the saw as if to prove saws,
knew what supper meant,

350
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,860
leaped out at the boy's
hand or seem to leap.

351
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,350
He must have given the hand.

352
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,020
However it was neither refuse the meeting,
but the hand,

353
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,960
the boys first outcry was a rueful laugh
as he swung toward them holding up the

354
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:04,430
hand. Half an appeal, but half as
if to keep the life from spilling.

355
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,220
Then the boy saw all,

356
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,850
since he was old enough to know big boy
doing a man's work though a child at

357
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,090
heart,
he saw all spoiled.

358
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,970
Don't let them cut my hand off the doctor
when he comes. Don't let them sister.

359
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,343
So,

360
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,900
but the hand was already
gone and the boy dies.

361
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,630
Uh, it's, it's, uh, an
extraordinarily powerful poem,

362
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,910
uh, this saw rather than whispering
it's snarls and rattles, uh,

363
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,160
ultimately it takes the life,
the worker,

364
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,970
it reminds the worker that, uh, uh,

365
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,240
it has the power of death,

366
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,370
the force that the worker only
access accesses through the tool.

367
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,630
Although a frost tools give the worker
a way to impose his will on the world.

368
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,080
The tool is part of the object world and
it declares here brutally and cruelly

369
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,150
that the workers will,

370
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:16,650
is limited and subject
to the tools he uses

371
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,190
in mowing.
The palms lines

372
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,140
are like sweeps of the size
as it lays down rows of swale.

373
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,200
Fros wants us to think about that.
He wants us to see the, the road.

374
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:41,070
The harvest had rose as being like
lines of verse. It's an ancient,

375
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,630
uh, association, uh,
from classical poetry.

376
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,580
The word Swale is interesting.
You hear in it,

377
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:55,230
the s and the w, uh, the
two key sounds of this poem,

378
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:55,980
uh,

379
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,980
which are the sounds of the whispering
Saif frost loves verbal sounds,

380
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,870
uh, and he loves to play with
their metaphorical associations.

381
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,140
He invites us to hear the sweep of
the size in those s sounds themselves,

382
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,940
I think. And maybe even to
hear the workers huff and puff,

383
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:18,540
uh,

384
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,540
his rhythmic exhalation in the Wus which
alternate and interact with those ss,

385
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,260
the whisper of the side.

386
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,130
Then this is what the poem is all about.

387
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,530
The whisper is not.

388
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,730
Frost specifies a dream
of the gift of idle hours.

389
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,890
Poetry is not,

390
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,580
that is to say a leisure
class activity for us.

391
00:28:45,581 --> 00:28:49,860
This is writing against the romantic
idea that poetry is written in, repose

392
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,850
received passively as inspiration.

393
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,950
Poetry in frost is action,
uh, not a matter as,

394
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:03,690
as Wordsworth would say,
of emotion recollected in tranquility.

395
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,600
Frost is also here specifically writing
against the early poetry of Yates,

396
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:12,150
which you'll read next week.
Uh,

397
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,180
poetry that that finds reality exactly
in dream and then has plenty of fairies

398
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:21,630
and elves in it.
A fraud.

399
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,110
A frost is not after easy gold,

400
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,540
but rather hard earned wages.

401
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,880
A dream. Uh, here.

402
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,110
Frost implies that it is something.

403
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:41,070
Dream is something more than
the truth. He has that, that

404
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,690
anything more than the truth would have
seem too weak to the earnest love that

405
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:53,350
laid the swale and rose. Uh,
that's an interesting phrase.

406
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,860
More than the truth.
Why not less?

407
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,650
Why isn't dream less than the truth?
Uh,

408
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,940
frost has made a
suggestive choice of words.

409
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,500
Truth is something less
than dream in frost.

410
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,300
Truth is life sized.
Uh, to get down to it,

411
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:15,580
you have to cut away what is not true.

412
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,620
What is inflated beside the
point, uh, excess ornament.

413
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,690
The truth is something that you get
down to. Uh, the truth is a reduction,

414
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,670
a simplification.

415
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:33,630
It is what is fit for the earnest
love that is working for truth.

416
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,070
Love.
This is a crucial word in frost.

417
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,590
You don't think of frost
as a, as a love poet. Uh,

418
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:49,210
there are lot of ponds in
frost, uh, uh, and yet,

419
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,180
um, uh, even apart from those,

420
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,720
there are many poems that use that word
love often in a crucial places in the

421
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,990
poems. Uh, in fact,

422
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,590
love and desire are really at
the center of Frost's poetry.

423
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:09,850
Uh,

424
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,850
so far I've been stressing a kind
of anti romantic side of frost,

425
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,380
uh, uh, how he seems to be saying
nothing but the facts please.

426
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,670
But the fact he says in that next to
last line is the sweetest dream of labor

427
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,440
and it is earnest love that is doing this.

428
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:37,441
Cutting labor loves labor dreams.

429
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,480
When we look carefully at this poem,
in fact,

430
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,540
the distinction that frost seems to make
between fact and dream starts to give

431
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,163
way.

432
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,090
Let me go back to the sound of this work.
What was it?

433
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,330
It whispered

434
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:05,010
note fros use of words
like something and perhaps,

435
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,310
uh, these are words you are not
supposed to use. And in poems or, or,

436
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:14,310
or even writing about poems, uh, in frost,

437
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:19,300
there is here this, uh, uh, explicit,
deliberate, calculated vagueness,

438
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
a withholding of certainty that allows
a range of possible meanings to be

439
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,650
entertained, held open. It's a,

440
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,780
it's a rhetorical and conceptual
move that I think is analogous to the

441
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:39,710
whispering of the size.
What I mean is, is that, uh,

442
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,530
this tool doesn't speak
loudly, it whispers, uh,

443
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:47,180
and you have to lean forward to hear it.

444
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,040
The same is true with the
poem with any frost poem,

445
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,530
uh,
except

446
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,430
that line 13 seems to violate that

447
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,060
it seems to violate that principle.

448
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,590
The fact is the sweetest dream
that Labor knows well here.

449
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:11,060
Frostings to be spelling things out,
making a declaration, making a statement,

450
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,860
saying what the fact is, uh, in
theming to celebrate the literal, uh,

451
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,570
the fact is the sweetest
stream that Labor knows.

452
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,660
Importantly though, that's not
the last thing. The poem says,

453
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,200
what difference would it make? Had
Frost as he could have, I suppose,

454
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:38,120
have reversed the order
of lines 13 and 14.

455
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,330
Line 13 stands out as if
almost as if out of the poem,

456
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,410
uh, as if out of time, as a,
as a kind of fact or truth,

457
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,570
a fixed principle, a that is stated
in the kind of eternal present.

458
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,860
The fact is like no other
sentence in this poem

459
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,570
had frost decided to end the poem there.
Uh,

460
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,930
he would have said or seem to be saying,
this is what it's all about.

461
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,050
It would, it would be like one of
those morals, uh, following the, the,

462
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,020
the titles of his pump. But
in fact, he doesn't end there.

463
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,370
Uh,
he doesn't make so clear a declaration.

464
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Line 14 returns us to the
work of mowing my long side,

465
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:29,921
the whispered and left the hay to make
returns us to the work of mowing and the

466
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:32,750
work of reading,
uh,

467
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,320
an interpretation in deciphering the poem
ends with an image of process and not

468
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,870
have product,
uh,

469
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,580
an image of the process of labor.

470
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,670
The implication is that it is the
same way for the poet who lays the s,

471
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,710
uh, his words in, in rows, uh, in those,

472
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,420
those, that rose of swale that
are his lines of verse the Hay.

473
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,740
That is well, what the payoff, uh,

474
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,940
what the poem is all about,
what mowing is all about. Uh,

475
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,880
the hay isn't handed over to you.
Uh,

476
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:16,730
it's rather left to make a,

477
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,960
that's a rich phrase.

478
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,970
What frost gives you here in elsewhere
is a poetry that leaves its meanings to

479
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,620
make all the time.

480
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,890
Frost poetry is engaged in,
uh,

481
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,360
construing constructing,

482
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,760
constituting facts,

483
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,260
which means it doesn't give us
the truth as if it were a product,

484
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,800
a fashioned object. Rather.
It gives us a, a process,

485
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,480
an act of fashioning,

486
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,150
an act that is involved with
dreams and desire and with love.

487
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:00,840
Facts are, are made and not found
in, in Frost's poetry of work.

488
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,020
And this is to say that the process
by which facts are made is, uh,

489
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,270
well, it's like work in is therefore, um,

490
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,920
well it's something daily, ordinary,

491
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,800
ongoing.
And for these reasons in completable,

492
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,593
uh,

493
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,650
it's something that we have to do over
and over again that is making up the

494
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:31,644
world.

495
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,870
Poetry is a response to the daily
necessity of getting the world right.

496
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,600
Steven said that,

497
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,910
but frost could have said it
to a meeting in frost poems,

498
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,320
uh,
as in the world that they evoke a,

499
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,880
it has to be interpreted every day.

500
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:54,600
It has to be in that sense
worked for again and again.

501
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,353
Well,

502
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,350
let me use this poem as a,

503
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,390
as a way into now talking
about sound and more actual,

504
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,590
more, more literal ways,
uh, in Frost's poetry. Uh,

505
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:17,360
and to begin with you to think
a little bit about meter, uh,

506
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,350
in fact and what frost does with it.
Uh,

507
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,380
let me go back to the handout
where we've got more passages from,

508
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,160
for us letters. Uh, and,

509
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:35,810
uh,
in particular

510
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,630
what for us has to say about
something he calls the sound of sense,

511
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,090
although he says in that first quotation
that, well, he doesn't like to brag.

512
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,240
I alone have English
writers have consciously set
myself to make music out of

513
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:00,860
what I may call the sound of.
Since this is an ambitious guy,

514
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,600
uh,

515
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,600
now it is possible to have sense without
the sound of sense as much prose that

516
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:13,001
is supposed to pass muster but makes
very dull reading and the sound of sensor

517
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,320
that sense as an Alice in wonderland,
which makes anything but dull reading.

518
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,930
This is a wonderful metaphor,

519
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:26,890
the best place to get the abstract sound
of census from voices behind a door

520
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,570
that cuts off the words you understand
what frost meantime that he's,

521
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,580
he wants us to think about how we
could understand what people are saying

522
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:37,750
without,
uh,

523
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,780
taking in the words that they're using
simply a by catching the tones and

524
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:48,700
rhythms of their exchanges.
The sound of sense.

525
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:53,701
Then you get that it is the
abstract vitality of our speech.

526
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,990
It is pure sound,

527
00:38:55,991 --> 00:39:00,991
pure form one who concerns himself with
it more than the subject is an artist.

528
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,563
But remember,

529
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,260
we're still talking merely of the raw
material of poetry and ear and an appetite

530
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:16,510
for these sounds of sense is the
first qualification of a writer,

531
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:18,490
be it of prose or verse.

532
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,240
But if one is to be a poet,

533
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,260
he must learn to get cadences
by skillfully breaking
the sounds of sense with

534
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,050
all their irregularity of accent.

535
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:36,950
Okay.

536
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,140
Across the regular beat of the meter

537
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,640
verse in which there is nothing but
the beat of the meter furnished by the

538
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:48,641
accents of the polysyllabic words we
call dog role versus not that neither is

539
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,310
the,
is it the sound of sense alone?

540
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,650
It is the resultant from those two.

541
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,700
There are only two or three meters
that are worth anything. Uh,

542
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,960
we depend for a variety on the infinite
play of accents in the sound of sense.

543
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,520
Fros sound, sound of sense. Uh,

544
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,260
the abstract vitality of our speech.

545
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:21,260
It has to do exactly with
how people say what they say.

546
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,750
These are our,
uh,

547
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,760
dimensions of communication that I've
been identifying in mowing with the

548
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:33,290
whisper of the side. That is a tone
of meaning or a way of meaning.

549
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:38,720
Uh, the sound of sense,
it represents a common,

550
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,660
common vernacular.
Elements of speech.

551
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,800
The sounds of sense are all
part of language in use, uh,

552
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,830
which people are using to do things with.

553
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,520
But for us, justice, uh, poetry is
not only that, it's something more,

554
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:58,700
it's the sound of senses.
He says broken.

555
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,120
And that's another interesting metaphor.
It's broken.

556
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,220
He says skillfully across
the beat of the meter.

557
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,690
A meter is something regular.
It's a fixed scheme.

558
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,860
It's inflexible as frost conceives of it.
Here,

559
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,450
the speaking voice by contrast
is something idiosyncratic.

560
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,160
Your regular particular,
uh,

561
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:31,270
ms second quotation or rather the last
on the page with the second one about the

562
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:34,680
subject. Um, for us says,

563
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,930
my versification seems to bother people
more than I should have expected because

564
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,080
he seemed to ears tutored in 19th
century norms to have a kind of,

565
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,200
uh, a rough and irregular, uh, um,

566
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,433
metric,

567
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,670
I suppose because I've been so long
accustomed to thinking of it in my own

568
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:01,550
private way.
It is as simple as this.

569
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,940
There are the very regular preestablished
accent and measure of blank first

570
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,900
blank first. That is, and I'll
explain it, uh, unrivaled.

571
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:16,930
I ambig pentameter and there are the
very irregular accent in measure of

572
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:19,670
speaking intonation.

573
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,200
I am never more pleased than when I can
get these into strained relations for us

574
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,170
wants to create a sound effect of
strained relation in his poetry,

575
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,570
uh, where a strained relation
between speech and meet her.

576
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,960
I like to, and again, the same word.

577
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:46,961
I like to drag and break the intonation
across the meter as waves first comb and

578
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:52,760
then break stumbling on the shingle.
And now I'm writing a poem. It seems,

579
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,440
uh,
that's all he says,

580
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:58,070
but it's no mere figure of speech though
one can make figures enough about it.

581
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:03,260
Uh, and in fact, uh, you can see for
us doing that in his poetry very often,

582
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,130
uh,
strained relation,

583
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,090
this tension between speech and pattern,
uh,

584
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:15,380
suggest the tension between all
sorts of contending forces in frost,

585
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,380
the vernacular and the literary,

586
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,260
the concrete and the abstract flux fixity

587
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,020
the individual will and material fact,

588
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,430
the special sound of Frost poems,
uh,

589
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,460
results from the tensions between these
pairs of opposing forces as they are

590
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:42,800
embodied in his language.

591
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,440
To approach this,
uh,

592
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,450
you'll need to know a
little bit about meter.

593
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:56,170
Uh, in fact, uh, a rough grasp
on traditional English meter is,

594
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:57,530
is essential to frost.

595
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,920
And it's also important to other
poets. We'll read to Stevens, say,

596
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,350
uh, or to crane or to Auden or bishop. Uh,

597
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,260
obviously these are, these are our,
our poets, uh, uh, who, who work, uh,

598
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,420
usually in, in, uh,
quite traditional meters.

599
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,670
And yet it's also important,
uh,

600
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,610
for reading pound and for reading
Eliot and for reading more, uh,

601
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,430
who sound the way they do,
uh,

602
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,310
partly because they make a
point of not writing Pentameter,

603
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:35,670
the meter that frost often,
but not always chooses.

604
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,030
Uh, how many, uh, of, you know what I am?

605
00:44:41,031 --> 00:44:44,230
The pentameter is don't be
shy. Let's see, I sat with,

606
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,920
uh, okay. Um,

607
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,670
I'm going to spend a little bit of time
at the beginning of class next time, uh,

608
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,180
talking about it and, and, uh, working
with you a little bit. Uh, as we, uh, uh,

609
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,110
read, um, uh, frost in particular, we can,

610
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:08,370
we can use the palm birches,
uh, to, to do that. Uh,

611
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,200
don't be distressed if you're
unfamiliar with it. Uh, um, knowing,

612
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:16,820
uh, what, uh, I ambit
pentameter is, is not a, uh,

613
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,470
a gift of birth, but rather, uh,

614
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,800
something that comes through
a little bit of practice,

615
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,460
which means you have to work at
it a little bit. Uh, and I will,

616
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:30,360
in order to enable you to do
that, uh, give you, uh, a well,

617
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:34,680
or I actually asked that the
tfs in section two, a handout,

618
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,360
a meter exercise that you
can do for next week, um,

619
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,120
when, uh, when you leave today, uh,
I would like to, uh, collect, uh,

620
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,540
cards just to figure out how many
of us there are. Um, and, uh,

621
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:53,260
as I say on Wednesday, uh,
between the online, um,

622
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,590
registration, uh, and, um, uh, are, um,

623
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,910
uh, work on it in a class, we should
be able to get our sections ordered.

624
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,770
So see you on Wednesday.
