1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,580
Wh Auden,

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,290
western [inaudible].
Uh,

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,510
there really is no more dramatic,
uh,

4
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,110
a contrast in this course, I think, uh,

5
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:35,170
then then to go from late
Stephens to early on,

6
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,350
uh,
in

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,240
Stephens is a boring Oh, uh, Oh,

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,340
20 years before. Um, uh, uh,
I'm, um, goes on writing,

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,300
uh, to his death in 1973. Uh,

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,740
so his career is somewhat
later, uh, then Stevens,

11
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:01,500
but again, uh, we're doing something a
little complicated. We're moving from, uh,

12
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,300
Stevens, his poems of
the late, uh, excuse me,

13
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:09,010
late 1940 [inaudible] early 1950s now to,
uh,

14
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,280
odd and, uh, and his early career, uh,

15
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:17,140
including poems are written in
the very late 1920s in the 1930s.

16
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:20,560
And we'll, we'll get up to, uh, uh,

17
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,680
the start of World War
Two by the end of class.

18
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:25,990
Uh,

19
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,990
so in one sense we're going back
in time back in literary history,

20
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:36,460
back and a cultural history,
uh, moving from the 1950s,

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,600
from, uh, this postwar
moment in which, uh,

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,050
Steven's is riding his late palms to,
uh,

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,930
an earlier phase. Uh,
at the same time, uh,

24
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,890
we are also, however, moving forward
in a sense in literary history,

25
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,450
uh, moving forward, uh,
to a, a poetry that, uh,

26
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,060
is distinctly, uh, and, uh,

27
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,590
very asley a poetry that
comes after modernism.

28
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,080
Uh, and, and to that extent that we
could think of as post modernist, uh,

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,210
it is, uh, well what do we
mean by that and what do,

30
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,260
what do I mean,

31
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,823
uh,

32
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,880
with Stevens in mind,

33
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,190
there are no giants and Auden,
uh,

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,560
their, uh, everything is a life size. Uh,

35
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,640
poems don't take the place of mountains.
Uh,

36
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,720
rather they,
you could say take place among them.

37
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,520
And in mountains figure,
interestingly in, uh, uh,

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,050
Auden's poetry and a number of places,
uh,

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,070
in Arden, there is no new
knowledge of reality to be had.

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,140
Uh,
in fact,

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,350
there's only a old wisdom
that nobody wants to face.

42
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,800
The, the modernism turns
on a kind of, uh, access,

43
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,930
uh, you could say a modernism
as wasteland or as bridge,

44
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,690
uh, uh, state of cultural decay in crisis,

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,670
or if promise, uh, and,
uh, celebration, uh,

46
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,400
pound Eliot on one side,
a crane,

47
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:33,401
Stevens on the other well
oddness beyond these debates,

48
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,660
they don't matter much
to him. Uh, he is, uh,

49
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:42,590
in a sense beyond, uh, the nostalgia of,

50
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,990
of the one side. And he's also, uh, quite,

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
uh, uh, self consciously beyond, uh,

52
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:56,500
the romantic exaltation of the other,
uh,

53
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:00,660
on, uh, is, uh, uh,

54
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,630
a British poet.
Uh,

55
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,860
he writes out of the distinctly
British tradition a tradition in which,

56
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,680
uh,

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,420
well tradition itself is in
a sense taken for granted.

58
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,520
It's something that they're accessible,
uh,

59
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,440
part of the poets,
uh,

60
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,250
repertoire that needed to be
either struggle for or against,

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,360
uh, industrial capitalism. Hart Crane is,

62
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,050
is all excited about this stuff.
Uh,

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,820
it's an old thing in the
north of England. Um, uh,

64
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,320
and, and, uh, Auden's
early poems take place in,

65
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,030
in a, um, a landscape of, uh, uh,

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,890
now, uh, fading, uh, and century old,

67
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,960
uh, industry, uh, early on.

68
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,470
Uh, later on. Um,

69
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,610
these are our, our,
uh, characters, uh, uh,

70
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,380
as well that are important to
the history of ans reception.

71
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,980
There's been a tendency to see his
career is coming in to have a divided by,

72
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,880
uh, his immigration, uh,
to, um, the United States.

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,220
Uh, and, uh, uh, the very end of 1938,

74
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,900
um, uh, a British Auden and then, uh,

75
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,490
in American on, uh, both Auden's,

76
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,410
uh,
you could say have a distinct characters.

77
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,370
Uh, early on, early on, uh, a,

78
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:57,400
a poet, a born in the city of York, uh,

79
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,790
the son of a doctor,
uh,

80
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,540
interested in natural science, uh,
and in scientific ways of knowing,

81
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,000
uh, a poet for whom science,
uh, was not an enemy,

82
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,640
but rather a kind of tool,
uh,

83
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,030
a point of view or perspective,
uh,

84
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,390
expressed importantly, uh,
for a, uh, early on in, uh,

85
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,380
uh, the work of Freud,
uh, the work of Freud,

86
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,350
but also the work of Marx.
Uh,

87
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,630
the early on is,

88
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,610
is not an Orthodox Marxist and
certainly not a communist party member.

89
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,430
Uh, but Marxism is important to
him. Uh, it's part of a worldview.

90
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,530
Uh, it's worked into his
sense of the world as a, uh,

91
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,240
seen, uh, where social classes
compete and struggle with each other.

92
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,000
Uh, and where the important
choices to be made are, uh, uh,

93
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,870
moral ones. Um, uh, moral ones that, uh,

94
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,580
enter into our political choices.
Uh,

95
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:10,730
it's also, uh, a, uh, uh,

96
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,700
uh,
uh,

97
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,660
the case in Auden's early poetry that,
um,

98
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,310
that he tends to conceive of the
world and a kind of us and them, uh,

99
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,670
construction. Uh, there's a,

100
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,580
a sense in the early poems
of, uh, extreme privacy, uh,

101
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:39,500
and the privacy of address, uh, the
way in which the poet speaks to us.

102
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,850
Uh, the way in which he
conceives his point of view. Um,

103
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,430
these early poems conceive a kind of,
uh,

104
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,970
you could say cooter re
audience, uh, who are, um,

105
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,110
uh, um, Auden's, uh, intellectual,

106
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,510
a leftist, a largely gay friends, uh,

107
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,990
at Oxford where he's, uh, uh,

108
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,740
riding his earliest poems.
Uh,

109
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,510
homosexuality is an important
context, uh, for, um,

110
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,650
uh, this early Odden and, and, uh,

111
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:23,080
his ways of imagining himself
and talking to us, uh, uh,

112
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,610
Auden's, um, uh,

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,780
odd and comes with a kind
of a embattled, uh, uh,

114
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,790
necessarily secretive,
uh, and, and, uh, uh,

115
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,300
self protective, uh, investment in,

116
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,030
in intimate relationships. There
there's something that have to be, uh,

117
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,790
fought for, um, um, they are prized,

118
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,480
uh, and they, um, uh, uh,

119
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,130
are something that must be
protected, uh, from, um,

120
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,560
the intrusions of, uh, other hostile, uh,

121
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:02,580
or disapproving eyes.
Um,

122
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,293
uh,

123
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,420
yeah. Well, let's, let's
look at an early poem here.

124
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,460
Uh, this is, um, uh,

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,620
in your, um, all right. Yes.

126
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,543
Packet.

127
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:25,783
Okay.

128
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,930
From the very first coming down,
it's, it's, uh, called, uh,

129
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,210
I'll, uh, I'll, I'll show you some,

130
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
some photos first before
getting into poem. This is, uh,

131
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,510
this is one I like a of the Oxford Auden.
Um,

132
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,820
uh, a, a sensitive boy, uh,

133
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,460
with the, uh, um, um,

134
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,530
interesting legend that he has,
uh, uh, applied to himself here.

135
00:09:55,531 --> 00:10:00,300
Probably in retrospect, the
cerebral life would pay. He said

136
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,350
it was going to be a, he was going to
make it work to be an intellectual. Um,

137
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,840
this is, uh, another
one, uh, uh, on, uh, the,

138
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:17,490
the, the rakish a young on, uh, uh,

139
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,450
this one also with, um, a, a,

140
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,130
a kind of a legend on top, uh, uh,

141
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,560
you know, Adam's hand where he
calls himself Utopian youth,

142
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,450
grown old Italian, uh, as in fact,

143
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,220
this was a certain kind of trajectory.
He would live, uh, starting,

144
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,320
uh, as a kind of Utopian youth.
And then, you know, later, uh,

145
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,770
learning how to relax and
have a good time in Italy. Um,

146
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,010
the, uh, uh, let's see here.

147
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah, I want to, um,

148
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,830
great. I've got my slides somewhat
backwards. So this is, um, uh,

149
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:05,580
Auden's poems. His first book, uh,

150
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,830
I believe it's 1930.
Uh,

151
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,770
they're written in a while.

152
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:15,720
He's a student at Oxford and,
uh,

153
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,910
um, excuse me, um, includes, uh,

154
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,660
poems that are this one that
I'll discuss in a moment,

155
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:29,010
but it's worth throwing them on the page.
Uh, they're laid out without titles.

156
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:33,780
Again, I'm somewhat as, um, uh,

157
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,520
Williams. His early poems are
presented. Uh, they are, um,

158
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,850
uh,
uh,

159
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,570
sat here almost sort of secretively,
uh,

160
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,340
I'd like to say without that, um,
public introduction of a title,

161
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,091
uh,

162
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:56,091
and well as I am suggesting of
some degree of self protection and,

163
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,250
um, a reticence are, uh,

164
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,490
important qualities and in fact,

165
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:08,350
themes of this early poetry.
Uh,

166
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,030
let, let's take a look at this poem
that, uh, I've got up on the, uh, screen,

167
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,100
uh, right now, uh, which is, uh,
called from the very first coming down.

168
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,720
Uh, that's the first line of
the poem and it's, um, uh,

169
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,090
generally known that way.
Um,

170
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,360
from the very first coming down into a
new valley with a frown already we're,

171
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,490
we're listening to a polity
rhymes, uh, because of the sun.

172
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,550
And the last way you certainly remain,

173
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,390
uh, there's a, you hear there's an
eye, the palm is a kind of letter. Uh,

174
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:52,900
and in fact, a kind of love letter. Uh,

175
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,110
today I crouching behind the sheep pen
and this is that northern landscape that,

176
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:03,370
that uh, uh, Auden comes from.

177
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
A I crouching behind a sheep pen,

178
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:11,161
heard travel across a sudden
bird cry out against the storm.

179
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:16,261
And found the years Arca Completed
Round and loves Warren Circuit.

180
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,410
Re begun endless with no
dissenting turn shall see,

181
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:29,281
shall pass as we have seen the swallow
on the tile springs green preliminary

182
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:33,670
shiver past a solitary truck,

183
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:37,030
the last shunting in the autumn.
And so on.

184
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Your letter comes speaking
is you speaking of much,

185
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,340
but not to come. The letter
comes, uh, in a sense,

186
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,930
uh, from an intimate of
friend, perhaps a lover, uh,

187
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,880
uh, saying much in yet, uh,
were given no content to it.

188
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,620
Uh, it's a veiled in that
sense, uh, it speaking of much,

189
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:08,890
but much that is not to come.
It seems,

190
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,860
uh,
it,

191
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,040
it's very content and
promises it seems withheld.

192
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,553
Uh,

193
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,800
then there's this further stanza
nor speech is close nor fingers numb

194
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,050
if love not seldom has received
an unjust answer was deceived.

195
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,440
This, this early on is, is,

196
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:39,020
has this highly compressed syntax,
uh,

197
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,290
that requires you to kind of put the
sentences together and fill in parts that

198
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:50,140
seemed to have been, uh,
occluded, uh, in the poets, uh,

199
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,810
compressing a of language.
Um, again, uh, uh,

200
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,110
an almost veiled form of speech.
Uh,

201
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,200
odd and says I decent with the seasons
move different or with a different love

202
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,520
is a sense that the love that he,
that animates him is a different love.

203
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,150
It sets him apart nor he doesn't
question over much the nod,

204
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,530
the stone smile of this country.

205
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,950
God that never was more reticent,

206
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,470
always afraid to say more than it meant.

207
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,610
Uh, there's an intimacy that
the poem establishes here, uh,

208
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,720
with the you, uh, and with
us as readers, um, that,

209
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,260
uh,

210
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,260
suggests a kind of implied
shared knowledge that the
poem nonetheless does not

211
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:55,370
openly declare a and doesn't specify,

212
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,680
but rather remains reticent about.

213
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,070
And we're invited into that reticence,
uh,

214
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:04,670
as well as the poets scruple,
uh,

215
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,890
expressed here as,
uh,

216
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,540
the wisdom of that country,
God,

217
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,660
which it's hard to know exactly how
we're supposed to interpret that,

218
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:15,770
whether that's, uh, uh,

219
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,790
actual figure or a kind of a
stone in the landscape that,

220
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:26,240
that the poet is animating in this
way. But in any case, seeing that,

221
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:31,160
that figure that country God as
emblematic of a, uh, a reticence, uh,

222
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,780
that scruples,
not to say more than it meant,

223
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,220
uh, in other words,
uh, there's, well, you,

224
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,010
you could compare this to Marianne
Moore's investment in restraint,

225
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,380
a very closely related,
uh, uh, in, in its,

226
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:56,330
um, moral, uh, valence
is, um, the idea here,

227
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,090
uh, is, is one that's
crucial in Ogden, uh,

228
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,510
throughout his career.
Uh,

229
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,780
that is the poet wishes to master
his intentions as a speaker.

230
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,960
He does not wish to
say more than he means,

231
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,360
and he means to say what he means,
uh,

232
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,800
and to insist on, um, uh,

233
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,910
meaning what he says. This is, uh,

234
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,890
this is a long way from,

235
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:32,891
its very different from
Wallace Stevens is a lavish,

236
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,910
uh, forms of play. His,
uh, uh, interest in,

237
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,100
um, uh, in exactness, uh, or, uh, uh,

238
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,150
poems that might resist the
intelligence almost successfully.

239
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,753
Uh,

240
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,700
odd wants very much to say what he means.

241
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:58,270
And he wants us to, uh, be
able to, to grasp that, um,

242
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,810
this, uh, uh,

243
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,680
well on conceives of poetry and of
language generally as a sphere of moral

244
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,530
action, uh, in which
truth is always at stake.

245
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,100
Uh, where, uh, the poet specific, uh,

246
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,120
office is to control and use
language in a kind of a responsible,

247
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,620
uh, and, uh, honest way. Um,

248
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,340
this is a poet wants to be honest.
Uh,

249
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,290
poets have not always wished
this. Uh, uh, you can,

250
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,910
you can think about Hart Crane,
uh, saying, uh, sleep, death,

251
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:46,080
desire, hasten while they
are true. Uh, in other words,

252
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,960
a crane's, uh, investment, uh,

253
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,730
willing investment in what
he recognizes as a illusion,

254
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,990
uh, or, or, um, you know,
a kind of temporary truth.

255
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,990
Uh, Arden is a rather, uh, uh,

256
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,020
morally bound to a
responsible for what he says.

257
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,910
Uh, he's concerned, uh, in this sense, uh,

258
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,150
with the limits of poetry, uh, with, uh,

259
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,490
saying only what's meant.
Um,

260
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,240
again, uh, a connection should
be drawn to a Marion Moore who,

261
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,650
who share something with
a odd in this way. Uh,

262
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,160
you remember her long
poem, um, uh, poetry. Uh,

263
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,820
I too dislike it. Uh, uh,

264
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:43,680
there must be something important
beyond all this fiddle. Uh, and yet, uh,

265
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,800
you know, after reading it
with a con perfect content
for it, when discovers, uh,

266
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,990
nonetheless, uh, a place for
the genuine, uh, she says,

267
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:56,960
or something very close to that. Um,
well that's the beginning in, um, uh,

268
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,140
Maura's case, uh, of a very
long, uh, an extravagant poem,

269
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,300
which over the course of her career,
uh, as she returned to it, uh,

270
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:11,100
and sought to tell the truth
in her poem and, and, uh, to,

271
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,120
uh, insist on a what was
genuine, uh, she eventually, uh,

272
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,910
cut, uh, to only those
lines, uh, more, uh,

273
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:25,580
was as a poet, a rigorous, uh,

274
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,390
self reviser, um, who,
um, you know, cuts out,

275
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,500
uh, pieces, uh,

276
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,420
of her poems who cuts out individual
poems from her body of work. Uh,

277
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,090
so was Aaden Aaden,

278
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,300
uh, uh, importantly, um, uh,

279
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,500
revised his poems, uh, sometimes, uh,

280
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,780
uh, on multiple occasions,
uh, uh, always, uh,

281
00:20:55,781 --> 00:21:00,770
as, uh, he collected them and
return to them in later, uh, uh,

282
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,470
volumes. There are a
couple important, um, uh,

283
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:08,350
examples of this, uh, including

284
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,920
the pumps, Spain, uh, on, uh, page 791,

285
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,990
um, uh, a poem that Auden wrote,

286
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,800
uh,

287
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,520
in response to, uh, the
Anti Fascist struggle, uh,

288
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,950
in the Spanish civil war, uh,
which he participated in a,

289
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:36,710
and it is, uh, a, uh, uh, a,

290
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,030
a poem that,
um,

291
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,780
Complex Lee, uh, and yet nonetheless, uh,

292
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,300
strongly, uh, comes to affirm the, um,

293
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,720
uh, uh, priority of, uh, making, um,

294
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,123
um,

295
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,870
political commitments over a and above,
um,

296
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,760
uh, it appears, um, uh,

297
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,250
individual moral
discriminations, uh, and, uh,

298
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,380
other, uh, forms of, um, uh,

299
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,370
individual commitment.
Uh,

300
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,940
and there are ideas expressed in this,

301
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:26,130
a poem that became an anthem and one
of, uh, Auden's most, most famous,

302
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,810
uh, uh, poems of the 30s. Uh, well,

303
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,190
let me give you just a few
lines from it. Uh, and, um, uh,

304
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,930
page seven,
93,

305
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,540
um,
uh,

306
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,230
stirring us to March, uh, uh, odd, uh,

307
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,920
says, uh, tomorrow, perhaps
the future, uh, tomorrow,

308
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,740
the rediscovery of Romantic love, uh, uh,

309
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,620
uh, and so on. But today,

310
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,560
okay.

311
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,910
On Line 93, the deliberate
increase in the chances of death,

312
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,430
even the conscious acceptance of
guilt in the necessary murder.

313
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,751
Today,

314
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:18,920
the expanding of powers on the flat of
femoral pamphlet and the boring meeting

315
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,490
he's calling us to do the work
of revolution and postpone, um,

316
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,690
uh, as a goal, uh,

317
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,810
the rediscovery of a romantic
love and other Utopian projects,

318
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,370
uh, Auden would, would come to, uh,

319
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,130
find the morality of this
poem, um, objectionable, uh,

320
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,600
and uh,
uh,

321
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,630
to repudiate the notion that we should
ever accept a guilt in the necessary

322
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:51,890
murder, uh, that rather any
murder would be necessary, uh,

323
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,750
in order to advance a cause and,
uh, expressing his own self.

324
00:23:56,751 --> 00:24:00,920
Censure cut the palm out of his, his
work. And if you buy Auden's collected,

325
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,880
uh, poems edited by as
executor a Edward Mendelson,

326
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,920
you will find that this
poem is not in there. Uh,

327
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,640
there are other, uh,
examples. Um, I'll, um,

328
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,600
uh, of of dramatic self revision. Uh,

329
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,300
let me just point to one
more, uh, that is famous, um,

330
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,220
in the pumps. September 1st, 1939, again,

331
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:32,420
one of Auden's most celebrated
and circulated poems.

332
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,880
Uh, he, uh, has, uh,

333
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:41,510
in, uh, the next to last stanza, uh,

334
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,240
these,
um,

335
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,980
assertions on page eight oh three.
All I have,

336
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:54,250
this is a poem occasion by the beginning
of the Second World War, uh, it,

337
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:59,240
um, positions the poet, uh, in a
dive, uh, in Manhattan drinking,

338
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,220
uh, with others. Uh,
he's reflecting on, um,

339
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,780
the European catastrophe now underway.
He says,

340
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:12,140
all I have is a voice
to undo the folded lie,

341
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,940
the romantic lie in the brain of the
sensual man in the street and the lie of

342
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:20,960
authority whose buildings grope the sky.

343
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,850
There is no such thing as the state,
and no one exists alone.

344
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,660
Hunger allows no choice to
the citizen or the police.

345
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,220
We must love one another. We're die, uh,

346
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,900
as, uh, uh, you are note below. Uh,

347
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,820
uh, registers a on a later
attempted to revise this line,

348
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,470
which struck him as,
uh,

349
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,300
in fact he called it incurably dishonest,
uh,

350
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,340
and, uh, uh, he, he revised
it a first with what, uh,

351
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,000
seem to him, uh, a, a more truthful claim.

352
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:04,001
We must love one another and die because
we're going to have to die in any case.

353
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,230
Uh, and that, uh, uh, eventually, uh,

354
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:13,120
he gave up on altogether, uh, and cut, uh,

355
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,670
the entire stands. Uh, uh, these, uh,

356
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,790
are examples of Auden a applying
a kind of stringent moral,

357
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:27,250
a self examination to the
language that he uses a in.

358
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:30,650
It's, uh, uh, um, a crucial part,

359
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:33,590
not only of the history of his work
and other, it's what he did with it,

360
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:38,120
but what of course we use doing in it,
uh, which was, uh, attempting to speak,

361
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,390
uh, in a truthful way, uh,

362
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,360
that he could take
responsibility for, uh, and yet,

363
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,560
which led him repeatedly to, um, uh,

364
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:54,480
forms of rhetoric that he would
mistrust, uh, and later, uh,

365
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,360
abandoned.
Uh,

366
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,530
all of this is consistent with the ways
in which Auden reconceived the modern

367
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,310
poets role.

368
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,630
Auden writes against Vat,
heck,

369
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,450
romantic inspiration. Uh, he, uh,

370
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,990
sees the modern poet as a
kind of rationalist, uh,

371
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,551
a rationalist,

372
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:25,551
especially skilled in the techniques
of poetry of language use,

373
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,490
uh, as expressed, uh, specifically, uh,

374
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:36,960
in technical mastery of
verse form and Genre.

375
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,370
Auden, uh, um, uh,

376
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,210
reclaims a following pound
Anglo Saxon alliterative meter.

377
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,400
Uh, he, uh,

378
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,060
rights in popular ballad forms,

379
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,940
all kinds of song forms,

380
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,780
many kinds of rhyme and meter.
Uh,

381
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,770
he, he takes over, uh,
you could say, uh, uh, uh,

382
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,650
song forms from the British music call,
which is something like Vaudeville. Uh,

383
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,540
he, um, produces intricate
stands, AIC patterns,

384
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,810
um, that we might find in
metaphysical poetry. He,

385
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,730
he produces ornate syllabic poems,
not unlike Marianne Moore's.

386
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:37,470
Sometimes he, uh, uh, influentially,

387
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,610
uh, revives the province Saul
forms of the Cistina, uh,

388
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,580
and the Kenzo Ne. Uh, and
other, uh, um, troubadour

389
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,970
a forms. Uh, if, uh, uh,

390
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,561
your,

391
00:28:55,561 --> 00:29:00,170
your poetry writing teachers have made
you write sestinas you have odd and to

392
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,950
thank for this, uh, as
well as much else. Um,

393
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,870
there is,
uh,

394
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,880
in these various acts of appropriation
and reclaiming of averse forms,

395
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:17,010
a kind of, um, no nostalgia, uh, rather,

396
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,580
uh, there's a sense that all of
these forms are simply available.

397
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:25,200
They should be part of a poet's
tool kit. Uh, and, and this is,

398
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:29,910
I'm also part of, uh, what is,

399
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:34,330
um, well Auden's, uh, presentation
of himself as a kind of expert, uh,

400
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,460
as a poet with expertise,
with expertise in the language.

401
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,760
And all of this is part of,
in his early poetry,

402
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,840
what you would have to call
his precocious adultness. Uh,

403
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:49,900
his knowingness, uh, which is again,

404
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:54,500
connected to his will to tell the truth,
uh,

405
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,560
uh, uh, to tell the truth
unclouded by sentiment. Uh, the,

406
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:04,240
the, uh, the early on and the odd
that we see in those photographs,

407
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:09,100
he's remarkably cool, uh, in all senses.

408
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,080
Uh, this is a cool poet. Uh, uh,

409
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,270
James Merrill, a poet, um, uh,

410
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:25,110
who was a friend of Arden's, uh, and,
and, uh, uh, influenced by him and,

411
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:29,310
and, uh, many ways once
remarked, uh, that, um,

412
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,620
all of the Auden's poems were written
on paper on which the tears had dried.

413
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,680
Uh, and, uh, that's an evocative
idea. Uh, it's important,

414
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:46,330
first of all, uh, that yes,
those tiers have dried. Uh,

415
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,520
but it's also important that there
were tears, uh, and both of these, uh,

416
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:52,720
our,
our properties of,

417
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,640
of the palms and they make on
a special kind of love poet.

418
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,630
Uh, let's look at, uh, the early palm. Uh,

419
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,300
this lunar beauty,
uh,

420
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,610
which is, uh, on seven 87,

421
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:18,590
uh,
yeah,

422
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,660
this lunar beauty has no
history is complete in early.

423
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,410
If beauty later bear any feature,

424
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,430
it had a lover and is another,

425
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,360
this like a dream,

426
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:43,530
this love that I experienced and
right up and out of keeps other time.

427
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:51,100
It's lunar and day time is the
loss of this for time is inches.

428
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,030
And the heart's changes where
ghost has haunted, lost and wanted.

429
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:00,650
Yeah,

430
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,230
but this was never a ghost
endeavor nor finished.

431
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:06,650
This was ghosted ease until it passed.

432
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:09,050
Love shall not near the sweetness here.

433
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,670
North sorrow take his endless look.

434
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,330
Uh, contrast this poem, uh,

435
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,410
two closely related palm
heart cranes voyages,

436
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:27,500
uh, palm of extravagant, uh, rhetoric. Uh,

437
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,480
here. Uh, uh, Arden is not writing.

438
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:37,100
I ambig pentameter. He's writing.
What is the meter here? Demeter,

439
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,800
uh,
there are two beats line.

440
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,840
You can't have a line that's much
shorter and have it be align or a meter.

441
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,890
Uh, it, it's really the
innocence, the smallest, uh,

442
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,030
measure can a meter can sustain.

443
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,110
There is in the poem a kind
of formal rhetoric reticence,

444
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,060
uh,

445
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:04,060
and what is proclaimed as endless
here is not love but sorrow.

446
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,810
A sorrows look, uh, and,

447
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:11,600
and sorrow is personified.

448
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,380
They're in the position of the poet,
uh,

449
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,090
looking at the beloved already in a sense,
looking back at him,

450
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,970
uh,
a lunar beauty.

451
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,750
Let's turn a few pages forward
to seven 90 and read another,

452
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,630
uh, of Auden's love poms, um,

453
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,190
closely related.
Lay your sleeping head.

454
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,000
My love human on my faithless arm.

455
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,450
Time and fevers burn away.

456
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,990
Individual beauty from thoughtful
children and the grave proves the child of

457
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:55,514
femoral.

458
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,080
But in my arms till break of day,

459
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:06,430
let the living creature lie mortal guilty.

460
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,040
But to me the entirely beautiful

461
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,590
certainty fidelity on the
stroke of midnight pass.

462
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,200
Okay.

463
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,130
They always do.

464
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,590
There were bound to like vibrations
of a bell and fashionable.

465
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:32,130
Madmen raised their pedantic boring cry.
Every farthing of the cost.

466
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:36,990
All the dreaded cards foretell
shall be paid. But from this night,

467
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,060
not a whisper, not a thought, not a kiss,

468
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,420
nor look,
be lost.

469
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,840
You're going to have to pay for it.

470
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,410
But here it is and it is now.
And to be celebrated,

471
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:59,670
beauty,
midnight vision dies.

472
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,750
Let the winds of dawn that blow softly
round you're dreaming head such a day of

473
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,960
sweetness, show I am
knocking heart, may bless.

474
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,410
Find the mortal world enough.

475
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,320
Nunes of dryness.
See you fed by the involuntary powers.

476
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,570
Knights of insult,

477
00:35:21,571 --> 00:35:26,571
let you pass watched by every human love

478
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,360
here again,

479
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,390
love is seen in the secularizing light
of certain future betrayal and loss.

480
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:44,340
Uh, to be living here is
to be mortal and guilty.

481
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,230
Uh,

482
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,230
to love is to be sure that
you will be faithless,

483
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,120
uh, that is to love fully, fully, uh,

484
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:02,121
and so to know love and beauty
entirely and in their entirety is,

485
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,860
uh,
to know them in the knowledge of time,

486
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,050
uh,
to know precisely that loves passing,

487
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,790
uh,

488
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,790
time here is not so much a kind
of emblem of human inconstancy,

489
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,410
uh, but rather have something
like natural law, uh,

490
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,380
to which everyone is subject.
Uh,

491
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,770
this is the theme of the,
uh,

492
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,020
very great poem written in
the popular ballot form,

493
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,370
uh, with, uh,

494
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:46,550
this title and Odense collected palms
as I walked out one evening on seven 93.

495
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,020
Uh,
yeah,

496
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,420
as I walked out one evening
walking down Bristol Street,

497
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,820
the crowds upon the pavement,

498
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,620
we're fields of harvest week and
down by the [inaudible] River,

499
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:08,580
I heard a lover sing under
an arch of the railway.

500
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,890
And here is his song.

501
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,370
Love has no ending.
I'll love you dear.

502
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,470
I love you till China and Africa meat
and the river jumps over the mountain and

503
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,210
salmon singing the street.

504
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,460
I'll love you til the ocean
is folded and hung up to dry.

505
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:33,570
And the seven stars go squawking
like geese about the sky.

506
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,040
The year she'll run like
rabbits free in my arms.

507
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:42,690
I hold the flower of the ages
and the first love of the world.

508
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,223
Okay,

509
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,710
have you ever said that?
And someone said that to you.

510
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,540
Okay.

511
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,540
But all the clocks in the city
began to were in time and they say,

512
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,980
oh,
let not time to see view.

513
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,850
You cannot conquer time in
the boroughs of the nightmare.

514
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,910
We're justice.
Naked is time.

515
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:18,530
Watches from the window and
coughs when you would kiss

516
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,250
in headaches and,
and worry vaguely.

517
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:25,280
Life leaks away and time.

518
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,520
We'll have his fancy
tomorrow or today into many.

519
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:32,300
A Green Valley drifts.

520
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:37,330
The appalling snow time breaks the
threaded dances and the divers.

521
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:42,460
Brilliant bow. Oh, plunge
your hands in water.

522
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,300
Plunge them in up to the wrist.
Stare,

523
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,960
stare in the base and in
wonder what you've missed.

524
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,960
The glacier knocks in the cupboard,

525
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:58,590
the desert size and the bed and the
crack and the tea cup opens a lane to the

526
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:02,860
land of the dead where the beggars raffle,

527
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:06,220
the bank notes and the giant
isn't chanting to Jack.

528
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,760
And the lily white boy is a roar
and Jill goes down on our back,

529
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,980
oh, look, look in the mirror.
Go look in your distress.

530
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,350
Life remains a blessing.

531
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,600
Although you cannot bless,
oh,

532
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:26,350
stand,

533
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,330
stand at the window as
the tiers scald and start.

534
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,550
You shall love your crooked
neighbor with your crooked heart.

535
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,020
It was late, late in the evening.
The lovers, they were gone.

536
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,970
The clocks had ceased.

537
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:50,110
Their timing and the deep river ran on

538
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,670
a, this is a ballad, uh,

539
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,290
on choice of it suggests, uh, uh,

540
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:04,320
that the song form is conveying
popular common wisdom.

541
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,490
Something we all know.
Uh,

542
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,820
it's expressing truth as a kind of
commonplace, uh, that is shared.

543
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,890
Like the tune itself.
Uh,

544
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:23,440
truth is not an elite knowledge.

545
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,040
It's something that's out there,
uh,

546
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,020
in the street and it touches
all of us, uh, in common.

547
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,590
Uh, there are here in the palm, um,

548
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,080
two distinct voices in quotation marks,
first the lovers,

549
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,020
and then the voice of time of the clocks,
uh,

550
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,300
the lover. When he speaks. Well,

551
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,890
the poem seems to say seems
to acknowledge he's lying

552
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,250
even if he doesn't know it or mean it.

553
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,600
And yet the poem still allows
him his truth, his say,

554
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,070
uh,

555
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:13,070
what it does really is it framed his
truth with this other larger truth,

556
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,920
which is times truth uttered by the
clocks and the clocks speak from the point

557
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:26,410
of view of disenchantment.
The lover cannot wash his hands.

558
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,170
Uh,
uh,

559
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,010
the palm gives us a kind of
image of primary sinfulness.

560
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,340
Again, how different
from Steven's, uh, uh,

561
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,740
ordinary life here is,
uh,

562
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,980
haunted by disrupted by elemental forces.
Uh,

563
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,830
the glacier knocks in the cupboard.

564
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,870
The domestic includes tragic
and uncanny dimensions.

565
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,580
Uh, they return like repressed
parts of the psyche in the palm,

566
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:05,660
uh, and still, uh,

567
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,960
there is a kind of constellation in view
in that ambiguous promise or command

568
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,280
that you and I will love each other are,

569
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:25,340
are crooked hearts will meet.
Uh,

570
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:30,180
there's a sense in which people are
bound to each other precisely, uh,

571
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:33,590
by the circumstances that
the poem describes in,

572
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:36,710
by the crookedness of their hearts,

573
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,250
uh, at the end. Then, uh, the
lovers and the clocks are all gone,

574
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:45,740
both, uh, and the river runs on.

575
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:50,090
There's that last stanza,
uh,

576
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,960
poetry in Auden,
uh,

577
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,700
speaks on behalf of a necessity,

578
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,510
a necessity that frames what we do and
think a necessity that determines the

579
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:08,300
circumstances within which
we make our moral choices.

580
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:13,460
Uh, in this way. Auden
like bishop who will,

581
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:15,890
will read next week, uh, is a poet,

582
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:21,140
a constantly drawing our attention
to matters of perspective,

583
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,100
uh, how things are seeing
how things are framed,

584
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:29,270
what the context of any given, uh, uh,

585
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,340
point of view, uh, or
utterance or action is, uh,

586
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,370
what is true and what is right from one
point of view may not be from another.

587
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,021
And this is,

588
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:46,970
this is part of the principle by
which often comes to in fact revise,

589
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,290
uh, and, uh, make, uh,
decisions about his,

590
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:55,700
his own work. Uh, that involves
censoring, um, his, uh,

591
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,500
uh, his, uh, his own language. Uh, the,

592
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,520
the great poem, uh, about this,
uh, theme, uh, that is, uh,

593
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,613
the,
uh,

594
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:11,720
way in which our knowledge and action
is a determined and bounded by the

595
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:16,580
perspectives, uh, uh, in which it
is viewed in which it takes place.

596
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:21,200
The great poem on this theme
is a music day. Bows are, um,

597
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:25,030
is, uh, also a poem that
we'll have to, um, uh,

598
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,680
wait to talk about it until
Monday when we will, uh,

599
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,770
talk about it,
uh,

600
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,800
in connection with the
almost contemporaneous
poem in memory of WB Yeats.
