1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,060
We talked, let me talk to
him Monday about Frost's, uh,

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:10,830
idea of the sound of sense.
Uh, and uh, vernacular, uh,

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,530
speech forms, uh, his,

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:18,240
his wish to put these
intention or as he put it,

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:22,410
strained relations, uh,
with metrical pattern.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,760
Uh,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,760
the primary metrical pattern in frost
a is the primary metrical pattern in

8
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:33,290
English poetry, which is
to say blank verse, uh,

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,310
or unrivaled I abic pentameter.
Well,

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,510
a meter, what is meter a meter is, uh,

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,190
it's a scheme for organizing
verse four, organizing, um,

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,000
lines of verse. Uh,
it's a scheme that, uh,

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,160
in English counts,

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,820
accents or stresses per line,

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:03,180
uh, and then arranges
them in a pattern. Um,

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,670
ordinarily in accentual syllabic verse,

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,600
which is what we're reading,
uh,

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,790
more often than not in English poetry,

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,780
the accents are arranged in
relation to unaccented syllables,

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,060
creating a kind of limited array of,
of standard units.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,280
Uh,
the most standard of these as the I am

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,920
the I am is,

23
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:39,240
is a simple pattern of an unstressed
syllable followed by a stressed one,

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,090
a boat about,
uh,

25
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,170
address a coat.
These are all simple.

26
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:54,171
I am Vick phrases that you hear
in our language all the time.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,580
If you,
if you repeat a boat three times a boat,

28
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,540
a boat, a boat, you have trinity.

29
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,340
I am Vic [inaudible] a
three. I am in a row. Uh,

30
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:13,800
if you do it four times, you've
got a Ted transmitter, uh,

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,920
uh, more common meter, uh, in English.

32
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,730
And if you repeat them five times,
you have pentameter,

33
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,720
uh, accent. Uh, what is an accent? Um,

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,440
for some of you, this will seem
self evident. For others, uh,

35
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,720
it'll seem like a great puzzle. Um,
uh, what constitutes an accident?

36
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,970
When you, what, what, what, what, uh,

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,150
what does an accent in
a given English word?

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,850
In fact,
uh,

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,380
linguists often argue about
this subject and it's a,

40
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:52,380
it's a complicated, uh, one, um,

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,390
accent is something somewhat difficult
to define and categorize. Uh,

42
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,620
don't worry about. Uh,
poetry is not interested in,

43
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,830
in, uh, expert debate,
uh, at all. Uh, and it,

44
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:08,910
it converts the, the, you know,

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,670
big spectrum of possible
degrees of accent, uh,

46
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,720
into those two simple categories,

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,790
stressed and unstressed syllables.
Uh,

48
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,260
so,
uh,

49
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:28,261
if you're unsure about the medical
definition of a line because it's hard to

50
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,560
discriminate between levels of stress
as will almost certainly be the case,

51
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,540
remember that, uh, more
often than not, uh,

52
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,080
the context takes over,
uh,

53
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,270
and the regular beat of a meter
rules and perhaps promotes an accent,

54
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,410
uh, in, uh,

55
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,850
a phrase that might not otherwise
seem to have one to you.

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,010
Let's, uh, illustrate these,
these general points by uh, uh,

57
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,250
just reading together and trying to hear
the beginning of a Robert Frost poem

58
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,810
birches on, on page two
11. And the, the Norton,

59
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,120
this is an example

60
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,140
of blank verse and that is,
uh,

61
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,130
always to be blank for us always
perhaps confusingly to be district a

62
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:31,131
distinguished from free verse blank
verse is unrivaled I amic Pentameter free

63
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,620
verse is non metrical poetry.
Another thing all together.

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,600
This is blank verse. It's the language of
Shakespeare. It's a language of Milton.

65
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,380
When I see birches Ben to left and right
across the lines of straight or dark or

66
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:48,584
trees,

67
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,060
I like to think some boys
been swinging them well.

68
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,863
Um,

69
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,070
for me when I try to make sense
of the meter of given lines,

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,550
uh,
I think it's useful to try to settle,

71
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,150
to start those syllables that
seem most clearly stressed,

72
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,320
uh, to, you know, identify where there,
there isn't a question, uh, and uh,

73
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:20,321
use that then as a structure from which
to interpret the rest of the lines.

74
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,790
So why don't we do that together?
Uh, just looking at this first,

75
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,570
first line when I see birches Ben to
left and right when I see birches Ben to

76
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:34,790
left and right

77
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,670
when I see birches bend
to the left and right,

78
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,860
and sometimes it's not good
to repeat it too often,

79
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:46,020
then you start to become unhinged.
Uh, let, let, let's, uh, let's,

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,720
let's see if we can't identify
those syllables that well,

81
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:52,120
we all are going to agree
on, uh, we're, we're,

82
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,660
where's the first accident that you
really want to say? That's an accent.

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,830
I
birches

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,340
bend.
Okay.

85
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,430
Speak Up. What's left, right

86
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,360
debate there.
Uh,

87
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,160
everybody, when I
propose, uh, another, uh,

88
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,660
another stress in that line,

89
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,813
yes.

90
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,600
Uh, there's a stress on when and see,
hmm, okay. Well, what if I had the phrase,

91
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:41,490
I see what, uh, what would
be stressed in that phrase?

92
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,443
I see.

93
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,293
Si

94
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,870
that's true. Um, when I see
birches Ben to left and right,

95
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:54,850
I think I would want to scan
that, that, uh, line, uh, as,

96
00:06:54,851 --> 00:06:59,780
as a bit of an odd beginning, uh, I
think that word see is, deserves the,

97
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:03,960
the, uh, the accent there.
Uh, and so it's, um, the,

98
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,970
the first first unit of the
sound isn't quite normative.

99
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,161
Uh,

100
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:15,161
it takes frost a little sweep to get
going when I see birches Ben to left and

101
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,370
right. But by the time we
finished the end of that line,

102
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,300
we are really right in the middle
of very regular I ambit pentameter.

103
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,690
When I see birches Ben to left and
right across the lines of straighter,

104
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,560
darker trees.

105
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,890
I like to think some boys been swinging
them across the line of straight,

106
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,800
darker trees. Let's, let's do the
lines of straight or darker trees.

107
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:42,380
Let's do that line. Uh, accents here.

108
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,610
Cross lines.
Straight

109
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,130
trees. Yeah. I, that one's pretty simple.
Uh, thank you for us. You, you, you have,

110
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:59,250
you know, delivered, uh, this,
this, this, uh, to us. Uh,

111
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,800
and as is not often the case, uh, every,

112
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,240
excuse me as is not
seldom the case in frost.

113
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,010
There's almost a kind of metaphorical
play between what he's describing. Uh,

114
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,970
and uh,

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,740
the sounds with which he is doing
the describing here, the uh,

116
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,220
uh, this image of, of uh,
aligns of trees and the uh,

117
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,310
metrical regularity of that, um,
uh, verse that describes them.

118
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,210
I like to think some
boys been swinging them.

119
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,070
I like to think some
boys been swinging them.

120
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,470
Yeah.
What about this line?

121
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,700
Yeah,

122
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,480
I like to think some
boys been swinging them.

123
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,560
That word
swinging gives a nice swing to the,

124
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,380
it's into the I am.
Anyone said Amen.

125
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:01,801
Uh,
the,

126
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:06,801
the point is that a swing has
some interesting swinging effect.

127
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,470
Um, yeah. I'm not sure how to
describe that exactly. Um, uh,

128
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,780
yeah, we want, we want to put a stress on
swing. Uh, what other words in that line?

129
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,970
I'm sorry. Think good. Like, Yup.

130
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,130
I like is like,
I see,

131
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,330
I like to think some boys swing them.

132
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,960
Yeah. This too is, is it utterly regular?

133
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:41,500
I am big pentameter line,
uh,

134
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,560
unstressed syllable followed by a
stressed syllable, five in a row,

135
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,480
and yet think about the qualities of
sound that are so different between,

136
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,270
across the lines of
straight or darker trees.

137
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,290
And I like to think some
boys been swinging them. Uh,

138
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,373
the,

139
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,800
what frost is interested in is
the what really ultimate, uh,

140
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,410
a variety of, of uh, sounds
that he is able to reduce,

141
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,310
uh, as that metrical pattern, uh,

142
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,380
comes into some kind of a tension with
a English sentence sounds as he calls.

143
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,160
And, uh, and uh, with the,

144
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,190
the effect that each of frost
lines of I am big pentameter has,

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,490
has different qualities even
when they're utterly regular. Uh,

146
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:36,440
and there are in frost often,
uh, some variations. Uh,

147
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:40,930
this is something I'd like you to
practice, uh, uh, I'd like you to,

148
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,764
to think about,

149
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,160
be conscious of and it's
something we can return to a,

150
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:51,161
it's not something I expect
you to necessarily master or,

151
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,330
um, uh, or, or, uh,
become advanced, uh, in,

152
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,520
um, uh, um, uh, you were, you were, um,

153
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,180
expertise.
Uh,

154
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:06,260
but it is a dimension of the poetry
that's absolutely essential to what it is

155
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:10,940
and to what your doing. When
you read a and you hear, uh,

156
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,380
that voice speaking.

157
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,030
And so I'd like you to work
on attuning yourself to it.

158
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,140
Uh, what can you do with
sound as interpreters?

159
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,570
How do we start to fund you?

160
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,280
Make a connection between what
we hear and what things mean?

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,930
Well, uh, in frost
case, as I'm suggesting,

162
00:11:32,931 --> 00:11:37,100
there's often very skillful
in complex, uh, uh,

163
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,090
imitation going on between for us sounds.
Uh,

164
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,110
and what he's imaging or describing are
the actions and events and a palm that's

165
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,440
the case, a marvelously in this poem. Um,

166
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,930
uh, and it, and I'd be
happy to talk about, uh, um,

167
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,880
particular examples with, with any of
you who'd like to work through it. Um,

168
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,130
but,
uh,

169
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:07,390
the point I want to make about it is as
much more general and we don't have to

170
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:11,400
look at, uh, a particular
cases to make it a,

171
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,410
this is a poem about bending
and breaking or not breaking,

172
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,590
uh, forms, uh,

173
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,120
forms the material,
givens of the world. Uh,

174
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,610
it's a poem in fact about
strained relation, uh,

175
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,830
uh, in, in a kind of
play, uh, that, uh, frost,

176
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,630
uh, is, is exploring, uh, and
that strange relation that he's a,

177
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:46,270
that the boy, uh, achieves
as he learns how to play, uh,

178
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,520
with these trees. Well, uh,

179
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,550
that's a version of what we hear in the
poem when we hear the forms of strange

180
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:56,790
relation between, um, uh,

181
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,800
frost dynamic speech sounds and the
metrical pattern of his writing.

182
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,320
Uh, the kinetic activity of the
form of the poem in other words,

183
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,180
uh, is something that's like,
but it's also itself for Frost,

184
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:18,181
an instance of the relations
of force and counter force,

185
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,480
desire and gravity,
uh,

186
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,520
that the poem is describing the
meter has, in other words, uh,

187
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,700
in relation to his individual
sentence sounds, uh,

188
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,780
some of the flexibility and
also resistance that those
trees have in relation to

189
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,790
the boy, uh, using them
to swing, to swing,

190
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,710
to go up and down,

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
to come and go safely.
Uh,

192
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,770
these are primal forms of
play. Uh, if you, if you like,

193
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,920
uh,
that suggest forms of poetic activity.

194
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,080
Also spiritual activity, uh, frosts,

195
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:07,030
ways of using language in short,
our, our, like our, our versions of,

196
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,360
uh, the boys' way of
using the trees. Let's,

197
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,950
let's look at the poem together.
I'll read it.

198
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,140
I like to think some boys been swinging
them but swinging doesn't bend them down

199
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,560
to stay as ice storms do.

200
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,470
Frost is going to counter
pose the boys swinging to uh,

201
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:39,040
the natural forces, uh,
imaged in the ice storm.

202
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,920
Often.
You must have seen them loaded with Isis.

203
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,280
Sunny winter morning after a rain,

204
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,790
they'd click upon themselves as the
breeze rises and turn many colors as the

205
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:56,291
stor cracks and crazes there a namel
soon the sun's warmth makes them shed

206
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:02,000
crystal shells shattering and
avalanching on the snow crest,

207
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,570
such heaps of broken glass to sweep away.

208
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,720
You'd think the inner
dome of Heaven had fallen.

209
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,310
They are dragged to the withered brack
and by the load and they seem not to

210
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,090
break the ones they are
bowed so low for long,

211
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,400
they never write themselves.

212
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,130
You may see their trunks arching
in the woods years afterwards,

213
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,610
trailing their leaves on the ground
like girls on hands and knees that throw

214
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,790
their hair before them,
over their heads to dry in the sun.

215
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,170
But I was going to say when truth broke
in with all her matter of fact about the

216
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:46,664
ice storm,

217
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,050
I should prefer to have some boy bend
them as he went out and in to fetch the

218
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:55,851
cows.

219
00:15:55,851 --> 00:16:00,851
Some boy too far from town to learn
baseball who's only play was what he found

220
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,971
himself summer or winter
and could play alone

221
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,040
one by one.

222
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:15,041
He subdued his father's trees by writing
them down over and over again until he

223
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:20,000
took the stiffness out of them
and not one but hung limp.

224
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,670
Not One was left for him to conquer.

225
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,390
He learned all there was to learn about
not launching out too soon and so not

226
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:32,900
carrying the tree away
clear to the ground.

227
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,330
He always kept his poise
to the top branches,

228
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,840
climbing carefully with the same pains
you use to fill a cup up to the brim and

229
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,930
even above the brim.

230
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Then he flung out where it feet first
with a swish kicking his way down through

231
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,970
the air to the ground.

232
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,640
So as I once myself a swinger of Birches,

233
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,150
and so I dream of going back to be,

234
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,990
it's when I'm weary of considerations in
life is too much like a pathless would

235
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,040
wear. Your face burns and tickles
with the cobwebs broken across it.

236
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,330
And one eye is weeping from a
twigs having lashed across it open.

237
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,960
I'd like to get away from Earth a while

238
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,960
and then come back to it and begin over.

239
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,380
May know fate willfully misunderstand me
and half grant what I wish and snatched

240
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:40,220
me away and not to return earth,
the right place for love.

241
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,070
I don't know where it's
likely to go better.

242
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:49,330
I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree
and climb black branches up a snow white

243
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:55,290
trunk toward heaven until
the tree could bear no more,

244
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,450
but dipped it's top and set me down again.
That would be good.

245
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Both going and coming back.

246
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,510
One could do worse than
be a swinger of birches.

247
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,600
So think about the birches as a tool,
another tool.

248
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,000
But this time of tool for play,
uh,

249
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,620
a tool for playing alone as in mowing
a frost is writing about solitude

250
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,820
in essential loneliness.

251
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,790
The boys solitude is like the mowers.
Who's absent?

252
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,090
Well, other children. Uh,

253
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,820
the other character that's mentioned
in the poem is the boy's father who's

254
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:47,671
trees.

255
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:52,671
They are the property
owner who also is absent.

256
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,600
It's his absence that leaves the
boy alone to his own devices. Uh,

257
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,760
we might think of him not
simply as, uh, the, the, uh,

258
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,490
farm or who holds the
deed to those Birch's,

259
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:10,020
but as maybe God the
father who created them,

260
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,600
uh,
and is likewise absent or invisible

261
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,890
in the solitude, the
solitude, uh, that absence.

262
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,773
Um,

263
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,150
the boy uses the tree to work
his will playfully this time.

264
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:34,440
He's not really a worker, uh,
to work his will on the world.

265
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,830
And the boy uses the trees
to do two things, right,

266
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,300
to go up or go out and come back

267
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,620
to return. Uh, this activity in,

268
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:51,120
in a wonderful homely way is
a version of romance quest.

269
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,150
It's an image of a cent toward heaven,

270
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,660
uh, from which, uh, the boy returns. Uh,

271
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,770
he's able to rise to,

272
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,750
to transcend the limits of
his own body and station. Uh,

273
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,240
at the same time,
it's dangerous.

274
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,170
It's dangerous to want to
get away from Earth Awhile,

275
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,410
uh, to get your feet
entirely off the ground. Uh,

276
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,580
what might happen to
you? Uh, uh, well, uh,

277
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,380
to put too much pressure on any
tool is to risk breaking it,

278
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,890
uh,
breaking down,

279
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,650
maybe a crashing,

280
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,460
coming back to earth like ICARUS.
Uh, the, uh, overreach here,

281
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,090
the poet after, uh, is,

282
00:20:48,091 --> 00:20:53,091
is subject to gravity in frost to the
force of the earth that checks it's a

283
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,770
counterweight to frost,
romantic longing,

284
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,990
the skill and the play that for us just
talking about a depends on being able to

285
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:08,200
use a tool,
in this case,

286
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:13,201
the tree emblematic of the world in its
sturdy but also delicate materiality to

287
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:19,210
use the tool to return
safely to the ground,

288
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:24,211
to get your feet back on the ground for
earth's the right place for love for us

289
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:26,180
as,
uh,

290
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,390
it's love that makes the boy
climb as it made the mower work.

291
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,110
Remember, but who was
talking about love? It's a,

292
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,020
uh, frost is so fly. Uh, he, he,

293
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,470
he brings it up as if we know that this
is what he's been talking about all the

294
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:49,360
time. Uh, uh, notice in
fact, the cleverness of,

295
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,280
of all this discourse in the poem,
notice the freedom that he exercises,

296
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,500
uh, in unfolding what feels like
an improvisitory monologue, uh,

297
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:03,850
in which he makes you race to
keep up with him, uh, as he, uh,

298
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,880
follows as semi hidden logic
that he treats as self evident.

299
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,260
Uh,
notice that final colloquial phrase to go.

300
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,060
He repeats it twice.

301
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,260
I don't know where it's
love is likely to go better.

302
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,940
And then I'd like to
go by climbing a tree,

303
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,700
a wonderful phrase to go,
uh,

304
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,600
meaning want a variety of things, uh, uh,

305
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:36,430
to go in the sense of, uh, uh, to
make, uh, to make something work out,

306
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:39,040
to make it go, uh, to journey,

307
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,740
to choose how to live,
uh,

308
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,960
to go to the limit, uh, where
the tool can bear no more.

309
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,720
Uh, yeah. And, and, and people use
that phrase to mean to die, don't they?

310
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,680
Uh, you know, we've talked about,
I'd like to go in this way.

311
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,820
All those resonances in those two words.
Uh,

312
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,360
on Monday I stressed that
poetry was for frost,

313
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,030
always a mode of work.
Uh,

314
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:18,031
and that work was for him a model
of poetic activity with mowing.

315
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,321
Uh,

316
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:25,321
as the example I said that in frost
meaning is always something made.

317
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,350
Uh,
something that works on and works for

318
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,740
frosts,
modernity,

319
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,860
consistent that the idea that a truth
is something that's concrete and

320
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,170
contingent, uh, not a
metaphysical matter, uh,

321
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,830
not an ideal principle.

322
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,150
And then it's something that's only
available in the act of deriving it,

323
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,260
constructing it. A, an
act that is ordinary,

324
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,250
that's in completable,
uh,

325
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,490
and therefore necessarily
always, uh, to be, uh,

326
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,270
repeated, uh, an ongoing task.

327
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,520
It's something you have to
get up and do every day. Uh,

328
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,690
frost is a, is a kind of
materialist, uh, by which I mean,

329
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:22,250
he calls attention to the
circumstances of imagination.

330
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,310
It's limits and conditions.
Uh,

331
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,160
poetry is in frost,
uh,

332
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,870
an encounter between fact and desire.
What we want.

333
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,620
And what is,
uh,

334
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,730
tools in frost,
uh,

335
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,200
are an image of the enabling
and defining conditions,

336
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:50,420
uh, of imagination. And they include
in the, the work of poetry, uh, itself,

337
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,610
um, uh, all sorts of tools. Uh, all the,

338
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,450
um, uh, technology of language, uh,

339
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:03,890
and the technology in particular
of verse, uh, including, uh,

340
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:08,140
importantly meter, uh,
the relation between the,

341
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,800
the speech sounds and the metrical
frame of a poem, uh, such as birches.

342
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,650
Uh, it's like the relation, as I'm saying,

343
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:19,700
between the boy and the
Birches, uh, in other words,

344
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,710
meter is something for us,
knows how to use. It's a,

345
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:29,330
it's a material force that his
rhetoric challenges and relies on a,

346
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:32,210
gives him a means of
getting off the ground, uh,

347
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:36,100
and a means of always
getting back to it too. Uh,

348
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,770
and that's another kind
of doubleness and frost.

349
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,470
I talked about doubleness
last time. Uh, um,

350
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,320
think in, in birches of, of
really the extraordinary, uh,

351
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,100
play of, of, of language, uh,
the freedom of association,

352
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:54,460
the metaphorical invention,
uh,

353
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,460
all of which is being played off of the
strict demands of the meter at every

354
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:03,350
moment. It's part of the energy
and force of the poem. Uh,

355
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,220
the,

356
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,220
the work of poetry in frost that
the really the high drama of,

357
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,380
uh, the wheel at work in the world. Uh,

358
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,700
it's something that we can
actually hear in his poetry,

359
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:22,180
in the expertly explored tensions between
speech and meter in that meter too.

360
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,770
We're hearing,
we're hearing some of frost modernity.

361
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,010
Uh,
let me say more about what I mean.

362
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,310
Uh, let me say more about what
I mean by approaching, uh,

363
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,530
the question of his modernness
as modernity. Uh, uh,

364
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,320
from the point of view of his subjects.
Last time I showed you the, uh,

365
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,220
his second book and it's, it's
a, it's covering north of Boston.

366
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,480
Uh,

367
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,070
the title of that book published in 1914
and the one that more than any other,

368
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,390
uh,
made him famous,

369
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,770
locates his subjects in
a specific geography.

370
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,340
Uh, it's important for thinking about
frost place in modern poetry. Uh,

371
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,630
Boston,
well,

372
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,560
it was the capital of 19th century
American literature and culture, uh,

373
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,830
a named synonymous eventually
with gentility, uh,

374
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,580
puritanism, uh, uh, old
American money and style.

375
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,640
Uh, exactly. Uh, in other words,

376
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,800
everything modernism
was attacking. So, uh,

377
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:38,910
where do you go to write modern
poetry? Well, anywhere but, but Boston,

378
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,070
uh, pound, uh, and Elliot, uh,

379
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,770
importantly go to London,
Paris.

380
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,610
There's the New York of crane,
uh,

381
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,990
of Moore Stephens too,
but frost says differently.

382
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,010
Uh,
he alone moves poetry north of Boston.

383
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,050
Uh, to do this is to, uh, reverse the,

384
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,580
the social direction,

385
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:10,581
which everyone else is going to reverse
the direction of American modernization,

386
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,760
which is evacuating rural
New England, uh, uh,

387
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,780
sending its workers to the
cities, uh, uh, in the, uh,

388
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:23,720
new industrial economy. If you
can think about cranes, images of,

389
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:28,130
of the Brooklyn Bridge in this
course, and then compare frosts, uh,

390
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,170
image of the woodpile that abandoned
woodpile that some worker has left,

391
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,590
uh, in the, the poem
called the woodpile. Uh,

392
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,230
these are in a sense
complimentary images of, uh,

393
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,820
the modern in a America,
uh,

394
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,990
frost when he goes north of Boston,
uh, goes back to the country,

395
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,770
goes in a sense the opposite
direction, uh, that,

396
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,880
uh, America is going, he goes in a sense,

397
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:01,050
in an anti modern direction.
Uh, maybe even in some sense,

398
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:04,170
in a reactionary,
a direction,

399
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,060
at least in relation to other poets,
ideas of progress and innovation,

400
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:15,050
this move roots Frost's poetry of
work in the lives of rural workers.

401
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,660
Uh, people who have to sustain
and entertain themselves, uh,

402
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,700
uh, often on their own or alone. Uh,

403
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,600
what these people have to work with are,

404
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:32,670
are the tools that have been passed
down to them or sometimes that they have

405
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,450
invented. Uh, the, the, uh,

406
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,010
the poverty of the people for
us writes about is important.

407
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:46,050
It makes them materialists
two or realists like frost.

408
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,660
Uh, they are, uh,

409
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,680
acutely conscious of the circumstances
in which they live their lives,

410
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,640
uh, and they suffer, uh,
they rage. Uh, they're,

411
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,840
they're new England.
Uh,

412
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:02,800
importantly is not an
ideal pastoral place.

413
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,600
The heart of north of Boston is a series
of dramatic monologues and dialogues,

414
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,050
uh, speeches in conversations for
people who really had never spoken,

415
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,650
were never spoken very much in modern,
excuse me,

416
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:21,310
in American poetry before. And, uh,

417
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,390
who in frost speak in a
holy, distinctive way, uh,

418
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,840
that is in Frost's combination
of colloquial sentence,

419
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:33,610
sound and unrivaled. I ambig
pentameter a blank. First,

420
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,200
it is the heroic language of Shakespeare,
Milton of Wordsworth.

421
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,200
Uh, the death of the hired man
home burial servant to servants.

422
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,560
The fear. These are, these
are, are our are, uh,

423
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,450
poems in which a frost is, uh,
giving, um, New England workers.

424
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,180
The, the, the language, uh,
of the great English poets.

425
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,820
Uh, I've been stressing
for us solitude, well, uh,

426
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,810
all the, uh, uh, people frost writes
about are in some sense alone, uh,

427
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,110
often alone together.
Uh, they share solitude,

428
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,180
uh, uh, solitary to in their
relation to each other.

429
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,430
Uh, frost. Uh,

430
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:23,410
as a narrator in these great poems
I'm describing a frames his peoples,

431
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,010
uh,

432
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,010
words minimally with few bits
of narrative information.

433
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:33,850
He just, uh, through plunges you
into their speech, into their lives.

434
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,040
And, uh, you have to, you have
to in a sense work to, uh,

435
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,990
uh, get into their character to
be able to keep track of who is,

436
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:47,690
uh, speaking. Let's, um, look at, uh,

437
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:52,690
w what is for me the most
gripping, uh, example,

438
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,850
uh, in this, of this kind of poem,
home burial on page two oh four,

439
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,060
um,
giving us a little introduction,

440
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:08,920
a little framing, uh, and no
consoling closure really, uh,

441
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,060
where the moral might come in another pot.
Uh,

442
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:17,310
frost creates a kind of uncomfortable
intimacy for us with his character's,

443
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,870
uh, were, were, were, were,
were challenged by them, were
brought up close to them.

444
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,260
Uh, look at, uh, home burial here.

445
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:32,110
He saw her from the bottom of
the stairs before she saw him.

446
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:33,770
And,

447
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,740
and that's a kind of emblematic moment
in frost where one person is in a sense

448
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,490
seeing another without being seen.
She was staring down,

449
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,910
looking back over her
shoulder at some fear.

450
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,670
She took a doubtful step and then undid
it to raise herself and look again.

451
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,200
He spoke, advancing toward her.
What is it you see from up there?

452
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,330
Always for,
I want to know

453
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,850
this is, this is another important
frost in motivation for, I want to know,

454
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,190
uh, here a desire expressed between
two people, a husband and a wife.

455
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,430
She turned and sank upon our skirts
at that as if collapsing and her face

456
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,040
changed from terrified to dull.

457
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,380
He said to gain time. And isn't that
an interesting phrase to gain time?

458
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,110
What is it you see

459
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,400
mounting until she coward under him

460
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,970
for he is fearful or fearsome?

461
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,330
I will find out now.
You must tell me dear.

462
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,890
She in her place refused him any help
with the least stiffening of her neck and

463
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:55,204
silence.

464
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,440
She let him look sure that he wouldn't
see blind creature in a while.

465
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,780
He didn't see, but at
last team murmured. Oh,

466
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,120
and again. Oh, what is it?

467
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,250
What she said,
just that I see

468
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,890
you don't, she challenged.
Tell me what it is.

469
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,760
Put it into words. What does he see? Well,

470
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,990
the wonder is I didn't see it once and
that is the grave that he has made for

471
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,740
their child.
Uh,

472
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:47,790
in those blocks of speech, there's,

473
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:50,070
there's, uh, importantly there. There's,

474
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:53,840
there's white space around what they
have to say. It's almost a way of, uh,

475
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:59,180
inviting us to visualize the separation
of these two people as they speak.

476
00:35:01,381 --> 00:35:03,540
And as we read,

477
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:06,690
we have to fill in the
nature of their relationship.

478
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,670
Uh, here, well,

479
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,150
people are locked into themselves in
frost and in their points of view.

480
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,620
Um, here, the issue in this palm is grief.

481
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,510
How the mother and father each
express how they deal with, uh,

482
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,920
the death of their child,
uh,

483
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,110
simply where and how they stand
in relation to each other.

484
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,790
They speak is important.

485
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,510
The woman,
the mother wishes to,

486
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,760
can't help herself from trying to hold
onto the dead child and she's caught

487
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:55,220
looking behind her, uh, as
if towards the past. Um,

488
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,830
which is also frankly a wish
to escape her husband, uh,

489
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,900
who is a frightening for
us to escape his will.

490
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:09,900
I think, uh, his will, his force,

491
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,700
these are his ways,

492
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:16,320
his resources for responding to death.
Uh,

493
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:22,150
uh, the woman's, uh,
objection as the poem and,

494
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,000
uh,
is summed up by his choice,

495
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,880
the father's choice to
bury the child himself. Uh,

496
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,130
he responds to this grievous loss
privately by taking it on himself,

497
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,930
by seeking to master it himself.

498
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,260
And specifically as a
worker in the grim tool,

499
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,070
if you like a of his,
uh, morning, uh, his,

500
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:56,640
his spade, uh, his, um,

501
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,300
uh, his, uh, the shovel he uses to do,

502
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:08,010
uh, the, the uh, uh, burying on,

503
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:09,420
on page two oh six,

504
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:17,130
um, she says, uh, um,

505
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,090
uh, well, there you go.
Sneering now, uh, and he says,

506
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:28,650
I'm not, I'm not, you make me
angry. I'll come down to you. God,

507
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,990
what a woman.
And it's come to this,

508
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,740
a man can't speak of his own child.
That's dead.

509
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,800
You can't speak because you don't
know how to speak. She says,

510
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:41,400
if you had feelings, you, that Doug
with your own hand, how could you,

511
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,300
his little grave,
I saw you from their very window.

512
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:49,920
They're making the gravel leap
and leap in air leap up like that,

513
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,950
like that and land so lightly
enroll back down the amount,

514
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,030
the mound beside the hole.
I thought, who is that man?

515
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,810
I didn't know you.
Well,

516
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,380
the father in home burial is a,
is a worker,

517
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:13,380
a worker there in those lines are
reduced to this tool that he's using,

518
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,420
uh, almost, uh, mechanically. That
makes the, uh, uh, dirt leap, um,

519
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,000
uh,

520
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
kind of desperate mechanism that's
trying to take control of the world and

521
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:27,100
failing, uh, as he, uh, uh,

522
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,020
well she says to him in this chills her,

523
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,410
I can repeat the very
words you were saying.

524
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,410
Three foggy mornings in one rainy
day will rot the best birch fence.

525
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,720
A man can build,
think of it,

526
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,640
talk like that at such a time.
But in fact, in his own way,

527
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:52,250
he's talking about his inability to,
uh,

528
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,510
keep his child alive there, uh, in,

529
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:58,930
in a kind of metaphorical way. Um, uh,

530
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,580
speaking of his failure to
build a fence to last, uh,

531
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,310
in a drives his wife ultimately,
uh,

532
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,670
disgusted by him away,
uh,

533
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,930
fearing him well.
Home burial is,

534
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,800
is a poem about the limits of work.
Uh,

535
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,830
the inability of the worker
to bring a knowable world,

536
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,830
a safe world into being there is in frost.
Uh,

537
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,100
no god,

538
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,320
no transcendental source of
guidance or constellation.

539
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,300
Nothing out there in the world,

540
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,690
but the material conditions
of our circumstances, uh,

541
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,770
over and over again, and
frost poems, uh, you see,

542
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,410
you see speakers, you
see the poet himself, uh,

543
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,430
wanting to know and wanting to know
means a pressing towards some revelation

544
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,410
towards, uh, some, uh, um,

545
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,540
a sense of the meaning of things. Uh, uh,

546
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,280
search for some kind of a presence
behind the way things are.

547
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:14,620
Uh, that is the subject of
the great sonnet design, uh,

548
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,780
uh, also in a very different
mood. Uh, the poem for once,

549
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:23,690
then something, uh, it's
also the subject of, uh,

550
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,240
neither out far nor in
deep, uh, which, um, uh,

551
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,520
I asked you to read for
today and is on to 20. Um,

552
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,320
I won't, I won't read it since we're
running a little short of time.

553
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,960
Uh, the, uh, people on the
shore that frost describes,

554
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:51,340
they're looking at to see, they're
watching for something. Uh,

555
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,110
but is there anything to watch for?
Is there any, anything uh, coming,

556
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:00,250
uh, uh, no, it doesn't appear so, uh,

557
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,860
but as he asks a,
at the end,

558
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,180
when was that ever a bar to any watch?
They keep,

559
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,720
uh, in these poems, um,

560
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,160
well when frost does give us images of

561
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,350
God or some informing presence,

562
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,910
that presence is imagine
negatively, uh, uh,

563
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,030
to be, uh, uh, well, uh,

564
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,530
as a kind of malevolence perhaps,
uh,

565
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,340
to be inferred from the arbitrariness and,

566
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:42,341
and cruelness of nature's destructive
force of the conditions of life,

567
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,800
of the people frost is describing.
So,

568
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,390
uh, if in in frost, you, you
can't look to God for it,

569
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,430
uh, what kind of, uh,

570
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,780
what kind of hope can be, uh, offered?

571
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,630
How can you save your soul?

572
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,450
This is a question for
us is interested in, uh,

573
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,720
in his own ways. Uh, he's
interested in redemption, uh,

574
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,860
important word for
Stevens to, uh, conclude.

575
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,020
Let me look quickly with you
at at two great late poems.

576
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,910
Uh, one on two 22, uh, is called provide,

577
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:36,620
provide,
well,

578
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,660
I'll read, I'll read
this. The witch that came,

579
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:46,930
the withered hag to wash the steps with
Pale and rag was once the beauty Abishag

580
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,490
the picture pride of Hollywood,
too many,

581
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:57,491
far from great and good for you to doubt
the likelihood die early and avoid the

582
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:03,500
fate.
Or if predestined to die late,

583
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,540
make up your mind to die and state,
make the whole stock,

584
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:13,541
exchange your own if need be occupied
the throne where nobody can call you

585
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:16,843
crone.

586
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,250
Some have relied on what they
knew others on being simply true,

587
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,310
what worked for them might work for you.

588
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,690
No memory of having starred atones for
later disregard or keeps the end from

589
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:32,870
being hard,

590
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,680
better to go down dignified with boughten
friendship at your side than none at

591
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:42,230
all. Provide, provide

592
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,050
and in some recordings for us then
says or somebody will provide for you.

593
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,660
It's a, it's a very funny poem. Uh,

594
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,060
and you've got triplet rhymes there
to make sure you know that frost is,

595
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:02,660
is joking and it feels like light verse
but of course, what are we laughing at?

596
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,240
Uh, uh, public achievement,
moral stature. They're of no use.

597
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,480
Uh, the end is hard and it's going to
be hard no matter how you come to it.

598
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,160
So you better look out for number one.
This is,

599
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:22,740
this is good old fashioned
American wisdom. Uh,

600
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,550
what is scathing about it,
uh,

601
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:30,320
is that frost gives up all
justification for self interest. Uh,

602
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,020
there's no for it except
self interest itself. Uh,

603
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,160
and then for us as even that won't work,
uh,

604
00:44:38,161 --> 00:44:43,161
the choice is a terrifying one of no
friendship and boughten friendship,

605
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,430
uh, which really isn't a friendship
at all. Uh, in short, uh,

606
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:54,150
the only thing to do in life is to provide
and provide is just what you cannot

607
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:58,440
ever adequately do as the
husband in home burial knows.

608
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,890
This is a poem written in the depth of
the depression and also at the height of

609
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:07,570
frost fame. Uh, and, uh, the, uh, you,

610
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:12,330
you could see that kind of grim refusal
to apologize for boughten friendship,

611
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,340
uh,
as a kind of well as a kind of apology,

612
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,090
a for his own popular success.
Well,

613
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:25,620
let me conclude by just
pointing to another poem. Uh,

614
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,290
a late poem, uh, directive,

615
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,450
a poem published in 1947 a,

616
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,870
it's on the page following,
uh, a poem published

617
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,010
after the Second World
War, uh, written, uh,

618
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,550
written about the postwar world.
Uh,

619
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,580
it begins by in a sense a rehearsing
or taking us back to frosts own,

620
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,460
um,

621
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,460
initial move north of Boston back out of
all this now too much for us back in a

622
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:06,210
time made simple by the loss of detail,
burn,

623
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:11,070
dissolved and broken off like graveyard,
marble sculpture in the weather.

624
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,340
There's a house that is no more a house,

625
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,760
and that is where he's going
to take us in the poem.

626
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,950
You can see that house, uh,
as uh, uh, in a sense, um,

627
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,690
a version of the home in home
burial. Uh, the, uh, the fraud,

628
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,600
the frost describes it here. Uh, you know,

629
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:34,650
movingly as uh,

630
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:39,420
well an image of a home that has
lost a of a home that has failed,

631
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,240
um, and, and yet frosts,
uh, attention is drawn,

632
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,370
uh, interestingly to a play house, uh,

633
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,480
that is part of that
household. Uh, he says, uh,

634
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,720
in the middle of the poem on two 25,
first,

635
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:02,310
there's the children's house of make
believe some shattered dishes underneath

636
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:03,144
the pine,

637
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,900
the play things in the play house of
the children week for what little things

638
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,610
could make them glad.

639
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,220
And then for the house that
is no more a house. And so on.

640
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,010
At the end of the poem here,
uh,

641
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,780
frost gives us however,

642
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:32,930
in a kind of alternative to this image
of the failure of the home and the

643
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:37,720
failure of, um, uh, the workers life, uh,

644
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,100
in,
um,

645
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:44,670
our own imaginative access to a spring,

646
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:49,330
a source, uh, above, um, above the house.

647
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:54,220
That was the water of the House that
nurtured it. That was, it's, uh, um,

648
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,050
refreshment. He says, your
destination in your destinies,

649
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,320
a brook that was the water of the house
cold as a spring is yet so near its

650
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:08,860
source,
too lofty and original to rage.

651
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,450
I have kept hidden in the instep arch
of an old cedar at the Waterside,

652
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,690
a broken drinking goblet,

653
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,230
like the grail under a spell.

654
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:25,030
So the wrong ones can't find it.

655
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,080
So can't get saved as saint
marks as they mustn't in there.

656
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:30,700
He sounds like a child,
doesn't he?

657
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,690
I stole the goblet from
the children's play house.

658
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,680
Here are your waters
in your watering place.

659
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:43,240
Drink and be whole again beyond confusion.

660
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,460
Uh, there the, the, uh, goblet, the, uh,

661
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:54,670
um, uh, the tool that frost comes to, uh,

662
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:59,560
is a, uh, it's a tool from
romance quest. It's the grail. Uh,

663
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:04,350
it's, it's, uh, the, uh, uh,
a cup of the last supper. Uh,

664
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:09,040
but what is it? It's in fact, a broken
goblet from the children's play house.

665
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:14,430
Frost returns us there too early sources
of imagination in a children's play.

666
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,010
Uh, and it gives us at
least imaginatively, uh,

667
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,960
in this shared journey with him,
uh,

668
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,420
access to a kind of
primal, we're freshmen, uh,

669
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,040
what he calls our waters and
our watering place. Uh, it's a,

670
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:38,041
it's a disillusioned and self
consciously ironic promise of salvation,

671
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:46,200
of wholeness, uh, but
it's still a promise. Uh,

672
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:51,210
and it's a promise of the
powers of imagination and
of poetry and of poetry made

673
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:58,060
out of play and a child's play.
Well, that's a good place to stop.

674
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,590
Uh, next week, uh, we will, um, uh,

675
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,690
go to work on William Butler.
Yeats.
