1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,630
The bridge. Uh, in order
to get to the bridge,

2
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:19,000
I want to go back and just say
a few more things about, uh,

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,020
voyages and about crane, uh, in general,

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,960
uh, in, uh, Crane's letter to, um,

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,660
the distressed editor of poetry
magazine, Harriet Monroe, uh,

6
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:38,260
that pros, uh, uh,
selection included in the,

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
the back of your book crane defense,
his palm app,

8
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:47,670
Melville's tomb, and,
uh, specifically defends,

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,760
uh, well, uh, what he calls his,

10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,350
uh, recourse to the logic of metaphor. Um,

11
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,420
what, what does the logic of
metaphor mean for crane? Well,

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,820
um, he, um,

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,670
distinguishes a,

14
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:13,590
his criteria for Monroe's on
page nine 68. Uh, you know,

15
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,520
he says, my palm may well be a
elliptical and actually obscure,

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
but in your criticism,
uh,

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,590
you've stated your objections in terms
that allow me the privilege of claiming

18
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:28,590
your ideas and ideals as theoretically,

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,450
at least quite outside the issues
of my own aspirations. And he says,

20
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,850
to put it more plainly,
as a poet,

21
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,851
I may very possibly be more interested
in the so called illogical impingements

22
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,190
of the connotations of,
well, that's a misprint. I,

23
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:52,191
it should be words on the consciousness
and their combinations and interplay in

24
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,450
metaphor in this basis.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Then I am interested in the preservation
of their logically rigid significations.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,140
Uh, crane is talking here about,

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,600
um, well, uh,

28
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,350
putting a kind of priority in his
poetry on connotation a over denotation.

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,680
Uh,

30
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,630
he's interested in the ways words
relate to and through other words,

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,630
uh,

32
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,150
before or in addition to the
ways in which they relate to,

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,830
uh, the things of the
world in this sense. Uh,

34
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,350
crane,
uh,

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,420
well introduces us to
a sense of poetry as,

36
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,040
um, as a linguistic
environment that, uh, uh,

37
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,230
is constructed through words,
uh, relating among themselves,

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,150
uh, in ways that play upon our, um, uh,

39
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:58,000
imagination systems of
association, uh, that in,

40
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,900
in effect our contribution to,
uh,

41
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,090
complete the thought,
uh,

42
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,250
all of which supposes and seeks a kind
of special intimacy with us as readers,

43
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,570
um, gives us a work to do. Um,

44
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,290
I suggested that the sea is a kind of
figure or metaphor in cranes work for this

45
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,470
linguistic space.
Um,

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
an imaginative space to which we are
summoned in a poem like App Melville's

47
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,690
Tomb. Uh, he's because he's
concerned with specifically, um,

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,530
how messages are transported,
um,

49
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,760
with, uh, the, uh, um, uh,

50
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,170
well what he calls the dice
have drowned men's bones. Um,

51
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,210
you can understand the, the, uh, the
poem is an allergy for Melville. Uh,

52
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:58,350
it's also a about reading Melville,
uh,

53
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,300
and getting his message,
uh,

54
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,310
that is reaching back into the
past and becoming for Melville,

55
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:10,840
the kind of reader that crane
himself seeks a as he describes it,

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,800
uh, in, um, uh, his letter to Monroe.

57
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,180
Uh,
in talking about voyages to,

58
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,340
I suggested that the,
our voyage is three rather.

59
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,840
The third section of the poem,
I,

60
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,790
I suggested that the image
of infinite con sang Gwyneth

61
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,080
was a impart an image of this linguistic
mixing and promiscuity that crane is

62
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,790
interested in, uh, in,

63
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,930
in poetry in this poem.
Uh,

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,960
the mixing of words in poetry
is analogized to the mixing of,

65
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,940
uh,
body of bodies of lovers.

66
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,680
Love here is also like death,
uh,

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,680
because it's a shattering
experience, uh, through which, uh,

68
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,540
the self is remade a and changed,

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,800
um,
with and through another,

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,330
uh, this is a process
of transformation. Uh,

71
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:24,070
it's one that crane costs Trans
member meant, um, which is,

72
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,330
uh, a way of evoking, not so
much a sharing of identity,

73
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:31,360
but rather some kind of exchange of it,
uh,

74
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,080
which is an experience
of the self changed, uh,

75
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,830
and the self redeemed,
uh, in, in cranes eyes.

76
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:42,100
This is exactly what
the wasteland, um, uh,

77
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:46,360
contemplates and draws
back from, uh, doesn't, uh,

78
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,140
embrace turns away from
it's what in Crane, uh,

79
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,930
love promises.
It's what poetry song promises.

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,320
Uh, the, uh, the space of
the palm, which is, uh,

81
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,950
like as crane imagines
that, uh, a space of love

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,860
is set apart from ordinary
life. Um, you, you, uh,

83
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:15,100
uh, Mike, uh, contrast the
kind of song and singing, uh,

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,300
that you find in this palm with
Elliot's Love Song for Prufrock,

85
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,210
uh,
crane recovers in this poem,

86
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,480
a kind of heroic blank first,
uh,

87
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:32,120
the medium of heroic drama,
uh,

88
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:37,121
and uses it for the speech of a poet
lover who celebrates the power of sound to

89
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:43,910
make its own sense through
the affirming force of desire.

90
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,340
Uh, he imagines this again, as a kind of
resurrection of some kind. What do you,

91
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:54,341
what he talks about is what has
to happen after the wasteland.

92
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,230
Uh,
in this sense,

93
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,460
a crane is talking about some
kind of passage through death.

94
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,050
Uh, and you can understand
that death as cranes,

95
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,530
admission as I suggested last time of the,
um,

96
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,360
uh, illusory nature of, um,

97
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,870
uh, rhetoric, uh, of, um, of love,

98
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,830
a itself of the power of a desire

99
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,310
which,
uh,

100
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,540
crane is always realistic about you.
You could say,

101
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,410
um, the poem voyages, uh,

102
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,660
treats its theme is really
the triumph of desire, uh,

103
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,280
even in defeat. Uh, that's also, uh,

104
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,680
the, the, um,

105
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,170
the theme of that Melville's tomb and
it's the grand theme of the bridge.

106
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,330
The bridge is cranes. Great
Poem, uh, about America.

107
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,250
Uh, we'll, uh, let me

108
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,670
bring up a picture of him.
This is a,

109
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:10,671
this is crane in 1927 or 28.

110
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,120
It's an unclear exactly when the
photo was taken by Walker Evans,

111
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,960
a great American photographer
and cranes friend on top of 'em,

112
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,090
one 10, Columbia Heights where crane
lived, uh, in view of Manhattan.

113
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,850
And, uh, the bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge,

114
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,870
the bridge is cranes.

115
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,250
A great poem about America or
about the idea of American.

116
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,870
I'll say more about what
that means in a moment. Uh,

117
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,290
and it's a reply, uh,
self consciously. So,

118
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,150
uh, to the wasteland. Uh,

119
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:55,590
I suggested that the shortness
of the wasteland was a,

120
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,410
in some ways, um, uh,

121
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,020
kind of argument against epic,
uh, in the modern world, uh,

122
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,130
uh, argument, uh,

123
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:10,131
about the impossibility of epic vision
in a culture which lacks a shared myths,

124
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,020
shared symbols,
a against this,

125
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:20,230
this lack a crane proposes,
uh, the bridge, uh,

126
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,410
the Brooklyn Bridge as a kind of
central organizing symbol, uh,

127
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,780
for modern culture.
Um,

128
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,110
the, uh, uh, this, this is a picture
of the bridge being built, um, uh,

129
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,840
in the 19th century. Uh,
it's important that as crane,

130
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,660
uh, looks at the bridge, uh, as a,

131
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:47,280
as a modern symbol that we remember
that it wasn't built in 1920 when I've,

132
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,240
I've forgotten now the, the year in
which it is a, but it was a, at least,

133
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,650
I think 60 years old at this point.
And you can see when, um, uh,

134
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:59,810
Roebling bridge, uh, was first
created. There's no Manhattan skyline

135
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,660
for it to reach to a, when crane, um, um,

136
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,020
turns to the bridge as
a symbol of the modern,

137
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:12,250
he's already looking back to an
earlier vision of the modern, uh,

138
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:16,400
if you like. Uh, and
in doing so, he is, uh,

139
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,430
joining many other American artists.
This is a photograph,

140
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,160
uh, by a Walker Evans, uh, who, who took,

141
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,590
uh, many images, uh, of
the, uh, the bridge, um,

142
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,450
with its cables and a Gothic Arches,

143
00:10:35,451 --> 00:10:40,010
all of which play into crane's
palms and complex ways.

144
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,110
Uh,
this is

145
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,590
the, the very great poem,
one of many Pa poem painting,

146
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,170
uh, by, uh, uh, Joseph Stella that, uh,

147
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,230
appears in the Yale Gallery,
a fantastic work, uh,

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,760
one that crane hadn't seen actually
when he began, uh, the bridge,

149
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,650
but which in all sorts of ways, um, uh,

150
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,170
is, is, uh,

151
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,110
Moni us with, with his
vision, including, um,

152
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,730
the ways in which, uh, the,
uh, sublime vision, uh,

153
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,140
that it offers, uh, includes, uh,

154
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,950
darkness. Uh, and, and I
would have to say, ah, okay,

155
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,470
uh, perhaps, uh, a frightening or, or, um,

156
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,620
um, sinister elements. Um,

157
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,720
it is a,
also importantly,

158
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:39,721
a moment in American art
when artists like a Stella,

159
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,070
uh,
like

160
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,270
a crane or interested,
uh, here's a Joseph Marin,

161
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,050
uh, uh, with another image. This
one painted from the bridge,

162
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,040
uh,
are in

163
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,040
which artists are creating a
kind of an idiom that involves,

164
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,700
includes abstraction, uh, shows us, uh,

165
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,730
images of the world in
realist representation that
are being transformed into,

166
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,180
uh, something, uh, semi
abstract and symbolic.

167
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,840
A crane is, is very much
involved in the same kind of, uh,

168
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,440
activity as these artists.
These are more images, uh, uh,

169
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,170
from Evans. Uh, these of course
shot from underneath the bridge and,

170
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:35,950
and showing it, uh, uh,
as a kind of abstract,

171
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,370
uh, form a rising, uh, into, uh,

172
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,680
uh, the New York skyline. Um,

173
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,320
this is, uh, this is the title page of,

174
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,530
of cranes a poem as it appeared in the,
uh,

175
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,020
uh, black son, uh, addition
a limited edition, uh,

176
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,640
in Paris in 1930. Uh, it's, uh, uh,

177
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,700
first publication followed shortly
thereafter by publication in New York

178
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,820
Crane took the Brooklyn
Bridge, uh, as, um,

179
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,340
as a kind of symbol of a structure.

180
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,540
The structure of spiritual
action as he understood it.

181
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,340
Underpinning American history,

182
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,300
it seemed to him to embody an idea that
he saw variously embodied in American

183
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:38,470
history. Uh, for crane.

184
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:43,471
American history is a
series of new world visions,

185
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,970
uh, all of them, uh,

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,890
versions or avatars of what
he also calls it Lantis.

187
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,800
Uh, the city sunk beneath the
waves in platonic Nif, uh,

188
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,730
that promises to return,
uh,

189
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,130
in return us to some kind
of redeemed community.

190
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:04,871
Uh,

191
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:09,871
Atlanta says cranes name for a kind
of promised relation to the world.

192
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,470
Uh,

193
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,470
that's been a glimpse but also
lost a to aim at Atlantis,

194
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,480
uh, as the poem does. And as
crane says, American history does,

195
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,580
uh, is to go interestingly, confusingly,

196
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,870
simultaneously into the
past and into the future,

197
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,880
uh,

198
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,880
to rescue or recover something from
history promised for the future,

199
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,200
uh, in to bring that future into
being crane understands, uh,

200
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,520
the mythic work of the poem,
his poem,

201
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,980
a as a kind of act of

202
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,150
a one that has this kind of chronological
mission of going back into the past

203
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,160
and forward into the future.

204
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:04,240
The title page here. Uh, you can't
make it out, but it's, uh, in,

205
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,300
um, uh, uh,

206
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,830
clear in your anthology carries a,

207
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,630
an epigraph from the book of Job,
uh,

208
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,270
from going to and fro in the earth
and from walking up and down in it.

209
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,300
Uh, the, the, um, um,

210
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,470
epigraph from job introduces these two
motions as being essential to a crane's

211
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:31,881
imagination in the poem that is
going to and fro back and forth.

212
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,890
And by going up and down, uh, you can see,

213
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,860
uh, these two motions,
uh, in fact, um, uh,

214
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,820
easily, uh, visual izable in
the form of the bridge itself,

215
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,290
which drives, it's pylons
that into the river, uh,

216
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:55,940
and rises up in these gothic
structures in order to carry,

217
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,530
uh,

218
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,130
people back and forth across the river.

219
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,090
Uh, the, uh, epigraph is
also a kind of joke, uh,

220
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,790
because crane wrote this poem,
a like job tramping around,

221
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,680
uh, across, uh, the, uh,
the northeast, uh, from, uh,

222
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,120
one apartment or House to
another, uh, or one couch,

223
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,930
uh, to uh, another, uh, and uh,

224
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:28,280
wrote it in Europe,
uh, and uh, California,

225
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,110
uh, and elsewhere. Um,
him self crane, being,

226
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,350
um, uh, um, without, um, uh,

227
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,950
secure, uh, station, uh, in, in, um, uh,

228
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,670
the poem, uh, in the,
the writing of the poem,

229
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,980
a crane's, um, interest
in the poem, uh, in,

230
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:56,390
uh, Hobos, uh, and marginals, uh,

231
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,180
of a, of many kinds, uh,

232
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,560
as well as with pioneers and
other kinds of travelers, uh,

233
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,370
all, um, represent, um,

234
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,690
uh, figures, uh,

235
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,760
of spiritual questers who are,
um,

236
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,830
in a sense without a station in life,

237
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:24,590
but rather in motion as, um, uh,

238
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,080
crane himself was the,
um,

239
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,850
this is the table of contents of the poem.
Uh,

240
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,690
it's helpful I think to, uh, uh,

241
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,710
look at it because it's
confusing. Um, it, it,

242
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,140
uh, the poem consists in
this, uh, pro, um, which I'll,

243
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,490
I'll talk about in a few moments.
Uh,

244
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:51,491
when crane actually dedicates as long
poem actually dedicates as poem to the

245
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,190
Brooklyn Bridge is if you could dedicate
a poem to the bridge to an object,

246
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,130
uh, a first section called Ave
Maria, which is spoken by Columbus,

247
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,840
Columbus,
not on his way to the new world,

248
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,310
but rather on his way back.
Uh, he speaks to us, uh,

249
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:13,080
on his way back.
Uh,

250
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:17,500
and it introduces the theme of,
uh,

251
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,580
carrying the message or the
vision forward into the future.

252
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,900
Um, the question of, you know,
how to retrieve or recover, um,

253
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,190
uh, the, uh, the vision
of the new world, uh,

254
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,910
is initially introduced there.
Uh,

255
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,580
then there's a section called
Pow Hatton's daughter, uh,

256
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:43,220
which refers to Pocahontas,
uh, invokes, um,

257
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,510
a, a, um, a vision of
the American continent,

258
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,350
uh, through a series of poems. Uh,

259
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,910
the Harbord Dance Van
Winkle, uh, the, the river,

260
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,870
the dance in Indiana, uh, which all, uh,

261
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:05,730
explore various moments in the history of,

262
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,500
um, the, uh, um, uh, um,

263
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,420
conquering of the continent.
Uh,

264
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,010
there's a section called
cutty Sark, uh, which, um, uh,

265
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:23,370
introduces us to a, um, um,

266
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,150
a drunken,
a visionary,

267
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,920
a sailor in a bar, uh,
on a sand street, uh,

268
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,350
in Lower Manhattan.
Uh,

269
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,240
that figure it seems to
metamorphose, uh, into, uh,

270
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:40,680
well Whitman in the,

271
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,720
a section for Cape Hatteras in a sense,
the center of the poem,

272
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,820
a Cape Hatteras, uh,
is concerned with, um,

273
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,930
the invention of flight. Uh, and, uh,

274
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,300
uh, at links a Whitman, um, to, um,

275
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,140
uh, well, really a, the whole
history of, uh, American, uh,

276
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,950
invention. Uh, there are, uh,

277
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,120
a series of songs called
three songs. Um, uh,

278
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,130
another section called
Quaker hill, uh, evoking, um,

279
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,340
in 1920s, um, uh,

280
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:26,730
New York suburb, a really
or, or Connecticut Hills, uh,

281
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:31,620
which, um, uh, brings
us up to the present,

282
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,860
uh, as does the poem, uh, the tunnel,

283
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,040
the tunnel being that most closely
based on the wasteland, uh,

284
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:45,420
and describing a kind of infernal
journey through the New York subways.

285
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,280
Uh, and then finally, um,

286
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,390
uh, Atlantis, uh, a
kind of a visionary, uh,

287
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,680
rhapsody that invokes the, uh, uh,

288
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:00,600
object of quest that the
poem is concerned with. Uh,

289
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,290
the poem as a,
in this way charts various journeys,

290
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,080
a westward and eastward,
uh,

291
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,480
back and forth in time.
Um,

292
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,940
discovery means nothing without the
relaying of the vision and the kind of

293
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:20,500
carrying it forward.
Um,

294
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,530
the bridge is a concerned with in these
various sections with a series of,

295
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,340
of, um, well a series of symbols,

296
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,080
symbols that are very frequently
vehicles or transports,

297
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,280
uh, from, uh, Columbus's ship to, uh,

298
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,510
the subway to the Wright
brothers, uh, airplanes,

299
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,070
uh, transport. Uh, this is in the sense,

300
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:51,060
the grand theme of the bridge.
Uh,

301
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,020
the root meaning of metaphor is to
carry something over to transport it.

302
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,190
A crane is, is, uh, um,

303
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,470
for crane metaphor is as
central, um, a concept,

304
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,400
inactivity, uh, as
translation is for pound.

305
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,340
But in a crane,

306
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,940
the emphasis is on
imaginative transformation.

307
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,130
That's really what a
metaphor has to offer. Uh,

308
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,740
the central symbol of the bridge. The
bridge itself, you could understand as a,

309
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,280
as a metaphor for metaphor,

310
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,370
a metaphor for a primary
human capacity. Uh, uh,

311
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,420
the capacity to posit an object of desire,

312
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,320
frosted eyes. There were
that lifted altars, uh,

313
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,520
to posit an object of desire that
expands the horizon of the real,

314
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,610
what's possible.
Uh,

315
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,670
and in so doing a violates a existing
systems of cognition and projects the

316
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,110
vision of a new world.
Uh,

317
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:10,090
this also means that the poem is
constantly producing new symbols for this

318
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:13,870
activity. New Metaphors,
uh, Crane said at a,

319
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,740
in one letter of the bridge in
becoming a ship, a world, a woman,

320
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,930
a tremendous harp as it finally does,

321
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,370
seems really to have a career.
Uh,

322
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,970
and so it does, um, this is, um,

323
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,120
again, the Black Sun edition,
which I recommend that you
go to buy Nikki. And look,

324
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,720
it's one of the most beautiful
books. Uh, I know, uh,

325
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,520
it's a great big book with
these, uh, big margins, uh, and,

326
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,350
uh, read, um, uh, headings.
Uh, let's look at the pro.

327
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:51,980
Um, uh, as both an introduction
to the poem and as a,

328
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,970
a kind of a summary, uh, in,

329
00:23:55,971 --> 00:24:00,830
in miniature of it's a
intentions, uh, claims procedures.

330
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,560
How many dawn's chill from his rippling
rest the seagulls wings shall dip and

331
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:15,041
pivot him shedding white rings of
tumult building high over the chain,

332
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,560
Bay waters,
liberty.

333
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,730
Then with inviolate curve,

334
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,750
for sake our eyes as apparitional,

335
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:31,751
as sales that cross some page of figures
to be filed away till elevators drop us

336
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,780
from our day.
And the poem begins with another,

337
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,770
a resurrection of some kind in this case,

338
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,950
not a seal rising from the
water to a gaze toward paradise,

339
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,440
but rather a seagull,
uh,

340
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,290
rising as many times before,

341
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:59,030
how many dawn's chill from
his rippling rest. Uh,

342
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,710
and this, this seagull
becomes a kind of, um, uh,

343
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:07,550
image of a cent, uh, and, and flight, uh,

344
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,990
uh, the, the, I guess, uh, um, uh, it,

345
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:15,560
it is an initial image of transport.
Uh,

346
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,730
the bird sheds white rings of tumult,
uh,

347
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,610
and there's that word
from voyage is three.

348
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,060
You remember him where death
if shed presumes no carnage,

349
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:29,180
but the single change here, uh, again,

350
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:33,920
there's an action of shedding as the
bird throws off the darkness of the night

351
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,360
and rises, uh, building hi, uh,

352
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,690
then disappears.
The vision vanishes.

353
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,270
We're in the world of work.
Uh,

354
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:49,271
we are in the office spaces of lower
Manhattan till elevators drop us from our

355
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,960
day. And if we've just gone
up, now we go down again.

356
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,790
I think of cinemas,

357
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,680
panoramic slights with multitudes
bent towards some flashing scene.

358
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,480
Never disclosed,

359
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,280
but hasten to again for
told two other eyes.

360
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:11,030
On the same screen. Uh, the movie theater,

361
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,830
the movie theater is a new machine
of transport, uh, in the 20s.

362
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,990
A kind of mass entertainment
that cranes poem will in a sense,

363
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:25,150
try to rival and provide, uh, a, uh,

364
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,650
uh, complementary, uh, uh, way of, uh,

365
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,250
imagining a collective
vision, uh, anyone he offers.

366
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,000
Next is the bridge, uh, which he, uh,

367
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,750
addresses in this Archaic Language,
uh,

368
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,660
archaic and intimate language as if,
uh,

369
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,320
Brooklyn Bridge could have
a subjectivity and the,

370
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,170
he says across the harbor silver paste,
as if

371
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,730
the light on the bridge, uh, um,

372
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,500
we're being seen as a kind of movement
that the bridge was itself involved in,

373
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,431
uh,

374
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:10,431
as though the son took step of the yet
left some motion ever unspent in Nice

375
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:15,690
stride, implicitly thy freedom
staying the, uh, this is,

376
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:20,070
uh, this is a wild kind of address to, uh,

377
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,970
architecture, uh, as if the
bridge were animate, uh,

378
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,360
with the power of motion,
uh,

379
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:31,740
and as if it had a kind of
motion that was w fountain, like,

380
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:36,630
and could not be exhausted,
then suddenly were given another,

381
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,530
uh, vision. Uh,

382
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,400
the, um, uh,

383
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,750
the threat of suicide suddenly rises up
in the poem out of some subway scuttle

384
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:54,170
cell or loft,
a bedlam.

385
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,180
Mites speeds to thy parapets tilting
their momently shrill shirt ballooning

386
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,190
adjust falls from the speechless caravan.

387
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,440
Uh,

388
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,440
the possibility of failure
seems dialectically to be
written into this poem's

389
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,190
grant, uh, ambition.
Uh, it's, it's, um, uh,

390
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,690
it's
wish for a assent and,

391
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,010
and redemption, uh, crane, uh,

392
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,710
turns then, uh, two, uh,
images of, of the, uh,

393
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,470
of the, of the bridge in, uh,

394
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,510
the New York skyline down wall
from girder into street noon leaks,

395
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,040
a rip tooth of the skies,

396
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:49,041
a settling all afternoon the cloud flown
Derek's turn thigh cables breathe the

397
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,520
North Atlantic still as if it
were a kind of ship. Uh, I,

398
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,870
I don't know about you, but I, I, uh,

399
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,600
am thrilled every time I
read a crane's, um, uh,

400
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:07,050
language, uh, of evoking the, uh,

401
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,120
the kind of sensual power, uh, of,

402
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,390
uh, New York architecture. Oh,

403
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:17,970
harp and alter of the fury fused.

404
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,410
How could mirror toil align?
I quiring strings.

405
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,890
It's the bridges harp and alter
instrument of music and site of worship.

406
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,500
Terrific threshold of the profits.

407
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:35,160
Pledge Prayer of pariah and the lovers cry

408
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,830
again.
The traffic lights that Skim,

409
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:43,330
Nice unfractionated idiom,

410
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,020
immaculate sigh of stars beating thy path,

411
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,420
condense Aternity.

412
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,040
And we have seen night lifted in nine
arms under the eye shadow by the peers.

413
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:00,550
I waited only in darkness.

414
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:05,551
Is Eye shadow clear the city's
fiery parcels all undone already.

415
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,580
Snow submerges in Iron Year.
Oh,

416
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:16,420
sleepless is the river under the vaulting.

417
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,810
The see the prayer dreaming Saad.

418
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,870
Suddenly the bridge crosses the
Atlantic. It crosses, uh, the, uh,

419
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,880
American continent unto us lowliest
and now it's a kind of divinity that he

420
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,100
beseeches to descend and of the curb ship
of the bridge itself seen as a kind of

421
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,570
vehicle of a curved ship.

422
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,540
Lend a myth to God.
Uh,

423
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,703
the poem,

424
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,450
the poem means to, uh, incorporate, uh,

425
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,370
the threat of failure
and the threat of death,

426
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,500
uh, and move beyond it, uh,

427
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,230
much as it aims to incorporate,
um,

428
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,080
the wastelands despair and move beyond it.

429
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,990
Uh, it is, uh,

430
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,380
kind of just a kind of prayer,

431
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,600
a kind of pledge that
belongs to lover or pariah.

432
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,290
Um, these are our speech acts that, um,

433
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,180
our models for the kind of
poem that you're reading,

434
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,503
uh,

435
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,700
the intention is to somehow create from
a series of fragments a hole that would

436
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,960
be an unfractionated
idiom as crane calls it,

437
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:51,760
which would be a kind of
pure and redeemed language.

438
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,583
Uh,

439
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:59,200
there's that phrase in the
last stanza of the curve ship,

440
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,790
meaning, uh, both derived
from the bridge. Uh,

441
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,370
I think an in partaking of it,

442
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,123
uh,

443
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,560
he asks the Bridge to lend a myth
to God land, you know, to land is,

444
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:19,540
is to, uh, give, knowing
it will be given back. Uh,

445
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:24,460
this is not a permanent, uh, name for
God. It is not the one symbol for God.

446
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,770
It is only a one in an ongoing
series of acts of naming,

447
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,900
which are all acts of metaphor,
uh, which are all acts by which,

448
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,990
uh, something from the past
is joined to the future.

449
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:42,991
Something far as joined with something
near out of some kind of spiritual need

450
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,790
or vision. Well, the poem was, uh,

451
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,630
begun, uh, crane. Like this
idea both ends at once.

452
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,690
Just the way you build a bridge,
uh,

453
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,350
by writing the poem and by writing
a Atlantis and gradually, uh,

454
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:05,150
over time, uh, moving
towards, uh, the middle. Um,

455
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,940
the, um, this is, uh,
the final section, uh,

456
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,750
Atlantis. In fact, why don't we
turn there for a moment? Uh, this,

457
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,980
this is this kind of
splendid, outrageous, um,

458
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,170
uh, Shelly in a lyric speech, uh,

459
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,360
through the bound cable strands, the
arching path upward veering with light,

460
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,550
the flight of strings.
And you can image now, uh,

461
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,210
in your minds that great Stella
painting, um, over in the gallery,

462
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,273
uh,

463
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:45,260
taught miles of shuttling moonlights
syncopate the whispered rush telepathy of

464
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:50,261
wires up the index of night granted and
steel transparent meshes fleck lists the

465
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:55,190
gleaming staves sibling voices,

466
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:58,580
flicker wavering Lee
stream as though a god.

467
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:03,530
We're issue of the strings here.
Uh,

468
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:08,070
at the end of the poem,
a crane imagines a kind of a cent,

469
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,120
uh,
through the structure of the bridge,

470
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,110
which becomes a grand musical instrument,
a harp.

471
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,330
Um, the, uh, uh, visionary,

472
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,850
uh, appears here, uh,

473
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,880
in fragmentary ways as in line 25 where
a sheerly the eyes like seagulls stung

474
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:36,590
with rhyme, uh, slipped and propelled
by glistening fins of light.

475
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,790
A crane talks here about
the eyes moving up, uh,

476
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,020
through this structure.
Uh,

477
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,970
like the seagull that we saw
in the first line of the poem.

478
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,650
Um, the, the,

479
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,880
the object of desire,
the, the, uh, uh, uh,

480
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,370
version of paradise crane offers us.

481
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:01,840
Is there an in line 42 or so,
uh,

482
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,880
where he talks about the bridge as vision
of the voyage bridge lifting night to

483
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:11,660
Cyclorama mic.
It should be a crest of deepest day,

484
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:13,551
uh,

485
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:18,551
oh choir translating time
into what multitudinous verb,

486
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,090
the suns and synergy of waters ever fuse
as if somehow the sun and water on the

487
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:28,460
space of the,
uh,

488
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,490
bridge and beneath it a created what crane
calls a multitudinous verb recast and

489
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:39,210
myriad syllables,
some of cafe.

490
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,610
That's of course Columbus's
goal cafe. Um, oh,

491
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:47,370
love thy White Pervasive Paradigm.

492
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:51,870
It's also a vision of love.
Um,

493
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,850
here, um, crane gives us a
kind of vision of the word,

494
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,350
the multitudinous verb as what his poem,
uh,

495
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:06,120
draws its a energy from and
what it moves towards. A,

496
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:10,560
it is not a Christian
word. Uh, importantly,

497
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,430
uh, it is, it is I think a a name for,

498
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:19,460
for a creative process that accessed
in and through our powers of language.

499
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,660
The word in cranes pump,
uh,

500
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:28,230
is secular and historical,
uh,

501
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,410
but yet it unfolds from what he
calls an ever presence beyond time.

502
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,790
A towards which the poem
is, is questing. Uh,

503
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,250
it is, uh, uh,

504
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,260
creativity or kind of power of world
making a that's embodied in our language

505
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,460
crane is imagining a post
Christian religion, uh,

506
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,330
for which America provides
iconography and myths. Uh,

507
00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:02,160
the poem is it an encyclopedia of
America and places in American culture,

508
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,110
uh, popular culture, uh,
in, in, uh, in burlesque,

509
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,940
in national winter garden in the
river in Virginia. There's slang,

510
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:16,440
jazz advertising.
All of that worked into the poem.

511
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,221
Uh,

512
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:22,221
the palm combines I kind of popular
storybook history of figures like Rip Van

513
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,930
Winkle and, uh, the most challenging
abstract modernist poetics.

514
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:32,700
At the same time. Uh, every
line is, is loaded with,

515
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,240
uh,

516
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,240
symbols and reference linking up
to other lines in the same way.

517
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:38,941
Uh,

518
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:43,941
in the same way crane is suggesting that
every moment in American history links

519
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:48,330
up with others, uh, and with the
larger structure of action, uh,

520
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,190
of which it is part a
crane's poem is therefore,

521
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,050
uh, I think, uh,

522
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,810
at once knowingly naive and hyper
sophisticated, uh, both of these,

523
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,850
uh,
things at once.

524
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,380
Um, crane composed the poem, uh,

525
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,570
through the funding with
the funding of Otto Kahn,

526
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,020
a businessman, philanthropist, uh,

527
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:23,310
and he explains his outline
of the poem, uh, at, um,

528
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,420
uh,

529
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,560
still a relatively early
period of composition in
that letter to Otto Kahn that

530
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:32,880
I included for you last time. Um, he, uh,

531
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,020
uh, well I'll just, uh, I'll,
I'll refer to it. Um, uh,

532
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,710
briefly, uh, the, um, uh,

533
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,100
keeping mind that table of
contents. I, I showed you before,

534
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:49,960
there's a kind of story of
American history told in large,

535
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,950
uh,
or in,

536
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:55,180
in the poem in which
crane moves from Columbus

537
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,330
to, uh, the, uh, um,
the section called Po,

538
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,700
Po Hatton's daughter, uh, where the
theme is the betrayal of the land, uh,

539
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,680
in the conquest of the
continent. Uh, in the middle, uh,

540
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,450
in, in Cape Hatteras, uh, when crane is,

541
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:20,110
is writing about a invention
and technology, uh,

542
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:21,280
in American culture,

543
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,870
his theme is also the civil
war and World War One.

544
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,340
Uh,
again,

545
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:32,341
a kind of a betrayal of vision by which
technology becomes a means to kill.

546
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,390
Uh, in, um, his letter to con, uh,

547
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:42,391
he talks about having a section on John
Brown that would take up the topic of

548
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:46,390
slavery. Uh, this section
was never written,

549
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:51,190
but there are traces of it you find
in the section called the river.

550
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,070
Uh, in each of these sections,
uh, crane turns to, uh, and,

551
00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:01,330
and looks to, um, um, uh, again,

552
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:04,510
hobos marginal figures who are,
uh,

553
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:09,010
emblems of lost promise who,
um,

554
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:12,340
uh,
seem to represent

555
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,300
possibilities,
uh,

556
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,560
included in but also marginalized by,
uh,

557
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:23,500
American history,
American culture.

558
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,700
You can understand these figures such as
the sailor that you meet and cutty Sark

559
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:32,970
as versions of the authors to whom crane
appeals throughout through illusion and

560
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:37,960
epigraph. Melville, uh, Dickinson,

561
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,170
a Po in the tunnel,
uh,

562
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,220
crane reaches back to these
authors canonical for us,

563
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,600
Co authors that you study,
but that were, uh, uh,

564
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,670
largely left out of accounts of American
literary history in the 1920s who

565
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:59,080
themselves appeared to be
marginals. Um, these, uh,

566
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,470
these are our versions
of a kind of, um, uh,

567
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,270
community that crane wants to
recover and carry forward, uh,

568
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,130
for the, uh, creative promise
that they seem to embody.

569
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,820
Well, um, let me, um,

570
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,770
okay.

571
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,040
Just point to, uh, the poems.

572
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,140
Let's say a two different
endings. Um, the, uh,

573
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,053
okay.

574
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,440
History of the composition of the
poem is different from the uh, uh,

575
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,020
sequence, uh, that you read. Uh,

576
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,290
because crane began at both ends.
Uh,

577
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,250
the end of the poem is really
a, in one sense, the middle.

578
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,040
Uh, when Crane Completes Cape
Hatteras at last, after, um,

579
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,140
uh, struggling, uh, with this
section, uh, for a couple years,

580
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,920
um, he, um, uh, completes, uh,

581
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:06,620
the span of the bridge in
one, uh, particular, uh, uh,

582
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,960
image one, 1 cents. And that's, uh,

583
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,060
towards the end of the
section on six 36. Uh, and he,

584
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:18,960
he invokes a in quotes,
Whitman, Whitman, again, a, uh,

585
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,840
here, seen as a kind of a marginal, uh,

586
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:28,841
who is a recovered for American
culture through the poems,

587
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,840
uh, imaginative act. Um,

588
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,270
Whitman is addressed, recorders,
ages, hence that's a quote from,

589
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:41,600
from Whitman's Calamus poems,
uh, recorders ages. Hence, yes,

590
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:46,430
they shall hear in their own veins
on canceled thy Shore Tread Whitman,

591
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,860
uh, and read the by the
oral, the halo round.

592
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,340
I head of pasture shine.
Panis Angelica,

593
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,670
a bread of angels. Uh,
here, uh, uh, Whitman's, um,

594
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,090
Whitman becomes a kind of figure for,
um, uh, a kind of secular communion.

595
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,560
Yes, Walt afoot again and
onward without halt. Not soon,

596
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:13,700
nor suddenly know, never to let
go my hand in yours, Walt Whitman.

597
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,430
So, uh, that is,

598
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,890
that's a kind of a moment
when in this hand clasp, uh,

599
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:25,040
a certain, um, uh,
aspiration of the poem, uh,

600
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:29,730
is completed, uh, and, and
a connection, uh, to, uh,

601
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,140
the past is a achieved, uh, in assertive.

602
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,600
The conclusion of the
poem that we find in, um,

603
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,750
uh, uh, at the end of
Atlantis, uh, is, is another,

604
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,890
uh, vision. Uh, and
I'll conclude with that.

605
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,540
Um, it's, I think, uh,

606
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,560
something to be contrasted with
this triumphant and reassuring,

607
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:58,030
um,
um,

608
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,800
conclusion that a Cape
Hatteras offers, uh, here.

609
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,250
Well,
here are the last to

610
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,380
sublime stanza of the poem migrations
that must needs void memory inventions

611
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:20,330
that cobblestone the heart
unspeakable bow bridge to the Oh,

612
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:25,310
love the, I pardon for this
history, widest flower. Oh,

613
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:27,580
answer of all anemone.

614
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,080
Now while the pedal, the
sun's about as hold, oh,

615
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:36,360
thou whose radio and stuff inherit me.

616
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,200
It Lantis hold dye
floating singer late here,

617
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:43,500
Atlantis is brought into being with,
uh,

618
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,010
the singer himself on
the verge of drowning

619
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,700
I floating singer. And
then finally, uh, uh,

620
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,820
crane dedicates himself
to this, uh, vision,

621
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,940
which he calls ever presence.

622
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,000
So to design ever presence beyond time,

623
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,780
like spears in sanguine of one tolling
star that bleeds infinity the or fix

624
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:11,371
strings.

625
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:16,371
Now the cables of the bridge have
become the strings of Orpheus is liar.

626
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,430
Say Dariel. Phalynx is leap
and converge. And again,

627
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:25,260
you can see the structure of the
bridge image there. One Song,

628
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,580
one bridge of fire,

629
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,240
is it cafe now pity steeps the grass
and rainbows ring the serpent with the

630
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:38,421
eagles in the leaves whispers
and Tiffany in Azure swing.

631
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,190
The poem ends, uh, with
this question. Is it cafe

632
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,180
Columbus's question,
uh, an error, a mistake.

633
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,850
Uh, it is the nature of the
object of desire to be misnamed,

634
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,110
uh, precisely because
it has no one name. Uh,

635
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,610
and even in this a error,
this kind of a defeat, um,

636
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:08,660
there is for crane,
uh,

637
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,930
in affirming of the scope of desire
precisely through its failure to be

638
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:18,810
contained by a single reference.
Well,

639
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,620
we'll stop now. Um,
and, uh, I know you have

640
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,570
done your work and, and gathered
a, a, a, a note a wheel, um,

641
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,270
collect these, uh, and, um, uh,

642
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,270
put together our own
annotated version of the poem.
