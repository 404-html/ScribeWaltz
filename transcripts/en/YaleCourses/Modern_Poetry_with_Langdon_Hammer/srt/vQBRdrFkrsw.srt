1
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,930
I'm going to talk about
William Carlos Williams today.

2
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,931
It may be that I end up carrying a little
bit of Williams over to next time too.

3
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:25,080
Um, uh, uh, Marianne Moore, his friend,

4
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,860
a contemporary and a really close,
um,

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,210
uh, close, uh, uh,
collaborator in a sense in the,

6
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:40,910
uh, uh, New York, uh, uh, scene of,

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,780
of modernism in the, uh, teens
twenties, thirties, forties, uh,

8
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,380
and on into the 50s. This is, uh,

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,870
this is the man, uh, as a young man,
uh, uh, William Carlos Williams.

10
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:58,560
If you open your, um, uh,

11
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:03,561
anthologies to page two
84 in the long head,

12
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:08,730
note that, um, and useful
headnote that Jihad Ramezani, uh,

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,470
provides you, uh, there's
this quotation from a letter,

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,743
uh,

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,680
in the middle of two 84 that
Williams wrote to Harriet Monroe,

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,630
uh, the editor of poetry who, uh,

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,670
13 years later Hart crane would a right
to in defense of his palm at Melville's

18
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,450
tomb. Uh, and William says
in this letter to Monroe,

19
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,040
most current versus dead from
the point of view of art,

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,570
it's dead. It's lifeless. Uh,

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,380
and what Williams cares about
is something he calls life.

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,080
Uh,

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,550
now life is above all
things else at any moment,

24
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,050
subversive of life as it
was the moment before.

25
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,950
And I think that's how we know it in
William's life is whatever is subverting

26
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,620
whatever was a, a moment, uh,

27
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,650
before and subversive as is probably
an important and suggestive word there.

28
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,000
Uh, uh, subversive of life
as it was the moment before,

29
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,740
always knew irregular.
He wants what is new,

30
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,900
uh, and what is new is going to be what
is your regular and what is irregular, uh,

31
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,270
has in some sense, uh, uh,

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,400
subverted what was in place before,
uh,

33
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,670
he continues verse to be alive,
to have,

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,490
you know, what pound I think
would've called the impulse, uh,

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,810
for verse to be alive.
Uh,

36
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:47,340
it must have infused into it
something of the same order.

37
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,650
It has to have life in it,
uh,

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,540
or what he calls some
tincture of disestablishment,

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,260
something in the nature of an impalpable
revolution in ethereal reversal.

40
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:08,320
Let me say, I am speaking
of modern verse, uh,

41
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,330
like, uh, uh, certain of
our other poets. Um, uh,

42
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:18,200
Williams is his self consciously
modern. Uh, he's defining, um,

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,380
what modern means.
Uh,

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,930
and he's defining it as a quality
of a experience that he calls life,

45
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,330
uh, that has the quality
of disrupting, uh,

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,230
whatever, uh, was, uh,
in existence before. Uh,

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,370
and this is a quality, uh, in energy, uh,

48
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:42,610
that he wants to have
in his poetry itself.

49
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,790
Uh, this is a Williams
a little bit older, uh,

50
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,060
Williams in 1924,
uh,

51
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,680
1924, uh, when he has, uh,

52
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,830
established himself through the poems
in a volume called springing all,

53
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,440
uh, as one of the, uh, major, uh,

54
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,970
modern poets in America,
uh,

55
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,740
he is the author of a poem.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,420
Have you ever seen it
called the red wheelbarrow?

57
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,000
Uh, and, uh, that might be
a good place to begin. Uh,

58
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,880
that's on to 94 to 95. Uh,
of course I'm joking. Uh,

59
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,070
probably,
um,

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,980
that's the one poem every body in this
class has read before they came to this

61
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,770
class. Uh, it is, uh, you know,

62
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,570
better known than the Negro
speaks of rivers or stopping
by woods on a snowy eve.

63
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,760
Um, uh, even, uh, it is,
uh, also distinguished,

64
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:50,080
I think as, uh, being the
second shortest modern poem. Uh,

65
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,300
after in a station of the metro,

66
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,130
a poem that it's related to
in certain ways. In fact, uh,

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,960
you know, a link between Williamson
pound is, is important. It's relevant.

68
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,790
A pound was a friend and
rival for Williams, uh,

69
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,660
throughout his career. Um, uh,

70
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,120
Williams is sometimes seen, uh,
in his, uh, early stages, uh,

71
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,390
as a, as a kind of images, uh, or, uh,

72
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,960
at any rate as a poet
influenced by, uh, the image,

73
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,830
just a aesthetic image.
Ism is of course,

74
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,300
a visual metaphor.
Uh,

75
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,990
and Williams is above all a visual poet,

76
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,650
a poet of the eye.
Uh,

77
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,080
so much depends upon a red wheelbarrow
glazed with rain water, uh,

78
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,680
and, uh, uh, beside
the white chickens. Uh,

79
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,950
well,
uh,

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,380
I think you have to see that poem to
start to really be able to read it, uh,

81
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,630
to, uh, it's, it's, uh, uh,

82
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:03,650
I think probably does involve some subtle,
uh,

83
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,400
vocal and auditory experience. But, uh,

84
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:12,050
it's first of all a poem that
meets you and challenges you, uh,

85
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,490
through the eye,
uh,

86
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:17,900
as a visual object in
some sense on the page.

87
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,110
Uh, the, the kind of seeing
that Williams's poems call for,

88
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,180
um, is, uh,

89
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,860
we can think of as a way of
reading that has, uh, uh, deaf.

90
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,850
His poems themselves
demand. Uh, in other words,

91
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:38,270
there's a kind of link between how he
sees the world and the way in which he

92
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:43,070
asks us to read him. Uh, his poems model,

93
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:46,370
a kind of seeing,
uh,

94
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,050
unlike in a station of the Metro,
uh,

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,870
the red wheelbarrow, or let me call
it instead, so much depends, uh,

96
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:01,800
is a poem a without a title. Uh,
this title, the Red Wheelbarrow was,

97
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,650
uh,
like the title.

98
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,410
This is just to say in the
poem that follows the almost
equally famous pump. Uh,

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,400
these are titles, a Williams,
uh, added, uh, later to his work,

100
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,750
uh, in spring and all that volume, uh,

101
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,860
first edition 1923,
uh,

102
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,520
the poem appears simply as a,
a text on the page.

103
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,120
That's important. Uh, it's, part of,

104
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,630
it's as important as the title
is for infestation of a metro.

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,240
Uh, simply presenting the poem on
the page to us as Williams does.

106
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:43,040
Doing it without a title
a Williams asks us to,

107
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,730
in some sense, read and encounter
this poem without a frame,

108
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,960
without some kind of pre established
a boundary or explanatory,

109
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,370
a introduction or entry. That choice, uh,

110
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,090
increases the immediacy of our experience.

111
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,300
It's as if a Williams, we're asking you
to kind of press up close to the poem,

112
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,200
uh, uh, face it, uh, uh,

113
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,970
just as he is facing the thing
he is writing about, uh, or,

114
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,230
uh, asks us to face, uh, well,

115
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,780
not the, the thing that he's writing
about so much as his act of writing,

116
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:31,250
in seeing his act of writing
as it embodies a way of seeing,

117
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,250
uh, it has, uh, the poem has
a suggestion, um, that, um,

118
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,043
uh,

119
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,860
it requires as a poem the same kind of
calm intensity of concentration that the

120
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:52,070
poets observation of the
wheelbarrow exemplifies.

121
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,280
Uh, so again, uh, you know,
the, I think the, the,

122
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,170
the kind of seeing that the poem does,
uh,

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,170
models away of reading.
Well,

124
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,360
uh, what is that way of, uh, reading, uh,

125
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,850
what is the, um, uh,

126
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,690
how does the poem embody
in its construction,

127
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,720
which it calls attention to? How does
it embody in its construction, uh,

128
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,980
emotive perception, a
way of, of seeing, uh,

129
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,960
how has William's organized, uh, this, uh,

130
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,590
language on the page,
uh, by what principles,

131
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,900
uh, looking at it? Well, uh,

132
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,820
as I suggested before,
it's not a poem.

133
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:47,730
I think that we begin by hearing a,

134
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:51,570
and we have to start reading it and seeing
it before we can even think about how

135
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,810
to really speak it properly.
Uh,

136
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,890
it is not a metrical poem.
This is not,

137
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,970
I am Beck pentameter.
It is a,

138
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,040
a free verse poem, um, in the, uh,

139
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,560
in the prologue to Cora
in hell. Um, which is,

140
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:13,370
uh,
uh,

141
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,370
the pros I asked you to read for
today at the back of the book.

142
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,340
Um, there's, there's a number of

143
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,270
sentences and ideas that
are, uh, important. Uh,

144
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:32,050
I'll call attention to
just a few on nine 58,

145
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,080
uh, William says, nothing
is good. Save the new.

146
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,053
Yeah.

147
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,080
If a thing, ha, if a thing have novelty,

148
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,940
it stands intrinsically beside every
other work of artistic excellence. Uh,

149
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:53,770
and if it doesn't, no loveliness or
heroic proportion or grand manner,

150
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:57,220
we'll save it. Uh, and he, uh, uh,

151
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,310
identifies here as elsewhere.
Uh,

152
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,450
this property of novelty with, uh, uh,

153
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,410
kind of verse that, uh, his shoes, um, uh,

154
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,920
rhyme and meter, uh, a whole
host of, uh, existing, uh,

155
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,040
poetic conventions. Uh, again,
in the headnote two, um,

156
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,640
uh, the William Selection, uh,

157
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,360
there's a, a quotation, uh, from, um,

158
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,990
uh, Williams on the subject of, of,

159
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:40,520
um, uh, meter, uh, on to 85, uh, from, uh,

160
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,440
his pro statement, the poem as a field
of action. Uh, he says, I propose,

161
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,510
I propose sweeping changes from top
to bottom of the poetic structure.

162
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,160
I say we are with a,

163
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,810
I am back pentameter as
presently conceived, uh,

164
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,880
through with the measured quite train,

165
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,270
the stayed concatenation of
sounds and the usual stanza,

166
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,220
the Sonnet so much for the Silken tent,
uh,

167
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,390
Hart crane, a Wallace Stevens, et Cetera,

168
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,810
uh, pound, uh, uh, excuse
me. Williams is a, uh,

169
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,370
insisting that a modern verse,

170
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,750
the kind of verse he
describes a has to be, uh, uh,

171
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:30,340
has to break with these models
and has to, uh, proceed, uh,

172
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,860
by a kind of, um, uh,

173
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,100
by patterns that it itself invents.

174
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,740
A free verse is a, in
that sense, the, um, uh,

175
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,060
uh, Williams is chosen
medium, uh, free verse, uh,

176
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:53,060
meaning, uh, a poem not pattern
by metrical scheme or rhyme, uh,

177
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,080
or, uh, indeed, uh, some other, uh,

178
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,810
in the sense preexisting
principle or pattern. Uh,

179
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,140
nonetheless,
uh,

180
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,170
free verse does always have
some kind of operative pattern,

181
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,400
uh, sometimes, uh, very strict
and structuring ones. Uh,

182
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,140
and this short poem is a good
example. Uh, in fact, uh,

183
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:18,430
as you examine it,

184
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,750
you see a series of four stanzas,
right?

185
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,910
A four to line groups since, uh,
Williams might not like the word stands,

186
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:32,230
uh, uh, uh, four to line
groups. And, and, uh,

187
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,180
the pattern is long, short,
um, three or four syllables,

188
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,910
um, uh, followed by two.

189
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,020
Uh, and, uh, this, this, uh,
this is itself almost, uh,

190
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,670
like a, a, a metrical or,
uh, or a rhyme scheme.

191
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:56,200
In fact, you could say this, this poem,
this is more strict than a Sonnet,

192
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,030
uh, that it's more limited in the
range of choices that it allows.

193
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,940
Uh, it isn't, however,
presented to us as sonnets are.

194
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,870
As an instance of a, um, uh,

195
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,020
received verse form, uh, that is, uh,

196
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,640
at least in its general
pattern in variant, uh, and,

197
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,280
um, um, uh,

198
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,340
again a preexisting instead,

199
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,280
the poem presents itself as a
kind of ad hoc arrangement, uh,

200
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:30,641
as a,

201
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:35,320
as a kind of a structure that the
poet has chosen to work within,

202
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,820
uh, reflecting the
contingencies of this moment.

203
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,480
Uh, the occasion, uh, the poems purpose,

204
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,880
uh, the, the poem, the poem shape,

205
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,540
and this was one reason it's, it's
hard to speak. It's hard to hear, uh,

206
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,870
organizes Williams his speech,
uh,

207
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:01,460
in a manner that disregards or disrupts,
uh,

208
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,320
normal, uh, familiar, uh, syntax. Uh,

209
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,630
it does. So a specifically through
in jam by carrying one line,

210
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,620
a one line over to the next,
uh,

211
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,200
Williams is in jam
[inaudible] have here as, uh,

212
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,950
throughout his poetry.
Uh,

213
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:27,560
the effect of breaking
up language, uh, uh,

214
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:32,420
breaking it up, a, forcing us to
in fact, slow down our reading,

215
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,740
uh,

216
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,150
to stop taking languages
sense making for granted.

217
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,440
And in a sense to get into the poem,
uh,

218
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,510
the white space in w a Williams palm is a,

219
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,470
is you can think of it as
a space for thought. A,

220
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,220
a space where we are
invited, uh, allowed, uh,

221
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,580
required to think about choices,
um,

222
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,980
to ask ourselves about what a possible,
uh,

223
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,780
connections can be made at a given moment.

224
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,930
In this poem,
uh,

225
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:13,850
William specifically breaks words
up into their component parts,

226
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,450
a wheel barrow,
rain,

227
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,310
water without hyphens, uh, as if,

228
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,640
as if what he was looking
at a red wheelbarrow, uh,

229
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,680
consisted of those three terms,
redness, uh, the wheel, the Barrow.

230
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,770
Uh, these are, it's a
component elements, uh,

231
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,670
he points out in effect
in this device. Um, how,

232
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,380
um,
in this case,

233
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:50,381
two nouns that are made of compounds
that are really compounds represent

234
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,380
things that are compounds,
uh,

235
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,630
things that are made up of
other things that have parts,

236
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,310
uh,
as he established this as this pattern.

237
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:09,311
So much depends upon a red wheel
barrow glazed with rain water.

238
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,470
You want to carry it forward,
don't you?

239
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,030
Now that we've learned what he's doing
into the next stanza beside the white

240
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,983
chickens,

241
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,740
as if a white chickens were the same,
uh,

242
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,380
kind of compound as rainwater
and red wheelbarrow,

243
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,450
uh, but they're not quite, uh, and, uh,

244
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,710
Williams is in a way teasing us.
Uh,

245
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,520
white chickens aren't made up of whiteness
and chicken this in the same way that,

246
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,290
uh, uh, a wheelbarrow is made up
of a wheel and a bear out. Uh,

247
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,260
he's doing something a
little different here. Uh,

248
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,820
no sooner has he in effect
established, uh, a certain, uh,

249
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,620
pattern of cognition. Uh, a, uh, you know,

250
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:03,520
uh, um, uh, showed us how
to read his and jam minutes,

251
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,670
then he breaks that pattern. Uh,
he, uh, revises how it works.

252
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,530
Uh, it's just been put in place and now
it's changed and in fact, it's over.

253
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:18,390
It's done. The poem is done. Um, if the,

254
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:19,224
uh,
uh,

255
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,700
first lines of the poem
and the first stanza is,

256
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,970
are in a sense made to interrupt and
disrupt and thereby freshen our habits of

257
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,830
seeing,
uh,

258
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:38,520
to make us see these
things in some new way.

259
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,540
This last stanza does away with the
habit of seeing that the poem itself has

260
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:47,950
just constructed a,

261
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
just introduced us to a Williams prevents
us from settling into a convention of

262
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:57,070
perception.
Uh,

263
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,200
even in a poem that is as
small and as brief as this one,

264
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,090
uh,
there's,

265
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:07,500
there's really only enough time in the
poems essentially introduction and three

266
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:11,880
parts following to, uh,
establish a pattern and break it.

267
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,143
Uh,

268
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:20,750
what this brief moment of heightened
perception allows us to see,

269
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,630
to experience,
uh,

270
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,730
it's something small and large.
Uh,

271
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,370
what is it that depends
on the red wheelbarrow?

272
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,740
Williams only says so much.
Uh,

273
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,980
so much.
Uh,

274
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,020
the idea is I think the beautiful one
that the world when it's glazed with rain

275
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:48,510
water,

276
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,510
a kind of aesthetic effect and aesthetic
effect that implies a light that does

277
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,151
the glazing,

278
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,320
that somewhere behind our shoulders and
the poets as he looks at these objects,

279
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,270
that that light, which comes after
rain and is a product of change,

280
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:03,991
uh,

281
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:08,991
of the energy of the world is it
transforms this light suddenly,

282
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,840
uh,
allows this world to be seen.

283
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,780
Invisible detail,
uh,

284
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,400
apprehensible in its component parts.
And,

285
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,200
uh,

286
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,580
the ordinary gestalt of
perception is interrupted,

287
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,433
uh,

288
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,610
fresh and in reoriented we see something,

289
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,470
something ordinary,
newly, uh, and freshly.

290
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,880
It stands out, uh, in
what we see in miniature,

291
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:46,881
in the limited space of the
moment or of the poem is,

292
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,430
uh, world. Uh,

293
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,130
well what we see is the
elements out of which, uh, uh,

294
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,170
the world is made elements ordinarily
held in a kind of complex mutual

295
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,830
dependency,
uh,

296
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,760
a kind of complex of relations that
we simply take for granted, uh,

297
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,300
in the words that we use in the,
uh, a way that we see things.

298
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,610
Uh,
just as we put together,

299
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:20,290
we'll and Barrow and rain and
water without thinking about it.

300
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,950
Uh,
what the red wheelbarrow holes then,

301
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:28,070
and what in that sense
it depends on, it, uh,

302
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,910
is something pretty heavy.
Uh, and that is, uh,

303
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,640
the sense of a whole world. We're,
we're, we're better, uh, the,

304
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:40,690
the sense of the world in its wholeness,
uh,

305
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,870
which is something
affirmed, uh, in this, uh,

306
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:46,300
attractively modest,

307
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,050
momentary poetic perception

308
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,340
so much for the red wheelbarrow
springing off.

309
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,080
Uh,

310
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,910
and there's that idea again in the
title a spring as a season of newness,

311
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,610
uh, for, for, uh,

312
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,230
William's beginning his career spring,
uh,

313
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:14,860
registering his own beginnings,
registering modernness,

314
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:20,350
uh,
a vision of the world in its newness.

315
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,050
Well, uh, springing all, uh, isn't a,

316
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,820
is a beautiful book.
And one I wish I could show you,

317
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:31,870
but the last time I saw it at Beinecke
disappeared and no one has seen it.

318
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:36,070
And a couple of years, uh, they
have a lot of paper over there.

319
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,110
I guess it's easy to lose
things. Maybe it's, maybe it's
a available. We'll, we'll,

320
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,250
we'll look and see. A, it's a,

321
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:49,240
it's a beautiful plane book,
a Robin's egg blue,

322
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,430
uh, for spring, I suppose. Uh, it seems,

323
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,990
uh, uh, it's, it's, it's
not, it's not large,

324
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,280
small. Uh, it almost has no ornament.

325
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,500
Uh, in, in all of this, it
seems to exemplify the, uh,

326
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,510
American virtues of a plainness
and a directness and a simplicity,

327
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,860
again, a long way from Hart Crane. Uh,

328
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,000
and the book is, is really, uh, so
American that it was published in Dijon.

329
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,050
Uh, Williams, uh,

330
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:33,190
is a polemically American poet,
even more than crane in certain ways,

331
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,710
a more than frost even. Uh, and yet, uh,

332
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,020
Williams has,

333
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,020
has a very important and
vital relationship to European
modernism and a French,

334
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:51,200
uh, modernism in particular [inaudible]
and even more particularly to French

335
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,970
painting.
Uh,

336
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:57,971
and to understand how Williams is
writing what he's trying to get at.

337
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,360
It's helpful to remember
what he was looking at. Uh,

338
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,770
here. Here's a Brock. Uh, I,
uh, George Brock, a 1908, uh,

339
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:11,530
it's, you know, on the way to cubism, uh,

340
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,560
and I think sort of helpfully
on the way to cubism because it,

341
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,690
it looks back to a real list,
uh, tradition, uh, with, uh,

342
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,320
it's, uh, in a sense conventional, uh,

343
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Perspec tival space that's yet
being broken up into planes,

344
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,450
uh, that, uh, allow us to, uh, register,

345
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,610
uh, the, uh, uh, painting as a
painting. And that force us to, uh,

346
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,220
really, uh, and, uh, I
suppose, uh, even more, uh,

347
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,160
striking a is, is this,
uh, uh, one of many great,

348
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:54,020
uh, late, uh, Suzanne paintings
of a limo, Sam Victoire where,

349
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,700
uh, here, uh, again, uh,
you know, um, the, uh,

350
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,240
Perspec tival space of the, uh, uh, uh,

351
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,550
painting as being a, turned
into almost a kind of, um, uh,

352
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:11,960
abstract field, uh, of,
um, uh, color patterns.

353
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,610
Uh, again, uh,

354
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,640
these are painters interested
in foregrounding their
action of seeing through

355
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,080
the ways in which they
foreground self-consciously, uh,

356
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:29,081
the materiality of the medium
in which they are working.

357
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,890
Um, the aim in, in, in post
impressionist painting,

358
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:39,700
and then in, in cubism. Really is to
again, break up that gestalt of, of,

359
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,630
uh, perception, uh, that,
um, uh, Williams is, is,

360
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,870
uh, uh, also opposing himself to, uh,

361
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:53,460
to break it up and grasp in
some sense the dynamism, uh,

362
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,540
in, uh, the world, uh, before us, uh,

363
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,520
precisely through acts of seeing,
uh,

364
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,540
that call attention to themselves into
the way in which that seeing is rendered.

365
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,360
Um, if you, uh, uh, have,

366
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:16,920
have read the prologue to Cora and
hell, which is, uh, starts on nine 58,

367
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,230
um, you know, that, um, uh, or excuse me,

368
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:26,340
nine 54, William's begins with a, uh,

369
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,150
anecdote about Marcel Duchamp,
um,

370
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,510
part of the New York art world
that, uh, uh, Williams, um, um,

371
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,180
also participated in
through his friend, the, uh,

372
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,340
a dealer and tastemaker
Walter Errands Berg. Uh, uh,

373
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,980
once, when I was taking lunch
with Walter Errands Berg,

374
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,020
I asked him if he could state what the
more modern painters were about. Uh,

375
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:55,930
and then he gives, uh, several, uh,

376
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,640
as examples including a Duchamp,
uh,

377
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,550
all of whom were then in
New York. Uh, and, uh,

378
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,930
Erin's Berg replied by saying that the
only way a man different from every other

379
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:09,660
creature was in his ability
to improvise novelty.

380
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
And since the pictorial
artist was under discussion,

381
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,520
anything in paint that is truly new,
truly a fresh creation is good art.

382
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,560
Thus, according to Duchamp, uh, who
was Erin's burgs champion at the time,

383
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,000
a stained glass window that had fallen
out and lay more or less together on the

384
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:32,001
ground was a far greater interest than
the thing conventionally composed in

385
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:36,270
city. You, uh, which is,
uh, uh, interesting, um,

386
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,240
uh, uh, model for, um, what, um, um,

387
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,730
Williams himself might be seen as
doing in poetry. That sound sentence.

388
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,160
He's taking the stained glass window and,
and you know,

389
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:53,540
seeing it laid out on the floor,
maybe broken on the floor. Um,

390
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,710
Duchamp, uh, uh,

391
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,660
painted this famous work,
a nude descending a staircase,

392
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,430
uh, and, uh, it, uh, is,
is clearly all about,

393
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,420
uh, here rendering, uh,
in a pictorial form,

394
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,120
the kind of a multi
frame, a vision, right?

395
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,310
That, uh, photography motion
pictures allow us, uh, to see, uh,

396
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:24,750
to, uh, again here, you know,
grasp in representation, uh,

397
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,680
some sense of the movement
and, uh, energy, uh,

398
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:33,030
that compose a, the, a world that, um, uh,

399
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,550
we see before us. Uh, the other,

400
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,710
uh, dimension of, of, uh, uh, the Duchamp.

401
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,220
A anecdote that that's nice, uh, uh, in,

402
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:48,950
in Williams is telling us that a
well, a stained glass window that, uh,

403
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,290
and it's falling out as something
you come upon or, or, or find a,

404
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:58,240
and Duchamp is of course,
uh, most famous for his, uh,

405
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,610
let me turn to the next image. Uh,

406
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,980
his ready mades this,
a facsimile of the are,

407
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:11,420
that is another version of, uh, uh,

408
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,920
his most famous ready made a fountain.
Um,

409
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,530
a urinal, uh, which we, uh, uh, uh,

410
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,350
signed with the pseudonym,
uh, are moot. Uh,

411
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,500
1917 and, uh, uh, presented, uh,

412
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,260
as a work of art. The,
um, uh, our gallery, uh,

413
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,140
has, um, um, this work. Uh,

414
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,310
this too is a, is it, as it were, a
facsimile of the original now loss,

415
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,380
uh, uh, a snow shovel, uh, in
other already made, uh, this one,

416
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,350
um, uh, with the, with the, uh,

417
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,850
excellent title in advance
of the broken arm, uh,

418
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,460
uh, Duchamp, uh, takes post
impressionism, uh, to New York,

419
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,470
uh, in the form of data,
uh, a, uh, uh, movement, uh,

420
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,420
with its importance for
Williams to including, uh, uh,

421
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,580
I think, um, duchamp's
mischievousness, uh, in his, uh,

422
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,040
willingness to, uh, provoke,
be subversive to take, uh,

423
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,040
Williams's word, uh, and to play with
expectations about what constitutes,

424
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,780
uh, art, uh,

425
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:30,670
as Williams in certain ways we'd play
with our expectations about what could

426
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:35,570
constitute a poem, a or
poetic statement in, um,

427
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,430
New York, uh, and elsewhere, uh,

428
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:43,610
Williams is in contact
with a whole range of, um,

429
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,940
uh, modernist, uh, American
artists, uh, influenced by the, uh,

430
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:53,830
European art I've just been
talking about. Um, uh, but also,

431
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:57,970
uh, working in a distinctively
American, uh, mode.

432
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,870
This is, uh, a, a work by
a shark, Charles de Muth.

433
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:08,020
Uh, 1921. I'm sorry, I'm behind on
producing my image lists, but I'll,

434
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,970
I'll get this for you. Uh,
and in here is, uh, another,

435
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,120
um, and again, uh, here, uh,

436
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,480
in urban scene, uh, that is, um, uh,

437
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,780
a realist in it's a
mode of representation.

438
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:30,370
And yet the, uh, uh, for
grounding of, um, the, uh,

439
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:30,970
uh,

440
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,970
lines created by the different
shapes of the buildings,

441
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,083
uh,

442
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,270
call attention to this as a
indeed a kind of constructed,

443
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,100
uh, image, uh, that is,
seems to be, you know,

444
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,350
moving out of the, um, uh,

445
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,170
realm of realist representation
to something, uh,

446
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,180
more a symbolic and
certainly, um, uh, avowedly,

447
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,410
um, uh, created, uh, by, uh, the artist,

448
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,620
uh, uh, Damuth, uh,

449
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,880
goes further in the same direction
in a what is probably his,

450
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,930
his best known work. Uh, this is, uh,

451
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,070
called the great figure number five.

452
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,630
Uh, if, um, uh, Williams was busy, uh,

453
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,890
looking at these artists
I've just been talking about,

454
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:30,640
they also were looking at
him, uh, and, and, uh, uh,

455
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,960
do a painting is a, a
attribute to Williams, uh,

456
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,450
and a, a little homage. Also,

457
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:42,451
I think a little joke about
a Williams is a own poem,

458
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,880
uh, also from springing off, uh,

459
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,870
that we know as the great
figure on two 91. Uh,

460
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:55,820
this is, um, well I'll,
I'll read this, uh, again,

461
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,150
uh, rain and light, uh,

462
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,490
among the rain and lights.

463
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,060
I saw the figure five in gold on a
red fire truck moving with weight and

464
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:13,730
urgency,
tense unheeded to Gong clangs,

465
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:17,540
siren howls and wheels
rumbling through the dark city.

466
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,480
Uh, and, uh, this is, you know, uh,

467
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,290
a rendering of that, uh, uh,

468
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,590
that moment that that draws out the,

469
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,520
I'm a way in which the
poem fines and makes, uh,

470
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,380
an exalted symbol, uh, from
this ordinary perception. Uh,

471
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,450
it's got bill up top and WCW
down in the bottom and Carlos,

472
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,150
uh, underneath the five,
uh, uh, as part of this, uh,

473
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,380
friendly, uh, tribute, uh, the pumps.

474
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,280
Interesting to look at next
to, uh, the red wheelbarrow.

475
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:03,350
Here's something else that's red,
right? Uh, and, uh, again, um,

476
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,760
uh, the poem is concerned
with a, a moment of,

477
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:11,630
of perception. Uh, here, uh,

478
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:16,631
the poem really tries to render the
process by which perception takes place

479
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:20,570
where, or rather the kind
of context in which it does,

480
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:24,170
which the red wheelbarrow doesn't. Red
wheelbarrow really kind of takes, this,

481
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,360
takes something seen. Uh, I'm
a fragmented out of, uh, uh,

482
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,190
a continuum of, of perception
that we can feel implied, uh,

483
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:38,900
but, uh, isn't made explicit
in the poem. Uh, the, um,

484
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,610
uh, in this case, uh, the, uh, uh,

485
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:48,290
we were given the kind of context,
uh, out of which a detail,

486
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,560
uh, something that arbitrary
contingent, ordinary, uh,

487
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,380
springs out, uh, springs out
of the rush of things, uh, and,

488
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,820
and, uh, uh,

489
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,850
catches the eye and the imagination
and the intention of the poet,

490
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,770
uh,
in a station of the metro.

491
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,370
This is a poem about metropolitan
urban perception. Uh,

492
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,920
so as this poem, uh, here, instead of a,

493
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:19,790
a present moment that's,
uh, briefly suspended, uh,

494
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:24,690
as in pound's poem or as
in, uh, so much depends. Uh,

495
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,650
this poem is, is just as
much about memory, uh, uh,

496
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:34,400
in the, in the, the rush
of, of ongoing experience,

497
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:38,090
of a kind of ongoing
temporality of, uh, uh,

498
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,220
figured here by the fire truck moving.

499
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,040
And there's that part of Sippeel,
uh,

500
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,900
a word moving kind of ongoing action.
Uh,

501
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,220
in the midst of this, the,
uh, something, uh, um, uh,

502
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,990
catches the poet's attention.
Uh, he acts, uh, uh,

503
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,350
as a perceiver. He says, I saw

504
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,470
in that action, uh, expressed in,
in a verb, in the past tense, uh,

505
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,150
intervenes in and, and,
uh, uh, you know, cuts, uh,

506
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,650
into this blurry,
uh,

507
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,660
perceptual part of Sippeel flow of things.
Uh,

508
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:23,640
that is the firetruck, a rushing
by. Uh, it fixes on a figure,

509
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:28,410
in this case, a number,
uh, and, uh, carries that,

510
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,700
uh, away and out of the, uh, experience,

511
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,910
uh, that, uh, that five
on the firetruck, uh,

512
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,070
it's something utterly ordinary.
Uh,

513
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,480
like a wheel barrel or a shovel,
snow shovel.

514
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,060
Uh, it's a kind of found
object, uh, and yet, uh,

515
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,530
here for, um, Williams, uh,

516
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,340
he makes something of it, uh, or, uh, uh,

517
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,680
plays with the act of making
something with it. It is, uh, uh,

518
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,340
something he calls with some joking,
some seriousness,

519
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,170
the great figure, a
great figure, a symbol,

520
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,180
but a symbol of what, uh,
of what exactly, uh, well,

521
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,750
um, perhaps, uh, a symbol of, uh,

522
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,780
the very capacity of the ordinary
to arrest our attention and become

523
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,450
significant, uh, become
objects of perception. Uh,

524
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,970
perhaps a symbol of the
five senses themselves.

525
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,700
What do you think, uh,
that seems possible to,

526
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,520
uh, the five senses, uh, who's powers, uh,

527
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,010
uh,
are behind for Williams,

528
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:53,870
the way we create figurative language,
uh,

529
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,970
the way we create figures and poems and
discover symbols and discover meaning in

530
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,880
the world around us.

531
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,300
Uh,
okay.

532
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:13,130
Now life is above all
things else at any moment.

533
00:38:13,131 --> 00:38:15,950
Subversive of life as it
was the moment before,

534
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,450
always knew irregular.
Uh,

535
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,310
the poem that place just after
this anthology is, is, uh,

536
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,200
one of William's this greatest,
uh, and uh, uh, it too,

537
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,430
as it appears in the volume
springing all has no title. Uh,

538
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,410
but it's given a title here, the
title of the volume itself, uh, but,

539
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,690
uh, was known rather, uh,

540
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,420
for a long time simply by its first line,

541
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:50,710
by the road to the contagious hospital.
Uh,

542
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,043
this,
uh,

543
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,480
the poem is about the continual
newness that Williams calls life,

544
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,780
something that's continually
constructing the world around us. Uh,

545
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:08,790
in the poet in this poem gets at it
like the post impressionist painter,

546
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,140
uh, even perhaps like the data is, uh,

547
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,640
by calling his and our attention,
uh,

548
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,060
to the act of constructing his
poem. Uh, and in particularly,

549
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,240
uh,
as that construction is,

550
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:29,140
is felt as it's kind of brought to
our consciousness through in jam,

551
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,280
uh, Williams, his poetry,

552
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,090
like the world he sees
is constantly in jammed,

553
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,680
segmented, renewed, uh, uh,

554
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,120
by that act.
Uh,

555
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,140
let's look at how in jam works here by
the road to the contagious hospital under

556
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:56,470
the surge of the blue modeled clouds,
driven from the northeast,

557
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:02,010
a cold when beyond the waste of broad
money feels brown with dried weeds,

558
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,430
standing and fallen,
patches of standing water,

559
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:14,320
the scattering of tall
trees all along the road,

560
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:16,180
the reddish,
purplish forked,

561
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,240
upstanding twiggy stuff of bushes and
small trees with dead Brown leaves under

562
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:24,340
them.
Leafless vines,

563
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,040
lifeless again,
dead in appearance,

564
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,320
sluggish,
dazed spring approaches.

565
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,030
That is the first verb in the pump.
They,

566
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,200
he now says suggesting
all of these things,

567
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:48,700
they entered the new world, naked, cold,

568
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,370
uncertain of all save that
they enter all about them.

569
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,110
These things, the things of the
world, the cold, familiar wind.

570
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,790
Now the grass tomorrow,
the stiff curl of wild carrot leaf,

571
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,310
one by one objects are defined
like a series of images.

572
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:13,420
Poems, it now, not they but it,

573
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,800
which is the again now here a world
felt in its wholeness Quicken's clarity,

574
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,660
outline of leaf,

575
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:28,590
but now the stark dignity of entrance
still the profound change has come upon

576
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:33,560
them rooted.
They grip down and begin to awaken.

577
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,140
It's a great pump. Uh, and in jam is

578
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,560
a key part of its energy.
Uh,

579
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,240
the first, uh, in jam at
that is striking a, is bold.

580
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:54,320
It's one of the really famous ones, in
fact in modern poetry is that second line,

581
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,760
this, uh, under the surge of the blue,

582
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,550
it invites us to read the blue as a noun,
right?

583
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:09,560
Uh, and to feel and hear that
phrase, the surge of the blue,

584
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,161
uh,

585
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:15,161
as a kind of a conventional expression
of lyric romantic exaltation.

586
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,060
But we're wrong. Uh, blue is, uh,

587
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,270
an adjective, uh, and, uh, uh,

588
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,710
we learned this as the poem
turns. Uh, and, uh, the, uh,

589
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,940
in Jasmine, uh, supplies the
information that this blue,

590
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,160
this kind of exalted thing,
uh,

591
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,610
is actually modeled a marred war,

592
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,960
flawed even in some sense.
Uh,

593
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,610
uh, and, um, uh, here, um,

594
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,190
the newness that the poem
is going to celebrate, uh,

595
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,540
is going to be something
we might feel modeled, uh,

596
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,880
that, uh, uh, cold, uh, flawed,

597
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,390
which is part of its claim to be new,
uh,

598
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,720
part of its claim to represent
something really real.

599
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,190
Uh, not to be found in
previous books of poetry, uh,

600
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:18,260
but something, uh, to
be found in living. Uh,

601
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,300
so at this moment it seems in
jam it means disestablishment,

602
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,410
uh, that word of, uh, Williams's
the subversion of life has,

603
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:30,900
it just was, uh, uh,

604
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:36,020
a surprise of perception.
But yeah.

605
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,330
Uh, as in the red wheelbarrow, uh,

606
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,270
if you think we've now learned what
[inaudible] means in a given context,

607
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:46,200
Williams is going to do
something else. Uh, uh,

608
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:53,030
the next lines are also sharply in Jammed,
um,

609
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,960
uh,
modeled clouds driven from the northeast,

610
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,880
a cold when beyond the waste of broad,
muddy fields.

611
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,470
Uh, I mean, that's a,

612
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,480
that is itself a bold thing to have
done in poetry to break off align at the

613
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:15,090
definite article. Uh, I'm not sure
that there's an example, uh, in,

614
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,740
uh,
poetry previously to align to this,

615
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:24,650
these examples of lines ending in
the, okay. Uh, there may well be,

616
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:29,110
but it's, it's, it's yet a, a
novel and bold thing for, um,

617
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,860
uh, uh, Williams to do, uh,

618
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,970
but it works differently from
the previous example where,

619
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,110
um, uh, the blue invited us to, um,

620
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,520
read that phrase as a kind of Noun,
uh,

621
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,430
expressive of romantic
exaltation and then,

622
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,010
and then gave us the surprise that no,

623
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:57,270
it doesn't function that way and what
you thought was a pure and exalted as in

624
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:01,110
fact modeled and, and a messy, uh,

625
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,810
these in jam, it's don't have any kind
of interpretive surprise like that.

626
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,070
The lines are just broken
that way. Uh, they,

627
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,550
they don't change the,
how we read the grammar of the phrases.

628
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:18,720
They don't force us to
recast our expectations. Uh,

629
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,050
together though as a series
of, and Jim Mintz, uh,

630
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:27,051
these lines evoke a state in which the
world is freshly taking shape coming at

631
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:31,870
us and informs, uh, that we have
to confront, uh, that are, uh, uh,

632
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,180
that give us abrupt insistent impressions,
uh,

633
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,960
which are sometimes full of
meaning and sometimes not. Uh,

634
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:44,670
this is a poetic version
way. Williams is, uh,

635
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,880
is constructing this poem
is a poetic version, uh,

636
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:52,320
of the action that the poems describing
the going forward into spring against

637
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,130
the cold,
uh,

638
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,430
through which eventually one
by one objects are defined, uh,

639
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:04,610
defined and organized and energized
and animated as William sees it.

640
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,920
As I say, uh, the verb does
not come in the poem, uh,

641
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,480
until uh, we see, uh, that
phrase spring approaches, uh,

642
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,860
almost a at the middle of, slightly
beyond the middle of the poem. Uh,

643
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,990
and then, uh, that next, um, uh,

644
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,990
sentence they entered the new world naked.
Uh,

645
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:30,670
they being deliberately vague, uh, uh,

646
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,740
evoking the things of the world,
but in a humanized way, uh,

647
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,990
uh, a humanized way as we come
to feel them and see them,

648
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:44,700
they enter the world just
as we do naked. Uh, and,

649
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,870
uh, uh, and we, we enter it
naked with them. You could say,

650
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,690
uh, this is a poem about, uh,

651
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:56,710
emergence a that identifies
a modern poetry modern verse,

652
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,250
uh, as William calls it, uh, uh, Williams
calls it in his letter to Monroe,

653
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,460
uh, identifies modern verse
with the process by which
the perceptual world takes

654
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:10,320
shape, grips down, grips, down,

655
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:15,260
routing itself in ordinary fact
and things, uh, and from which, uh,

656
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,250
uh, kind of, uh,

657
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,610
energy is drawn and we begin to awaken.

658
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:27,510
This is probably a good, uh,
uh, place to, to, and, uh,

659
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,700
I want to stress the resonance and,
and,

660
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,380
and suggestiveness of, of, um, uh,

661
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,010
Williams is investment in what
is naked. It's a, it's a way of,

662
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,620
uh, um, envisioning the
world in its primary terms.

663
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:48,940
It's also a way of calling forth
a kind of, uh, human energy,

664
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:54,480
uh, that is, uh, primary,
uh, and, uh, again as, um,

665
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,270
uh, Williams a imagines that, uh, modern.

666
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,130
And here he is a in the buff, um, uh, uh,

667
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,000
I guess,
uh,

668
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,980
skinny dipping in New Jersey with a
couple sticks to pretend he's pan.

669
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,390
Um, so, uh, go enjoy the
spring day. Uh, and we all,

670
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,150
um, uh, keep your clothes on. And, uh,

671
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,230
we'll, um, talk about maybe
a little more Williams,

672
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:25,570
but definitely Mary and more next time.
