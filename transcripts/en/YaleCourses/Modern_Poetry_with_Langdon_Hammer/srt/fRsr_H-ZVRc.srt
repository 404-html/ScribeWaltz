1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,540
On Wednesday,
uh,

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,450
I would like you to, uh, you know, come,

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:13,920
having read one of
Steven's is longer poems.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,690
Um, it's not too long, but it's a
little longer, uh, the words of autumn,

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,110
uh, which is a wonderful poem.
It's not exactly timely, uh,

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,740
at this moment, but, um, uh, please, uh,

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,510
please come having thought
about it, uh, as you,

8
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:37,010
as you read it, um, think about, um,

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,940
images that you find in the
poem of Stars of the theater,

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,330
uh, of, um,

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,090
images of mother and father. Uh, poem is

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,420
full of both. Uh, a friend
asked me the other day,

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,100
are there any happy poets?
Uh,

14
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,150
well, and of course, no, there aren't,

15
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,990
or at least not any that
are any good, right? Um, no,
that's, that's not true. Um,

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,660
in fact, as I think
about the syllabus, um,

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,750
Williams is a happy poet.
You know,

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,220
he caused himself the happy
genius of his house, uh, hold, uh,

19
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:28,221
in that little poem dance reus he's
talking about running around the house

20
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:33,390
naked. Uh, Marianne Moore I think
in many ways is a happy poem.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,750
Uh, but, uh, no poet is so happy, uh,

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,720
as well as Stevens. Uh,
and Stephen's is, um,

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,180
he is happy,
uh,

24
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,700
in the sense that he is a comic poet.
Uh,

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,360
and that doesn't mean that you're going
to laugh a lot while you read while

26
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,320
Steven's though you might sometimes and,
and he can be silly,

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,330
uh, though that's perhaps
not his strongest vein. Uh,

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,300
Steven's is, is, uh, a
comic poet in the sense, um,

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,300
uh, in the generic sense
of, of, uh, a poet, uh,

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,310
in whom and for whom and with whom
the world always comes, right. Um,

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,080
the world is right and good.
Uh, it is a regenerative, uh,

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,630
exhilarating,
endlessly.

33
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,730
I'm consoling and
meaningful place to dwell.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,410
Uh, and, and Steven says,
uh, you know, really, uh,

35
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,440
as I read him every year,
um,

36
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,220
I like him more and more and
becomes more and more important.

37
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,350
Uh,

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,350
Steven's gives us a really a
comprehensive view of the world,

39
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,230
uh, and one in which, uh,

40
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,950
poetry and imagination
have central roles to play.

41
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,490
Uh,
imagination.

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,850
That's an important word
in Steven's. Uh, it's,

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,860
it's a word he takes right out
of British romanticism. Uh,

44
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:12,790
and the long tradition of romantic poetry.

45
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,280
And Stevens is a though in complex ways.
Uh,

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,750
Leichhardt crane and, uh, a, um,

47
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,880
defiantly romantic,
modern poet.

48
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,980
Uh, Steven's is poetry like Morris, uh,

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,030
like cranes.
Uh,

50
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,840
to some extent like frost is always
in a sense met up poetry that is,

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,400
uh, well he shares with these
poets as with certain others,

52
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,740
uh, on our syllabus. Um,

53
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,100
the sense that poetry has to always
involve and investigation into its own

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,780
rules, how it works, uh, what
it does, what it's capable of.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,310
Uh, what it's potential uses are. Uh,

56
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,280
and that all of these are in a
sense open, uh, and uh, available,

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,230
um, to, uh, redefinition
and a fundamental level.

58
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,000
Uh, he says there's a
wonderful set of, uh,

59
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,750
adages is or, um, epigrams or, uh,

60
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,840
statements, uh, at the back of your book
which come from, uh, Steven's, his dad.

61
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:30,010
Gea.
Uh,

62
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:35,011
one of those statements is all
poetry is experimental poetry.

63
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,490
Uh,
and there's a sense in any Stevens poem,

64
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,970
uh, that, uh, Steven's is going to, uh,

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,370
is experimenting and is
going in some new direction,

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,060
not just at the beginning of the
poem, but throughout the poem. Uh,

67
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,390
that's how it proceeds. Uh, you
could compare this idea, uh,

68
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,150
to Williams is, uh,
interest in newness, uh,

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
and a,
um,

70
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,640
a sense of life as always
subversive of life, uh,

71
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,330
preceding. Uh, it's a
related idea for, uh,

72
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,390
Steven's, uh, in his, uh,

73
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,380
poetry in his poem, um, of modern poetry,

74
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:25,381
which is a little a essay on the
subject of what is modern poetry.

75
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,410
Uh, Steven says, um,

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,420
it has to construct a new stage,
uh,

77
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,230
and it not only has to construct that
new stage, it has to be on it too. Uh,

78
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,410
and there's a way in which Stevens,
his poems are both, uh, you know,

79
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:45,880
creating a new space in which to speak,
uh,

80
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,780
and they're speaking from there.
These two things are going on at once.

81
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,330
Uh, Steven's also says, uh,
in that set of a Diageo,

82
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:01,110
um, uh, and they're wonderful,
uh, provocative ones, uh,

83
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,510
throughout a poem is a
pheasant, uh, for one, uh,

84
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,520
he also says poetry is a means of
redemption and it's on page nine 72.

85
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,270
Poetry is a means of redemption.
He meant it.

86
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,870
He meant it,
uh,

87
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,930
for Steven's poetry stands in
the place that religion wants.

88
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,840
Did,
uh,

89
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,930
other poets that we've read this semester,
uh,

90
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,020
look to poetry, to serve different
functions, uh, of religion.

91
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,800
I think, um, for Elliot,

92
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,450
uh, he is concerned with
ritual and community, uh,

93
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,940
in ways in which poetry might
establish these, constitute these,

94
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,890
uh, more is, uh,

95
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:57,350
the most well with
Elliot, the, the most, uh,

96
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,210
uh, serious Christian,
uh, is, is concerned, uh,

97
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:06,770
with poetry as a, as a model for
ethical action as a kind of guide, uh,

98
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,990
uh, for conduct in the
world. Uh, and, and, uh,

99
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,560
poetry models for her,

100
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:17,420
what she calls love or hope or striving,
uh,

101
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,090
or doing hard things,
uh,

102
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,350
for Steven's poetry takes over,
uh,

103
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,610
another dimension of religious experience.
Uh,

104
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,690
power poetry takes over Christianity's
traditional concern with redemption.

105
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,130
Uh, and with redemption, uh, with
questions about the afterlife,

106
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,180
Paradise, uh, the transcendental,

107
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,250
how can culture imagine the transcendental
in a non transcendental world?

108
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,103
Uh,

109
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,560
how can it imagine the metaphysical
in a non metaphysical world?

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,540
How can we have heaven
if we don't have god?

111
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,610
These are all questions in
Stephen's his poetry. Uh,

112
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,550
he answers them,
uh,

113
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,820
in ways that that put him on heart
cranes side of the debate with Elliot,

114
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,460
uh, in the wasteland, the
decay of Sacred Authority, uh,

115
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:30,461
this is a crisis of community of meaning
language has sort of lost its meaning,

116
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,870
uh,
for crane.

117
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,440
This condition rather than
a crisis as an opportunity,

118
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:44,030
an opportunity for poetry
to lend a myth to God.

119
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,930
Elliot is disturbed to see God,
uh, as something constructed,

120
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,030
something linguistics,

121
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,970
something we might lend a myth to only
lend it in a sense that we're going to

122
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:01,580
have to bring it back. Uh, for crane, uh,

123
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,040
for Steven's,
God always was a myth,

124
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,450
a metaphor and metaphors can and need
to be exchanged in renewed all the time.

125
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,540
Uh, in this crane and Stevens
are very close together.

126
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,390
Let's, um, let's look at

127
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,100
an early palm of while Stevenson early
grand poem called Sunday morning.

128
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,240
Uh,
the first one in your Steven's selection,

129
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,430
it's on page two 37,

130
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,063
uh,

131
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,210
Sunday morning.

132
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,670
It was published in
Poetry magazine in 1915,

133
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,400
uh, which is to say it's
contemporary with Prufrock,

134
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,710
uh, roughly contemporary with
Marianne Morris. A grave,

135
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:06,100
both poems that appeared in poetry to

136
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,333
uh,

137
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,510
well let's read this first stanza.

138
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,810
Complacency's of the pain wire and lake
coffee in orange is in a sunny chair and

139
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:26,480
the green freedom of
a cockatoo upon a rug.

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,040
All these things mingle to dissipate
the holy hush of ancient sacrifice.

141
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,373
Okay.

142
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,750
She dreams a little

143
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,580
and she feels the dark encroachment
of that old catastrophe,

144
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,990
that old catastrophe being the crucifixion

145
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,370
as a calm,
dark and among water lights,

146
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,960
or if it's not the crucifixion,
it's

147
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,733
the fall.

148
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,920
The pungent oranges and bright green wings
seem things in some procession of the

149
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:14,011
dead winding across wide
water without sound.

150
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,220
The day is like wide water without sound
stilled for the passing of her dreaming

151
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,450
feet over the seas to silent Palestine.

152
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,620
Dominion of the blood and sepal occur.

153
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,190
This is a poem about,
uh, not going to church,

154
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,170
uh, about doing something
else with Sunday morning.

155
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,410
Uh, it announces, or it
takes for granted really

156
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,170
a great change in culture

157
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,420
change and the cultural order,
uh,

158
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,570
where Sunday morning is
no longer spent or need,

159
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:06,280
not necessarily always be spent at church.
Uh,

160
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,660
Steven's is writing about,
in some ways the end of the Christian era.

161
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,570
Of course, it's going on, but in a,

162
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,780
in a different form from
what it had been known as a,

163
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,670
you can think about how
unlike this poem is,

164
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,840
uh, how, how, excuse me, how, uh,

165
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,720
how little this poem is like,
uh,

166
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,810
a poem on a similar theme in Yates
such as the second coming, uh,

167
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,910
where the end of Christianity is an
apocalyptic event and there's some rough

168
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,810
beast slouching towards Bethlehem.
Uh,

169
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,090
instead in Stevens,
the power of the past,

170
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:53,930
the Christian area simply dissipates,
poof,

171
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,920
uh, dissolves, uh, in the
circumstances that he's describing.

172
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,480
What is it,
what is a pain new are,

173
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,280
uh, I, I think Steven's
likes the French word. Uh,

174
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,450
this is, this is a dressing gown.
Um, we have a female figure here,

175
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,490
uh,
presented to us in a space of domestic,

176
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,080
bourgeois luxury comfort,
um,

177
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,140
a complacency even,
uh,

178
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,140
with coffee and oranges

179
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,010
and a cockatoo.
Uh,

180
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,120
whether that cockatoos
actually a bird or, or, um,

181
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,340
uh, design in the rug, uh,
critics have disagreed.

182
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,290
Uh, you can, uh, you can, you
can make that bird what you like.

183
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,283
Um,

184
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,150
this female presence that we're
introduced to is a figure for the poet,

185
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,540
uh, an unnamed, she, that
the poem will be about

186
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,000
she,
uh,

187
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,680
embodying poetic sensibility,

188
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,860
a poetic thinking and poetic impulses,
uh,

189
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,750
seems to place poetry in this
space of domestic comfort,

190
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,050
uh, seems to identify
poetry with the feminine,

191
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,480
with a female perspective,
uh, and with consumption, uh,

192
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,560
with fine imported goods,
uh,

193
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,580
as you will find elsewhere.
And Steven's, uh,

194
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,050
uh, identifies a life of
ease with the imagination.

195
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,530
Uh, Steven's is poetry, uh,

196
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,630
like Yates is in certain ways a
though I'm very different terms,

197
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,290
what we're even here, like Elliot's, uh,

198
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,050
presents us with a number of very powerful
female figures with whom the poet,

199
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,490
uh,
identifies his own creativity.

200
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:13,400
This is an important one. A, and
there there's a, there's a, um,

201
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,960
uh,
what w uh,

202
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,170
there's an aspect of Steven's that's
gendered as feminine. You could say,

203
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,373
ah,

204
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,390
it's that aspect of Steven's
that identifies with poetry
as a space apart from

205
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:33,110
the masculine world of work.
Uh,

206
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,120
contrast this with Frost, uh, who, uh,

207
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,820
uh, Steven's identify as poetry
with subjective freedom, uh,

208
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,000
space, uh, apart from objective necessity,

209
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,510
what frost is always responding to.
Uh,

210
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,900
Steven's maintains a complex
attitude, however, uh,

211
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,820
towards this,
um,

212
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,620
identification of poetry with
aspects of culture that are,

213
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:09,390
are gendered, uh, as,
as female. Uh, there,

214
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,250
there's a macho strain in
Stevens to, uh, often, uh,

215
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,680
a hyperbolic in somewhat comic,

216
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,681
one in which Stevens is
identifying with a giant big men.

217
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,750
Uh, and, and I'll talk more about
that. Uh, two lectures from now.

218
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,860
Um, uh, in this poem, um, I think,

219
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,640
uh, well possibly, uh,

220
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,300
warding off the anxiety
of identifying poetry.

221
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:45,910
So, uh, clearly and strongly
with, uh, the female, uh,

222
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,150
Steven's includes in, um, stands a seven

223
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,250
on a two 39 to 40. Uh, I,

224
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,510
I kind of parodic
celebration of masculinity,

225
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:00,710
supple and turbulent.

226
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:05,030
A ring of men shall chant an orgy on a
summer more in their boisterous devotion

227
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:09,530
to the sun, not as a god, but as
a god might be naked among them,

228
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:13,750
like a savage source.
And so on. This is a,

229
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,470
this is another vein of
Stevens, his imagination, and
it's here in this poem, uh,

230
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,950
in again,
almost hyperbolic comic form.

231
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,010
Uh, if Stevens is, is, uh, uh,

232
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,290
anxious about, uh, identifying, um, uh,

233
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,000
poetry with, um, uh, the,
uh, the feminine. Uh,

234
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:43,001
I think that's because in a sense as
Steven sets things up here at this early

235
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,410
point in his career,

236
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,360
all poets are women poets
on Sunday morning. Uh,

237
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,710
poetry can only be written
on Sunday morning, uh,

238
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,160
or on the weekend or after
hours at the end of the workday.

239
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,340
Uh, uh, these are the
spaces in which, uh, uh,

240
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,030
in his life, uh, um, poetry exists.

241
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:16,220
But more generally, these are the sort
of cultural spaces that, that, uh,

242
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,190
the Times that, uh, Steven's, um,

243
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,530
identify as poetry with,
uh, here in this poem.

244
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,760
Uh, uh, Steven's is, is in
a sense brooding on, um,

245
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,600
the bourgeois image of
the earthly paradise.

246
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,540
That is what it's like
to have a nice home, uh,

247
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,190
and some free time in it.
Uh,

248
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,510
it's a poem that Stevens
wrote in his twenties, uh,

249
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,170
in the earliest phase of his
career. Uh, like Elliott,

250
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,150
like frost, uh, Stevens went to Harvard,

251
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,210
uh, that all of these modern
poets went to Harvard. Uh,

252
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,960
he was from early on divided in his
ambitions between poetry and the law of

253
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:11,340
securely masculine pursuit.
Uh,

254
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,050
Steven's tried journalism
briefly, uh, in New York,

255
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,740
uh, and, uh, legal practice before.

256
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:24,741
Eventually he entered
the Hartford accident and
indemnity company in our state,

257
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,160
uh, where he remained for
the rest of his life, uh,

258
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,350
becoming a national authority
on Surety bonds, uh, and,

259
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,430
uh,
leading an extraordinary divided life,

260
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,860
a life in which poetry was
identified with leisure in repose.

261
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,860
Uh, there's a kind of, um, sybaritic, uh,

262
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,210
quality to, um, uh,
Stevens, his imagination.

263
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,980
He luxuriating, uh, in another
one of those, uh, Dad Gea,

264
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,540
he says a poem is a cafe. Uh, and,

265
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,350
and so it is, and Stevens, this case, uh,

266
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:14,330
poetry represents a kind of release
from a objective disciplines, uh,

267
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,440
including the 19th century Protestant
injunctions to refuse private pleasures,

268
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,800
uh, to save for future life. Uh,

269
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,490
perhaps a life beyond
life, uh, in afterlife.

270
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,850
This is the quote puritanism that crane
objects to early in his career and,

271
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,590
and, and, uh, uh, fights against, uh,

272
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,430
and Stevens to a,
is here in a more cautious,

273
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,260
uh, a way, uh, struggling
against it. On, um,

274
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,320
two 38 in the second
stanza, this poem, he says,

275
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,743
[inaudible],

276
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,120
why should she give
her bounty to the dead?

277
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,410
Why should she give,
uh,

278
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,400
why should she give her her spirit?
Uh,

279
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,380
her imaginative investments,
her hopes, uh, to,

280
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,330
uh, uh, the dead, uh,
here, uh, suggesting both,

281
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,950
uh, the dead Jesus and, uh, also, um,

282
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,470
uh, a future life beyond life. Um, uh,

283
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,090
that Christianity would look towards.
Uh,

284
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,600
Steve Stevens is, uh, imagining, um,

285
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,090
earth itself as where bounty is given
and where it should be bestowed.

286
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,130
Uh, it is, uh, it's where we are. Uh,

287
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,860
and, and he'll go on and
describe it, uh, in this stanza.

288
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,990
What his divinity, if it can come
only in silent shadows and in dreams,

289
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,540
shall she not find and comforts of the
sun and pungent fruit and bright green

290
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,750
wings or else in any bomb
or beauty of the earth.

291
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:09,320
Things to be cherished
like the thought of Heaven.

292
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,650
No. You know, divinity can't be off
somewhere else. It can't be beyond life.

293
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,440
Divinity must live within herself.

294
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,110
And what form does it take?

295
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:25,670
Their passions of rain or
moods and falling? Snow?

296
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,600
Grievings and loneliness are unsub dude.

297
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:33,601
Elations when the forest blooms gusty
emotions on wet roads at autumn nights,

298
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,460
all pleasures and all pains remembering
the bow of summer and the winter branch.

299
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,670
These are the measures destined
for her soul. Uh, here,

300
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,090
um, uh, uh,

301
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,060
divinity must live within the person,
uh,

302
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,470
in her subjectivity, uh, uh,

303
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,480
subjectivity that's modeled on and
represented as a version of the sexual

304
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:06,800
encounter with the seasons,
uh,

305
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,690
which are themselves revolving
and balanced and cyclical.

306
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:16,400
Uh, uh, the bow of summer
and the winter branch,

307
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,283
uh,

308
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,620
to say that paradise must be here
on earth is also to say that,

309
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,350
um,
uh,

310
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,850
it must include death and dying.
Uh,

311
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,620
a world of,
uh,

312
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,680
change a world that's always in
a sense passing out of existence.

313
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,520
Um, and, and Stevens says in, in, uh, uh,

314
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,550
stands a six, uh, oh,

315
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,360
excuse me, uh, stands a
five, but in contentment,

316
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,060
she says,
he says with her,

317
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,340
I still feel the need of
some imperishable bliss.

318
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,830
Death is the mother of beauty.
Hands from her alone,

319
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:11,800
she'll come fulfillment to our
dreams and our desires. Uh,

320
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,710
yeah. Paradise. Uh, uh,

321
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,480
if it is to exist on earth, um, uh,

322
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,050
must include death in it.
And,

323
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,380
uh,
as the poem moves towards it's close.

324
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,460
That's what Steven's imagines for us.
Uh,

325
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,150
it's also, uh, well it's a scene

326
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,480
that he leaves us with in the eight
eighth stanza, or excuse me. Um, yeah,

327
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,310
eighth stands, uh, uh, uh, it's
a scene of a world of plenty,

328
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,690
uh, a beautiful world, but also a,

329
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:57,691
a world which for these
reasons includes death in it.

330
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,620
Um, let's, let's look at that.

331
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,650
It returns to the opening lines of the
poem and then the camera pans out to give

332
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,420
a view of the landscape
in the world around us.

333
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:23,050
She hears upon that water without
sound and voice that cries.

334
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,800
The tomb in Palestine is not
the porch of spirits lingering.

335
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,440
It is the grave of Jesus where
he lay the tomb is empty.

336
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,370
Jesus is,
is not a presence for us.

337
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,670
And now Steven's moves for the
first time in the poem, uh,

338
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,880
out of that, um, uh, third person,

339
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,980
she to speak in the first person,
plural.

340
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,290
We live in an old chaos of the sun

341
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:07,150
or old dependency of day and
night or island solitude,

342
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,380
unsponsored free of that
wide water in escapable.

343
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,270
We live in an old chaos of
the sun. We live in a, um, uh,

344
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,940
a world that is material.
Uh,

345
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,100
it exists as a,
uh,

346
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,750
a set of rocks blasted a
across the universe, uh,

347
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,290
that the sun structures and radiates,

348
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,660
uh,
uh,

349
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,440
even as Stevens makes this declaration
characteristic of him is the resistance

350
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:49,800
to residing in any one formulation.

351
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,210
So he'll say one thing and
then he'll say another or,

352
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,380
and notice this pattern a here where he,
uh,

353
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,830
in fact gives us two oars,
uh,

354
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:08,100
old dependency of day and night. That's
another way of imaging our world, uh,

355
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:10,890
where day and night.
These essential contraries,

356
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:14,970
these essential natural forms
are dependent on each other,

357
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:18,900
are constituting each other continuously.
Uh,

358
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,460
we are dependent on them.
They are dependent on each other.

359
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,690
We exist or perhaps in island solitude,

360
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,790
a here the world,
the globe,

361
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,620
this natural space, this earthly
paradise is an island, uh,

362
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,750
in a solitary one, uh,
one without God out there,

363
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,930
uh, in, uh, in, in what, uh, uh,

364
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,660
condition Stevens we'll call
unsponsored and therefore free,

365
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:57,030
uh,
of that wide water in escapable

366
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,980
where that wide water that
was first introduced, uh,

367
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
to us in the first stanza of the poem
becomes a kind of image for a silence in

368
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:11,760
the world, which is the silence
of, uh, uh, lack of, uh,

369
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,960
I think divine language,
uh,

370
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:20,460
from these generalizations.
Steven's then moves to these particulars.

371
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Deer walk upon our mountains
and the quail whistle about us.

372
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:30,900
They're spontaneous cries, sweet
berries, ripen in the wilderness,

373
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,170
and in the isolation of the sky at evening
casual flux of pigeons make ambiguous

374
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:44,391
undulations as they sync downward
to darkness on extended wings.

375
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,460
Steven's is approach finally is
not to generalize about the world,

376
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,420
but to describe it, uh, to uh,

377
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,870
not tell us how things should
be or might be or were,

378
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,610
but rather how they are, uh, how
they are now. And at this moment,

379
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,890
uh, Steven's evokes the world in
a state of fullness of rightness.

380
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:18,600
Those berries are ripening.
There's deer walking on the mountains.

381
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:19,141
Uh,

382
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:24,141
that present tense that he's using
a evokes action that is ongoing,

383
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:29,190
uh, is, is present. Uh, and yet,

384
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,450
um,
uh,

385
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:35,451
all these potential satisfactions
that he evokes are colored by evening,

386
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,180
uh, uh, pleasure here, uh,

387
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,020
is shadowed by death, not unhappily. Uh,

388
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:48,850
but it is the color of the
environment of the evening.

389
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,320
Uh,
the birds,

390
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,470
they make a downward movement
and yet their wings are extended.

391
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,000
Uh, they're undulations are
ambiguous in that sense.

392
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,160
A much as the dependency of day
and night is itself ambiguous.

393
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,500
Uh, you could, you could contrast those
birds with, with heart cranes. Um,

394
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,610
uh, ascending Siegel at the
beginning of the bridge.

395
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,250
This is a different image.
Stephen's is,

396
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,260
is here trying to image
for us a non transcendental
secular vision of the world.

397
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,860
Let's look ahead to another poem,
uh,

398
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,180
poems of our climate on
to 40. Ooh, excuse me.

399
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:40,720
Two 52,

400
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,443
uh,

401
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,270
another palm exploring
the idea of paradise.

402
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,560
Uh, Steven's means here in that
title the poems of our climate.

403
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,970
He means, uh, America,

404
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,930
uh, our culture, uh, our
environment, our situation.

405
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,243
Uh,

406
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,950
it's a poem that you might read alongside
of home like England by Marianne Moore.

407
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,170
Uh, he also, uh, means, uh,

408
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,960
the poems of our time,
our,

409
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:26,900
our moment and our time or our moment,
uh,

410
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:30,820
for Stevens is defined
as a climate, uh, as, uh,

411
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,130
as a kind of, uh, uh,
environment rather than a,

412
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,510
some other kind of overarching way of,
uh,

413
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:41,960
understanding or defining a,
the present moment.

414
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,960
Uh, it's not, uh, as the
poem unfolds, uh, uh,

415
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,770
a question about nature so
much as a about culture.

416
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,440
Uh,
Steven's will

417
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,760
here explore one of his,
uh,

418
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,820
recurrent impulses that is to
renew poetry by simplifying terms,

419
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,700
by getting down to some, uh, essential,

420
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,970
some primary elements.
Uh,

421
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,190
if Stevens is essential list,

422
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,910
he's also a kind of aesthetic.
Uh,

423
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:21,360
he can be both a and as,
and even find,

424
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:25,740
I suppose a kind of a
essential, uh, asceticism, uh,

425
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:30,570
in this poem exemplifies that
clear water in a brilliant bowl.

426
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,580
Pink and white carnations
the light in the room,

427
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:38,970
more like a snowy air reflecting snow,

428
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:45,390
a newly fallen snow at the end
of winter when afternoons return.

429
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,520
Uh, we, we still don't have a main verb
yet. Uh, pink and white carnations.

430
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,520
One desire is so much more than that.

431
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,730
The day itself is simplified
a bowl of white cold,

432
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,361
uh,

433
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:07,361
cold porcelain low and round with
nothing more than the carnations there.

434
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,090
Uh, this is, this is Steven's.

435
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,990
This is exploring another version
of secularity of the secular,

436
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,330
uh,
giving us a poetry.

437
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,360
It seems as he starts not have ideas
but of things as Williams might approve.

438
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,450
It is a, a world of
white, uh, you, you can,

439
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,710
you can understand the impulse
here as, uh, a version of the,

440
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,230
um, reduction to nakedness, uh, or, um,

441
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,683
uh,

442
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,200
the reduction to primary
terms that image ism seeks to,

443
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,940
uh, accomplish. Uh, and,
and these are in a sense,

444
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,540
you know, precisely, uh, uh, images that,

445
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,490
that Stephens is presenting to us
almost as a kind of still life there,

446
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,750
uh,

447
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,430
that clear water and a brilliant boal
and the pink and white carnations where,

448
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,030
uh, you know, that word
carnation from the Latin, uh,

449
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,980
meaning flesh a evokes, uh, the, uh, uh,

450
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,570
colors of the body,
uh, and, uh, uh, blood,

451
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,290
uh, and of flesh. Uh, and yet, um,

452
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,790
those qualities are here held
in a kind of suspension that is,

453
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:34,030
um, contains them and, and,
uh, uh, treats them Cooley,

454
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,590
uh, and, and arranges them.

455
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,190
And it's unsatisfying to
Steven's a, the moment, uh,

456
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,080
he has created this still life.
He starts to want to get rid of it.

457
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,390
Uh,
he says,

458
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:56,170
say even that this complete simplicity
that I've just produced here stripped

459
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:00,710
one.
In fact of the heat of the flesh,

460
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,830
a stripped one of all ones torments,

461
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,090
conceal the Evilee compounded vital I

462
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,190
and made it fresh in a world of white,
a world of Clearwater,

463
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,540
brilliant edged still one would want more,

464
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,520
one would need more,

465
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,380
more than a world of white and
snowy sense. Uh, and again,

466
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:27,980
this is characteristic of Stephens
is imagination. If he said one thing,

467
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:32,660
he will now try something
else. Uh, he will now, uh, uh,

468
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,410
turn his, his strategy and
an in another direction. Uh,

469
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,320
he continues here. Uh, affirming

470
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,410
powers of mind.

471
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,160
There would still remain the never
resting mind so that one would want to

472
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,214
escape,

473
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,780
come back to what had
been so long composed.

474
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,900
The imperfect is our paradise.

475
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,870
Note that in this bitterness delight,

476
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,110
since the imperfect is so hot in us,

477
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,850
lies and flawed words and stubborn sounds

478
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
that never resting mind always wants
more even as it wants to get down to

479
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,690
primary terms. It then once more, again,

480
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,590
paradise is the imperfect,
uh,

481
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:35,730
the imperfect meaning. Again,
Stephen's is always playing on Latin.

482
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:36,890
I think,
uh,

483
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,380
the imperfect is the incompleted.
Uh,

484
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,400
the not finished the ongoing, uh, and,

485
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:50,970
and, and to there, there's tinge is
in that word, imperfect of corruption,

486
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,240
of fallenness, uh, of well flaws, uh,

487
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,510
as Stephen's, we'll go
on to to say, um, uh,

488
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:05,460
the imperfect does something that's not
cold, but it's hot as people are hot.

489
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,130
It's hot with desire.
It's the heat, uh, uh,

490
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,310
heat of desire that that
shows itself as Steven says,

491
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,510
in flawed words and stubborn sounds.

492
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,180
Uh, Steven's affirms the, the
never resting mine, but above all,

493
00:37:24,181 --> 00:37:28,620
he, he, uh, affirms a
kind of continuing, um,

494
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,420
impulse,
uh,

495
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:35,421
and demand to speak to find
flawed words and stubborn sounds.

496
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,190
Uh,
over the course of the poem,

497
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:42,510
Stevens moves from a still
world to a world in action,

498
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:44,230
and he moves from a world,
uh,

499
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,750
that is visual to a world that is verbal,
uh,

500
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:52,740
that's linguistic, uh,
here, uh, and elsewhere.

501
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:57,741
And Steven's language is the privileged
medium of human desire and aspiration.

502
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,780
Uh, uh, it's, it's what
gives us delight, uh, his,

503
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,980
his word here. Uh, it
gives us pleasure, uh,

504
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:12,460
and in this sense, uh, it
remains language does, uh,

505
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,240
on the side of leisure, uh, and, uh,

506
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:21,120
play a rather than a,
of discipline and work,

507
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,290
uh, in yet, uh, also, uh, no, uh,

508
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,340
the implications of those adjectives,
a flawed,

509
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,880
flawed implies craft some
kind of making I think,

510
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:40,180
uh, and stubborn, stubborn
suggests perseverance,

511
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,870
discipline, uh, uh, perhaps,

512
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:48,850
surprisingly a kind of
continuing will, uh, uh, to,

513
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,640
well,
not to rest and to go on speaking.

514
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,270
Uh,
these values that emerge in this poem,

515
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,070
uh, are, um, well they're
recurrent and Steven's,

516
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:07,230
you'll find him exploring
them, celebrating them, uh,

517
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,140
elsewhere. Uh, let's go forward, uh,

518
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,230
to the poem called the man on the dump,

519
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,290
a on two 54 a for another

520
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,863
poem.

521
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,790
Again, uh, exploring and affirming, um,

522
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,740
certain capacities of
language. Uh, this is,

523
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:37,520
uh, this is Steven's, uh,

524
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,530
at play in, in the landscape
of the wasteland, if you like.

525
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:50,390
Stephen's, you know, letter
explains that on his way to work,

526
00:39:50,391 --> 00:39:54,660
he walked to work, uh,
from West Hartford to, um,

527
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,970
uh, downtown and he would, um, uh,

528
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:04,150
observe during the depression.
Uh, a man on the dump, uh,

529
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,670
and, uh, compose. This

530
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,230
poem prompted by him.
Day creeps down,

531
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,750
the moon is creeping up.

532
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,930
The Sun is a coral Bay of flowers.
The Moon Blanche of course,

533
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:21,764
she's blanched.

534
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,060
It's the white moon
places there a bouquet.

535
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,550
Ho Ho.
The dump is full of images,

536
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,860
just like the wasteland days

537
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,170
past like papers from a press.

538
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,670
The bouquets come here in the papers,
so the sun.

539
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,750
And so the moon both come and
the janitors poems of every day.

540
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,210
The wrapper on the can of Pairs,
the cat and the paper bag,

541
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,650
the course of the box from Astonia,
the tiger chest for tea.

542
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,830
If Steven's celebrates a desire,
uh, celebrates consumption,

543
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,480
uh,
and sensual pleasure as he does well,

544
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,860
that makes a certain
amount of garbage, uh, uh,

545
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,830
that makes a certain amount of waste.

546
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,020
If you are

547
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,310
constantly seeking

548
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,610
new ways of phrasing and
understanding the world,

549
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,270
you're going to have to be getting
rid of the ones you just had, right?

550
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,980
The ones that you were just using.
Uh,

551
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,960
and the dump is an image of this which
Steven's conference here with a certain

552
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:43,130
kind of irritation.
Playful,

553
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,930
but not so far, I think from despair. Uh,

554
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:52,970
the dump is a place of old poetry,
uh, and of course, Stevens.

555
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,970
His own poetry doesn't
want to end up there,

556
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,910
or maybe it does.

557
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Since Stephen's is able to find in the
dump a certain kind of regenerative

558
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,100
power, uh, the freshness of night,

559
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,910
any poet knows,
has been fresh along time.

560
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,830
The freshness of mourning,

561
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:20,720
the blowing of day one says that it
puffs as Cornelius knee puff reads,

562
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:24,440
it puffs more than less than,

563
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,050
or puffs like this or that.

564
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,970
Maybe it's just all air. Uh, uh,

565
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:35,860
these poems
Stephen's is,

566
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,670
is talking about the problem of cliche.
He's talking about,

567
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,530
uh, um, well, the way in which, uh,

568
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:51,020
any formulation, uh, dies becomes frozen,

569
00:42:51,021 --> 00:42:54,080
becomes a bouquet you must throw out.

570
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,433
Uh,

571
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,600
this is a condition in the wasteland
that Elliot profoundly mistrusts.

572
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:06,830
Uh,
Steven's on the other hand,

573
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,460
a season it,

574
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,860
a potential for a vision of
the self that is consoling,

575
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,250
uh, and is powerful. Steven's,

576
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,600
uh,
generates as the poem goes on.

577
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,340
Uh, a, um, an image of,

578
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,830
of the poet as a man on the dump,

579
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,910
a one who beats in old tin
can and makes stubborn sounds,

580
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:42,110
which are are, uh, if you like
sounds of his own stubbornness.

581
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,793
Uh,

582
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,040
Steven's is willing as Elliot is not
to make belief be a personal thing,

583
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:58,650
a to B something that each
of us constructs a out of
our own will in our own

584
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:04,030
powers of speech.
It's the palm develops,

585
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,440
uh, Steven's goes through
a, uh, kind of, uh, uh,

586
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,840
a gesture of throwing things out,

587
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:15,130
a kind of reduction to primary terms
that is like the poems of our climate,

588
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,570
uh, as, uh, around line 21 or so. Uh, uh,

589
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:23,820
he says now in the time of spring as
alias Trillium's myrtle over Burnham's

590
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,810
daffodils blue flux, you know, all the
names between that disgust in this.

591
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:32,940
And I think there is discussed in the
palm between the things that are on the

592
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:37,800
dump, azaleas and so on, and those
that will be as aliens and so on.

593
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,580
When feels the purifying change.

594
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,700
When rejects the trash

595
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,490
and as one rejects the
trash, as one, uh, uh,

596
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,260
gets down to some kind of a primary

597
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,310
whiteness,
some kind of fresh seeing of the world,

598
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,210
we then start to see the moon and
perhaps a different terms, uh,

599
00:45:03,211 --> 00:45:07,980
not merely as blanche. Uh,
you know, uh, some, uh,

600
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,330
uh, uh, old, uh, uh, lady from, uh,

601
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,770
poems from the past, but
perhaps in some new terms, uh,

602
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,760
Steven says that's the moment when
the moon creeps up to the bubbling of

603
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:25,710
bassoons. That's the time when looks
at the elephant colorings of tires.

604
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,300
Even this, this ugliness
is interesting. Uh,

605
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,610
everything is shed.
The moon comes up then as the moon,

606
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:40,860
cause all it's images are in the dump.
You have to see it freshly. And you see,

607
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,560
because you're seeing
freshly now as a man,

608
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,110
not like an image of a man.

609
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,370
You see the moon rise in the empty sky,

610
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,420
one sits and beets and old tin can Lard
Pale when beats and beats for that.

611
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:01,640
Which one believes
that?

612
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,240
What one wants to get near?

613
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,870
Could it after all be merely oneself

614
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,810
that you want to get near,
that you need to get near.

615
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:12,910
Okay.

616
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:17,830
Stephens is willing to say yes.
Whereas Elliot is, is as I say,

617
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,690
frightened of this prospect,
uh,

618
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,900
merely oneself as superior
as the ear to a crows voice.

619
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,700
Did the Nightingale torture the ear,
pack the heart,

620
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:35,410
and scratch the mind and does the
ear solace itself and peevish birds?

621
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,350
Is it peace?
Is it a philosopher's honeymoon?

622
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:42,730
One fines on the dump?

623
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:48,160
Is it to sit among the mattresses
of the dead bottles, pots, shoes,

624
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:51,370
and grass and murmur?
Aptist eve

625
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:58,140
is it to hear the bladder of grackles
and say invisible priest is it to eject,

626
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:04,210
to pull the data pieces and
Christ stands on my stone.

627
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,550
Where was it when first
heard of the truth? The Va?

628
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:12,863
Yeah.

629
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,360
It's a wonderful poem that's
on the verge of nonsense.

630
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,100
Uh, that's on the verge of a kind
of personal language that, as I say,

631
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,730
is an apocalyptic thing in the wasteland.

632
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:30,731
But is here a source of energy
and power and play for Stephens?

633
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,480
Stephens is not afraid of nonsense.

634
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:38,170
He's not afraid of
idiosyncrasy of expression.

635
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:43,960
Uh,
he is willing to play with words.

636
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,270
A linguistic play puts
Stephen's in touch with, um, uh,

637
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:53,440
kind of, uh, uh, primal poetic resource.

638
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,483
Uh,

639
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:00,490
Steven's understands truth as
something that is linguistic.

640
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:04,000
It's something constructed
in and through language.

641
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,540
Uh,
it is therefore perishable.

642
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,000
Uh,
it is also for the same reason renewable.

643
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,900
Uh,
look at that last line.

644
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,170
Where was it when first heard
of the truth, the, the, the,

645
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,520
the, if you prefer, um,

646
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,500
that last sentence fragment, the, the,

647
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,750
is it, what is that? Is that, uh,

648
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,230
an answer or a clarification
to the question?

649
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,080
Where was it when first heard
of the truth? Now there's,

650
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,050
where did this idea of truth
come from to begin with?

651
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,750
Where did you get that idea?
Why do you want it?

652
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,960
You want it because it is something
that you have heard about. Uh,

653
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,560
it is something that has been spoken.
Uh,

654
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,600
it has come to us as
language has framed it. Uh,

655
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,440
the, the, the definite article,

656
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:11,440
it's the definite article that makes
the truth the truth. Otherwise,

657
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:14,350
it would be merely only what a truth

658
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,420
that is to, uh, indicate, uh,

659
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:24,100
and declare truth in its
singularity, uh, to, to, uh,

660
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,260
uh, uh, uh, give it this, uh,

661
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,360
status that is linguistic act.

662
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,580
The truth is the function and Steven's
understands it of a certain linguistic

663
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,960
capacity, uh, in this
case of verbal formula,

664
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,250
uh,

665
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,250
which takes priority ultimately over
any specific content or doctrine.

666
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,060
Any truth, uh, in that sense,

667
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,210
the truth lies in the Va.

668
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,950
The Va is here representative of
the Human Capacity for declaration,

669
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,260
uh,
uh,

670
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:09,880
for statement a specifically
verbal and linguistic power.

671
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,560
Uh,

672
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:16,560
the truth that it represents is
not in any sense of final term,

673
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,660
a last word,
a doctrine,

674
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,100
a particular content of
any kind. Uh, instead,

675
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,280
it points to a, a way of
thinking, a medium of thought,

676
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:33,470
a medium of thought and desire,
a process which is a process of naming,

677
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,070
uh,

678
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:39,070
or a Stevens who would also call it in
a of modern poetry and active finding.

679
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,350
Uh, this is what, uh,
language does in Steven's, uh,

680
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,060
it creates the world. It
finds the world, uh, it, uh,

681
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,260
constructs the world
through, uh, such, uh,

682
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:59,220
elementary terms, uh, as the
definite article. Well, uh,

683
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,170
we'll hear more about,
uh,

684
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,840
the implications of this
perspective on experience,

685
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,630
uh,
next time and following.
