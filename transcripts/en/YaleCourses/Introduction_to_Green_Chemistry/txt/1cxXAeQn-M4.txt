Speaker 1:          00:04          So these are the 12, 12 principles. And I should say that the 12 principles, um, like any principles of framework aren't, um, you know, don't come from on high on stone tablets or anything else. Frameworks are thrown out into the scientific community to be beaten up and who'd be ripped apart and put back together and, and uh, and to see if they have any utility or any value. Uh, and what is useful about these is that they're, they've been around for coming on 20 years out there with lots of a discussion and they are at this point, widely used. Uh, and we can talk a lot more about this, but let's talk about principal one. It's better to prevent waste than to treat or cleanup waste after it's formed. So the reason that it's necessary to state this is cause the entire history of environmental protection has been then, you know, you're just treat a controlling waste and all well with the world.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Okay. So that has been the whole, whole industries have sprouted up to clean up after wasteful manufacturing processes. Waste will end of life. Uh, but there's, there's an inherent problem with the create and cleanup waste issue and one has to do with the laws of thermodynamics. Okay. So we talked about, well, we'll make sure that if, uh, there, we'll close our, our loops. There won't be any emissions, there won't be any, uh, exposure to people, uh, workers, consumers, there won't be any exposure, uh, to the air, to the water. These loops stay closed based on thermodynamics right up until they don't, and they dissipate. And when we're talking about substances that persist, that bioaccumulate the build up into our bodies and the biosphere, the idea of, well, it's okay if we can create it, we'll just clean it up. Becomes, um, an experiment that we've run for many, many decades and shown that it doesn't, uh, it doesn't work and I'm close to anything I say.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Please feel free to challenge. But the other issue is that, does it cost money to treat or clean up waste? It has a cost energy. Do you have to expend energy to separate the waste, to clean it, to treat it? And it, does it add performance to a product? Does it add efficiency to a manufacturing scheme? Why have we thought that environmental issues cost a lot of money for decades? Because this has largely been the approach that we've used. Our approach to dealing with these issues has largely men that you were going to have a significant expenditure principle to synthetic methods should be designed to maximize the incorporation of all materials use, uh, now that are used into the final product. Basically, if you're going to put an atom in, you want it to wind up in your product and not into your waste stream, it's concept called Adam economy.

Speaker 1:          03:26          We're going to talk a lot about it and we're going to, uh, be able to actually measure what's the Adam Economy of these transformations. Principle three, Rev. A practical synthetic methods should be designed to use in generate substances to possess little or no toxicity to human health and the environment. So we captured this. So you want to use whether it's your reagents, you're feedstocks, um, um, and all of these transformations that possessed little or no toxicity to human health and the environment and toxicity really is probably better understood as hazard. Well, more generally principle for the products chemical come products should be designed to preserve efficacy of function. So not that you have a very nice soap, that's, that, that, uh, doesn't have any toxicity, but it doesn't work as a self preserve. The efficacy of function while minimizing toxicity. Okay, this is going to be a large section of this class.

Speaker 1:          04:27          When we started talking about molecular design, we start talking about hazard reduction. This is what we're talking about on ciliary substances. There's a whole lot of things that go into manufacturing. There are solvents there. Our separation agents, there's, there's energy that's put in, uh, to, uh, to bring about separations that we'll talk a lot about. And these can make up a huge percentage of the waste stream and pharmaceuticals. It's estimated that 80% of the waste are the solvents that are used and the manufacturing process. So we kind of underestimate this so that they, there are ways to not only come up with alternative solvents and other exonerees that are less toxic, but also ways to eliminate them. Completely. Principles six energy, energy and the nature of its energy needs to be understood how much embedded energy is going into the harvesting or mining. How much, uh, how much energy is going into the, the manufacturer, the separations, the isolation, the purification, and the nature of that energy.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Is it renewable? Is it a, is it fossil? Is a depleting principle seven, a raw material. This is our feedstocks question. Should be renewable rather than depleting wherever the technically and economically practical, renewable, renewable, and what kind of timeframe oils, renewable, they just a few million years. So not on a geologic timeframe. We're talking about a human timescale. If you're, if you're not able to renew this on, uh, your, your materials, uh, on a time frame in there, your definitionally depleting principle eight, this is more subtle. It's, uh, actually, uh, an order to get from a to B. Many times you have to go through a double prime, a prime, a double prime, a tip triple prime, and you transform it on your way to to be. That has been the way for a hundred years coming up with ways of instead of going through all of those other steps that generate all kinds of ways, he was all kinds of material. Instead come up with ways that we can eliminate these, these steps catachesis we are going to devote whole focus to Catalin [inaudible] we'll be discussing what ketalysis is and the spoiler alert catachesis allows you to make product with less energy, less material, less waste. And there's not a petrochemical, pharmaceuticals, specialty chemical company that would be in business today without it.

Speaker 1:          07:11          Principle 10 products should be designed so the end of their function, they do not persist in the environment and they break down into unoccupied degradation products. I didn't say bio degradation, products, degradation products. This definition leaves open that you want to have, you know, both natural degradation as well as trigger degradation so that you can break it down into building blocks that can be used for other upcycling purposes. So there are ways to break down plastics. For instance, Donna to the basic building block monomers, so that's going to use him as virgin plastic. Once again, uh, investigating what this means so that they don't last forever or build up in our bodies of the biosphere.

Speaker 1:          07:54          Analytical methodologies should be developed so that we can test in real time in process, in field rather than as has been done for so long. After you create the, the contamination or after you've generated the waste, you then measure it and say, oops, look what we have to deal with now. Realtime analysis and then principal 12 substances and the form of these substances, uh, should be used to minimize the potential for chemical accidents, including fires, explosions, or at least as you don't want to have pollution prevention and accident prevention working at opposite goals. You have to align these so that accident prevention, and there are inherent ways that you can engage in chemical safety.
