Speaker 1:          00:02          Why do green chemistry, why do green chemistry? You know, it's not my job. You know, I like to talk about the chef. This is the meals. I make a delicious, sure they are poisonous, but there are other shuts working on nonlethal

Speaker 2:          00:17          cook,

Speaker 1:          00:21          the architect that says the homes I build on luxurious and beautiful. Yes, they collapse and kill people on a regular basis. But there are other people working on safe house. The car designer, it says, I build cars that are fast, powerful, beautiful. Yes, they fall apart unexpectedly when people die. But there are other designers working on sustainable cars.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And then the chemist. I've developed some of the best methodologies and processes from making hundreds of target molecules, target molecules that are improving the world. Sure they harm humans and the environment. But there are other chemists working on green chemistry for the same reason that the first three examples were absurd. This is absurd. And yet throughout the history of chemistry, and sadly even in large swaths today, this is not considered absurd. This is considered the orthodoxy that green chemistry is not my job. It's somebody else's job. Somebody else has to worry about it. I'm just doing research. I'm just making this widget. I'm just making this shampoo. I'm somebody else. The engineer's, we'll clean up the, uh, uh, the waste, et Cetera, et cetera. And what we understand now is that we can have the building blocks of chemistry of the economy that doesn't have to have these unintended consequences.
