1
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.850
Stay with the planet was still in the,
uh,

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.570
and the overview background section of this class.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
And so if you to say,
I think that we're going big picture.
You're right.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.250
We're going big pitch right now and we're going to drill down.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.910
But what I want to do is talk about where we are currently and two to do a uh,

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.870
a full treatment of that has of course,
absolutely impossible.

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
So I can do almost little more than metaphor.
Uh,
but let's,

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.650
let's try,
so this is a demonstration that maybe some of you saw,

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.830
but it's the earth and 10 seconds.
Okay?

10
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.330
What has happening it means while you're waiting for this,

11
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.540
I want you to take a deep breath and I want you to hold that breath.

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
I want you to do this.
Literally,
I want you to do it literally.

13
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.270
I want you to take a deep breath and watch her to hold it for 10 seconds.

14
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.190
10 seconds is very long,
but I want you to get a feel for what 10 seconds is.

15
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.310
Exhale.
That's 10 seconds.
We got 10 seconds.

16
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.960
You've got it locked in.
All right,
10 seconds.

17
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.630
42 children were born 40 in the poorest nations in the world.

18
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.440
10 seconds,
10 seconds.

19
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.910
4,100 worth of damage was done to the global economy through polluting,

20
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.840
close to waters,
and totaling 13 billion in year,

21
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.120
10 seconds,
119 tons of hazardous and toxic waste,

22
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.680
or out to the world.
10 seconds.

23
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.510
Two people died from drinking bad water.

24
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.380
A 1 billion don't have access to clean drinking water.

25
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.290
And 2 billion don't have access to sanitation.

26
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.350
<v 1>Ah,</v>

27
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.210
<v 0>almost 4,000 tons of fuel consumed.</v>

28
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.340
2000 tons of co two was added to the atmosphere.

29
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.890
2 billion people don't have access to electricity and pull a billion.

30
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.630
Don't have adequate supplies.
Furniture.

31
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.960
Three children died from preventable diseases,
malaria and ammonia,
measles,

32
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:34.760
malnutrition,
dysentery of the three children that die too,
to have babies.

33
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.120
And the last 10 seconds,
four acres of rainforest with destroyed.

34
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.390
All right.
So any one of those things is,
um,

35
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.490
is of concern.
