1
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.760
Green Chemistry's role in sustainability.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.050
So we already talked about the definition of sustainability.
I have to confess,

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.020
I like,
um,
the way I kind of paraphrase it,

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
preserving what you can't live without and preserving it forever.
Okay.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
So sustainability is a century's long perspective.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.160
The decisions you make are not short term.

7
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.740
It's not about the next financial quarter.
It's a,

8
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:30.930
it's not about the next election cycle.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.530
It's about centuries,
decades and centuries.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.000
So if you are resource planner and you were planning in 1914,

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
what 2014 needed to look like,
you would make sure that you had enough,
well,

12
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:47.280
oil for lighting,
you would make sure that you had enough wood for fuel.

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.040
It's certainly want to have enough rock software,

14
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.210
refrigeration and you're better beef up on the horses for transportation because

15
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:58.920
those horseless carriage things.
And now we're going to take off,
okay,

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.173
what actually happened?

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.470
These are the charts where the land use to feed horses peaked at 89 million

18
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.991
acres a to less than 3 million in 1961 when they stopped keeping the records

19
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.030
because it was irrelevant and useless.

20
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.350
This is w,
uh,
would you use this fueled?
Um,

21
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.690
these are all from department of Commerce went from a high of 5 billion cubic

22
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:29.691
feet in 1900 to less than 500 million acres in 1970 when they stopped keeping

23
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:34.320
the records because they weren't crucial to the economy.

24
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.770
So when you,
there was this great New York Times article,

25
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.520
I believe it was in 1896 the talked about the,
um,

26
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.450
the increase in horses for transportation in Manhattan and they projected the

27
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:56.451
increase in population and therefore the increase in horses to transport people

28
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.680
in the increase in the natural byproduct of horses on the streets of New York.

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.350
And they projected that in just a few years,

30
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.150
the average height of that natural byproduct was going to be taller than the

31
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:13.350
average person.
So what happened?
Oh,

32
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.040
this is at a time when the environmental technology was a bucket and a shovel.

33
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.820
Okay.
So what happened?
Did they ban horses?
No.

34
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.950
Technology intervene to change the equation.
A change,
the trajectory that we run,

35
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.700
he can argue about whether or not cars were the,
uh,
and,
and,

36
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.420
and a trolley cars and things like that with the best long term solution.

37
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.920
But Science and technology intervene to change that unsustainable trajectory.

38
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.460
So we start looking at the great challenges of sustainability.

39
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:44.280
Everybody can have their own list,
but certainly,
um,

40
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
population has to be up there,
right?
So we're talking that,
uh,

41
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.520
let's see,
since Iran,
when I was,

42
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.180
I was born,
we're more than doubled the population.

43
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.510
We went from 3 billion to over seven.
Okay.
Uh,

44
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.250
and the past,
uh,
when I was 60 years,
we tripled the population.

45
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.950
And where is that population growth happening?

46
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.500
These are the richest nations of the world.

47
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.930
These are the poorest nations of the world.
Okay,
great.

48
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.110
So that tells us that what we have to do is increase the state of development of

49
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.220
the poorest nations in the world.
That will bring about higher quality of life,

50
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.800
higher state of development,
higher learning follows,
uh,
uh,

51
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.750
almost always follows I,
or empowerment and education of women.

52
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.810
And you bring about a stable population growth.

53
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.690
What's the problem with that?

54
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.970
Problem with that is that historically coupled with

55
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.090
increased of state of development has been increased resource depletion,

56
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.640
environmental degradation.
All right?

57
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.100
So the challenge becomes how do you increase the state of development,

58
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:07.810
the quality of life while reducing the detrimental effects,

59
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.760
the detrimental effects of uh,
uh,
of this economic growth,

60
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.650
avoiding the resource depletion.

61
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.730
Last I checked and that's exactly what Green Chemistry and green engineering is

62
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:23.680
all about.
How you decrease the,
the adverse consequences,

63
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.640
the hazard,
the toxicity,
the pollution while getting higher performance.

64
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.510
That's what we're going to be talking about this whole semester is how do we

65
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.390
manifest this?
This is not going to be theory.

66
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.980
We're going to be seeing countless examples of how we're achieving exactly that.

67
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.430
So what we want to do is get a,

68
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.590
the higher state of development and do this kind of leapfrog technology and

69
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:49.960
we're going to talk a lot about leapfrogs and I'm going to want all of you to

70
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:53.860
know about some of the leapfrog examples.
Okay?

71
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.683
Um,

72
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.950
this is one of my favorite of all of a president Kennedy's quads,

73
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.120
that the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie,
deliberate,

74
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.990
contrived and dishonest,
but the myth persistent,
persuasive and realistic.

75
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.580
So there's a mythology that you can't have economic development,

76
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.250
you can't have growth.
You kind of have increase in jobs.
You can have,
uh,
uh,

77
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.590
increased quality of life unless you're going to essentially destroy the

78
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:28.270
environment,
use toxic substances.
Green Chemistry is belying that myth every day.

79
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.270
I'm going to talk to you a little bit about some of these.
So let's talk about

80
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.050
energy.
Everybody knows in this room knows that the vast majority of our energy,

81
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.300
uh,
in the world today is generated from nonrenewable sources.

82
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.750
Um,
all right,

83
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.300
so this is the projected increase in consumption of energy over time.

84
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.850
These are the projections and this

85
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.580
is what is projected to be the portfolio of energy.

86
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.220
Still oil,
still natural gas.
It's still cold.

87
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.820
What Green Chemistry and green engineering sustainable design is all about,

88
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.140
is changing that trajectory,
changing that balance,

89
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.550
so that though that is not inevitable.
All right.

90
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:21.470
So it's looking at developing alternatives for energy,
uh,
uh,
generation,

91
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.400
everything from photovoltaics,
hydrogen generation fuel cells,

92
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.980
biobased uh,

93
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.890
in addition to these alternative energy sources that we're going to talk a lot

94
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:34.770
about.
It's also about,
uh,
Catalin [inaudible].

95
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.560
We're going to talk about [inaudible] and how you can undertake transformations,

96
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.191
for instance,

97
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:44.720
of one material into another with dramatically lower energy with dramatically

98
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:49.340
lower waist,
with dramatically lower material consumption,

99
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.250
global change.
All right.
I hate the phrase global warming.
Um,
I,

100
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.350
I sometimes use the phrase climatic chaos because what's happening is when we're

101
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.310
adding energy into what's largely a closed system,
um,

102
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.980
and when you do that,
some places will get warmer,
some places will get colder,

103
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.270
some places will get wet,
or some places will get dryer.
It's not about this,

104
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.220
this linear,
uh,
progression.
It's about how you add turbulence into,
uh,

105
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.730
into a system.
And the literal definition of the word chaos.

106
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.890
This is one of the classic,
uh,
pieces of,

107
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.560
of data.
Uh,
the,

108
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:36.800
this shows the temperature change over the past thousand years.

109
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.590
This shows the increases in carbon dioxide concentrations over the last several

110
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.400
years.
Um,
and these are the initiatives over time.
Okay.

111
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.280
All right.
So I'm telling you this quick story.
One of the most powerful,

112
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.870
um,
greenhouse gasses is not,
um,

113
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.250
there's not CO2,
but a lot of the CFCs,

114
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:06.710
the floral conference and many of these were,
uh,

115
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.210
were used as fire extinguishing agents.
Okay.

116
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.680
This is an example of a technology it's called pirate piratical of a fire

117
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:20.240
extinguishing agent
that didn't use EFCs,

118
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:25.070
completely eliminated CFCs.
Um,
and so no emissions.

119
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.310
It basically served to make water a more effective fire extinguishing agent by

120
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:36.050
using surfactants in a formulation.
Okay?
So why do I tell you that?

121
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:39.230
Because he in such a big deal of fire extinguishing agents and they contribute,

122
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.400
even though there are about 24,000 times more potent a greenhouse gas,

123
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.440
then CO2,
no,
that's not why I'm telling you until you this.

124
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:49.640
Because one,

125
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:54.410
he can use the science and technology of this technology to use and other

126
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.860
applications.
More importantly,

127
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.990
when this fire extinguishing agent was used in a,
uh,

128
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.800
and an oil tanker player on the Bosphorus Straits,
Lloyd's of London,
uh,

129
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.920
estimated that this would take,
uh,

130
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.800
10 days to put out in this fire extinguishing agent,

131
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.360
put it out in 12 and a half minutes.
So what does that mean?

132
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.520
Come back to JFK?
The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie,

133
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.960
it's the myth.
The myth is the green products with not go into work as well.

134
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.790
Then if you're going to get an environmental benefit,

135
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.480
if you're not going to have environmental degradation,

136
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.870
you're not going to get the pro form.
It's on the function that you want.

137
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I am going to show you your going to discover your going to research examples

138
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.760
over and over again that are more functional,
higher performance,

139
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.890
and environmentally beneficial and sustainable.
So how do we change the equation?

140
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.790
It's not about just CFCs or,
uh,
all the,

141
00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:59.370
all the like,
how do we make greenhouse gases so that,

142
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:03.440
that actually,
um,
uh,
functional,
uh,

143
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.760
how do we take CO2 and,

144
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.620
and build it into our polymers and plastics?
It's being done.
Brilliant work by,

145
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:17.400
uh,
a company founded by Professor Jeff Jeff Coulton Codec Cornell,

146
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.030
making new plastics.
She's Co two.
All right,

147
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.760
so we know that we have a resource depletion issue,
uh,

148
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.010
that we've talked about that we know that we were burning a lot of our natural

149
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:33.720
capital,
a like it's a fire sale.
How do we,
what green chemistry is doing this?

150
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:35.070
How do we use bio mass?

151
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.360
How do we use a nano science so that we get the,

152
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.630
the function that we want with dramatically less material?

153
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.740
How do we go into carry out transformations with visible light rather than

154
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.180
chemicals and material?

155
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.890
How do we use carbon dioxide as a feed stock rather than as a waste number when

156
00:10:57.891 --> 00:11:00.920
it's a waste,
not a waste,
when it's a value added material.

157
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.610
All a waste is this is a material or energy for what you have not found a

158
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.550
valuable endpoint and titan,

159
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.410
which is a biopolymer or waste utilization.
All right?

160
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.430
We're gonna be wrapping up talking about a food supply.

161
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.020
We actually produce enough food.
There's an equitable distribution.

162
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.140
So there's still regional star starvation,
which is tragic.

163
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.950
But if you take a look at the green revolution that I talked about,

164
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.540
Norman Borlaug,
this is the development since 1960,

165
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.050
the food production absolutely astounding.

166
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.700
Good food production in the developing countries,
uh,

167
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.700
and industrialized nations belt.
You have to ask the question,
how did it happen?

168
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.240
That's part of how it happened.
That's part of how it happened.

169
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.420
So how do we get that important performance producing food,

170
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.280
feeding hungry bellies,
but not doing in a way that's,

171
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:10.600
that's contaminating our drinking water building up in our bodies.

172
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.840
And that's what green chemistry is developing new pesticides,

173
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:18.040
which are only focused on the target pest and not all of the other beneficial

174
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.290
insects think fertilizer and fruits that fertilize Agilent's the draw the

175
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.490
fertilizers to the roots so that you don't put 10 times the amount of fertilizer

176
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.190
so that you wind up having it going into your drinking water,

177
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.000
but you only put down what is actually going to be taken up by the,
uh,

178
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.420
by the plant methods of using agricultural wastes for beneficial and profitable

179
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.900
uses.
So one of the key areas that we're going to talk about is,
um,

180
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.200
toxics in the environment,
toxics in our body.

181
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200
And this is one of the great strengths of how you decouple the adverse

182
00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:54.880
consequences of ta of chemicals

183
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.540
from the performance.
Then we talked about,

184
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.720
as you all know,
I'm a chemist,

185
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.000
I love chemistry,
I love chemicals,

186
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.250
I hate hazard,

187
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.090
I hate on sustainability and I ain't going to be the last one that will ever say

188
00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.590
we ought to stop using chemicals.
What we need is things that are chemical free.

189
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.330
I find that very silly.
We just discussed that everything's a chemical.

190
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.280
The reason that I've,

191
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.640
and on a personal have devoted my professional life to green chemistry is

192
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:43.480
because not because I,
I hate chemistry and dislike chemistry.

193
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.400
It's because we can do better that chemistry can do far better.

194
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.440
It's transformed the world and some very positive ways and it's transformed the

195
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:55.990
world and some very consequential and adverse ways.

196
00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.420
And one of the things I know as a person who's been involved in green chemistry

197
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:04.010
for a lot of years now,
um,

198
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.260
is that we can get the benefits without the adverse consequences.
