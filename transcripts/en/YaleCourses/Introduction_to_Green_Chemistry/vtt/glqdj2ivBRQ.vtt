1
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.470
Green Chemistry,
its role in,
uh,
advancing sustainability,

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.590
dealing with health issues and dealing with environmental issues.
Um,

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.990
so did you get the benefits of chemistry and chemicals in the world without the

4
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.170
adverse consequences?
21 words.

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.280
It's the definitely one sentence definition of green chemistry.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.890
Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.430
eliminate the use in generation of hazardous substances.

8
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.190
So what teaching a course on this subject,

9
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.650
there are journals devoted to the subject.
There are international networks,

10
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.170
research networks in 35 countries around the world.

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.730
Our presidential awards on the subject,
and I could go on and on and on.

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.850
These 21 words better means something.
If you're going to define,

13
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.520
uh,
uh,
an area of focus

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.250
like that in one sentence.
So Green Chemistry.

15
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.460
So I'm going to just spend a few minutes about this.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
So first of all,
it'll sound like I'm joking.

17
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.690
People think I'm joking when I'm talking about Green Chemistry.
Now these green,

18
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:20.280
everything green,
this,
green that,
but back in 91,

19
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.730
uh,
it wasn't,
uh,
it wasn't that way.
And people said,

20
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.420
how did you come up with this crazy name green chemistry at the time?

21
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.440
And they think,
I'm joking when I say that,
you know,

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.620
green of course ever been an hour thinks of conjuring up images of,

23
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.100
of the natural environment.

24
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670
Green tree is green leaves and everything else and it's synonymous with

25
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.350
environmental types of issues.

26
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320
But in the u s green is also the color of our money.

27
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
And so how do you break that old myth that we've talked about,

28
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.280
which is that if you go into have environmental improvement,

29
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.480
make things more sustainable,

30
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:00.660
it has to cost more and it has to be an economic drain.

31
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.170
How do you instead meet the economic goals and the environmental goals

32
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.620
simultaneously?

33
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.620
How do you align those two things so that market drivers become a catalyst for

34
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:14.730
doing things in a sustainable way?

35
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.540
And that's one of the things that's at the essence of green chemistry.

36
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:22.760
And quite frankly,
one of the reasons why it has such widespread adoption.
Um,

37
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.570
and we can talk a lot more about that,

38
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.320
but the word chemistry and this chemistry is the design of chemical products and

39
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.820
processes.
So when we're talking about chemistry,

40
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.320
we all know that we're not talking about a department in a university.

41
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.180
We're not talking about a particular industry sector narrowly defined as we've

42
00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:47.490
been talking about.
We're talking about everything that you can see,

43
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.320
touch and feel at the most fundamental level.

44
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:53.680
How do you understand the molecular basis of,
of our,
uh,

45
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.330
products and processes to make them more sustainable?
Okay.

46
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.430
So,
um,

47
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.980
products and processes that's in this why?

48
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.420
Because really what we're talking about and what's absolutely key is the

49
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.030
lifecycle.
I've talked a little bit about the life cycle.

50
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.790
We're going to talk a lot about the life cycle and just a few minutes,

51
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.180
but is it possible to make something that's benign or therapeutic and

52
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:26.020
beneficial,
a product

53
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.610
that is made in an absolutely agregious manufacturing process?

54
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.903
Is that possible?

55
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.070
<v 0>Does anybody want to remind me about pharmaceuticals?</v>

57
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.110
How much waste per pound of product on average for pharmaceuticals,

58
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.670
one ton of waste per pound of product produced on average across the life cycle.

59
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.260
Okay.
Uh,
you'll see different numbers.

60
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.110
Different numbers is because you're going to get variability from drug to drug.

61
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.090
But the variability is also because

62
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.010
if you measure across the lifecycle from the origins of the feedstock for the

63
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.830
under the product,
that could be very different if you say,
oh,

64
00:04:12.831 --> 00:04:17.120
well we're measuring from gate to gate when you only what's happening within our

65
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:20.300
manufacturing facility.
So you'll see different numbers,

66
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:25.010
but a ton of ton of waste per pound product is a good general general measure.

67
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.890
Hold it.
That could be a lifesaving drug.
Yeah,

68
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:32.210
but you made it in a way that was tremendously polluting.

69
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.380
What about the opposite?

70
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.830
Can you have a tremendously efficient a manufacturing process but brings about,

71
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.270
um,
uh,
um,

72
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.960
acutely lethal product?
Sure.

73
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.380
Absolutely.
The synthesis of mustard gas,

74
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.340
one of the horrible nerve agents have a worldwide one is one of the most

75
00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:03.290
perfectly efficient chemical syntheses manufacturing process that you could

76
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.124
imagine.
That's,

77
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.330
you could argue that it's about as close to zero waste as many of our

78
00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:13.230
manufacturing processes get.
Okay.
So in need to look across the life cycle.

79
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:18.231
So we're talking about products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use

80
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.150
and generation.
Okay.
So can you reduce waste

81
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.730
with green chemistry?
Absolutely.
Right.

82
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.930
Can you make a process more efficient using green chemistry?
Absolutely.

83
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.030
Is that where it ends?
Absolutely not.
Again.
