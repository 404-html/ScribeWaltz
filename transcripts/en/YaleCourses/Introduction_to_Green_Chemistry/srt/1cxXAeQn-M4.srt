1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,240
So these are the 12, 12 principles. And
I should say that the 12 principles, um,

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,130
like any principles of
framework aren't, um, you know,

3
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,760
don't come from on high on
stone tablets or anything else.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,980
Frameworks are thrown out into the
scientific community to be beaten up and

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,760
who'd be ripped apart and put
back together and, and uh,

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,800
and to see if they have any
utility or any value. Uh,

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:36,540
and what is useful about
these is that they're,

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,810
they've been around for coming on 20
years out there with lots of a discussion

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,320
and they are at this
point, widely used. Uh,

10
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:53,100
and we can talk a lot more about this,
but let's talk about principal one.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,750
It's better to prevent waste than to
treat or cleanup waste after it's formed.

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,650
So the reason that it's necessary to
state this is cause the entire history of

13
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:07,170
environmental protection has been then,
you know,

14
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:10,770
you're just treat a controlling waste
and all well with the world. Okay.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,960
So that has been the whole,

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,820
whole industries have sprouted up to
clean up after wasteful manufacturing

17
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:22,410
processes. Waste will end
of life. Uh, but there's,

18
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,190
there's an inherent problem with
the create and cleanup waste

19
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,570
issue and one has to do with
the laws of thermodynamics.

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,770
Okay. So we talked about, well,

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,380
we'll make sure that if, uh,
there, we'll close our, our loops.

22
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:50,910
There won't be any emissions, there
won't be any, uh, exposure to people, uh,

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,890
workers, consumers, there won't be any
exposure, uh, to the air, to the water.

24
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,210
These loops stay closed based on
thermodynamics right up until they don't,

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,710
and they dissipate.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,240
And when we're talking about
substances that persist,

27
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,650
that bioaccumulate the build up into our
bodies and the biosphere, the idea of,

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,400
well, it's okay if we can create
it, we'll just clean it up.

29
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,870
Becomes, um, an experiment
that we've run for many,

30
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:25,410
many decades and shown that it
doesn't, uh, it doesn't work

31
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,330
and I'm close to anything I say.
Please feel free to challenge.

32
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,510
But the other issue is that,

33
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,510
does it cost money to
treat or clean up waste?

34
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,370
It has a cost energy. Do you have to
expend energy to separate the waste,

35
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:48,060
to clean it, to treat it? And it,
does it add performance to a product?

36
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,500
Does it add efficiency to
a manufacturing scheme?

37
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,860
Why have we thought that environmental
issues cost a lot of money for decades?

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,680
Because this has largely been
the approach that we've used.

39
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,090
Our approach to dealing with these issues
has largely men that you were going to

40
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:12,091
have a significant expenditure principle
to synthetic methods should be designed

41
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,900
to maximize the incorporation
of all materials use, uh,

42
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,390
now that are used into the final product.
Basically,

43
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,490
if you're going to put an atom in,

44
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,640
you want it to wind up in your product
and not into your waste stream,

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,800
it's concept called Adam economy.

46
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,570
We're going to talk a lot about
it and we're going to, uh,

47
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,880
be able to actually measure what's the
Adam Economy of these transformations.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,300
Principle three,
Rev.

49
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,700
A practical synthetic methods should be
designed to use in generate substances

50
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,240
to possess little or no toxicity to
human health and the environment.

51
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,620
So we captured this.

52
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,830
So you want to use whether it's
your reagents, you're feedstocks,

53
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,750
um,
um,

54
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,560
and all of these transformations that
possessed little or no toxicity to human

55
00:03:56,561 --> 00:04:00,160
health and the environment and toxicity
really is probably better understood as

56
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:01,300
hazard.
Well,

57
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:06,301
more generally principle for the
products chemical come products should be

58
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:09,310
designed to preserve efficacy of function.

59
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,070
So not that you have a very
nice soap, that's, that,

60
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,670
that, uh, doesn't have any toxicity,
but it doesn't work as a self preserve.

61
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:23,350
The efficacy of function
while minimizing toxicity.

62
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,310
Okay, this is going to be a
large section of this class.

63
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,650
When we started talking
about molecular design,

64
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:32,680
we start talking about hazard reduction.
This is what we're talking about

65
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,670
on ciliary substances.

66
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,390
There's a whole lot of things
that go into manufacturing.

67
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,530
There are solvents there. Our
separation agents, there's,

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,890
there's energy that's put in, uh, to, uh,

69
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,740
to bring about separations
that we'll talk a lot about.

70
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,250
And these can make up a huge percentage
of the waste stream and pharmaceuticals.

71
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,970
It's estimated that 80% of the waste
are the solvents that are used and the

72
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:09,100
manufacturing process. So we kind
of underestimate this so that they,

73
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,990
there are ways to not only come up with
alternative solvents and other exonerees

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,650
that are less toxic, but also ways
to eliminate them. Completely.

75
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,380
Principles six energy,

76
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,990
energy and the nature of its energy
needs to be understood how much embedded

77
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,480
energy is going into the
harvesting or mining. How much, uh,

78
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,660
how much energy is going into the,
the manufacturer, the separations,

79
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,320
the isolation, the purification, and the
nature of that energy. Is it renewable?

80
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,550
Is it a, is it fossil? Is a
depleting principle seven,

81
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,220
a raw material.
This is our feedstocks question.

82
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,660
Should be renewable rather than
depleting wherever the technically and

83
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,580
economically practical, renewable,
renewable, and what kind of timeframe

84
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,590
oils, renewable, they just a few million
years. So not on a geologic timeframe.

85
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,930
We're talking about a human timescale.
If you're,

86
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,650
if you're not able to renew this
on, uh, your, your materials, uh,

87
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,390
on a time frame in there, your
definitionally depleting principle eight,

88
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,620
this is more subtle.
It's, uh, actually, uh,

89
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,080
an order to get from a to B.

90
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,050
Many times you have to go through a
double prime, a prime, a double prime,

91
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:26,960
a tip triple prime,
and you transform it on your way to to be.

92
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,520
That has been the way for a hundred
years coming up with ways of instead of

93
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,190
going through all of those other
steps that generate all kinds of ways,

94
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
he was all kinds of material.

95
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,040
Instead come up with ways
that we can eliminate these,

96
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,130
these steps catachesis we are going to
devote whole focus to Catalin [inaudible]

97
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,370
we'll be discussing what ketalysis is
and the spoiler alert catachesis allows

98
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,980
you to make product with less energy,
less material,

99
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,030
less waste. And there's not a
petrochemical, pharmaceuticals,

100
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,360
specialty chemical company that would
be in business today without it.

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,890
Principle 10 products should be
designed so the end of their function,

102
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,550
they do not persist in the environment
and they break down into unoccupied

103
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,140
degradation products. I
didn't say bio degradation,
products, degradation products.

104
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,100
This definition leaves open
that you want to have, you know,

105
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,240
both natural degradation as
well as trigger degradation
so that you can break it

106
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:35,810
down into building blocks that can
be used for other upcycling purposes.

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,350
So there are ways to break down plastics.
For instance,

108
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,660
Donna to the basic
building block monomers,

109
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,170
so that's going to use him as
virgin plastic. Once again, uh,

110
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,770
investigating what this means so that
they don't last forever or build up in our

111
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:52,730
bodies of the biosphere.

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Analytical methodologies
should be developed so that
we can test in real time in

113
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:04,880
process, in field rather than
as has been done for so long.

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,190
After you create the, the contamination
or after you've generated the waste,

115
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,910
you then measure it and say, oops,
look what we have to deal with now.

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,340
Realtime analysis and then principal
12 substances and the form of these

117
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:21,360
substances,
uh,

118
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
should be used to minimize the potential
for chemical accidents, including fires,

119
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:26,834
explosions,

120
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,710
or at least as you don't want to have
pollution prevention and accident

121
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,800
prevention working at opposite goals.

122
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,500
You have to align these so
that accident prevention,

123
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,120
and there are inherent ways that
you can engage in chemical safety.
