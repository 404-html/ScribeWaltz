1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,310
A key concept in this course,
we'll be lifecycle.

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,130
So these are the different lifecycle
stages, material extraction,

3
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,880
material processing, manufacturing use,
and we'll call it waste management.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,980
Ideally, we'll, we'll talk about ways
of, we're not talking about end of life,

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,380
but rather closing loops.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,460
Why is life cycle thinking going
to be absolutely essential to, uh,

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,110
uh, green chemistry discussion
as sustainability discussion?

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,240
Let's go through it. Uh, so,

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,560
oh, when we look at the
origins of our feedstocks,

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,630
it would be very possible to
produce a product that is nontoxic,

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,990
affective, performs great. You
know, a little kid could chew on it,

12
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,883
no problem,

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,700
but yet do it in a way that results
in dramatic ecological damage.

14
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,920
But you might say that that's a,
that's a rarity right now.

15
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,680
That's pretty much the little,
the rule of the road.

16
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:22,480
What did we say about the amount
of, uh, uh, of waste generated per,

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,830
uh, per pound of product
for manufacturing generally?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,833
Yeah,

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,510
so we're talking about 90% of all of the
material that goes into manufacturing

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,520
winds up immediately. His waste. And
it's the character, not the amount,

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,230
the character, the nature of the
inherent nature of those materials.

22
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:48,730
That is crucial. Important. Is
it to pleading? Is it renewable?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,930
Is it inherently toxic?
All right,

24
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:57,010
so we know what manufacturing is, is a
conversion of raw materials into products.

25
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,370
It's like in the design and
the production of goods and

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,520
manufacturing needs to add value in
order for it to be really considered

27
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:07,354
manufacturing.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,970
Although there are a lot of businesses
that it's very questionable. Um,

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,140
so is manufacturing important?

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,370
These are the different industry sectors
and this is the a billion tons of waste.

31
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,070
Waste generated manufacturing waste
are significant to say the least.

32
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,870
When you take a look at the annual
waste generator, this is a EU data. Uh,

33
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,860
uh, manufacturing wastes
are, are significant,

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,650
but these other, uh, Eric,

35
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,720
now a quicker side energy production,
very little waste,

36
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,340
1%. What does that mean? It means,

37
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,020
and we'll talk about this,

38
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
that the petrochemical industry is
one of the most materially efficient

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,690
industries that the world has ever seen.
Almost.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,360
If you only got a 99% efficiency for
many of the petrochemical processes,

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,060
you'd be fired. You'd be shut
down. It'd be out of business.

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,840
The degree to which they are
so excellent at efficiency,

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,560
we can say, oh, well good then
that, then that's perfect.

44
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,750
That's why we talk about life cycle,
because it's not all about efficiency.

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,830
It's not all about one life cycle stage.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,790
Okay. What about the use
phase? They say, Oh, I'm,

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,620
I meet a washing machine
and I made it from a,

48
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,150
from a new Birol renewable resin and I,

49
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,030
and I'm going to recycle the whole thing.
Where's the impact?

50
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,200
Was the environmental impact,
uh, of a, of a washing machine.

51
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,060
It's in the use phase,

52
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,690
the energy consumed in the use and the
water consumed in the US, et Cetera,

53
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,290
et cetera. Uh, what about, um,

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,713
is important.

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,830
Think about those products
where they use is of necessity.

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Dissipative remember I laws of
thermodynamics chlorofluorocarbons,

57
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,320
whether it's in sprays or, or
whatever it is, propellant.

58
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,350
These lined up in the ozone layer.
Solvents,

59
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:26,030
wide range of solvents are
amongst the highest, uh,

60
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,380
emissions, air emission, uh,
chemicals known coolin's.

61
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Pesticides and fertilizers necessarily
have to be distributed in the environment

62
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,750
to function.
It's why they wind up in our groundwater.

63
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,030
It's why they wind up in our drinking
water. Okay. Is End of life important?

64
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,230
Yeah. It kind of speaks
for itself, I guess. Yeah.

65
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:52,430
That's the base camp of the handle.
A's. But you want to go for a track?

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,583
All right.

67
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,050
Okay.
So we need to have lifecycle thinking.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,120
This is not a life cycle analysis class.

69
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,470
We're not going to do a rigorous
lifecycle analysis, lagers,

70
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,600
rigorous lifecycle assessment. However,
if we don't think across lifecycle,

71
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,720
then we will do exactly the wrong things
by shifting the problem from one life.

72
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,890
So Lycos lifecycle stage to another,
and you will know where to find them.

73
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,730
That is so often the
essence of greenwashing.
