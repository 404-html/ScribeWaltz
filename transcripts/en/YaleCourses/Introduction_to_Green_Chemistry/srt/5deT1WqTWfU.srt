1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:06,760
Why do green chemistry, why
do green chemistry? You know,

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,610
it's not my job. You know, I like to
talk about the chef. This is the meals.

3
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:14,270
I make a delicious,
sure they are poisonous,

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,520
but there are other shuts
working on nonlethal

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,483
cook,

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,350
the architect that says the homes I
build on luxurious and beautiful. Yes,

7
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:28,960
they collapse and kill
people on a regular basis.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,350
But there are other people working
on safe house. The car designer,

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,060
it says, I build cars that are
fast, powerful, beautiful. Yes,

10
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,820
they fall apart unexpectedly
when people die.

11
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,490
But there are other designers
working on sustainable cars.

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,220
Okay.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,053
And then the chemist.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,090
I've developed some of
the best methodologies and
processes from making hundreds

15
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:55,870
of target molecules, target molecules
that are improving the world.

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,900
Sure they harm humans and the environment.

17
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,900
But there are other chemists
working on green chemistry

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,380
for the same reason that the
first three examples were absurd.

19
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,440
This is absurd.

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,310
And yet throughout the
history of chemistry,

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,720
and sadly even in large swaths today,

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,080
this is not considered absurd.

23
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,710
This is considered the orthodoxy
that green chemistry is not my job.

24
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,850
It's somebody else's job.
Somebody else has to worry about it.

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,030
I'm just doing research.
I'm just making this widget.

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,620
I'm just making this shampoo. I'm
somebody else. The engineer's,

27
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:46,570
we'll clean up the, uh, uh, the
waste, et Cetera, et cetera.

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,110
And what we understand now is that we
can have the building blocks of chemistry

29
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:58,120
of the economy that doesn't have to
have these unintended consequences.
