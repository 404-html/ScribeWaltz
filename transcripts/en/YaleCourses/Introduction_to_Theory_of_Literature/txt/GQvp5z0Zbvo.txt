Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, I'd like to begin by pointing out that the first name of Frederic Jameson is spelled f. R. E. D. R. I. C. Uh, there isn't, I point that out is that, uh, most scholars don't seem to be able to grasp that simple fact, uh, and that references to him, which are rife in the critical literature. Uh, perhaps one third of the time spell his first name wrong. So I thought it would be important for you to be among the cornea shanti. Uh, and to know that it is spelled in the way that I just mentioned. It's a strange thing. Um, when I started teaching, I taught many, many, many sections of English one 29, uh, and of course in the second semester, the first text that we read was the Iliad. Now ill, it is spelled I l. I a. D. Why it is that of the student population I taught over all those years, hundreds and hundreds of students, fully.

Speaker 1:          01:02          A third of them spelled it I, l. L. I. A. D I really couldn't say, but there are words that simply seem to be in susceptible of being spelled correctly. And one, and one of those words is the first name of Frederic Jameson. So, um, stand advised. Uh, okay. Now, um, last time I talked about four possible options of an aesthetic nature, uh, for a Marxist approach to literature and passed them in review, a imagined realism, both realism according to the tastes and theoretical preferences of angles and Luke couch also tendentious realism, uh, as it pervaded, uh, the Soviet world, especially after 1934 a then also part of the participatory aesthetic of figures like Vaulter Benyamin, the high modernist aesthetic of the whole, uh, embraced particularly by Adorno. Those are the two, uh, aesthetic modes that we passed in review last time. Uh, and finally, the idea that realism being somehow out worn, uh, having a developed hardening of the arteries as a kind of a bourgeois perspective on things, uh, needs somehow or another to be replaced as theoretically, uh, in the Marxists do things by something else.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Uh, and perhaps the most eloquent proponent of replacing it with something, uh, is Jameson, who earlier in the introductory chapter of the political unconscious, uh, much of which you've been assigned for today. Uh, writes a section which he calls magical narratives, uh, and which, uh, uh, promotes, um, very much in keeping with the thinking of Northrop Frye about the role of romance in society, particularly the religious role of romance in society, uh, proposes that and aesthetic of the romance, which entails a folklore, the folk tale, the fairy tale, uh, various forms of folk expression as magical resolution of conflicts that can't otherwise be resolved, uh, is the more appropriate aesthetic to take up. And the long passage that I sent to you last night, which I'd like quickly to go over, um, is, uh, meant to further the promotion of, of this aesthetic and also, uh, to pose for us a critique of what the consequences would be of lingering with a realist aesthetic.

Speaker 1:          03:54          And so Jameson says, second passage on your sheet, let Scott Balzac and Dreiser serve as the, and remember that Balzac is the favorite author of angles and Scott is the favorite author of at least in 1927 of Lucaj, uh, and drives her is a figure from the so-called naturalist movement, the American novelist, uh, who, uh, is a very appropriate addition to the list. And so it's in that context that, uh, that Jameson is dropping these particular names. Let Scott Balzac and Dreiser serve as the non chronological markers of the emergence of realism in its modern form. These first great realism's are characterized by a fundamental and exhilarating heterogeneity in their raw materials and by a corresponding versatility in their narrative apparatus at such moments, a generic confinement to the existence. In other words, the only thing you have to do if you're a realist is talk about things the way they really are.

Speaker 1:          04:56          Uh, at such moments, a generic confinement to the existent has a paradoxically liberating effect on the registers of the text and releases a set of heterogeneous historical perspectives. The past for Scott, the future for Balzac. And the process of commodification for Dreiser normally felt to be inconsistent with a focus on the historical present. In other words, Scott's treatment of history is dialectical against the foil of the present. There is a envisioned, a kind of romanticized feudal, um, uh, evocation of a feudal past. Uh, and so it is in turn. I don't want to linger long over this with the other writers, uh, normally felt to be inconsistent with a focus on historical presence. Indeed, this multiple temporality tends to be sealed off and really contained again in high realism and naturalism. In other words, it starts getting too easy. And the formulas of representing and evoking the real began to become, as I said, sclerotic, very begin.

Speaker 1:          06:01          They begin to harden. They'd begin to confine us in ways, uh, that had hitherto been liberating where a perfected narrative apparatus in particular, the threefold imperatives of authorial depersonalization. That is to say the voice in steel and direct labor ally to write, uh, uh, indirect discourse, uh, authorial depersonalization, unity of point of view and restriction to scenic representation begin to confer on the realistic option, the appearance of an US fixating self-imposed pennants. And other words. This is all I can say, and this is the only way I can say it. There are no other possibilities, uh, of literary expression because I now feel confined to this, uh, to this reification of the reel. This insistence that, uh, the real, um, the evocation of the reel is my only literary option. Uh, and so it's no longer liberating. Uh, it is in the context of this gradual reification in late capitalism that the romance once again comes to be felt as the place of narrative heterogeneity and freedom from the reality principle.

Speaker 1:          07:18          And that is, uh, in a way of jab at Freud, uh, but at the same time and acknowledgement that Freud, uh, participates in a sort of growing despair over the necessity of confining oneself to the real, um, the, and freedom from the reality principle to which a now oppressive, realistic representation is the hostage. Okay. So that's the aesthetic of Frederic Jameson. And before we begin and analysis, that is to say, before we begin to consider his three horizons or concentric circles of interpretation from other points of view, I thought it would be interesting to find this romance aesthetic in those three levels. We're talking of course about the political, the social, the historical, the political, uh, the kind of chronicle, like as he puts it, a record of successive, uh, happen happenings, ineffective context as a constructed it as a plot by some individual voice, the social as the conflict or emergence into, uh, our awareness of its being a conflict of what Jameson calls ideology teams.

Speaker 1:          08:41          That is to say ways of thinking about the world as expressed by disparate and conflicting classes. And then finally the historical, which Jameson calls necessity. At the end of the essay he says it's what hurts. Ah, but which in terms of literary analysis as we'll see has to do with understanding the overlap of the succession of modes of production as they unfold in historical time. And we'll have more to say about modes of production, but our basic three horizons then, uh, which are in which I'm now going to look for the romance aesthetic. Our basic three horizons then are what Jameson calls the political, the social and the historical. It's, it's important that he does sometimes call them concentric circles because you have to understand that as you advance through the three stages, you're not leaving anything behind. The historical is contained within the social and the social is contained within, I'm sorry, the political is contained within the social and the social is contained within the historical and all of that is what we is not to be left behind but is rather to be rethought.

Speaker 1:          10:06          Reconsidered Jameson sometimes use the word rewritten, a thinking of the text that want, that is the object of one study. Uh, as one advances through these three stages. So that's why, that's why he thinks it appropriate to call them concentric circles. Well, in any case, so what is the political, the essential political, uh, moment of the creative act? Well, it's what Jameson borrowing from Kenneth Burke calls the symbolic act. As an individual writer, I undertake to resolve symbolically a contradiction. And Marxism is always about contradiction. That is to say the way in which the way in which the perspective of any class, uh, exists in country in a contradictory relation, both with its own needs and desires and with other classes. In any case, then the symbolic act at the political level is designed to resolve a contradiction that can't be resolved by other means. In other words, it's a fantasy.

Speaker 1:          11:19          It is the fairy tale. It is the princess and the pauper. It is the arbitrary happy ending tacked onto a situation for which in reality there would be no happy ending. In other words, it is a romance perspective about a world, the re the realistic approach to which, um, uh, would somehow or another leave us feeling much more confined. Slumdog millionaire, uh, is an interesting example. Uh, it's an old tourists film made by Danny Boyle. Uh, an interesting example of an individual act which magically resolves a contradiction through the whole Bollywood apparatus that it brings to bear on it. And the contradictions of course, are rife between his Hindu and Muslim. The contradictions entailed and globalization, the contradictions of cast. All of these contradictions not to be resolved on a realistic plane, nevertheless, can be resolved by an individual symbolic act. You hit the lotto, you know, you win, uh, against all odds.

Speaker 1:          12:33          A prize that makes you a millionaire who wants to be a millionaire? Have we all want to be millionaires, but only one of us, the miraculously, magically, uh, through a series of completely implausible happen happenstances is able to do so. Now notice this. It's not that it doesn't happen. People do hit the lotto. People do when the $64 thousand thousand dollar question of whatever. It's not that, it's not that it's absolute never, never land. But the point is, and, and I think this is really ultimately the point of that extravagant dance and the railroad station. At the end of the film, the point, the point is that even were to happen in reality, it wouldn't resolve contradictions. That is to say your life would not have the kind of scripted perfection. You get the girl, everything is going to be perfect. The whole world falls in line dancing behind you.

Speaker 1:          13:37          You know, this just this, this just doesn't happen. In other words, it's sort of tragic to hit the lotto. As many stories of that kind have made clear to us and that it seems to me is finally how the film is somewhat self conscious about its nature as a symbolic act in any way. That's the romance element of the political level of interpretation as understood by Jameson. Now the second level brings to the surface the element of subversion that has to be entailed in this same fairy tale resolution of a conflict that can't otherwise be resolved. There are all sorts of other aspects at the second level, but remember I'm discovering the romance aesthetic here in all three levels before turning to other matters having to do them. So let's say, I mean at the second level, on page 12, 97, uh, the right hand column, um, you have, um, uh, aunts blocks understanding of the fairytale.

Speaker 1:          14:51          This is at the second level by about two thirds of the way down. Thus, for instance, blocks reading of the fairytale with its magical wish fulfillments and it's utopian fantasies of plenty and the pay to you restores the dialogical and the Big Rock Candy Mountain, basically as the paid Corecon restores the dialogical and antagonistic content of this form by exhibiting it as a systematic deconstruction and undermining of the hedge demonic aristocratic form of the epic. In other words, it's not just a symbolic act, the fairy tale. It is a thumbing of the nose at hedge emoney. It is in other words and act of antagonism, which of course recognizes the impossibility of resolution or reconciliation precisely in its register of antagonism. So that at the second level, the social level in which the ideological voices of various glasses and perspective are openly in conflict. You don't get resolution once you get is subversion and reaction.

Speaker 1:          16:06          You get, in other words, a tension of voices that is not meant to resolve anything but as rather meant to lay bare the conflicts that are entailed. And still, however, in doing this, you get the kind of the, the, the kind of of, uh, carnivalesque uprising from below, which a Jameson associates with romance that letting off of steam, that, uh, uh, entertaining the possibility of utopia that you get, for example, in the early modern period on that day, which is called, uh, in which someone is called the Lord of Misrule. And the entire social order for one day is inverted, uh, and the low are elevated to a positions of authority. Uh, and for one day, uh, you get the keys to the castle and effect. This is a day in which conflict is expressed and not resolved because everybody knows that tomorrow it's going to be the same old, same old, uh, and back to business as usual.

Speaker 1:          17:21          And so, but the romance element, the idea that the idea that the, that folk expression is simultaneously the expression of a wish, a wish, similar to the wish that's expressed at the first political level, but, but, but, but the expression of a wish, which is collective, that is to say in behalf of a class and a perspective and which is also with great consciousness, not aware that can in any way expect to be fulfilled, but rather one that has used subversively with respect to the dominant ideology. Uh, that it, it, it, it, it, it expresses its abrasiveness. A tort third level involves the way in which, uh, there is at any given time, the historical level, a dominant mode of production. Emotive production is a system is a system of thought or production, uh, generated by a, an overarching social or economic arrangement. Uh, Jameson lists them in his text.

Speaker 1:          18:37          Uh, and we'll come back to them. Uh, and we'll read that listing and we'll think about those terms. The Jameson gives an excellent example of the way in which in the latter part of the 18th century, the enlightenment began to be the dominant form of expression. All of an emergent Merkin toll successfully capitalist bourgeoisie. That is to say the values that drove, uh, uh, the development of industrialization and capital were those values emerging from feudal, uh, and aristocratic ideals, less realistic, less engaged with actuality, and the way in which you can actually get things done in the world. Uh, the enlightenment is understood as an expression of an emerging new mode of production. Capitalism, Asic succeeds feudalism, but Jameson points out and here's where romance comes in. And then after that we'll move on to our next point. But Jameson points out at the same time you get enlightenment at the same time that that does seem to become the dominant form of expression.

Speaker 1:          19:55          You also get two modes of resistance or contest station. On the one hand, you have romanticism, which can be understood in this context as a kind of atavistic throwback to aristocratic and futile idealism, codes of conduct, beliefs, uh, uh, visions of Utopia, uh, within romanticism. All of them sort of trying to re code, uh, in an age of enlightenment, um, various sorts of idealism that had come to seem outmoded. So that's a kind of of, uh, as it were, reactionary mode of production overlapping with or expressing itself through, uh, the dominant one. And then at the same time you get folk resistance to the mechanization of the enlightenment with political economy and with the rise of social engineering, uh, and with the various forms of, of, of social organization associated with utilitarian. With utilitarianism, you get, uh, you get folk resistance, you get popular resistance in the forms of protest frame breaking, a disruption of labor activity, uh, protest against industrialization, all of which also because it insists on earlier forms of agricultural and industrial sort of cottage industry.

Speaker 1:          21:27          And it's on all of which is also atavistic. Also a throwback to the way in which labor is performed or conducted, a under feudalism. And so that to, uh, in the form of folk expression of longing for, in this case a utopian past, more agrarian, more individualized, as, as a mode of labor, more cottage or added in all of this, you get, um, uh, an overlapping mode of production. So the tension among modes of production, which is the focus of analysis at the historical level, the third historical level can also be understood in terms of the romance of Utopian Nostalgia. All right, so that then just to show how Jameson's aesthetic, his sense of the importance of romance can be seen to pervade the way in which he understands analysis at all three of these levels. So that's his aesthetic question then, is what is the interpretive payoff of undertaking literary analysis at these three levels?

Speaker 1:          22:45          That is to say, why should we, why should we take the trouble to do it? What's so interesting about it? Well, from Jameson's point of view, this of course is the title of his book. Each of these three modes of analysis, uh, is designed to disclose, to uncover, to lay bare and element of the political unconscious. As for deconstruction. As for Freud, this sense of a political unconscious exposes, reveals something that is antithetical to ordinary consciousness. That is to say, uh, undermines the, our conventional understanding of things shows us that beneath our conventional understanding of things, there are laws and causes and dynamics at work, uh, that we need to understand. Uh, in this case, however, the unconscious and question is not a linguistic unconscious. It is not a psychological unconscious. It is a political unconscious in so far. In other words, as we are political animals, the acts that we perform, the dialogues that we engage in, the modes of production that we participate in, all of them have political ramifications.

Speaker 1:          24:10          That is to say, we w we, we do what we do as opposed to doing other things for political reasons of which we may not be fully aware. Hence the emphasis in analysis of this kind on the political unconscious. So again, the three levels, going back to the idea of the symbolic act, what political unconscious in other words, is revealed by a, by a symbolic act? Well, Jameson gives a wonderful example taken from structuralism and he, and you can see that he leans very heavily on structuralism for his understanding, uh, of the way in which of the way in which something is going on in a narrative form of which it is not immediately apparent that anybody can be aware. Take for example, [inaudible] face painting. Why Levy Strauss asks both in the savage mind and again, in Trieste stroke peak, why the excessive complexity of these paintings, why the curious tension in the marks on the faces between the vertical and the horizontal?

Speaker 1:          25:27          Why is, you know, why, in other words, do you get a kind of, have a feeling of tension, aesthetic beauty, but also of, of, of, of tension and complication in this cross hatching, in the sense of the relation between the vertical and the horizontal Jameson's argument, which he brings out more clearly than Levy Strauss. But Levy Strauss says the same thing. A contrasting the Caddo video in this respect that with neighboring tribes like the Bharara, the explanation is that the category are a hierarchical society, uh, in which there are open and obvious forms of inequality that one must perforce be aware of as a member of the tribe, but that neighboring tribes, and this is something that probably the tribe itself can observe, work out a way of seeming to resolve the contradictions and to inherent in hierarchy by the exchange of loyalty, moieties of or which is to say, of, of, of kinship gifts and wedding gifts and so on.

Speaker 1:          26:35          Uh, that, uh, that Levy Strauss talks about and this exchange of mortise seems to impose on these social orders in real life, in real terms, a way of making society more equal than it might otherwise be. Yes, it's still hierarchical, but at the same time, wealth is distributed. Each person has his own form of asserting dignity and Zoe on the cat Aveo doesn't have this Levy Strauss's and Jameson's boy is that the [inaudible] never really worked that out so that they're stuck with a simple form of hierarchical organization face painting. Then according to Levy Strauss followed by Janssen is their way of symbolically resolving the problem by introducing the horizontal, by introducing, in other words, the ways in which other tribes have successfully offset hierarchy by ways of distributing wealth more equally deep wealth and prestige more equally and that the symbolic act which other tribes were able to accomplish in real life in real terms, the Caddo Aveo Express, I accomplish individually each individual woman painting her face as a symbolic act, a symbolic act expressing the political unconscious because this is not an act we suppose of which any individual is aware.

Speaker 1:          28:11          I mean you can the unawareness, the lack of consciousness of what's going on and a story is much more readily available to us in the Oedipus myth because that's the part of Levy Strauss is a structural study of myth. We happy it happened to have read. The next part is category or basement, but the structure and the Structural Study of Myth Levy Strauss begins by talking about the Oedipus might as well. The whole point of that is cheap. There's a terrible contradiction born from two or born from one plainly, no individual version of the story, certainly not Sophocles version is sang to itself. Oh, this is a terrible contradiction. I don't know whether I'm born for two people or born from one person. That's, that is the unconscious. In other words of the story which is brought out, brought to the surface by a structuralist analysis of the meth. Jameson doesn't talk about it because it's not in any obvious and immediate way a political problem or a problem susceptible of Marxist analysis.

Speaker 1:          29:16          It is perhaps ultimately everything is, but, uh, not immediately. And so he turns instead to a discussion of the cat countervail myth, um, which has as it's unconscious and issue, that's obviously a political one, but it is nevertheless the case that a structural analysis of a symbolic act is designed to and will inevitably reveal an element of unconscious thought, political or otherwise. And that then is the way in which the political unconscious as Jameson describes it, is brought out at the first political level of understanding, uh, the individual symbolic act, not the second level, the social in which the text as Jameson says, rewrites itself, not as an individual act, but as very much in the spirit of buck teen, um, a Hetero Glossop expression of voices of points of view writing themselves as it were through the text there, the political unconscious in question, um, is something that, uh, it has to be understood in terms of ideology means in other words, people reflexively xpress perhaps unbeknownst to themselves, views and opinions which are intelligible, not arising out of their individuality, not because they are who they are as they themselves might say, but rather because of their economic class and prestige status.

Speaker 1:          30:55          In other words, because of their place in the world, it follows that they will hold certain views, they will be the mouthpieces, in other words, for certain ideology, genes and those ideologies. Uh, Jameson understands, uh, to be at least in part unconscious one doesn't know. And other words that the opinions one so fervently expresses. And so devoutly believes in our opinions conditioned by the social circumstances in which one finds oneself. So that literature then becomes a kind of drama of ideology, means a representation of unresolved conflict, uh, sort of manifest in the variety of class, uh, or status voices, uh, brought to bear. And you can see this is the point at which, uh, Jameson's work is closest to Bach teens and most and most clearly reflects some of the preoccupations of Bactine as, as we've encountered them already. Jameson gives a very good example of the way in which this conflict works because it's a at par part of the mystery of these clashes as that they are always present as is, that they always present themselves with a sh within a shared code.

Speaker 1:          32:18          This already begins to look forward to the idea of the mode of production. Uh, at the bottom of page 12, 96, Jameson who was talking about the grit, the violent religious controversies of the 17th century in England, uh, between cavalier and roundhead, between, uh, all the controversies surrounding, uh, the, uh, interregnum of Commonweal, uh, the restoration of Charles the second, uh, and the tremendous ferment religion, largely religious ferment, uh, taking place during those periods during that period. But this ferment for any Marxist and Christopher Hill is the leading historian writing about this period who has made, made it most clearly a intelligible in these terms. Uh, for any Marxist. These, this conflict has an underlying political unconscious that is its ultimate motives are and assertion of rights, uh, and, uh, an expression of class views. This is the way James and puts it bottom of page 1296.

Speaker 1:          33:25          The normal form of the dialogical is essentially an antagonistic one. He's referees at alluding here to Bactine for whom frequently the dialogical is simply a kind of a happy cacophony of voices, a carnivalesque, uh, expression of chaos from below, all of which is a kind of yeast like ferment. Um, and somehow or another, and the long run, uh, energizing, uh, and socially progressive, uh, but Jameson points up that dial that the dialogue them is, is, is very often a expressive of conflict as well and antagonistic one. And that the dialogue of class struggle is one in which two opposing discourses fight it out within the general unity of a shared code. Thus, for instance, the shared master code of religion becomes, and the 1640s in England, the place in which the dominant formulations of a hedge demonic theology are reappropriated and polemically modified. In other words, the Church of England stands for as, and this is the word that was used as stablish meant roundhead points of view.

Speaker 1:          34:39          Various forms of puritanism and other forms of religious rebellion are anti establishment. And yet they are all coded within the sort of discourse of the Christian religion. That is to say they have to fight it out on a common battlefield. And that's the way it is with conflict of this kind. Maybe a contemporary example, uh, would be not so much in the sphere of religion as well today. One could could speak again, uh, of religion. But, uh, in the sixties and seventies, it was maybe more a question of ethics. Think for example of the sexual revolution, the ECOM, you know, again, there's a common ground, you know, a sense of the central reality of sexual conduct to human life. But there are, but, but what you get in the, not so much, perhaps conflict of classes is conflict of generations. In this case, what you get in conflict of generations is an inversion of values.

Speaker 1:          35:41          Not a new set of values. Exactly. But a simple trans valuation of what exists. Everything that one faction considers bad, uh, another faction, trans values, and considered as good. The various, the, the, the, the, the very thing against which one is worn is the thing that one rushes to embrace and so on. So once again, you get a clash and unresolved clash, but a class that arises from and participates in the semiotic structure of a common code, right? And that's the way in which social antagonism expresses itself, uh, at the second level. Uh, and it usually involves because there isn't, there are underlying interests, uh, elements of the political unconscious brings to the surface elements of the political unconscious. Finally, at the third level, what comes out, what is made manifest is the tension or clash among modes of production as they jostle each other.

Speaker 1:          36:53          Historically, it's understood that the danger as Jameson puts it of thinking in terms of a succession of modes of production is that each one of those modes of production might see like a synchronic moment. In other words, if you're in capitalism, you might get lulled into thinking that no other motive production is available. If you're in patriarchy, you might get lulled into thinking that no other mode of production is available. And yet as Jameson points out, the tension between, uh, between corporate hierarchy and patriarchal hierarchy, the tension, in other words, which, uh, very often drives a wedge, has driven a wedge in polemic between Marxist and feminist points of view, uh, is a reflection of the coexistence of modes of production from completely different areas. One contemporary one completely, uh, uh, it's at least insofar as it was the dominant a thing of the past and yet presenting, uh, and still, uh, overlapping with a mode of production that is contemporary.

Speaker 1:          38:08          So all of that, uh, is, is sort of, is, is simply a matter of historical fact. But in literary analysis and literary analysis, um, you begin, you begin to think of it in more formal terms and you see, uh, for example, uh, the very choice of verse form, and I'm, I'm taking as an example, uh, uh, Shelly's famous poem, the Ode to the West Wind. You see the very choice of verse form as an instance of what Jameson calls the ideology of form and can under can be understood in terms of the conflict of mode of production. The verse form of Shelley's Ode to the West Wind is simultaneously, it has five stroll fees and each stroke fee is exactly the same informed it is simultaneously a sonnet. And the first 12 lines of which concluding in a couple of, uh, a succession of Teradata [inaudible]. Now these two forms brought together synthesize as a single stroller fiqh forum in Shelly are coated and entirely different ways.

Speaker 1:          39:25          Each aspect of them has an ideology. Terrizi rema is coated prophecy because it is in the tradition of Dante. It's the verse form in which the divine comedy is written and it is add a mode that is expressive of hope that resolves all contradiction, uh, in the divine, in the revelation of the divine, in the parodies up so that the tariffs, the Rhema expresses for Shelly the hope of the poem, which is that the west wind will be through him. The prompt, the trumpet of a political prophecy. If winter's here can spring be far behind, uh, revolution is in the offing. Everything's going to be great, but at the same time, the palm is shot through with a kind of pessimism, a sort of, if you will, realism and awareness that this notion of prophecy is rather farfetched. Why should the wind do his bidding?

Speaker 1:          40:32          The wind is just when it's not inspiration. Uh, therefore the, the various stands up, which is written in Tasa. Rema is written at the same time as a sonnet 14 lines. And the first stanza in particular is coated not just as a Sonnet, but also as an illusion, specifically to one sonnet and particular Shakespeare's 73rd, which begins that time of year in me, thou mayest be hold, uh, uh, in which I'm getting old. My bare root might my, I don't have any hair left. I'd mind sort of, I, I'm just a bare ruined choir where late sweet bird sang. In other words, I'm in a parlous state. I'm getting old and there's nothing to be done about it. Uh, at the end of the poem, uh, the embers of my fire are about to be, uh, are about to be snuffed out. There is just no hope for it.

Speaker 1:          41:27          Uh, that's the way it is. You get old. In other words, winters here and spring in coming, there is no prophetic possibility. There is only the reality of the trajectory of a lifespan. If there's rise, there's also fall. If there's development, there's also decline and decay. And these, uh, as the, as, as the sonnet form codes, it are simple facts of life, that poetic idealism that Romanticism cannot override. So what you get in Shell is verse form is a tension between ideas, the eye, the eye, the prophetic idea, which you can associate with a, with a feudal and Theo centric world in wets. The contradictions of reality really can be resolved theologically on the one hand and a kind of protocol, realist tradition and which we just have to come to terms with the way things are coded through, which is after all a Prodo enlightenment.

Speaker 1:          42:39          I mean, and Shaw and Shakespeare is often sort of thought thought of as a pro enlightenment figure. Uh, and that is coded through the Sonnet. So formally both the tarts, the rema and the sonnet participate in what Jameson calls the ideology of form. And they raise, they reflect modes of production, feudal and enlightenment respectively. And they respect and they reflect attitudes that one can associate with those modes of production. So that's an example of the way in which the Po, the sort of the political perhaps wanted better call it cuase. I conscious because Shelly was an incredibly self conscious, but the way in which the political quasar conscious expresses itself at the third or historical level of analysis. Um, now, um, so in formal terms, and I've already, and, and I've already sort of gotten into this and I'll go through it rather quickly because there isn't much time left.

Speaker 1:          43:44          Um, informal terms. We can think of the, uh, the essential critical, uh, task at the first or historical level as one of theme at Ization. That is to say what theme is the plot structure of an individual symbolic act trying to express what are we, you know, what is the contradiction that's being resolved in this symbolic act? At the second level, the formal principal that we, that we do bring to bear is the idea, the Bach Tinian idea of Heteroglossia, the clash of voices, the way in which the voice is no longer individual, but rather social, uh, the representative a social point of view. And it expresses itself through, um, uh, the, the, the, the individual authors writing. And at the third level, you get what Jason calls a repertoire of devices. And I've already, uh, reflected a little bit on that. Let me just add another example also taken from Romanticism and keeping with, uh, Jameson's is exemplification of the overlap of modes of production as being particularly interesting in the age of enlightenment.

Speaker 1:          45:02          In Romanticism, there's a long, there's a long tradition leading up to it, of the formal pindaric Ode. Uh, Wordsworth is still making use of that tradition in writing his own intimations of immortality. But in the meantime, he and Coleridge have developed a new kind of owed, if you will, which is called the conversation Palm Coleridge's frosted midnight. This lime tree Bauer, my prison Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, notable examples of the conversation poem. Now the difference is very clearly intelligible in terms of a conflict of modes of production. The formal owed a derived ultimately from Pindar celebrating, uh, Olympic victories of aristocratic patrons in Greece, a horse races, foot races, wrestling matches. Uh, that's, that's the original purpose to which the formal owed was put, uh, plainly, uh, is coded once again a feudal aristocratic, whereas the conversation poem belongs very much as the title, as the word suggests in the public sphere.

Speaker 1:          46:15          It's the atmosphere of the coffee house. It's the atmosphere in which people sit down and talk together, exchange views, address each other. It is a poem always have address to some individual person that turns to that person at a certain point. Um, uh, evokes the nature of that person sometimes solicits that person's opinions. In other words, it's upon that performs Diallo Ism. It's upon that performs, uh, the sense of, of the given take of a much more open democratic culture in the public sphere. And so you can see that they're very transitioned from the formal owed to the conversation. Palm is itself intelligible as a transition among, uh, or what Jameson calls a cultural revolution brought about by a seismic shift in modes of production. All right, so these exemplify in various ways, in various ways what can be done with these three levels. Jameson himself, uh, reminds us of the dangers.

Speaker 1:          47:26          If we think of a narrative as a symbolic act, we're a much too prone either to forget that it's based in reality by emphasizing the structuralist nature of what's going on or to forget that that form is involved at all, uh, by emphasizing the social contradiction that's being resolved. And as Jameson says, these two dangerous at the first level or the danger of structuralism and the danger of vulgar materialism. The point in analyzing the symbolic act is to sustain a balance or a synthesis between formal, uh, and uh, social, uh, elements within the text. Um, the, at the, at the second level, the problem is that if we start thinking in terms of unreconcilable class conflict, our analysis can become static as though class perspectives didn't shift as though, uh, one perspective might succeed another as the hedge demonic. In other words, as though change didn't take place as though there was always the same old, same old in class conflict, the boss is always going to speak demeaningly or the worker, the worker is always going to laugh at the boss behind his back.

Speaker 1:          48:47          Uh, this is the way it is. This is the way it will always be. There are static relations. In other words, uh, among the classes that history can't resolve. And finally, uh, at the third level, there's the danger of thinking in terms of impasse, uh, late capitalism for example, as an impasse that simply can't be surmounted. Think of Adorno they give a darn off and his incredible gloom about the culture industry, there isn't much hope in a door. No. Is there, and by the same token, you could argue that poor old Jameson, you know, talking about history as necessity, history is what hurts, you know, history is just what has happened. You know, by the same token, you could argue that Jameson to is perhaps a little bit subject to this sense of impasse, which is why I quote for you as these people themselves often do, you know, the ringing a warning of mark of marks in the 11th thesis on Foreign Bach, the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.

Speaker 1:          49:49          The point, however, is to change it. That is ultimately the focus of Marxist analysis. Tony in the remaining minute. Now a reified realist approach to Tony. The kind that Jameson criticizes in his sheet would point out that nothing happens to Nido and speedy. They are manifest villains and had at the same time nothing can happen to them. They are simply, they simply have their place in the social order. One of them is a fastidious aristocrat who doesn't want to get dirty. The other is, you know, completely committed to productivity and the time clock and the work ethic, but a speedy, ah, there they are. Nothing to be done. They're not nice to Tony, but nothing happens to them. There is no recrimination but that at the first level, if we understand this as a symbolic act, the resolution of what would otherwise be a hopeless conflict is through friendship.

Speaker 1:          50:45          The friendship of bumpy and Tony. They have to the fact that it's perfectly okay if I'm just a working guy. I've got my buddies, we go out, we drink beer, we have a good time. Life is great. You know, that is, you know, it doesn't matter. In other words that there's a class structure that there's a social system. You know, I'm happy. Tony says, I like my job. That in itself of course is a resolution is a symbolic act and a resolution in advance of the conflicts that the story might otherwise manifest. The second level you get the discourse of ideology. Jeans, I can't help you. He says, Nieto of the car. I don't want to get dirty. I can't help you said speed you the car. I am too busy. I can help you says bumpy, but notice that this is all within an individual single code in that that that's what the, the the complete parallel parallelism of these three utterances shows us within a single code these ideology which can't really been re be resolved, get themselves expressed.

Speaker 1:          51:53          All right. Now finally, modes of production. Plainly, the very existence of a Nido and speedy in the same story suggest that there is a certain tension between the feudal and the bourgeois at work, but it's not attention that in any way necessarily works itself out. The important thing to notice here, it seems to me is the conflict between pulling and pushing. I mean it's very interesting. I've said this before, that a tow truck, something that polls and, and, and you know, once again, you know this Tony is a mode of production, right? I mean he's a tow truck, right? That something, something that pulls, has to be pushed bumpy, you know, is like the little engine that could, is a sort of a throwback to an earlier, uh, less energized, less powerful mode of production. He has to push, think of the way walls get put up, you know, a prefabricated wall before the invention of the crane and the pulley has to be pushed up by a bunch of people.

Speaker 1:          52:56          Pushing is the essential labor mode before the kind of technology arises that makes it possible to pull something. After that you have a crane, you run the hook down, you just pull the wall up into place before then you've got maybe one person standing on a rafter with a rope kind of pulling. But everybody else is down on the ground pushing. And so the relationship between pushing and pulling in the story is a crucially important one, which suggests the overlap of older and newer modes of production, uh, all of which can be resolved at Jameson's third or historical level of analysis. Okay. So much then for Jameson and for Tony will be coming back to Tony again next time. In the context of talking about the new historicism.
