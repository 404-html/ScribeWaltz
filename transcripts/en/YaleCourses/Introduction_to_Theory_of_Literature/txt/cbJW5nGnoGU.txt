Speaker 1:          00:01          So, uh, before we go on to talk a little bit about the American historicist, a hermeneutical scholar, ed Hirsch and Wolfgang Eser, uh, for whom you have your reading assignment. Uh, I want to go back to God them are a little bit and say something more about his taste. That is to say the kind of literary and intellectual cannon that his approach to hermeneutics establishes. You. Remember, God, Amar is very much concerned with the norm of classicism, which later in his essay he's inclined to call tradition instead. Uh, and the reason that that's so important to him is that he actually has a very conservative view of what the reader can accomplish in understanding another horizon. God, him or in other words, does think that the reader can perform any great miracles and intuitively feeling his or her way into the mind of another time and place so that the value of classicism and of tradition for God or is that there is evident common ground in certain texts.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Sometimes we refer to them as great books. In other words, the sort of text that speaks, or we feel as though it's speaking to all places and times, of course it's contested whether or not there's really any, any merit in talking about texts that way. But God and his view is very strongly that this conservatism about the cannon, which is intimately related to his conservatism, has doubt about the actual capability of a reader to span enormous gaps. And I use that word advisedly because it is the word that ease of uses, uh, to talk about the distance between the reader and the text and the way in which that in the way in which that distance it should be negotiated. So in any case, um, this conservatism, it seems to me, however, can be questioned and I thought that we'd begin then by turning to page seven 31, uh, the lefthand column, the footnote, uh, you're beginning to realize, I'm sure that I like footnotes a given of course was said to have lived his life in his footnotes.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Perhaps I live my life in the footnotes of other people. In any case, in this footnote, God ever says something. I, I think it's very rare that we can actually just sort of outright disagree with God over. But he says nothing in this footnote that I believe we can actually disagree with. Toward the bottom of the footnote seven 31 lefthand column, he says, just as in conversation, we understand irony to the extent to which we are in agreement on the subject with the other person. We understand irony only he means to the extent to which we are in agreement with the other person. If you are expressing an opinion and otherwise, which differs radically from my own. I can't understand according to gardener whether or not you're being ironic. This seems to me to be just patently false. Uh, think about politics. Think about political talk shows, think about political campaigns when our political opponent is being ironic about our views.

Speaker 1:          03:46          We understand the irony perfectly. Well, we're used to it. Uh, we have accommodated ourselves to it. And of course it's the same in reverse. Our opponent understands are ironies and there is, it seems to me a perfect kind of symbiosis, ironically enough between political opponents. Precisely. Maybe in the measure to which they're ironies are mutually intelligible. It probably teaches each of them are good deal, uh, to accommodate, to encounter, to get used to the ironies of the other. And I think this applies to conversation in general. It's very easy to pick up most forms of irony we don't have, we don't have an enormous difficulty grasping them. And it doesn't seem to me that our capability of grasping irony is founded on unnecessary underlying agreement. That's what he's saying. Now, if this is the case, it seems to me that one has found a loophole and got him or his conservatism about what the reader can do.

Speaker 1:          04:58          His premise is that in order to understand there has to be a basis of agreement. But if what we've just said about understanding each other's ironies, even where there is pretty wholesale disagreement is true, that ought to apply also to our capacity to read work that with which we distinctly disagree with, which we feel we can never come to terms, uh, in terms of affirming it's value, but which we nevertheless can understand if understanding is not predicated on agreement, the possibility of opening up the Canon, as we say, insisting that it doesn't have to be an absolutely continuous traditional cannon is available to us once again and got, or his conservatism on this issue can be questioned now. It's not the gardener's insisting on absolute continuity on contrary. You'll probably remember that on page seven 32, um, it, the, the, uh, um, the, it can't be seven 32, so please disregard that.

Speaker 1:          06:08          I'm not going to read this passage anyway. Uh, uh, he says early in the essay that in order to recognize that we are in the presence of something that isn't merely within our own historical horizon, we need to be pulled up short. In other words, to go back to that example once more, the, um, we need to recognize that there's something weird about that word plastic. Um, and in being pulled up short, we recognize the need also for the fundamental act of reading and God umber, which is the merger of horizons with the, in other words that we are dealing knowingly with the horizon, not altogether our own. That has to be negotiated, that has to be merged with our own for understanding to be possible. So got her. In fact, God, we're even insist that if we don't have this phenomenon of being pulled up short, our reading is basically just solid cystic.

Speaker 1:          07:08          We, we just take it for granted that what we're reading is completely within our own horizon. Um, and we don't make any effort at all to understand that which is fundamentally, or at least in some ways different God I'm or acknowledges this, even insist on it as I say, but he doesn't lay stress on it because the gap that is implied in the need to be pulled up short is not a big one that has to say it's one that we can easily satisfy plastic again. Oh Gee, that's a strange word we say. So we go to the OED, we see it meant something different than our problem is solved and we continue. No big deal, right? But there may be a ways of being pulled up, short occasions for being co pulled up short that God of Earth thinks exceed the imaginative grasp of a reader.

Speaker 1:          08:03          And this, as you'll see when we return to ease or after I've said a few things about Hershey, this as you'll see, is the fundamental difference between God and man and or where it gut wherefore God them or the gap between reader and text between my horizon and the horizon of the text isn't it? Is perforce a small one for either, it needs to be a much larger one in order for what he calls the act of the reader, the Reading Act really to swing into high gear. And we'll see that this has implications for the obvious difference between their two cannons. All right, but now I want to say something about the person who, the passage of whom, uh, I quoted over against the passage from God. I'm at the end of the God and or a lecture you remember got him or said, um, we have to be open to the otherness of the past.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Uh, and, and in order that for us it may speak true, but if we simply bracket out our own feelings, uh, that can't possibly happen. So that we have to recognize that in this mutuality of the reading experience, we really are in a conversation. We're open to being told something true by someone else. Hirsch on the other hand says, oh, well, you know, the important thing is to know the exact meaning of that other person, because that's the only way to honor the otherness of the person. You know, concepts people ought to be, uh, an end and not a means for us. We ought to understand them on their terms, God and or his claim, however, was that if we do that, we are in fact suspending the way in which it might be that they speak true. We're sitting, we're, we're honoring instead the integrity of what we're saying without thinking about whether or not it might be true.

Speaker 1:          10:06          So I introduced Hirsch in that context and now I want to go back to him a little bit. Uh, and I want to work with two passages, which I've sent you all an email form, which I've neglected to put on the board, but there is so short, I don't think that will be necessary. The first of the two passages I want to talk about is Hershey's argument that consciousness is an of that meaning is an affair of consciousness and not have words. Meaning is an affair of consciousness and not have words. In other words, the text is what makes the ascertainment of meaning possible and available to us. But meaning is not in the text. Meaning is in the intention of the author. And that is the, and that is what we need to arrive at as we work through the text. Meaning is an affair of consciousness and not have words.

Speaker 1:          11:10          Now think about this. What it means is that in understanding a text, we are attempting to grasp it. In paraphrase, we are, in other words attempting to grasp it in a sentence that might read something like what the author means to say is right. That is it. So that it's a, it's not what the text means, which might be anything according to her. She, if you've just appealed to the text, it's what the author means to say is, okay, so what's implied here? On the one hand you can say this is just absolute total nonsense and we use a text to find meaning and something that we don't have available to us. Why don't we just find meaning in the checks which is available to us? Uh, that would make more sense. It's up to us to construe the text. Um, we can't possibly know what the author meant except on the basis of our determination of the meaning of the text, so why not just focus our attention to meaning on the text.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Hirsch was a student of whimsy at Harris, was engaged in lifelong that's agreement with God, but he was a student at wounds, wounds that the author of the intentional fallacy, obviously Hirsch was a rebellious student and insisted that far from wanting to take websites. Position appealing to intention was the most important thing you can do. The only thing you can do, which establishes according to the title of his first important book on Hermeneutics, validity in interpretation. All right. Now it seems it's very difficult. It's very difficult intuitively to assent to Hershey's position and I'll just tell you by the way that I don't, I can't, but I will say in passing in defense of Hirsch that if we reflect on the matter, we realized that in common sense terms, appealing to an author's intention is precisely what we do for practical reasons. Let me give you an example.

Speaker 1:          13:20          You're all students. You are sitting in classrooms that in many cases oblige you to take exams. Your instructor tells you when you write your exam, don't just para the words of the authors you're studying. I wanted, I want to know that you understand those offers. Think about it. You prove to your teacher that you understand the authors by being able to put their meaning. In other words, in other words, to say the author is intending to say something, not just that the text says something and this is what it says it's at with your exam. Then you know one long screed of quotation. Ironically, the the, the, the instructor doesn't really want just quotation on an exam. He wants explanation and the form of explanation is paraphrase. You can't have paraphrase unless you can identify a meaning, which is interpersonal meaning, which can be shared among a group that understands and can be expressed.

Speaker 1:          14:36          In other words, that's the key. If you can put it, in other words, those other words take the form of an appeal to intention. All right, so that's, and that's an important point. Argument in Hirsch's favor. We realized that practically speaking, the necessity of appealing to paraphrase in order to guarantee mutual understanding certainly does seem to be something like agreeing or admitting that meaning is an affair of consciousness, not of words. My consciousness, the author's consciousness, the consciousness that we can all share. That's where we find meaning and meaning takes the form of that kind of paragraph paraphrase that everyone can agree on so much then, uh, to the, uh, to the t to the advantage or benefit of Hirsch. Uh, there are lots of things to be said against it. On the other hand, which I don't want to pause over now because I think a, a course of lectures and literary theory will inevitably show the ways in which paraphrase is inadequate to the task of rigorous interpretation.

Speaker 1:          15:54          Clans, Brooks, uh, the new critic, uh, uh, rights of famous essay called the heresy of paraphrase, insisting that a proper literary interpretation is a wooden mechanical inflexible exercise if it reduces the incredible complexity of a textual surface. To paraphrase. Um, and so it's a complex issue. Uh, and I should, I should leave it. Having said this much, leave at x at least for the moment. Now, one other thing that her says, the other thing that I uh, that I quoted, um, is in effect, I'll paraphrase now that uh, that uh, that what got them or omits to realize is that there is a difference between the meaning of a text and the significance of a text that is Hirsch's other key position. And we can understand it by saying something like this. The meaning of a text is what the author intended it. To me that is to say what we can establish with a reliable paraphrase.

Speaker 1:          17:01          The significance of the text, which Hirsch does not deny interest to the significance of the text is the meaning for us. That is to say what we take to be important about this meaning, uh, the way in which for example, we can translate it into our own terms. Historically we can adapt it to a cause or a or an intellectual position. The ways, in other words in which we can take the meaning of a text and make it significant for us, the difference between meaning and significance then is something that purse takes very seriously and he insists and here's of course where it becomes controversial. He insists that it's possible to tell the difference between meaning and significance if good basis that you are, you can pin down accurately an incontestably the author's meaning appealing to all the philological tricks that you have, uh, throwing out irrelevancies and insisting that you finally have the meaning.

Speaker 1:          18:04          Right? And of course, how many times has that happened, which is obviously one point of disagreement with hers and insisting that you finally have the meaning, right? Then once you've done that, once you've secured the integrity and accuracy of the meaning, her says, okay, fine. Now you can do anything you like with the text. You know, you can adapt it for any, any sort of possible purpose. But the crucial thing is to keep the distinction between meaning and significance. Clear obviously got 'em or refuses, refuses to argue that we can distinguish in that way reliably. We don't know because it's a question of merging horizons. My horizon in the horizon of the tax, we don't know with any guarantee where meaning leaves off and insignificance begins so that the splitting apart of the two terms is something that simply can't be accomplished by the way in which we enter the hermaneutic circle that's got hammers position.

Speaker 1:          19:12          Uh, and it is the position of anyone who supposes that, uh, Hirsch, uh, although the, once again, the distinction, what he means by that distinction is clear enough. Yes, yes. You say, I see exactly what he means. Nevertheless, that to secure the distinction is that in actual practice say, okay, this is the meaning and now this is how I'm going to make it significant. Well, you know, it seems unlikely indeed, that this is something anyone could ever accomplish. All right? Finally, to turn to Wolfgang easier ease or is concerned with what he calls the act of the reader. Does. AHC does lasers a as the title of one of his books and he is an, and in so doing, he establishes himself as a person very much in the tradition of phenomenology, deriving from Husserl more directly in [inaudible] case from a an analyst of the way in which the reader moves from sentence to sentence and negotiating a text, a Polish intellectual named Roman in garden who is quoted frequently in the essay that you have.

Speaker 1:          20:28          Um, those are the primary influences on either, but he himself has been tremendously influential in turn reader's interest in the reader. There's interest in the reader's experience, uh, is part of a school of thought that he helped to found that grew up around the university of Constance in the sixties and seventies, uh, which resulted in a series of seminars on what was called reception history or alternatively the aesthetics of reception and ease. Or his colleague was Hans Robella [inaudible] whom we will be reading later in the course. Uh, the influence of the so called constant school spread to the United States, uh, and had many ramifications here, uh, particularly, uh, and crucially in the early work of another critic will be turning to later in this semester, Stanley fish. Uh, so reception history has been a kind of partly theoretical, partly scholarly field, uh, one that's really still flourishing ever since the early work in the great Constance seminars of Eser.

Speaker 1:          21:40          Uh, yes and others. So, and easier later in his career. He died just a couple of years ago, later in his career, taught annually at a university of California, Irvine. And by that time he was very much engaged in a new aspect of his project, uh, which he called the anthropology of fiction. That is to say, why do we have fiction? Why do we tell stories to each other? All of eases work is grounded in the notion of literature as fiction. He's almost exclusively a scholar of the novel. And by the way, one of the first obvious differences, uh, you can notice between Eser and got her is that whereas God omers and intellectual historian who's canonical texts are works of philosophy, uh, works of social thought, uh, as well as great works of Literature, uh, for easier. It's a completely different canon. He has exclusively concerned with fiction and how we read fiction and how we come to understand fiction and how we determine the meaning of a work of fiction.

Speaker 1:          22:47          And as I say in the, in the last phase of his career when he started thinking about the anthropology of fiction, he raised the even more fundamental question. I think a very important one though, not necessarily to be aimed exclusively at fiction. Uh, the anthropological question, why we have fiction at all, why it has been a preexisting trans historical phenomenon of human culture that we tell stories to each other, that we make things up. Uh, when after all, when after all we could be spending all of our time. Well just talking about things that actually are around us. How is it that we feel the need to make things up? All right. Now as you read easier, you'll see immediately that he in tone and in and in a sense of what's important and his understanding of the way in which we negotiate the world of texts that he much more closely gossamer than Hershey.

Speaker 1:          23:47          We can say this in two different ways. We can say that [inaudible] position is a way is, is a reconstruction of what got him or says has essentially to say about the merger of horizons. For example, on page 1002, a the bottom of the left hand column over to the right hand column, he says, the convergence of texts and reader, the convergence of text and reader got him, or his way of putting that would be the merger of the uh, readers horizon. My horizon with the horizon within which the text appears either says the convergence of text and reader brings the literary work into existence. This is implied in God Amar as well. It's not your horizon, it's not my horizon. It's that effective history which takes place when our horizons merge. That is the locus of meaning for Ghana. By the same token, for what what, what [inaudible] is saying is that the space of meaning is virtual and this is the word he uses.

Speaker 1:          24:56          It's neither in the taxed nor in the reader, but the result of the negotiation back and forth between the text and the reader, he says, sort of brings the literary work into existence in a virtual space. And this convergence can never be precisely pinpointed, but must always remain virtual and is not to be identified either with the reality of the text or with the individual disposition of the reader. So you'll see this has got a mirror in. This is the result. This is the fruit of they hermaneutic engagement between horizons that results in meaning, let's put in a different way by his there. But it is in a large degree the same idea. He also plainly shares with God. They assumption the supposition that the construal of meaning cannot be all together. Objective, in other words, is there is no more, uh, and historicist then God I'm or is, but insist rather on this mutual exchange of prejudice between the two horizons in question.

Speaker 1:          26:11          So he argues on page 1005, the right hand column one text, this is halfway down the column one text is potentially capable of several different realizations and no reading can ever exhaust the full potential for each individual reader will fill in the gaps in his own way. And this of course brings us to the issue of gaps and the role that they play, uh, in the act of reading as ease or understands it a gap. It's an interesting term. I don't know. I don't actually know whether either to be Hershey and means, uh, what I'm about to say about gaps, but plainly a gap isn't a bit, so it's a distance between two points. But what's really interesting is that we think of spark plugs. We think of gapping a spark plug. In other words, I don't know if you know how the spark plug words but, but, but, but for the electrical current to fly into operation and a spark plug, the two points of contact have to be gapped.

Speaker 1:          27:23          They have to be forced apart to a certain degree. Too much. There's no spark too little. There is no to too little you short out, right? There's no spark. So you have to gap a spark plug. And it seems to me that the Aha effect of reading the movement back and forth across the gap between the reader and the text can be understood in terms of a spark, right? As though the relationship between the reader and the text where the relationship between the two points of a spark plug, whether God Umer means that when he speaks of gap or whether he simply means and a bis or distance to be crossed. I couldn't say. Um, but I think it's useful. Uh, you know, like the opportunities in the word plastic. I think it's useful, uh, to suggest that the sense of gapping as spark club may have some relevance to our understanding of what goes on in this, in this reading process.

Speaker 1:          28:25          Now, how then does he differ from God are one way that is I think, not terribly important but I think is interesting in view of what we've just been saying about Hershey and another way that's absolutely crucial that we've implied already and to which we need to return the way that's perhaps not terribly important, at least for president present purposes. Although this is a distinction that's going to be coming up again and again later in the semester is the way in which he actually seems to distinguish. This is page 1006, uh, in the, uh, how can it be? I've got it, uh, in the um, uh, yeah, in the upper left hand column, the way in which he appears to distinguish between reading and interpretation, very top of the left hand column. He says the text refers back directly to our own preconceptions. Got them or would call those prejudices to our own preconceptions which are revealed by the act of interpretation.

Speaker 1:          29:33          That is a basic element of the reading process. So there's a wedge there between the concept of reading and the concept of interpretation. I would suggest that it's not unlike the wedge that her drives between the concept of meaning and the concept of Inter of, of significance and meaning is construal significance is the application of that construal to something. I think that the distinction is, is making between reading an interpretation can be understood in much the same way is or doesn't make much of the distinction. In other words, it's not an important part of his object of his argument, which is why I say that the difference with gardener who never makes the distinction between reading and interpretation. Uh, the difference we've got 'em or in this matter is slight. But the other difference is very important and that is to return to this point that eser stresses innovation as the principle of value governing the choice and the interpretive strategies of reading innovation is what easier as Canon is looking for.

Speaker 1:          30:51          That's what makes it so different from God. Numerous conservative, continuous, traditional cannon is as understanding of gapping. The spark plug is a much more bold, uh, affirmative of the imaginative powers of the reader. A much more bold process than the uh, hesitant conservative process suggested by God ever. Now in order, in order to illustrate the way in which, what ease or calls virtual work gets done in this regard, let me just run through a few passages quickly. If God ever says in a way that PR that he doesn't really stress in the long run, that in order to know that there is actually a difference between the reader's horizon and the horizon of the text, you need to be pulled up short. Something needs to surprise you. Well easier throws his whole emphasis on this element of surprise. If it doesn't surprise, it isn't worth it, it doesn't have value.

Speaker 1:          31:57          And we'll, and we'll talk in more detail about the ways in which it doesn't have value in a minute. So the gap, if the element of surprise is to become absolutely central and paramount in the reading process, the gap has to get bigger. The the, you know, there just has to be, it has to be a bigger distance, a broader of bits. And that's what either is working with in the passages I'm about to quote, as I said, I'm going to quote three more or less rapid fire. The first is on page 1003, the upper left hand column in this process of creativity, that is to say the way in which a text induces the feeling of surprise in the reader. In this process of creativity, the text may either go not far enough or may go too far. Now I admit in this particular passage, you get a hint of God, hammers, element of conservatism.

Speaker 1:          33:00          The text may go through far. In other words, it may make demands on us that are too great. Yeah, we're reading Finnegan's wake. We haven't got a clue. You know, the text has gone too far. Uh, we can't get from sentence to sentence. Even within the sentence, we have no idea what the words mean. And so we're at sea, uh, uh, unless of course we really rise to meet the challenge, but typically are characteristically it in [inaudible] terms, the text has gone too far. So we may say he elaborates here. So we may say that boredom and overstrain form the boundaries, the on which the reader will leave the field of play. And that as if there are no surprises, that's just the Yon. I mean, why bother to read it all and at the surprises are too great. They induce overstrain. Uh, and we throw away the book, um, in frustration and despair. Uh, and so the distance of the gap needs to be between the outer limits of boredom and overstrain according to according to Eser page 1004, the upper right hand column

Speaker 1:          34:14          expectations and this word is, uh, what, uh, eser thanks. The sort of dialectic that the reading process is playing with reading consists according to his, her, and the violation of expectations for the violation to work. The expectations have to be there. So that's the dialectic. That's what's negotiated. The, there has to be a sense moving from sentence to sentence that something is likely to happen next. If that underlying sense isn't there, then whatever happens is simply met with frustration. But if we have the expectation that something's going to happen next and then something different happens or if the suspense of wondering what will happen next is in play so that anything can happen and it and, and, and, and the but, but but the experience is suspense, um, has been gone through then in those cases, that's all to the good. That's a good part of the reading process. Expectations says eser are scarcely ever fulfilled in truly literary texts. You see, that's where the evaluative principle that completely revolutionizes got hammers. Cannon comes in.

Speaker 1:          35:34          In other words, innovation is that the principle of change, the principle of violated expectation is what imposes or establishes value and the literary text, not continuity, not a sense that across the abyss truth is being spoken to us, but rather the sense that across the abyss we are being constructively surprised. Right? That's that, that that's what has changed between, between these two positions. We implicitly demand of expository text. He goes on and he may be alluding to God, I'm are here because after all, God Ameren is talking primarily about expository text works of Philosophy, works of social thought, which of course aren't trying to surprise or trickest. They're trying to lay out an argument which is consistent and continuous, um, and keeps surprise to a minimum. It's difficult philosophy and social thought, but it's not difficult because of the element of surprise, but it's the vocabulary.

Speaker 1:          36:37          It's the complexity of the thought and so on that makes it difficult. So easily said and easily acknowledges this. He says, uh, uh, we implicitly demand of expository text that there be no surprise, um, as we refer to the objects they're meant to present, but it's a defect in a literary text. That's the difference for Eason between nonfiction and fiction and nonfiction. We don't want to be surprised. It has other, it, it poses other kinds of difficulty, let's say. But in the case of fiction, in order to be engaged, in order to enter the hermaneutic circle properly, we need the element of surprise. So as I say, a way of distinguishing between fiction and nonfiction. Page 10, 10, the lower right hand column, the word defund linearization we will encounter soon when we take up the Russian formalists. D familiarization means precisely pulling you up short or taking you by surprise, making you, making you feel that what you thought was going to be the case or what you thought was the state of affairs is not the state of affairs.

Speaker 1:          37:59          Uh, Wallace, the poet Wallace Stevens puts it beautifully when he says that poetry should make the visible a little hard to see. In other words, it should be a d familiarizing of that which has become too familiar. That's an aspect of the reading process. And so is her says this d familiarization of what the reader thought he recognized is bound to create attention that will intensify his expectations as well as his distrust of those expectations. In other words, the tension itself of simultaneously having expectations and feeling that they should be valid, violated the probably they will be violated, being on the alert for how they're going to be violated. This is a kind of tension, a constructive tension, which constitutes for either the psychological excitement of reading. All right. Having said all of this, obviously what easy means to say is that the reader should work hard.

Speaker 1:          39:03          There should be that the virtual work done by the reader to constitute, to bring into existence a virtual meaning, uh, should be hard work and there's not much work to do if two things are the case, first of all, if the techs just seems real, in other words, if, if it's, it is, if there's no spin on reality, if there is no sense of this being a fictive world, if it's just seems to be about the every day about life as we live at the life that we find ourselves in according to ease, or at least there are no, there are no, there's no violation of expectations. The gap isn't big enough. This is of course disputable. There is a kind of a vogue recurrently and the history of fiction for a kind of a miraculous sense that this is just exactly the way things are.

Speaker 1:          40:04          People enjoy that in ways that ease or may not be fully acknowledging in this argument, but there's no question that it doesn't involve the violation of expectations. There's not much gap at all. It's another kind of pleasure that re that either is perhaps not taking into account that we take in that which seems to be simply incontestably real as we read it. Uh, and and easier leaves that out of account. On the other hand, he says that there is no use either a no value either in that form of engagement with the text in which an illusion is perpetually sustained and that it's an illusion is created a never, never land is created. We know it's an illusion, but we get to live in it so comfortably with so little alteration of the nature of the illusion or of the way in which we negotiate the illusory world that it becomes kind of womb like and cozy.

Speaker 1:          41:06          Uh, it is, I mean, and here of course either is referring to what he calls culinary fiction. The very, the, the sub genres of literature like, well, nurse novels, bodice, rippers, uh, uh, certain kinds of, of, of detective fiction. Although a lot of detective fiction is much better than than that description would imply. In other words, novels in which undoubtedly it's an illusory world just don't happen the way they happen in nurse novels and bought us for a prison. You know, somehow or another, you know, the pauper marries the prince. This doesn't happen. But at the same time, it's a world of illusion in which the reader lives all to comfortably. Right. So these are forms of reading, of the reading, of the experience of reading fiction, of which either disapproves because there's no work being done. The virtual work of the reader does not involve surprise, does not involve the violation of expectations.

Speaker 1:          42:08          The relationship between text and reader must be a collaboration. Eser argues the poly semantic nature of the text. That is to say the fact that the text sort of throws up all sorts of possibilities of meaning. If it's a good text, the policy, romantic nature of the text and the illusion making of the reader are opposed factors. In other words, there's something in the raider that wants to settle comfortably into the world of the nurse novel, the Bodice ripper, the formulaic detective novel wants just to sort of exist comfortably in those worlds, but a good taxed. It's perpetually bringing the reader up short and preventing that comfort zone from establishing itself. So that the tension between the, the, the, the tendency on our part to sustain an illusion and the way in which the rate of the tax keeps undermining the illusion is again, that aspect of the psychological excitement of reading that ease or wants to concentrate on.

Speaker 1:          43:12          Now a word about then Tony, the tow truck in this regard. Um, I brought the text with me. Uh, you can look at it now or at your leisure and I wanted to call attention to a few places in the text in which it is a question of expectation and of the way in which this expectation can be violated. Now, it's only fair to say that if we're going to read Tony seriously in this way, we have to put ourselves in the shoes of a toddler. That is to say as readers or auditors, we have to, we, you know, we have to think of ourselves and of the psychological excitement of experiencing with text as that of a toddler. Uh, we, you know, and it's not so very difficult to do. For example, um, I'm Tony if tow truck, I live in the little yellow Varage I helped cars that has stuck.

Speaker 1:          44:06          I told them to my garage. I liked my job one day. I am stuck. Who will help Tony the tow truck. All right. Now this is a wonderful example of the tension between having expectations x with the expectation that someone will help Tony and being in a state of suspense, not knowing who it will be. Now from the adult point of view, this is culinary because we know that we're in the world of folklore and that in folklore everything happens three times. We know that two vehicles are going to come along and not help Tony. And that the third vehicle will, because everything, as I say, ah, but happens in threes in folklore. And Notice Tony the tow truck next week when we read the Russian formalists, uh, we will, we will learn, uh, the research finding or one of the early formulas to the effect that repetition in verse is analogous to Tautology in folklore.

Speaker 1:          45:05          We have exactly that going on in Tony the tow truck Tuck, Tuck, Tuck, and then the three events, Nido, the car, speed of the car, bumpy, the car, uh, you know, it's coming along and sequence and bumping finally resolving the problem. So in any case, we, we, we have an expectation. We have the dialectic of suspense. On the one hand, how will this be resolved and inevitability on the other? Oh, it's a folk tale. It'll be resolved. Don't worry about it. Uh, uh, and we have, and we have this suspense, as I say, between expectation, the possibility of violation and simply not knowing. Ah, okay. Now, so we continue. I cannot help you says neato the car. I don't want to get dirty. I cannot help. You said speed of the car. I am too busy. I am very sad. Then a little car pulls up.

Speaker 1:          45:55          I think it's wonderful because you know, it's pulls, it pulls up just like God and we're being pulled up short. And there isn't, it seems to me that there's another crisis of expectation in this line is that especially as a toddler, I need to negotiate that expression. Idiomatically you know, I'm three years old, maybe. I don't know what pulls up means, you know, it's a strange, you know, I mean, it, it, it, it's probably not very good writing for a toddler precisely for that reason, but at the same time, you know, it, it lends itself to us because we recognize that there's a reading problem or a piece of the virtual work that needs to be overcome before you can get on with it. You have to find out what pulls up means in the same way that the adult reader of pleasures of the imagination has to find out what plastic means.

Speaker 1:          46:46          And, uh, and as I say, it's a, it's a wonderful irony that this particular difficulty in reading is precisely what God, her calls being pulled up short. All right? So you solve the problem and then Lo and behold, it turns out that it is my friend, bumpy, bumpy, gives me a push. He pushes and pushes and I'm on my way. Thank you. Bumpy. I called that you're welcome. Says Bumpy. And now I think we got another expectation. This is the kind of story that has a moral, it's a feel good story. Uh, there is, you know, something good has happened. Uh, there is this sense of reciprocity is established between the tow truck, uh, and the person who helps the tow truck, uh, out of being stuck, uh, of, of a fine sense of reciprocity. So the expectation is that there will be a moral, the tension or a suspense is what will the moral be.

Speaker 1:          47:40          Yeah. There are a variety of ways. In other words, in which this story, just like the rime of the ancient mariner, good end. I mean, it's not, it's by no means clear that the rime of the ancient mariner, we'll end budget, you know, love all things great and small things that could have ended any number of other ways. Uh, and just so this story could end a number of ways. It happens to end now that's what I call a friend. Well, fine, the moral is that reciprocity is friendship and good all, all to the good. But as I say, there's that, there's a moment of suspense in the expectation at the point in the text when we expect a moral, but we don't know what the moral is going to be. So once again, there's a kind of, there's that moment of suspense that the reader is able to get through with a kind of pleasurable excitement and then overcome as the moral is actually revealed.

Speaker 1:          48:36          All right? Now. So even Tony, the tow truck in other words, is not absolutely culinary and can be a and can be treated in ways that I hope shed some light on, uh, the reading process. All right? Very quickly, uh, the time is up. So let me conclude by saying that if there is this remarkable distinction between God and easier between cannons, where the methodology of God seems to impose on us a traditional cannon and the methodology of Eser seems to impose on us and innovative cannon, isn't there some relief in historicism after all? Because the whole point of historicism as got him or herself puts it is that it lets the cannon B, we're not interested in establishing a, a, a principle of value that shapes a canon. We're interested in hearing everybody on his or her own terms and letting those texts be, in other words, doesn't historicism open the cannon and indeed make the process of reading the experience of reading, archival, uh, and, and omnivorous rather than canonical.

Speaker 1:          49:54          You know, if every text just is what it is and we can't bring a methodologically speaking any kind of preconception to bear on what's a good text or what's a bad case, haven't we solved the problem of the limitation imposed on the reader by any kind of cannon formation? Well, only I say in conclusion, if we can distinguish between meaning and significance. In other words, only if we really are sure that the historicist act of is effective and works. If I know the meaning of a text, well fine. Then later on, if I wish I can establish a Canon by saying certain texts have certain significance and those are the texts that I care about and water rate. But I can only do that if I can distinguish between meaning and cigarette. But if meaning and significance bleed into each other, what I'm in, what I'm going to be doing is establishing a canon as it were, unconsciously or 70 consciously, I'm going to say, oh, this is just what the text means.

Speaker 1:          50:59          But at the same time, I'll be finding ways without realizing it, of affirming certain kinds of meaning, uh, and discrediting certain other kinds of meaning. Um, all the while saying, oh, it's just meaning I'm not, I'm, I'm not doing that. Uh, and that would if, but if in fact my reading practice can be shown not clearly to distinguish between meaning and significance, well then that's what would happen. Uh, so it's still up in the air and it's still perhaps in escapable that we read as it were. Canonically uh, but I think what is shown by thinking of various approaches to hermeneutics in these terms, I think what's shown is that there is a relationship between methodology and Canon formation that certain things follow, uh, from our assumptions about how to read, uh, evaluation, uh, would seem rather at a distant remove from simple considerations of how to read. But in fact, I think we've shown that evaluation is in one way or another, implicit in certain methodological premises as they establish themselves in the work of these various writers. Okay. Thank you very much.
