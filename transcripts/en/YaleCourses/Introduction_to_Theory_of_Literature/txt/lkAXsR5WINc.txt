Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, I'd really better start, I can infer, I think from looking around the room that there is either post paper depression at work or that having read written the paper, uh, is scarcely had time to read a 15 page labyrinthine essay by law call. Um, that's unfortunate. Uh, and I hope you're able to make up for it soon. And those of you who, uh, are here today, uh, can take such notes as you can figure out how to take and then go back to the text of Laconia and try to make use of them. Uh, I, uh, it is a pity that not everyone's here, but we'll fair forward. Nevertheless. Uh, now there is an obvious link between, uh, the work of Peter Brooks that you read last time and this particular essay of Laconia, uh, which of course I'd like to begin by underlining. It has to do with the part of the argument of Lacan, which probably is most accessible to you after your tour through structuralism and related Isms and which, uh, in a way I think really can be used to anchor a certain understanding of luck call.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Uh, and it's something I am going to spend a walk, want to spend a lot of time with in the long run today. And then a case Brooks understood, uh, the fictional texts, the co and the completed fictional narrative as a sustaining of desire through a series of day two or detours, uh, um, inadequate and improper and points overcome a resulting in a continuation of desire, uh, resulting in a proper ending. That is to say something corresponding to what Freud understood as the desire of the organism to die in its own way, uh, and not according to the modification or pressure of something from without. Uh, and this sequence of day to, uh, in the elaboration of a narrative plot, Brooks called Matana me in a way that by this time we ought to recognize as what happens, uh, in the putting together of signs along the axis of combination as it's described by [inaudible], but Brooks remarks also that at the same time there is a binding of this sequence of signs of events.

Speaker 1:          02:49          In the case of a plot, there is a binding of these signs. There is an effect of unity, a feeling that the experience one has in reading a fictional plot is an experience of unity. And this effect, uh, he calls metaphor. That is to say our sense of the unity of a fictional pro plot. We understand as metaphor some kind of identity or self identity or close correspondence in the meaning of the variety of, of events that we have encountered results in a unity that can be understood in metaphorical terms. Uh, in other words, something like what Y'all cups and calls the poetic function has been super imposed on the med anemic, uh, access of combination in such a way that the feeling of unity, the sense of the recurrence of identity in the signs used is something that we can come away with. And this a Brooks argues accounts for our sense of the unity of the plot, even as we understand it to be a perpetual, a form of the delay of desire.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Uh, that's how I speak of the delay of desire. That's most obvious. Of course, at a marriage plot, a marriage plot being the heart of fiction perhaps, uh, and most immediately intelligible. But of course, desire takes many forms. There are many sorts of plot, uh, and they always do in one form or another half to do in Brookson sense with desire. Now, uh, I, I pause, uh, in this way over Brooks because I think you can see whatever frustration you may also be feeling and encountering con, I think you can see that the same basic movement is at work in luck because understanding of the unconscious, the discourse of desire for luck car, the perpetual deferral of bringing into consciousness, into being into presence, the object of Desire Lacan to hearkening back to Freud as Brooks does. Hearkening back to the, uh, distinction made, uh, th th the, the, the, the, the, the connection made, uh, in Freud and thought and picked up by [inaudible] between condensation and the dream work and metaphor and the Dream Work and displacement in the dream work and my autonomy in the dream work.

Speaker 1:          05:23          This is central as well to luck argument, the deferral of desire and for a la carte. The impossibility ever of realizing one's desire for a certain kind of other that I'm going to be trying to identify during the course of the lecture is understood as much autonomy just as Brooks understands the movement of metonymy as a purpose, as not a perpetual, uh, but a cyst, a plot sustaining day tour or deferral of the end. So there's two, one finds in desire and uh, in, in, in Laconia and metaphor. On the other hand, he understands to be what he calls it. One interesting point, the quilting of the mat, anemic chain, the plan to copy Tom or quilting button that suddenly holds together a sequence of disparate signifiers in such a way that a kind of substitution of signs as opposed to a displacement of science can be accomplished.

Speaker 1:          06:34          And we'll come back to this later on. Uh, in attempting to understand what Lacan has to say about that line from victor goes, Poem Boaz Asleep. Uh, the line, his sheaves were not miserly nor spiteful. We'll come back to that. But in the meantime, the point of Lacan and what makes a lot cause reading of desire different from Brooks's. And indeed, what makes his reading of desire different from that of anyone who thinks of these structuralist issues in psychoanalytic terms as that Laca really doesn't believe that we can ever have what we desire. He has no doubt that we can have what we need. He makes the fundamental distinction between having what we desire and having what we need. The distinction is often put, and when you read a Slovak g Zach, next week, you'll see who makes a much more central point of this. It's often put as the distinction between the big other.

Speaker 1:          07:38          And uh, later on we'll talk about why it's big, uh, the big other, which one can never appropriate as an object of desire. It is perpetually and always elusive. And the OBC j petite, ah, the little, uh, object of desire, uh, which is not really an object of desire at all, but is available to satisfy need socio biologically. You can get what you need a psychoanalytically, you cannot get what you desire. Now, the obvious gloss here I think, um, is the rolling stones. Uh, if, uh, Lacan were the rolling stones and he'd had slightly rewritten the famous refrain by saying, you can never get what you want, right. But sometimes if you try and you got to try, I mean, even for what you need, you've got to hear it. You can't just sit there sometimes if you try, you can get what you need.

Speaker 1:          08:41          And so, and, and I, I'm sure that a Mick Jagger had many sticky fingers in the pages of Lacan in order to be able, in order to be able to make that important distinction. Um, but I think it's one that perhaps you might want to salt away the next time you feel confused about the distinction between desire and need. Uh, now obviously it'd be great if we could just stop there, but we do have to get a little closer to the text and try to figure out why in these terms given to us by Lacan terms, both structuralist and psychoanalytic, we have to figure out why this distinction prevails, uh, and, and, and what it amounts to. So we, we soldier on. Uh, first of all, let me just say a couple of things in passing. There's, there is, there is for humanistic studies more than one Jacques Lacan.

Speaker 1:          09:36          There is the luck call for literary studies who I think is very well represented by the text we have before us, even though some of his most important ideas are only hinted at in this text. For example, we hear nothing in this text about his famous, uh, triadic distinction among the real, the imaginary and the symbolic. This is something we can't really explore, uh, with only this text before us. And there's only the slightest hint at the very end of the essay on the last page of the distinction I've just made between the big other and the object Patea we'll have lots of time to think about that because it's central to the essay of Dziedzic that you read next week. But for literary studies, focusing on the structuralist legacy for a lot call, uh, this is an exemplary selection, but there's also the lock car.

Speaker 1:          10:29          Perhaps a more current Lacan, one better known, perhaps even to some of you have film studies, the [inaudible] of the gays, uh, the complicated dialectic of the gaze, which does very much involve up negotiating the distinctions among the real, the imaginary and the symbolic. And as I say, this luck, Huh? We're obliged largely to leave aside, uh, if only because of the selectivity of what I've given you to read. Uh, but as I say, these are, these are lock call, uh, luck cause with very, with, with quite different emphases overlapping only to a certain degree. Now the other thing I want to say in passing explains some of their other strange tone of this essay. You notice that Laca is just sort of bristling with hostility, uh, and of course as well, condescension of all the big egos. And in our syllabus, this is by far the biggest and we, and you know, it's just something we have to live with and come to terms with.

Speaker 1:          11:33          Uh, but the condescension isn't just toward the natural stupidity of all the rest of us. It's toward, in particular what he takes to be the distortion of the legacy of Freud by most of his psychoanalytic contemporaries, particularly the international psychoanalytic association, many members of whom were the so called American ego psychologist. Now what does an ego psychologist, it's somebody who begins as Lacan does too. And this is something we'll want to come back to. It's somebody who begins with Freud's famous proposition, vo s Var, Zol Zine where it was there I should be. And other words out of the raw materials of the ID, it, it s in the unconscious, the ego. That is to say the capacity of the human organism to develop into its maturity should arise. In other words, they relationship between instinctual drives and, uh, the proper inhibitions of human or adult consciousness should be a progressive one.

Speaker 1:          12:50          And the purpose of psychoanalysis, the purpose of bringing people beyond, uh, their entrapment in the various infantile stages, uh, or beyond, uh, their entrapment in some form or another of neurosis. The idea of progress or development in psychoanalysis has to do with the emergence and reinforcement of the ego. Huh? Hates this idea. And there isn't. He hates it is because that idea of the emergence of a stable and mature ego is presupposed by the idea that there is such a thing as stable human subjectivity. In other words, that there is such a thing as consciousness from which are communicated and linguistic and other sorts of systems derive laca takes a completely different view of consciousness. And this of course is something to which we will turn in a moment. But the basic disagreement and the source of his most intense hostility throughout this essay, uh, concerns the question whether or not there is for each of us a stable and by implication unique subjectivity.

Speaker 1:          14:07          We are not each other. We suppose ourselves. Indeed we complain when we think about ethics, uh, of our, about our isolation from each other. We suppose ourselves to be all together individual. Uh, uh, whereas for a lot car, um, there is a kind of continuousness in consciousness. The reason for which I'll explain at which is not absolute, uh, in the long run. And this essay you will find, and I hope to be able to understand this as a kind of turn in his argument in the long run. In this essay, you will find that Lacan does actually hold out a limited sense of individual subjectivity, not as, not really as autonomous subjectivity, not something that can, uh, that, that, that, that can authorize a sense of free will or power of agency, but a, a way in which the simplest owing simply to the complexity of the unconscious, a way in which each of us, uh, as it were and habits, a slightly different form of that complexity.

Speaker 1:          15:20          Lacan goes that far in the direction of the subject or of subjectivity, but refuses the idea that the subject that is something that can emerge from analysis, a analysis or in the case of, I suppose most of us simply through maturation as a stable, coherent, uh, uh, well organized, uh, a sense of self and identity. All right, let's start then with the one piece of really solid clinical work that Lacan ever did. Uh, la cause a psycho psycho analytic philosophy is as he would be the first to admit and even sort of tearfully to endorse, uh, largely speculative. That is to say he works, uh, in depth with philosophical and literary materials. He is, uh, uh, not glued to the analysts chair. Uh, he is a notoriously impatient with his annual exams, uh, and uh, is uh, very interested in matters of analysis either in on the one hand shortcuts or on the other hand, uh, championing Freud's late essay analysis terminable or interminable, uh, taking the side.

Speaker 1:          16:42          That analysis is just obviously such as the complexity of the thing in terminable, but they want really solid piece of clinical research that Lacan did. Uh, and that is accepted as part of the psychoanalytic psychoanalytic lore is his work that he did in the 1930s on the mirror stage. And that worked actually does generate the system of ideas that [inaudible] has to offer. So what is the mirror stage? A baby in the anal phase, that is to say no longer identifying with the abreast with the breast of the mother, but aware of a sense of difference between, uh, whatever it might be. And that otherness, which is out there, a baby views itself in the mirror. And you know, I mean, maybe it views itself like this, right? It, it, it can only crawl, you know, it can barely touch. It's knows it can't feed itself and it, and, and it's the actual nature of its body.

Speaker 1:          17:48          It's still frag fragmented and disorganized. It lacks coordination. And in fact, it lacks in any ordinary sense of the term uprightness. But you know, let's say it's looking at itself in the mirror like this. And so, you know, what it sees is something like this. It sees, in other words, it sees something which is coherent, coordinated at really rather handsome. Yo, you know, it, it says, wow, you know, I'm, I'm okay. Uh, and, and, and it acknowledges itself to be at, recognizes itself to be, it's the object of the mother's desire, right? And that is the moment in which it no longer identifies with the breast but thinks of itself as the object of the desire of another because of, because it's so pleased with itself. So somebody's gotta desire me, you know, it's probably mom, you know, so, so, so, so there it is.

Speaker 1:          18:48          Uh, and this is, and this is the moment of the mirror stage. Now what happens after that, and by the way, the rather wonderful epigraph from Leonardo Davinci, which begins your essay is all about this. What happens after that is rather tragic. The baby falls into language and in the moment of and, and, and, and I'm going to come back in a minute to the whole question. Why is it language that does this in the moment at which it falls into language? It no longer sees itself as the ideal. I, that's Eda. I'll ish in Freud's language. It no longer sees itself as the ideal eye, but it comes into the recognition that it doesn't even have its own name, let alone and identity it has the name of the father. It sort of doesn't have the Phallus of the father. And it begins to recognize competition in desire.

Speaker 1:          19:55          And it begins to recognize that what it itself desires is not accessible in a kind of mutuality of desire. And that it is, it has no choice but to admire while at the same time envying and indeed forming as an object desire because that's what it lacks the father. And that's the sense in which, uh, but, but it's, it's the father only in a phantasmagoric sense in [inaudible], the object of desire can be just absolutely anything depending on the course of the, of, of, of, of the, of, of the unraveling of a, of, of a, the men anemic sequence, uh, that desire follows. But this is what Lacan associates with the oedipal phase. And that's why I say in passing the father, and it does have something to do with luck cause revision of Freud. Uh, uh, in saying that the object of lack, the object of lack, that perpetually motivates desire.

Speaker 1:          21:04          The desire for what one lacks is not an all physical. I mean, if you make that mistake, you're right back in, in, you know, sort of mindless Freud, hedonism. You know, it's not the penis. It is on the contrary something which is by nature symbolic something which is an ego ideal. That is to say, but no longer oneself. That is to say no longer what one has, but what through the gap opened up by language. One recognizes that one lacks. And so it takes a variety of, let's just say fellow go centric forms, uh, in film criticism. Some of you may know the essay, the Lacanian Essay of Laura Molavi in which the female object of the spectators desire or gays dressed in a sheath dress is actually just like the baby. Just like anything else. It is this. In other words, it is sort of, despite being obviously an incredibly different kind of thing, nevertheless, in symbolic terms, the Fallis all right.

Speaker 1:          22:18          Now, so the question then is, why is it that it's language that does this lacoss speaks of the impossibility of realizing a and object of desire? Because the metronomic structure of desire follows what he calls an ace in [inaudible] course, a syntonic meaning the line which curves toward the lion it wants to meet but never reaches it. And there's a kind of an underlying punning sense in that word of the met anemic, uh, course of desire not revealing the symptom. It's a symbiotic in that sense as well. Uh, the only thing that can reveal the symptom is those moments of quilting. Uh, the, the moments at the plant to copy tall when metaphor, as Lakana says on two different occasions in the essay reveals the symptom. So this is what happens when you can't get ever when you can't ever get what you want. And the question is, but don't worry because you can always have what you need as long as you try.

Speaker 1:          23:32          Uh, so the question is why does language do this? What is it about language that introduces this problematic beyond repair call? It begins with an, he begins the essay with a claim about the Freud in unconscious, a claim which he takes. He says from the interpretation of dreams where Freud speaks of the relationship between condensation and displacement in the dreamwork Lacan says, the unconscious is structured like a language that's perhaps the most single expression that people take away from luck on. And rightly so, because it is again, foundational and, uh, what we need to understand, uh, if we're to get, uh, get along with him. The unconscious is structured like a language. Now what does this mean? It means that the UNCA, he doesn't say the unconscious is a language, by the way. And he doesn't say that he means the unconscious is structured exclusively like human language.

Speaker 1:          24:40          He means that the unconscious is structured like a semiotic system. And in fact, he draws from Freud's interpretation of dreams. The idea that the way the dream work works and the way everyday life and Freud sense of the psychopathology of everyday life works is like a rebus. In other words, one of those puzzles in which you can find the, an underlying sentence. If you figure out how to put together drawings, numbers, syllables, and other words, a sequence of signs taken from different semiotics systems, uh, that can put themselves together into a meaning. That's how Lacan understands the dream work and the, uh, the movements of consciousness, uh, to go. They, the unconscious then is structured like a language which is not the same thing as to say it is a language now, okay. Structured like a language. This means, and this is where there is this enormous gulf between Loc and most other practitioners of psychoanalysis, the unconsciousness is not in that case to be understood as the seat of the instincts.

Speaker 1:          25:56          It's not to be understood as something prior. In other words, to those forms of derivative articulation, those forms of articulation emerging through maturity that we're accustomed to call language. If the unconscious is structured like a language, then it, the ID s itself is precisely the signifier, the signifier that is that, that that emerges as language. Not, not that that is foundational to language because luck Han's point like the point of many other people in our syllabus is not that is not that language expresses thought. Not at all that language expresses thought, but that language constitutes thought. That language brings thought consciousness, a sense of things into being that this is articulated through language. Now this of course brings us immediately to um, certain issues, uh, of conflict that lock car has, not just with other forms of psychoanalysis, but with a whole philosophical tradition. If you are a materialist, in other words, if you believe that things come first and consciousness comes second, that is to say if you're a Marxist, if you, if, if you believe that, uh, that that consciousness ideology call it what you will is determined by existing material circumstances.

Speaker 1:          27:35          As one says, you can't very well think that existing material circumstances are produced by language. Whoa. You know, and if by the same token you're a positivist, if you believe that the meaning of things is something that is expressed by language, something that language is brought into being to express, then also you're giving priority to things to that which is behind language to that which gives rise to language rather than as Lacan does giving priority to language and he actually attacks both the Marxist tradition and the positive tradition at various points in your text. Uh, the, uh, the, the sideways blow at at Marxism is on page 1130, the right hand column, the size, what the sideways blow it. Positivism is on page 1132, uh, the right hand column. I don't want to pause, uh, to quote them. Uh, but uh, you can, you, you can go to them in, in your text.

Speaker 1:          28:38          So what is it? Id s what is what that which is normally called, uh, the instinctual drives, the Id, you know, that, you know, these are sort of the UN unmediated, uh, the, the unmediated wish for something. Well, lock on says it is nothing other than the signifier. He says, what do I mean by literalism? How else can I mean it except literally it is the letter that is to say consciousness begins with the letter. Remember Levy Strauss saying in the text quoted by Derrida, remember Levy Strauss sang. The language doesn't come into being just a little bit at a time. One day there is no language and the next day there is language which is to say suddenly there is a way of conferring meaning on things and that way of convert conferring meaning on things is differential. That is to say it introduces the arbitrary nature of the sign and the differential relations among signs which are featured in the work of so Seward so it has so it is for lock off the letter, is that not which is brought into being to express things.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Not that which is brought into being in the service of the ego to discipline and civilize the ID but rather is it itself. That is to say it is the beginning. In the beginning was the word in the beginning was the letter which disseminates consciousness through the signifying system that it makes available. Now. Actually, I'm hoping that in saying these things, you find me merely and, and, and rather dull. He repeating myself, uh, saying things that I've said before because it seems to me that this is the part of, of lock core, which is accessible and which, uh, is, is, is central to the sorts of things that we've been talking about, which I rather imagine you must be getting used to by this time. Yaka Epson lock car shares a structuralist understanding of how the unconscious discourses he accepts Jaak Upson's distinction between metaphor and Mytonomy.

Speaker 1:          31:03          And he sees the cooperative building up relationship of matter, metaphor and metonymy in the discourse of the unconscious and of the psychopathology of everyday day life in much the same way that [inaudible] does. Remember Yacob son, uh, associates matter for an autonomy, not just with poetry and prose, not just with certain kinds of style, but actually with pathologies. Uh, and it's extreme forms metaphor and my autonomy as manifest in linguistic practice, uh, take the form of Aphasias and so yuck as Lakoff points out. And so y'all cups in two is concerned with, with something sort of built in hard wired in the way in which language works. Uh, in an as the unconscious, uh, that in its extreme forms is aphasic and always expresses itself in tendencies, either met anemic or metaphoric. Now, of course, he also draws on, so sir, but as your editor rightly points out and a footnote, uh, the way in which he reads.

Speaker 1:          32:10          So sewer, the signifier, the big signifier over the signified, the little rather insignificant signified. Because after all, what does it signified matter? You can never, you can never cross the bar. All right to get to it, you are barred from it. The signified, uh, is you know, that what, which from which you are forever excluded. And we'll, we'll go into lock cons. Example of the examples of this in a minute. This is actually quite different from so sewers, uh, signified over the signifier, uh, anchored by a kind of mutuality whereby it's never a question, uh, what generates what, uh, but rather a question. And, but, but, and which has in common, I think with a lot so-called algorithm only, in fact, the bar itself, the fact that the relationship between signifier and signified or signified and signifier is an arbitrary one that can't be crossed by evoking anything natural in the nature of the signified that calls forth the signifier there they agree, but as to what produces what.

Speaker 1:          33:30          So Sarah is agnostic about it and Lacan incests that the big s, uh, is that which generates the signified that from which any possibility of grasping a signified, uh, arises and derives. So, so Lacoste Algorithm is act is in fact rather difficult, uh, different from, uh, so sewers diagram now, okay, let's, let's exemplify this, uh, by going back to what I said about the red light, right? Because here too, I think we'll have continuity, right? The red light over a door is a signifier which has a great deal to do with desire, right? Uh, this week, this we take for granted the reds, the red light in other contexts has nothing to do with desire, but the, a signifier, a red light over a door suggests desire. But desire for what? Well, we think we know desire for what, but look at the signifier. Desire for the door does, I mean, what is the relationship between the signifier and what would seem to be the signified?

Speaker 1:          34:39          Right? That's not what you desire. You don't desire the door. And it's the same with on a farm. Right? You know? So what is this [inaudible] a farm. Well, okay, the little girl says, we've arrived at gentlemen and the little boy says we've arrived at ladies. Well, that seems to be quite healthy, right? We're on our way. We're, we're, we're on our way to something like heteronormative desire. Great, terrific. But wait a minute, this, I'm here. Right? What, what does, um, what does that have to do with the price? I mean, the only thing you can do with, even behind this door is restore your personal comfort. I mean, it has nothing to do with, it has nothing to do with right, or, or anything else for that matter. Uh, and if it's the, and if the, the visible signified, uh, is in question, well, in what sense can we call this door?

Speaker 1:          35:32          Um, right and it's the same with farm and uh, there is in any case, uh, in uh, in La Cause Anecdote, um, the wonderful existence or the railroad tracks, which for him constitutes the bar. That is to say that owing to the nature of language whoring to the arbitrary relation of the signifier to the signified the little boy and little girl who are, who are wonderful characters right out of no buck off's, Ata, I don't know, I don't know if any of you know that novel, but the little boy is a sort of a little genius, obviously Lacan but his sisters even smarter than he is, she says, you know, just like a character in the Volkov. But both this little boy and little girl are barred from desire, from their desire because they have, they are already putting up with a substitute precisely in so far as they seem to be on track towards something like, uh, the heteronormative expression of desire.

Speaker 1:          36:35          It's not an expression of desire at all. It's an expression of need because they are not able to bring into being or consciousness or before themselves. The object of desire indicated by the signifier. The signifier is always displaced from the object of desire and precisely the ways that are borne out diagrammatically in, in these formulas. All right, so, um, what then is desire? Well, perhaps we've covered it. It is the, uh, endless deferral of that which cannot be signified in the Metta Nimic movement of discourse or of dreaming or of the way in which the unconscious functions and Lacan is very ingenious in showing, I think convincingly showing us how it is that we get from one signifier to another. In other words, how, what he calls the chain of the signifier works. You have a series of concentric rings, but each concentric ring is made up of a lot of little concentric rings, which Hook on to associated surrounding signifiers, uh, in ways that could be variable.

Speaker 1:          37:54          This, I think very nicely up re diagrams, so serious sense of the associate of structure of the vertical axis. That is to say, of the sin chronic moment of language, the way in which some signifiers naturally cluster with other signifiers and not just one group of signifiers, but a variety of groups of signifiers, but don't all naturally cluster with just any or all signifiers so that you get associated clusters in the access of selection. And they are indicated by this. And as the chain of signifiers unfolds, um, the one or another of these possible associations links on and remember all of these, I mean, all of these signifiers, uh, are made up in turn, have a chain of, uh, of concentric circles. So I think this is a rather good way of understanding the unfolding of, of, of autonomy. Now every once in awhile you get metaphor.

Speaker 1:          38:57          Whoa. You know, and it's a moment to be celebrated in lock con, uh, because it's as he says, poetic. And it is also, as he says in a number of places, the manifestation, the only possible manifestation of the symptom. What is the symptom? The awareness of the lack of an object of desire expressed in a displaced manner. That is to say, expressed in a manner which is not, however said, it's completely Upfest gatory of the lack of the object of desire. And it just sort of caught up in my endless battling, uh, but rather is that moment of pause in which there is a gathering together of signifiers and ultimately a substitution of one signifier for another in such a way that one says, Aha, I see it. I can't grasp it. I can't have it. But I see it. I see the object of desire.

Speaker 1:          39:56          I see what has been displaced by the very act of signification. That's what he calls metaphor. And he sees matter for as appearing at these planned to copy. Tom, think of this as a quilt. Think of this as quilting. What are your column quilting, quilting, those, you know what I'm talking about? Quilting, nuts. Pins knit. No, not needles. That's what you make a quilt with. Uh, uh, uh, those little buttons, quilting buttons, right. You know, that's what a quilt is like. He's, it's, it's, it's, it's filled with something and then, and then the, the stuffing is held in place by buttons, right? So the stuffing of men and [inaudible] signification is held in place usefully for the analyst, for the reader, for the interpreter, by these quilting buttons or plan to copy Tom. And so the example that, Yuck Yuck, I'm sorry that luck comp gives, uh, is as I say, he gives several examples there.

Speaker 1:          40:59          There are the wonderful dazzling ratings, both the four lines from Valerie and of the one line from Victor Hugo, I focus on the ego because it's a little easier just the one line. Um, he says there is something that happens in this line which is metaphoric and he, I'm delighted that he uses the word sparks. In other words, the metaphoric, the presence of the metaphor is a spark. I remember I was talking about in Wolfgang [inaudible] the need to gap a spark plug, spark plug. In other words, the need to have a certain distance between two points in order for the spark to happen. If it's too close, it doesn't happen. You can, you just share it out. And if it's too distant, it doesn't happen because you know the distance is too great. So the spark that lock cause talking about is the relationship. His sheaves were neither miserly nor spiteful as the relationship between Boaz and his sheets because the shades themselves, which give of themselves, you know, you know, just as certain other things we could mention give of itself, the sheet, the shades, the themselves, which give of themselves and certainly are not miserly or spiteful for that reason.

Speaker 1:          42:16          They're generous, they're open, they give, they feed us, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. Um, uh, are supposed in Matana me to indicate that Boaz is like that. Oh, look at the munificence of Boaz is crop. You know, it's neither miserly north spiteful, but as Lacan points out, you know, the miserliness and spitefulness comes back in an unfortunate way, precisely in that word, his, the word. Because if he is a possessor of the Sheaf, he is, he, he, this involves, uh, perhaps sort of the hole as it were, structure of capitalist or Darwinian competition, uh, and involves, at least in an underlying way, all the elements of friction, if you will, uh, and competitive envy, spite, if you will, that seem to have been banished. Uh, from the sentence. In other words, metaphorically speaking, Boaz returns in his absence, he substitutes. He is substituted for by the expression his sheets.

Speaker 1:          43:32          The possessive means that he is not the things that he said to be met, an ethnically speaking and the shades themselves are precisely what he is in the oedipal phase. That is to say precisely what he is if he is objectified by a baby looking at him, but at the same time, uh, not at all, uh, what or where we expected him to be. In other words, they plan to copy ta of the sentence of the line is the substitution of his, of boy ads for his sheaves and his sheaves for boys. The, so, so the line has both a mat anemic reading and a metaphoric reading here I think you can see lacan sense of the relation between metaphor and Matana me hovering between that of York, Epson or Brooks and that of demand, because there seems to be an underlying irreducible tension between reading the sentence as the reading the line as though it says Ma Boaz was generous and free of spite and rating the line as though it said boy as just necessarily because he's one who possesses something.

Speaker 1:          44:53          A person who has the characteristics of miserliness, miserliness and spitefulness and other, the tension in other words seems to me to be in Lacan and irreducible one, so that at least in that regard, we can place him closer to Lacan than we have a to say Brooks or [inaudible], which isn't to say that [inaudible] is not the primary and central influence on lock cons way of thinking about the access of combination, the, the, uh, the appearance of metaphor on the access of combination. They way in which we can identify these quilting buttons on the axis of common is nothing other than what Jakobsen Yacob son said and meant when he said the poetic function is the transference of the principle of equivalents from the access of selection to the axis of combination. All right, so this, uh, this, uh, I'm not saying in, in speaking, in passing of this sort of irreducible conflict, one senses between autonomy and metaphor.

Speaker 1:          46:01          Here, I'm not saying that, uh, that, uh, Jaco Epson is not the primary influence behind lock cons thinking in this regard. All right? Now, Lacan says, language is a rebus says, I've said, and he says, the movement of the signifier, which is the movement of desire, is the articulation of a lack. That is to say it is in the impossibility of as the, uh, as, as, as certain kinds of language philosophers would say, of making the signifier hook onto the signifier signified, or as we might say, hook up with the signified. The impossibility of doing that, uh, is precisely the impossibilities of realizing and object of desire. So all of this, uh, all of this should I hope now be clear. So at some of the, some of the consequences are that language and the most obvious consequence is, and this isn't the first time or last time that we will live encounter this in various vocabularies and context is that language thinks me odd.

Speaker 1:          47:12          Page 11, 42, the right hand column for example, I think where I am not therefore I am where I do not think that is to say that which, uh, that which brings my thinking into being is not present to me. It, it, it is the letter. It is the signifier which is perpetually, uh, the signified. I'm sorry to say, I meant to say which is, which perpetually evades us. Uh, and which cannot possibly be present to us. I am not present to myself. I cannot be present to myself because what is present is the way in which my self comes into being in discourse, which cannot identify me. They cannot identify me, uh, either as subject or, uh, in a phase of narcissism or a supposing I can somehow or another re imagined myself in the mirror phase as an object of desire. All right.

Speaker 1:          48:17          So, uh, I actually think that, um, without quite having meant to, I've pretty much pretty much exhausted, uh, what I have to say, an outline about luck call. I haven't said nearly enough about the relationship between desire and need as it plots itself in our actual lives and in fiction. Because the extraordinary thing about it is it's not just a slogan from the rolling stones or from Lacan as we think about it, you know, not that we're not happy with, uh, with our, with the, our relationship, with the things that we need. Obviously we are. But the extraordinary thing about it is that we recognize in our lives, in the magical world of film that is to say the world of illusion, deliberately promoted by film. Uh, and in fiction we recognize the absolutely central significance of this distinction. That's what's so wonderful and amazing about the essay by Jijak, you'll be reading for next week called courtly love, which I, which I love, uh, and which, which, which is headlines which features readings of a series of films, uh, in which the law Keynesian distinction between the impossibilities ever of achieving the big other.

Speaker 1:          49:44          By the way, there seem to be, there are times in various kinds of fictional plots in which you can actually have the object of desire. But what always happens in plots like that is that the unconscious, the psyche finds ways of rejecting it. You know, I can't have that. It's my brother or I can't, I can't have that. It is in one form or another forbidden, right? In other words, it is in actuality, in the way in which the psyche works, uh, according to the structure of the films, uh, Jijak undertakes to analyze. And he's so profused and examples that he really does leave us feeling that there's a kind of universality in what he's saying. Uh, yeah, there are all kinds of, there are all kinds of, uh, object choices that can happen and do happen. And may even seem satisfactory, but the, those are all objects of Jay Patea, whereas the big other, the, the, that, that, which is the true object of desire is something that will prevent, that will provecho perpetually evade a possession. Okay. So next time we're actually talking about the anxiety of influence and Harold bloom. And then in the ensuing lecture, we'll return in a way to lock con when we take up Deleuze Guattari and, uh, slower. Dziedzic. Thank you.
