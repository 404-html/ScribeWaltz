Speaker 1:          00:01          Last time, uh, we were giving examples of what might happen if one takes seriously that extraordinary 11th footnote and websites, the intentional fallacy in which he says the history of words after a bomb was composed may well be relevant to the overall structure of the poem and should not be avoided owing simply to a scruple about intention. That's what essentially that's what wimps that says in the footnote. So I went back to the great creator raising his plastic arm and suggested that, well, maybe after all, there might be some good way of complicating the meaning of akin side by suggesting that the modern anachronistic meaning of plastic would be relevant to the sense of the poem. This is by the way, and adjust just because one can make this claim and I think make it stick in certain cases, it doesn't mean that the proposition is any less outrageous.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I'm just doing it. Imagine a philologist being confronted with the idea that the meaning of words add a certain historical moment, uh, isn't the only thing that matters in understanding the meaning of a poem. Um, so I just wanted to give another example a little closer to home, uh, of the poem of Yates 1935 poem, Lapis Lazuli. I began talking about it. It's a forum which begins, I have heard that hysterical women say they are sick of the Palette and fiddle bow of poets that are always gay. Now this is a bar that, you know, the storm clouds of the approaching war are beginning to gather. Uh, a lot of people are saying, enough of this kind of a, you know, if feet culture, uh, we need to think about, um, important things, uh, particularly about, uh, politics and the social order. Uh, by the way, a very powerful argument in 1935, but in any case, Yates was on the other side of the controversy and insisted after all that there is a continuing role for art as indeed on the other hand, there may well be.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And he said, so he's, he's sick of everybody saying they don't want to talk about painting, they don't want to talk about music and they don't want to talk about poets who are always gay. All right. So then the poem continues. It involves, it involves a stone, a piece of Lapis Lazily, uh, that you, that that has a kind of a flaw in it, which is like a watercourse and where one can imagine, um, a pilgrim climbing, uh, toward increased enlightenment. Uh, and as the poem goes on, Yates talks about the way in which civilizations crumble. That is to say all things fall apart, but then it's possible to build them back up. And he says, all things fall and are built again. And those that build them again are gay. Now, as I said last time, needless to say, Yates was not aware of the anachronistic, meaning that we may be tempted to bring to bear on the poem.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Yates is thinking of nature is thinking of, of, of, of a word further, which probably is best translated, joyous, uh, energetically joyous. Uh, and uh, he is just borrowing that word from the translation of a book by nature. Well and good. But if you were a queer theorist or if you were interested in making a, not a week, but a strong claim for, uh, the importance of queerness in our literary tradition, you would be very tempted to say this enriches the poem, not just in other words, that they are energetically joyous as creators, but also that in our contemporary sense of the word, they're gay. Now, this again, as in the case of akin side, may or may not raise the hackles of the philologists, but there's a certain sense in which from a certain point of view, it's difficult to deny that it doesn't land a sir, that, that, that it doesn't lend a certain coherence.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Additionally complex coherence to the nature of the poem. All right, and then, you know, I mean, we have Tony the tow truck. You're probably beginning to wish I would refer to it. So why don't I, in the second line of tone of the tow truck, we learn, I live in a little yellow garage. Now, of course, the dean notation as of that of the word yellow as clearance Brooks would say, is that the garage is painted a certain color. The conotation, which undoubtedly though the author had no notion of, wasn't thinking of this is a book for toddlers. The connotation is somehow or another, there's the imputation of cowardice, possibly also the derogatory imputation of being Asian. Maybe Tony is Asian. Well, okay, well, you know, this has, this has nothing to do with the text we say. And yet at the same time, suppose it did, I mean we could interrogate it, we could interrogate the author psychoanalytically we could say, hey, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          05:27          You know, okay, so you say it was painted yellow, why don't you say it's painted some other color? And we could begin to put a certain amount of pressure on the text and possibly, as I say, begin to do things with it, um, which are a kind of five finger exercise and we'll be doing a lot more of that sort of thing, but which might work. All right. These are examples of the extraordinary implications of [inaudible] 11th footnote. And also I think, um, perhaps in advance of today's discussion clarified to some extent the importance for critics of this kind of the notion of unity. In some ways, everything we have to say today will concern the idea of unity. In other words, a connotation is valuable and ought to be invoked even if it's fill a illogically incorrect if it contributes to the unity, the complex building up of the unity of literary texts.

Speaker 1:          06:30          If on the other hand it is what got them or would call a bad prejudice, that is to say sip some aspect of my subjectivity that nothing could possibly be done with in thinking about in interpreting the text, then you throw it up. So the criteria is, is it relevant to the unified form that we as critics are trying to realize in the text and that criterion, as I say, not just for the sorts of of semi facetious readings we can do with [inaudible] 11th footnote, but also for ratings that may at least have some marginal plausibility. This sense of unity is what governs interpretive decisions of this kind. All right now a word or two about the antecedents of the new criticism and the first place, the 30s and forties, a in the academic world. Bare witness to uh, the rise of a cannon of taste, largely introduced by the great modernist writers, particularly by ts Elliot.

Speaker 1:          07:40          You may notice that Brooks for example, has a kind of done obsession. He gets that from Elliot's essay, the metaphysical poets, uh, which is a review essay of a volume of [inaudible] Donne's poems edited by somebody named Grierson, which may done overnight for a great many readers. The central poet in the English tradition. Brooks is still, as I say, very much under the influence of this. Well, Elliot in the metaphysical poets says some rather interesting things that had far reaching consequences for the new criticism. He says, poetry in our own time, such is the complexity of the world we live in. Poetry must be difficult. He says poetry has to reconcile all sorts of disparate experience. Reading spinosa the smell of cooking, the sound of the typewriter. All of this has to be yoked together in the imagery of a good poem, particularly of a metaphysical poem.

Speaker 1:          08:48          And this model of complexity is what matters both for modern literature and for literary criticism. Now, by the same token, other modernists like Jane's joys are also contributing to this idea of the independent unity of the work of art and Steven Herro portrait of the artist as a young man. You remember Steven in his disquisition on form and Aquinas and all the rest of it argues that the work of art, it's something that is cut off from its creator because its creator withdraws from it. Uh, and and simply Paris, his fingernails in the, in the famous expression. Um, it's very interesting you remember that, that in the winds at that you read last time women's at argues, I think probably thinking about that passage and Joyce, that the work of art is cut off from its author at birth. This isn't, this is an umbilical cord he's talking about.

Speaker 1:          09:49          It has no more connection with its author from birth on and roams the world on its own. And so ideas like this, as I say, are taken from the aesthetic and Pratt and practical thinking about the nature of the work of art that one finds in modernism. In the meantime, the academic setting in the 1930s when ransom in particular is writing his political manifestos, the new criticism and the world's body and attacking most of what's going on as it's being done by his colleagues. He has two things in particular in mind in the first place, old fashion philology the kind of of thinking about literary texts that would insist that plastic means what it means in the 18th century and in the set and a lot of that was being done. This is the golden age of the consolidation of the literary profession. Additions are being created.

Speaker 1:          10:53          The great learning journals are in their early phase. Knowledge is actually still being accumulated about the base having to do with the basic facts of the literary tradition that we didn't know a great deal about certain authors until this period of flourishing of philology in the very late 19th and early 20th century took hold and it, and pretty much created for us the archives that we now use today in a variety of ways. So although the new critics were fed up with philological criticism, I don't mean to be condescending toward it or to suggest that it didn't play a crucially important role in the evolution of literary studies. Now, the other thing that was going on, and here, I don't know, depending on one's viewpoint, perhaps some measure of condescension might be in order, but these two were spectacular figures. The other thing that was going on was there was a vogue for what might be called appreciative teaching.

Speaker 1:          11:54          That is, I mean, the, the contemporary and colleague of Iaa Richards at Cambridge was the famous queue, Sir Arthur quiller couch, who's left, who's, who's mesmerizing lectures, um, had virtually no content at all. They were simply evocations appreciative evocations of great works. Of Literature. And I have to say that it yell exactly contemporary with queue. We had a similar figure. The person after whom felt skate is named the Great William Lyon Phelps who would enter the classroom, begin rapturously to quote Tennyson would clasp his hands and say that that was really good stuff. Uh, and the students were, and, and, and the students were so appreciative that they gave hundreds and thousands of dollars to the university, uh, ever after. Um, the, in other words, this is valuable teaching, but, but, but again, you know, but, but again, the new critics were fed up with it. This was the atmosphere they found themselves in and what they wanted.

Speaker 1:          12:59          And this anticipates the atmosphere that you'll, you'll see the Russian formalists found themselves in when we turned them, turned to them next week, what they wanted with something like rigor or a scientific basis or some sort of set of principles that could actually be invoked so that the business of credits, criticism could be, could become more careful and systematic, less scattershot, less effusive, and so on. So this is, this is in effect the backdrop, uh, in which, um, in the American academy but influenced as we'll now see, uh, by certain trends in the British Academy, uh, arose in the 30s and in the forties. All right. Now the first figure I want to talk a little bit about in the first figure whom you read it for. Today's assignment is I a Richards Richards, ah, before he became a, before he joined the English department at Cambridge was actually a psychologist and trained as a Pavlovian psychologists so that when you read, uh, in his essay about stimuli and needs, uh, you see pretty much where you stand.

Speaker 1:          14:15          It is, I mean his sense of the way in which the mind reacts to the world to its experience, the way in which, uh, it's an uncomplicated reaction or a resisting reaction or a, an adjusting reaction all has very much to do with Pavlovian principles. Uh, and these governed to some extent Richard's his understanding of his boat, even of his literary vocation. Um, during the period when he wrote 1924 when he wrote principles of literary criticism for Richards reading is all about experience. That is to say the way in which the mind is affected by what it reads. And so even though, uh, his subject matter is literature, he is nevertheless constantly talking about human psychology. That is to say what need is answered by literature, how the psyche responds to literature, what's good and bad about psychic responses and so on. This is th th th this is the intellectual focus.

Speaker 1:          15:23          In other words of Richard's his work. Now another thing, another aspect of his having been and continuing to be a scientist is that Richard's really did believe, seriously believed in reference. That is to say in the way in which language really can hook onto the world. Verifiable and falsifiable statement is for Richard's the essence of scientific practice. And he cares very much about that, that it's not, I mean he does not, in other words, share with so many literary critics, perhaps even with Brooks who follows him and making the fundamental distinction I'm about to describe it. He does not share with the majority of literary critics and artists, uh, uh, kind of distaste for science. I mean, he, and this by the way is also true of his student Samson who was a math major before he became an English major. Both of them, uh, take very seriously, uh, a the notion that there can be a scientific basis for what one does in English or in literary studies.

Speaker 1:          16:29          So another aspect of it for Richards is because he takes science so seriously, is that he actually reverses the idea that we talked about last time in Sydney and cotton and Coleridge and wild and whimsy, that he actually reverses the idea that it's art that's autonomous. If you look on page seven, 66 in the left hand column, you'll find him saying that science is autonomous to, and what he means by that is that scientific facts can be described in statements without the need for any kind of psychological context or any dependency on the varieties of human need. It is autonomous in the sense that it is a pure, um, uncluttered and [inaudible] influenced declaration of fact or falsehood. Then he says to declare science autonomous is very different from subordinating all our activities to it. And here's where poetry comes in. It is merely to assert that so far as anybody of references is undistorted, it belongs to science.

Speaker 1:          17:41          It is not in the least to assert that no references may be distorted if advantage can thereby gained be gained. And just as there are innumerable human activities which require undistorted references, scientific activities if they are to be satisfied. So there are innumerable other human activities, not less important, which equally require distorted references or more plainly fictions. Here you see Richard's is basic distinction between what he calls scientific statement and what he calls emotive statement. The distinction between, uh, between that which is truly referential, that which is in controvert, controvert ugly, verifiable or falsifiable on the one hand, and that which is emotive. Later on, Richard's changes his vocabulary and he no longer talks about scientific and emotive language. He talks instead even more dangerously from the standpoint of anybody who likes poetry. He talks instead of statement, meaning science and pseudo statement, leading poetry.

Speaker 1:          18:53          I mean here, we're really out on a limb if you're going to defend poetry, has Richards kept doing as pseudo statement, but of course pseudo statement is just another expression for what he calls here fiction. Now, why on earth once we sort of settle into this vocabulary and once we get used to this clearly a unquestioningly scientific perspective, why on earth do you need pseudo statement or fiction at all? We know very well by the way, that they're are scientists to simply cannot stand to read poetry because it's fault. Right? You know, it's, I mean it, it just as Richard says, you know, poetry, there's a, so there's, there's, there's always something kind of archaic or atavistic about poetic thinking. It's not just that, it's not trying to tell the truth as Sydney said, nothing lives because it never afirma's not just that, it's not trying to tell the truth. It is in fact said Richard's go so far as to say following Plato. It is in fact lying poetry. Poetry is constantly getting itself in trouble and in all sorts of ways. Um, and the all, I mean on page seven 68, for example, I know it seven 68, although I can't find my reference in the lecture, see if I can see if I can find it in the book. Um,

Speaker 2:          20:15          okay, it

Speaker 1:          20:16          is evident and he says at the top, sort of toward the top of the right hand column seven 68, it is evident that the bulk of poetry consists of statements which only the very foolish would think of attempting to verify. They are not the kinds of things which can be verified pack of lies, pack, you know, I mean, and then we say, you know, it usually follows from this that somebody liked this points out that whereas we all know that the democratic society is the best society to live in. Poetry prefers society. It makes better poetry and what, whereas we all, and whereas we all know that the universe is of a certain kind, uh, we can't even call it Copernican anymore. Poetry has this odd preference for Ptolemaic astronomy and in, in other words, everything about poetry is atavistic. It's a throwback to some earlier way of thinking.

Speaker 1:          21:08          There's some kind of late primitivism in poetic thinking. Um, and Richard scenes cheerfully to embrace this idea. That's what he means by fiction or suit. PSEUDOS taper. So why on earth do we want it? We want it according to Richards because it answers needs in our psychological makeup that science can't answer. In other words, we are, you know, a chaos of desires. Some of them are involved. The desire for truth that is to say for what we can learn from science, but a great many of our desires have nothing to do with any notion of truth, but rather our needs that require fanciful or imaginative fulfillment, fulfillment of other kinds. And the reason this fulfillment is important and can be valued is according to Richards that these needs, unless they are organized, harmonized so that they work together in what he sometimes calls a synthesis can actually tear us apart.

Speaker 1:          22:21          Literature is what can't reconcile conflicting or opposing needs. And Richard's cares so much about this basic idea that in another text, not in the text you've just read, he says, shockingly, poetry is capable of saving us. In other words, poetry is capable of doing. Now what religion used to do poetry and rubber, if this is a scientist, poetry is no more true than religion, but it can perform the function of religion and is therefore capable of saving us. And so even despite the seeming derogation of the very thing that he purports to be celebrating in books like the principles of literary criticism, Richard's does hold out an extraordinarily important feeling for the mission of poetry to harmonize conflicting needs. That's the role of poetry and that's what it does. Simply by evoking our wishes, our desires, irrespective of truth in there, complicated, chaotic form and synthesizing them organically into something that amounts to psychological piece, something that leaves us, it's a little bit like Aristotle's idea of Catharsis, which can be understood in a variety of ways, but Milton at the end of Samson agonists, these understands it in one way.

Speaker 1:          24:00          When he says, now we have as a result of this tragedy, calm of mind, all passion spent. That could be the motto to Richards, his work, the experience of art, the experience of poetry, the reconciliation of conflicting needs, results in a kind of catharsis, calm of mind, all passion spent. All right. Now Richard's had a student, an undergraduate student, William Thompson, who had, as I say, had been a math major who decided he'd switched to English. He went to Richardson and he said, Hey, he had an idea about ambiguity. He said he thought he thought there was quite a bit that could be written about it. Um, and so he wondered if Richard's would mind if, if maybe he worked on that. Richard said, fine, fine. Sounds terrific. Uh, go do it. So a few months later, Amston brought him the manuscript of one of the greatest books of criticism in the 20th century and one of the most amazingly surprising seven types of ambiguity.

Speaker 1:          25:07          The brief excerpt you have in your packet. I trust that you have picked it up by this time at Tyco, your photocopy packet. The brief excerpt you have from Samson is taken from seven types of ambiguity. Um, I think [inaudible] is the funniest. A person who has ever written literary criticism. Uh, I think that his dead pan way of bringing things down to earth when they get a little too high Falutin, uh, is, you know, involves the skill of a genuine stand up comic. Uh, his timing is perfect. Uh, he has, in other words, all of the, all the attributes of a great comic writer. Uh, I enjoyed reading him so much that when I was asked to write a book about him, I agreed to do so. Um, I've always been like that. I enjoyed that Byron was the only person I enjoyed reading during the nail biting and tense period of studying for my orals.

Speaker 1:          26:05          So I wrote my dissertation on Byron as a result of that. Um, nothing complicated, no deep reason for doing these things, but Amsa and I hope you enjoy, uh, he's a page Turner. Uh, and his extraordinary brilliance as a critic, a is really just part of the experience of reading him. Uh, I'm particularly interested in the, in the excerpt you have in what he does with his notion of, because this is his way of responding to enthusiastic or appreciative criticism. One of the tricks of Q and Billy [inaudible], Billy Phelps and [inaudible] and all the other sort of authors and lecturers in this mode was to say that they read for atmosphere that, that that was something that one just felt along ones bloodstream or in the pulses. One, one encountered great literature and their purpose as lecturers and as critics was to evoke the atmosphere of things.

Speaker 1:          27:10          And so absent says, well, you know, atmosphere, certainly, uh, certainly that exists and we can talk about it and all sorts of ways. Um, but after all, what is the use of atmosphere? What does the use of any aspect of literature? If as good scientist, we can't analyze it if we can't somehow or another account for it. If there is atmosphere in the passage I'm about to quote from Macbeth, it must be atmosphere of a certain kind and there for a certain reason. And what follows it seems to me is one of the most staggeringly beautiful, wonderful, amazing rifts, uh, on a passage of literature that you can encounter. I'm sorry if I sound a little bit like Billy Phelps, but I do get, I do get excited. Um, uh, he quotes, he quotes the passage from Macbeth, uh, as Amston says, uh, you know, the murderers have just left the room and, and uh, Macbeth is sort of twiddling his thumbs hoping it's getting dark because it's got to get dark before Banquo can be killed.

Speaker 1:          28:13          So natural he looks out the window, see just to see how the time is going. Um, and uh, and this is what he says, come ceiling nights, scarf up the tender. I have pitiful day that with thigh bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces that great bond that keeps us Pale amps and doesn't mention this word Pale, but in juxtaposition with the crows and Rooks, it strikes me that it itself is an interesting woman in the passage light thickens and the crow makes wing to the rookie. Would Anson Italicize that? Because while he has something to say about every part of the passage, which all good criticism by the way, should do you quote something. So he's not thinking about all of it. Okay. Uh, and, but, but, but, but, but, but, but Anson italicized is these particular lines because it's going to be the true focus of what he'll say later.

Speaker 1:          29:08          Good things of day begin to droop and drowse while nights black agents to their praise, do rouse Dow marvel step my words, but hold these lady Macbeth has come into the room, you know, so now marvels at my words, but hold the still things bad begun, make strong themselves by ill. So pretty. Go with me. All right. So Amston is fascinated by this passage and then he gets the, he gives you in the next few paragraphs, the amazing variety of grounds for his fascination. Um, and he says, look, this is, this is what people mean when they talk about atmosphere. It's not just something you feel on your pulse. It's something that can be described. Something that can be analyzed. And I just want to touch on the last part of it. He says, rooks live in a crowd and I mainly vegetarian absence. Allison's the person who says that, uh, that the ancient mariner shot the Albatross because the crew was hungry.

Speaker 1:          30:06          He points out that I'm 17, 1998 edition of the rime of the ancient mariner a biscuit worms had gotten into the hardtack. So naturally he says the particular kinds of Albatross that the Marriner shot, I am told makes it very tolerable broth. This is, this is the mode of William Hansen. Uh, and so and so he begins here, Brooks live in a crowd and are mainly vegetarian, cro, maybe either another name for rook, especially when scene alone or it may mean the solitary carrion crow. This subdued pun, this ambiguity. Remember, this is a book about ambiguity. This subdued pawn is made to imply here that Mac Beth looking out of the window is trying to see himself as a murderer and can only see himself as in the position of the crow, that his day of power now is closing. That he has to distinguish himself from the other rooks by a difference of name, Rook Crow, like the kingly title.

Speaker 1:          31:12          Only that he is anxious at bottom to be one with the other rooks not to murder them, that he can no longer or that he may yet be United with the rookery and that he is murdering Banquo in a for Lauren attempt to obtain peace of mind. Well, I just, I'm not at all sure there's anything more to be said about that passage, which is debt, which, which, which I think lays to rest. And it does. So by insisting on a complex mode of ambiguity that governs the path, not atmosphere, short call it atmosphere if you like, as long as you're willing to subject it to verbal analysis, as long as you're willing to show how and why the atmosphere is exactly of the nature that it is, that it arises and other words. And here is um, the relationship between Rick Richards and Anson, that it arises out of a complex state of mind that poetry, the poetry of this speaker, speaker slash murderer, that poetry is attempting desperately to reconcile, to harmonize just as he is attempting desperately to be reconciled and harmonized with the society from which he has alienated himself.

Speaker 1:          32:34          And of course failing Macbeth is not Shakespeare. Shakespeare is poetry. Attempting to do something which in the immediate psychological circumstances it can't do, but in the process, evoking an extraordinary complexity of effort on the part of the mind to be reconciled through the medium of language. As I say, this is the sense in which amps and follows Richards, but at the same time there's something rather different between, first of all, Anson Anson doesn't really kind of settle into a sense that it's all about the reader that has to say it's, it's, it's all about the reader's experience of the literary. Richard's is actually an Avatar of figures like either like a Hans Robert Galson, Stanley fish who, and we'll be discussing later in the syllabus who are interested in reader response. That is to say, and the way in which we can talk about the structure of reader experience.

Speaker 1:          33:39          Amazon is sort of interested in that and just as he's the adjusted, he's fascinated by the texture of, of, of, of textual evidence itself. And he is also very interested, much more so than Richards and certainly more so than the new critics from whom he sharply diverges in advance. In this respect. He's also much more interested in authorial intention. That is to say for him, literary criticism is always an appeal to authorial attention. Mind you, he ascribes to authorial attention the most amazingly outrageous things that other critics threw up their hands in despair about. But nevertheless it is for him always still an appeal to authorial attention at bottom. Anson doesn't really settle into the rigorous consideration of the author or of the text or of the reader as, as it were a separate functions for Anson. There's a kind of a fluid and easy movement back and forth between what for hermeneutics are three very different phenomena, author, text, reader, um, for Ramson it's, it's, it's a kind of synthetic may launch that appeal that that's ultimately and appealed to the author.

Speaker 1:          35:01          That certainly involves both the working on the text itself and also understanding its effect on, on the reader. So all of this, uh, distances, Anson from Richard's to a certain extent. But the most important difference I think between Anson and the other figures were discussing a difference, which makes it even a little bit complex to say that he's a precursor of the new criticism is that Anson very rarely concerns himself with the whole of a text. He isn't really interested in the of the poem is simply interested in saying as much as he can about certain locally facts. Certainly with the implication possibly that this has a bearing on our understanding of let's say the whole of Macbeth, but he doesn't set about doing a systematic reading of the whole of Macbeth. He always zooms in on something, thinks about it for a while, and then goes away and thinks about something else.

Speaker 1:          36:02          Leaving us to decide whether it has a genuine bearing on the entirety or on the literary wholeness or unity of Macbeth. Anson is interested in the complexity of local effects. And another thing to say about Emerson's perspective, which makes him differ sharply, I think from Richards and from the later new critics, is that Anson is perfectly willing to accommodate the idea that maybe just as in the case of the psychology of Mac Beth, the character that may be poetry doesn't reconcile conflicting needs maybe after all poetry is x is an expression of the irreducible conflict of our needs. The s the last chapter of seven types of ambiguity. His seventh ambiguity is actually as amps and said about some fundamental division in the writer's mind. There you see he divergence from his teacher Richards. He's fascinated by the way in which literature doesn't unify opposites or reconcile needs but leaves things as it found them, but exposed in all of their complexity.

Speaker 1:          37:18          Polderman more than once invoked Amston as a precursor of deconstruction, not of the new criticism and for this reason, for the reason that he's not concerned with unity and that he's not concerned with the idea of the reconciliation of opposites. Empson I think can rightly be understood as a freakin precursor of deconstruction because deconstruction follows the new criticism of course, and being a mode of close reading and there has never been a better close reader then Anson, but it needs to be set before turning away from Anson who's influenced was widespread despite this divergent. It needs to be said that his purposes for close reading are actually very different from the purposes of the new criticism. New critics, the American new critics, particularly Brooks, who's preoccupation with unity is something he freely confesses. Uh, and something that, uh, well we've got 10 minutes, so I'm not going to, I shouldn't, I shouldn't rush ahead prematurely up something that you can see to be at the heart of what Brooks is doing.

Speaker 1:          38:29          Now here he works Brooks in the well rod earn and modern poetry in the, and the other books for what she's well known uses a variety of different words to describe the way in which the complexity of literature is placed in the service of unification. In the essay you're reading here, he uses the word irony. He admits that maybe he stretches the word irony, but he tries to argue that the variety of effects that he focuses on in his essay, uh, have to do with irony. And another great essay, the first, the first chapter of the well rod earn, he talks about paradox. Obviously these are related ideas and elsewhere he takes up other ways of evoking the way in which sort of complex feelings and thoughts are brought together. Um, ensigns word ambiguity, uh, continues to play an important role in the work of the new criticism.

Speaker 1:          39:27          And, uh, and it is, uh, at least it puts itself forward as a candidate to be an alternative term that one might use if one got tired of saying irony or paradox. There are a variety of words. In other words and other words given by the poet critic Allen Tate, one of the founding figures of the new criticism is tension. That is to say the way in which, uh, the literary text resolves, uh, oppositions, uh, um, uh, as a tension that it's a holding in suspension of conflict, experienced as tension. So there are these varieties of ways for describing what's going on in a text. It's interesting, I think that if one thinks of donated the tow truck, um, one can think of the, at the, uh, when you go home and study it, you'll see what I mean. Uh, there's a complex pattern of imagery as it were, between pulling and pushing.

Speaker 1:          40:26          There's a tremendous amount of pulling and pushing that goes on in Tony. The tow truck will revert to, especially to the notion of pushing in other contexts later in the course. But for the moment you can see, uh, the way in which there is a tension between that which pulls and that which pushes, which is one of the motive forces of the story. Uh, and that I think is an example also if there is, if it is ironic that Tony is now stuck and instead of pulling needs to be pushed, if it is in some Brooks in sense, ironic that that is the case. Uh, we can understand that as irony or as tension or ambiguity. So in any case, uh, that, you know, there's one way and there's one way in which Tony is probably not a good proof text for the new criticism.

Speaker 1:          41:17          You remember that in my credo, the little, the little sort of excerpt that you get at the beginning of the book section in your anthology, Brooke says, um, poetry should be about moral things, but it shouldn't point a moral that and obviously, you know, uh, tone of the tow truck points immoral. Um, and so would be subject to a kind of devaluation on those grounds. Uh, but, but the new criticism, even though there are ways of reading, Tony, as I've been suggesting new critically right now, the ideal of unity for Brooks, for the new critics in general is that it be complex that it warp the statements of science that it bring to bear a tension between the denotation and the connotation of words that were yellow in the second line of Tony, the tow truck, it's denotation is that it is a certain color, the color that Tony's garages painted.

Speaker 1:          42:22          The connotation I have suggested is of the variety of kinds that one might gingerly approach. Uh, in thinking about complicating the texture of the story, uh, in any case, uh, the tension between Dana rotation and connotation is part of the way in which irony works. So the question again is, and the question it seems to me raised in advanced by Amston is why should these sorts of tension, these, these movements of, of complex reconciliation result in unity. Uh, it's very interesting. Brooks is reading if she dwelt among on common ways. The Wonderful Lucy poem by Wordsworth emphasizes the irony of the poem Brookfield's that he's on very thin ice talking about Wordsworth, Ian Irony at all, but at the same time, you know, does bring it out rather beautifully talking about the irony of the poem, uh, basically as the way in which you can't really say that Lucy can be a flower and a star simultaneously.

Speaker 1:          43:27          She's a flower, she's perishable, she's half hidden, uh, she's ultimately dead and in the ground. Uh, whereas a star, uh, would seem to be something that she just can't be mapped onto. If she is this half hidden thing, but at the same times work says, well after all she is a star to the speaker. He's just saying she's a star to me. She has a flower half hidden, uh, unnoticed to everyone else. And the relationship between the depth of the speakers feeling and the obscurity of Lucy in the world is the irony that the speaker wants to lay hold of. And that reconciles, uh, what seem like disparate facts in the poem. Well now I just want to point out that close reading can always be pushed farther. That's the difficulty about close reading. You know, it's all very well to say, look at me, I'm reconciling harmony's, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm creating patterns.

Speaker 1:          44:27          I'm, I'm showing the purpose of image clusters and all the rest of it. But if you keep doing it, once you have yoked together, becomes on yoked again, it falls apart. Or at least it threatens to do so. A contemporary of Brooks is named FW Bateson wrote an essay on this same poems she dwelt among on tried and ways in which he points out this is the palms on page eight oh two in which he points out that the poem is full of oxymorons contradictions in terms untrodden ways away as a path. But how can they be a path if it's not trodden? What? What is the meaning of an untrodden way or in an or? There are none to praise her, but very few to love. Why? Why call attention? Not so much to the difference between few lover and non praiser as the notion that non praiser this is palpably false because here's the poet praising her, right?

Speaker 1:          45:32          So what does he mean? None? Why is he calling attention? In other words to this, this, this logical disparity she lived unknown and few could know. How can she be unknown if you know anything about her. In other words, the palm is full of, not of of complexities, but who says they're being reconciled. They're just sitting there. Oxymoronic Lee, you know, not reconciling themselves at all. So Bates, his argument is that Wordsworth is calling attention to a, to a conflict of emotion or feeling that can't be reconciled. Hence the path those of the ending. Oh, the difference to me and so on. And this, as I say, uh, is a different use of close reading. It's close reading, which is not in the service of unity or of unification, but recognizes that the very arts whereby we see a thing as a unified whole can just as easily be put to the purpose of blasting it apart again and, uh, and, and of calling our attention to that, which can't be reconciled just as the speaker can't be reconciled to the death of Lucy.

Speaker 1:          46:51          Now the new critics can, I think, be criticized for that reason. And the aftermath of the, the historical close reading aftermath of the new criticism does precisely that. The, if, if one sees deconstruction as a response to the new criticism and it's not just that as we'll see, it's a great many other things to that response consists essentially in saying, look, you can't just arbitrarily tie a ribbon around something and say, Aha, it's a unity, right? The ribbon comes off, things fly apart as the poet. Uh, and uh, it's not a unity after all. Uh, there is another aspect of the way in which the new criticism has been criticized for the last 40 or 50 years, which needs to be touched on. The notion of autonomy, the notion of the freedom of the poem from any kind of dependence in the world is something that is very easy to undermine.

Speaker 1:          47:56          Critically. Think of Brooks's analysis of Randall, Gerald's eighth air force. It concludes on the last page of the essay by saying this is a bomb about human nature, about human nature under stress. Whether or not human nature is or is not good. And arguments of this kind arguments of the kind set forth by the poem can make better citizens of us. In other words, the experience of reading poetry is not just an aesthetic experience. It's not just a question of private reconciliation, of, of conflicting needs. It's a social experience on this view. And the social experience is intrinsically a conservative one. In other words, it insists on the need to balance opinions, to balance viewpoints to balance needs precisely in a way which is of course, uh, in implicitly a kind of social and political centrism. In other words, how can poetry on this view, how can literature be progressive for that matter?

Speaker 1:          49:05          How can it be reactionary? How, in other words, can it be put to political purposes if there's this underlying, this implicit centrism in this notion of reconciliation, harmonization balance. And that is has been a frequent source of the criticism of the new criticism, uh, in its aftermath over the last 40 or 50 years. There's also the question of religion. There's a kind of implicit Episcopalian perspective that you see in Brooks is essay, what he's talking about, the Shakespeare poem, uh, in which, um, in which under the aspect of eternity, inevitably things here on earth seem ironic. And, and there is always, there's, there's that play of thought, uh, uh, throughout, uh, the thinking of the new criticism as well. Naturally, one will think of things in ironic terms. If one sees them from the perspective of the divine or of the eternal moment.
