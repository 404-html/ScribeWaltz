Speaker 1:          00:01          So today we turned to, uh, a mode of doing literary criticism, which was extraordinarily widespread in beginning in the late seventies and into the 80s, uh, called the new historicism. It was, uh, it definable in ways that I'll, that I'll turn to in a minute. And, uh, as I say, prevalent to a remarkable degree everywhere. Uh, it began probably at the University of California at Berkeley, uh, under the auspices and part of Steven Greene Blat, who's a brief essay you've read for today, Greenblatt and others, uh, founded a journal, still one of the most important and influential journals in the field of literary study called Representation's. Um, always has been, still is an Oregon for new historicist thought. Uh, it's the movement which began, uh, primarily preoccupied with the early modern period, so called renaissance. The new historicism, uh, is in effect, responsible for the replacement of the term renaissance with the term, uh, early modern, uh, and, uh, it's influence, however quickly did extend to other fields.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Um, some fields perhaps more than others. It would be, I think, probably worth a lecture that I'm not going to give to explain why certain fields somehow or another, seem to lend themselves more readily to new historicist approaches than others. I think it's fair to say that in addition to the early modern period, the three fields that have been most influenced by the newest eracism CISM or the 18th Century British Romanticism, uh, and Americanists Studies, uh, from the, uh, late colonial through the Republican period, uh, the age, the emergence of print culture, the emergence of the public sphere, uh, as a medium of influence. And the distribution of knowledge, uh, in the United States has been a very fruitful, he studied from new historicist points of view. So those are the fields that are, that are most directly influenced, uh, by this approach. Uh, when you read it went, when we discussed the German McGann's essay, you'll see how, uh, it influences, uh, romantic studies.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Uh, now the newest Doris CISM, um, is, was, and this probably accounts for its remarkable popularity and influence, uh, in the period roughly from the late seventies through the early nineties, the newest Doris and was a response to an increasing sense of ethical failure and the isolation of the, as it was allegedly practiced in certain forms of literary study, beginning with the new criticism through the period of deconstruction, uh, the recondite a discourse of Lacan and others. In psycho analysis, there was a feeling widespread among scholars, especially younger scholars that somehow or another, uh, especially in response to pressing concerns, a sort of post Vietnam concerns with globalization concerns with the distribution of power, uh, uh, and um, uh, and global capital. Uh, all of these concerns, um, uh, inspired what one can only call a guilt complex in a academic literary scholarship and led to a return to history.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Uh, it was felt that, um, that a kind of ethical tipping point had been arrived at, uh, and that the, uh, modes of analysis that had been flourishing, um, needed to be superseded by modes of analysis in which a history and the political implications of what one was doing, uh, became prominent. And Central. Uh, I have to say that, uh, in debates of this kind, there's always a considerable amount of hot air perhaps on both sides. Uh, in many ways it's not the case that the so-called isolated approaches really were isolated. A deconstruction in its second generation, uh, wrote perpetually about history, uh, and undertook to Orient, uh, the techniques of deconstruction to an understanding of history. Uh, just to give one example and the new historicism on the other hand, um, events, a preoccupation with issues of form and textual integrity that, uh, certainly followed from the disciplines, the approaches that preceded them.

Speaker 1:          05:06          And also to a large degree. And this is of course true of a good many other approaches that we're about to investigate approaches based in questions of identity. Also to a large degree appropriated the language of the generation of the deconstructionists. And to a certain extent, certain underlying was died is having to do with the binder of binary relationship between self and other binary relationships among, uh, uh, social entities, uh, as opposed to linguistic entities, but still, as I say, inheriting, uh, the essentially inheriting the structure of thought of preceding approaches. So as I say, it was in an atmosphere, in a polemical atmosphere and at a moment of uh, widespread self doubt in, uh, the academic literary profession that the new historicism came into its own a response, as I say, to the isolation of the text by certain techniques and approaches to it.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Now, very quickly, the method of new historical analysis, uh, fell into a pattern, a very engaging one, one that's wonderfully exemplified by the brief introduction of Greenblatt that is, uh, that, that, that I've asked you to read a pattern of beginning with an anecdote, uh, often, uh, rather far afield, at least apparently rather far afield from the literary issues that are eventually turned to, uh, in the argument of a given essay. A Dusty Miller was walking down the road, uh, thinking about nothing in particular when he encountered a bailiff, you know, uh, and then certain legal issues arise. Uh, and uh, somehow or another, the next thing you know, we're talking about king lear. Uh, this, uh, rather marvelous, um, oblique way into a literary topics was um, going to, uh, the brilliance in handling it of Greenblatt in particular and Louie Mantrose and some of his colleagues.

Speaker 1:          07:22          This, uh, this technique, um, became a kind of a hallmark of the new historicism in the long run. Of course. Uh, it was easy enough, uh, to parody it and it has been subjected to parody, uh, and in a certain sense has, uh, been modified and chastened by the prevalence of parity. Uh, but nevertheless, um, I think, um, shows you something about the way new, newer historicist thinking works. It is the newest or us isn't, is interested following food co and Fuko is the primary interest on the new historicism. I won't say as much, uh, about this today as I might feel obliged to say if I weren't soon be going to return to Fukiko. And the context of Gender Studies, uh, when we take up Fuko and Judith Butler together. But I will say briefly that food co's writing, especially his later writing, is about the pervasiveness, the circulation through social orders of what he calls power.

Speaker 1:          08:31          Now, power is not just, or in many cases in Foodco, not even primarily the power of vested authorities, the power of violence, uh, the power of tyranny from above power in Fuko though it can be those things and frequently is, is much more pervasively. And also insidiously the way in which knowledge circulates in a culture. That is to say the way in which what we think, what we think, that it is appropriate to think, uh, acceptable thinking is distributed by largely unseen forces in a social network or social system. Power. In other words, in food co is in a certain sense, knowledge, or to put it another way, it is the explanation of how certain forms of knowledge come to exist. Knowledge, by the way, not necessarily have something that's true. Certain forms of knowledge come to exist in certain places. So all of this is central to the work of Fuko and is carried over by the new historicist.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Hence the interest for them of the anecdote. Start as far a field as you can imagine, ugly start from what you will finally be talking about, which is probably some textual or thematic issue in, in Shakespeare or in the Elizabethan mask or whatever the case may be. Start as far afield as you possibly can from that precisely in order to show the pervasiveness of a certain kind of thinking, the pervasiveness of a certain social constraint or limitation on freedom. If you can show how pervasive it is, you reinforce and justify the food called in idea. That power is, as I've said, uh, uh, and insidious and ubiquitous mode of circulating knowledge. So all of this is implicit, sometimes explicit in new historicist approaches to what they do, what they do.

Speaker 1:          10:57          So as I said, Fuko is the crucial antecedent. Uh, and of course, when it's a question of who co literature as we want to conceive of it, perhaps generically or as a particular kind of utterance as opposed to other kinds, does tend to collapse back into the broader or more a general notion of discourse. Uh, because it's discourse, it's by means of discourse that power circulates knowledge. Uh, once again, you know, despite the fact that historicism wants to return us to the real world, it nevertheless acknowledges that that return is language bound. It is by means of language that the real world, uh, uh, shapes itself. That's why for the new historicist and we will buy this means I'll turn it in a moment to the marvelous anecdote with which Greenblatt begins the brief essay that I've asked you to read. That's why the new historicist lays such, such intense emphasis on the idea that the relationship between discourse call it literature if you like, you might as well.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Uh, the relationship between history and discourse is reciprocal. Yes. History conditions, what literature can say in a given epoch. History is an important way of understanding. Uh, the valence see of certain kinds of utterance at certain kinds. In other words, history is as it's traditionally thought to be by the old historicism, and I'll get to that in a minute. History has a background to discourse or literature, but by the same token, there is an agency that has to say a capacity to circulate power in discourse. In turn, call it literature. I am Richard the second. No you not, that says Queen Elizabeth when at the time of the threatened Essex uprising, she gets wind of the fact that Richard the second is being performed as she believes in the public streets and in private houses. In other words, wherever there is sedition, wherever there are people who want to overthrow her and replace her with the Earl of Essex, the pretender to the throne, Richard the second is being performed well.

Speaker 1:          13:43          Now, this is terrifying to Queen Elizabeth because she knows she's a supporter of the theater. She knows that Richard, the second is about a king who has many virtues, but a certain weakness, political weakness, and also weakness of temperament, guide of weakness that makes him, you know, sit upon the ground and tell sad tales about the death of kings. You know, that kind of weakness who is then user served by Bolingbroke who became Henry the fourth. Ah, introducing a whole new, uh, dynasty. Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and, and focus of, of the royal family in England. Queen this Queen Elizabeth says they're staging this plot because they're trying to compare me with Richard the second and preparation for deposing me and who knows what else they might do to me. So everything you know, is this, this is a matter of great concern. In other words, literature.

Speaker 1:          14:46          I mean, Fredric Jameson says, history hurts, literature hurts to literature, and other words has a discursive agency that affects history every bit as much as history affects literature, literature out there, theater, especially if, if it escapes the confines of the playhouse. Because as Greenblatt argues, the playhouse has a certain mediatory effect, which diffuses the possibilities of sedition. Uh, w one views, uh, literary representation in the playhouse with a certain objectivity, perhaps that is, that is absent altogether when interested parties take up the same text and stage it precisely for the purpose of fomenting rebellion. Um, and so, uh, literature, especially when Kate went, when escaped from its conventional confines, uh, becomes a very, very dangerous or positive influence depending on your point of view on the course of history. So the relationship between history and discourse is reciprocal. Now in this, uh, Greenblatt wants to argue very v w with a tremendous amount of stress and I think effectiveness in this, uh, the new historicism differs from the old historicism page 1443 and the right hand column, John Dover Wilson, a traditional Shakespeare scholar, and a very important one is the spokesperson in Greenblatt's scenario for the old historicism.

Speaker 1:          16:29          And so the view I'm about to quote is that of Don John Dover Wilson, a kind of consensus about the relationship between literature and history. Modern historical scholarship, meaning old historicism has assured Elizabeth that she had this as the right hand column, but two thirds of the way down has assured Elizabeth that she had nothing to worry about. Richard. The second is not at all subversive, but rather a him to tutor ordered the play far from encouraging thoughts of rebellion, regards the deposition of the legitimate king as a sac religious act that drags the country down into an abyss of chaos that Shakespeare and his audience regarded Bolingbroke as a usurper declares John Dover Wilson is incontestable but in 1601 neither Queen Elizabeth nor the Earl of Essex. We're so sure green black wins. I mean, it's a wonderful example. It's the genius of Greene Blat to choose examples that are so telling.

Speaker 1:          17:38          And so in controvertible we know Queen Elizabeth was scared on this occasion. Um, and it's at, which makes it quite simply the case that John Dover Wilson was wrong. Suppose that retroed the second was no threat to her. It's not the, it's not a all the point that the, a broad ideological view of Richard. The second was any different from what Wilson said. It was perfectly true. Bolingbroke was considered a usurper. It was considered tragic that Richard the second was deposed. But that doesn't mean that the text can't be taken over commandeered and made subversive. Wilson doesn't acknowledge this because his view of the relationship between history and literature is all in the history influences literature, not that the influence can be reciprocal. You see, that's how it is that the new historicism wants to define itself over and against the old historicism. If there is a political or ideological consensus about, uh, legitimacy of monarchy, divine right of kings, legitimacy of success and under the sanction of the Church of England and all the rest of it, all of which is anachronistic.

Speaker 1:          18:56          When you were thinking about these history plays, if there is this broad consensus, that's it. That's what the play means according to the old historicism. Even though play Ley, you can take the plot of the play and completely invert those values, which is what the Essex faction does and staging it, ah, in those places where Queen Elizabeth success suspects that it's being staged. Okay. Now another way in which the old historicism and the new historicism differ correctly. I think according to Greene Blat is that in the old historicism? There is no question. I'm looking at page 1444 of the right hand column about a third of the way down and the oldest Doris says, there's no question of the the real, the role of the historians own subjectivity. It is not thought says Greenblatt to be the product of the historians interpretation history is just what is will on views it objectively and that's that.

Speaker 1:          20:03          Now notice here that we're back with God Umer remember that this was God hammers, accusation of historicism. It's belief, the belief of historicism, what Greenblatt calls the old historicism, that we can bracket out our own historical horizon, that we can eliminate all of our own historical prejudices in order to understand the past objectively in and for itself. This is not the case. Said God. Remember God, Omer said that interpretation must necessarily involve the merger of horizons, the horizon of the other and my own horizon. As an interpreter, I cannot bracket out my own subjectivity. Okay. If that's the case, then God them or anticipates Greenblatt and saying that the naive putty of the old historicism is it's supposition that it has no vested interest in what it's talking about. That is to say it's a position that he, that it wants history to a cord in one way or another with its own preconceptions but isn't aware of it.

Speaker 1:          21:22          The anecdote, again, a wonderfully placed in the polemical argument that after all John Dover Wilson delivered himself of these opinions about Richard the second before a group of scholars in Germany in 1939 is after all rather interesting Hitler is about to be the Bolingbroke of Germany. John Dover Wilson Watson, his audience to say, Hey, wait a minute. You know, stick with vested authority. You know, you have a weak democracy, but it is a democracy. Don't let it get away from you. You know, uh, and, and so he is speaking, um, you know, the horse already having escaped from the barn in this reassuring way about German politics as a means of sort of reinforcing his own view of the politics of Elizabethan England. But this greenglass opposes it. Something about which he has very little self consciousness that is to say he just, he, he his own interest as of course it should be on this occasion, is in the preservation of vested authority, uh, and his own interests then folds back into his understanding of Elizabethan ideology in such a way that it can conform to that interest he has.

Speaker 1:          22:45          In other words, in short, as we say today, a hidden agenda and is very little aware of it, unlike the new historicist who following God. Hammer in this respect is fully cognizant of the subjective investment that, uh, leads to a choice of interest in materials, a way of thinking about those materials and a means of bringing them to life for us today and into focus. In other words, it's okay for a Greenblatt as it was for God gossamer much to the horror of Ed Hirsch to find the significance of a text as opposed to the meaning of a text. The significance of the text is that it has a certain kinds of power invested in it. Those kinds of power are still of interest to us today, still have relevance to what's going on in our own world. All of this is taken up openly, uh, as a matter of self consciousness by the new historicist, uh, in ways that according to Greenblatt and his colleagues, uh, uh, we're not available, uh, consciously, uh, in the older historicism now the world as the news, as the new historicism sees it.

Speaker 1:          24:10          And after I've said this, I'll turn to McGahn the world as the new historicism sees it is essentially a dynamic interplay of power, networks of power and subversion. That is to say modes of challenging those networks. Uh, even within, uh, the authoritative texts that generate positions of power, the Elizabethan mask for example, uh, which stages, uh, the relation of court to Cordier to a visitor to hang her on, uh, in wonderfully orchestrated ways, um, is a means because it's kind of poly vocal is a means of, of containing within its structure, elements of subversion according to the argument that's made about these things. The same with court ritual itself. The same with the, uh, the, uh, happenstance that takes place once a year in early modern England, uh, in which the Lord of Misrule, uh, is, is d is so denominated, uh, and ordinary authority is turned on its ear for one day, Queen for a day, uh, as it were, is something that is available to any citizen once a year.

Speaker 1:          25:37          Um, and these are all ways of diffusing what they in fact bring into visibility and consciousness, namely the existence, perhaps the inevitable existence of subversion with respect to structures and circulatory systems of power. And it's this relationship between power and subversion that the newest Doris is and especially in taking up issues of the early modern period tends to focus and to specialize in. Now, Jerome McGann is, it's not wholly clear that Jerome again has ever really thought of himself as a new historicist. He has been so designated by others, but I think there is one rather important difference in emphasis, at least between what he's doing and what a green bond and his colleagues do in the early modern period. Um, mum again doesn't really so much stress the reciprocity of history and discourse. He is interested in the presence of history, the presence of immediate social and also personal circumstances in the history of a text.

Speaker 1:          26:58          His primary concern is with, at least in this essay is with textual scholarship. He himself is the, uh, editor of the new standard works of Byron. He has also done a standard works of Swinburne, uh, and he has been, uh, a vocal and colorful spokesperson of a certain point of view within the recondite debates of textual scholarship, whether textual scholarship ought to be or to produce a text that's an amalgam of a variety of available manuscripts and credit tax, whether the texts that produces ought to be the last and best thoughts of the author. That's the position that again, seems to be taking, uh, in this essay. Whether the text on the contrary ought to be, you know, the first burst of inspiration of the author. Uh, all the people who prefer the earliest versions of Wordsworth prelude for example, uh, would favor that point of who, um, in other words, McGahn is making a contribution here at least to the debates surrounding, uh, editing, uh, and the production of authoritative scholarly texts.

Speaker 1:          28:10          It's in that context, uh, that the remarks he's making about Keats have to be understood. I think the primary influence on McGahn is not so much Fuko then with this sense of the sort of circulation of power back and forth between history and literature and literary discourse as Bactine whom he quotes a on pages 18 and 19, or who's influenced he sites I should say, rather, uh, in a way that I think does pervade, uh, what you encounter in reading. Uh, what he then goes on to say bottom of page 18, what follows it says McGahn is a summary, an extrapolation of certain key ideas set forth by the so called buck teen school of criticism, a small group of Marxists, good x from the Soviet Union who made an early attack upon formalist approaches to poetry just as he began. And as the new historicist are themselves in their turn doing the Bach teens schools, socio historical method approaches all language utterances, including poems as phenomena marked with their concrete origins and history.

Speaker 1:          29:26          That is to say phenomena voiced by the material circumstances that produced them phenomenon. In other words, in which the voice of the sort of romantic solitary is not really, uh, that voice at all. But it's rather the poly Glassell infusion of a variety of perspectives, including ideological perspectives shaping, uh, that particular utterance. And also in the, in the case of the textual scholar, uh, shaping which have a variety of manuscripts will be chosen for publication and for central attention in the tradition of the reception of a given text. So all of this, uh, uh, McGahn, uh, takes to be derived from buck teen, uh, rather than from Foodco. So I do think that's a significant difference between our two authors. Now I'm against most, uh, important contribution to the return to history of the seventies and eighties is a book, a short book called the romantic ideology. And this book, well, what it is, is an attack on romanticism.

Speaker 1:          30:46          At least it's an attack on certain widely understood and received ideas about romanticism, ideas with which, by the way, I don't agree, but this course isn't about me. Uh, the romantic ideology is an amalgam of two titles, one of them as the important early critique of Romanticism by the German poet and sometime romantic Heinrich hyena called d romanticist Shula, the romantic school, uh, in which the subjectivity, even solipsism isolation from social concern, uh, and from, uh, and, and, and from unfolding historical processes of the romantic poets is emphasized and criticized. And in addition to that, that's the word. That's where the word romantic comes from in the title of the Romantic ideology. And the other title that it amalgamates is Marxists book the German ideology, which is about many things, but as in particular about room lumpenproletariat intellectuals who think, ah, with Hagle still following Hagle despite the believing themselves to be progressive who think with Hagle that thought produces material circumstances rather than the other way around.

Speaker 1:          32:04          In other words, people in short who are idealists and therefore under this indictment, also romantic. And so again, it's title as I say, cleverly amalgamates these two other titles and sets the agenda for this short book, which is an attack not just on romanticism but what but on what he believes to be our continued tendency still to be in romanticism, still to be romantic. And there his particular object of attack is the so called Yale School, um, who are still under attack in the Essa that you've read for today. Uh, Paul Demonn and Geoffrey Hartman's a well known essay on Keats's to autumn or singled out for a particular, uh, scorn and does praise. Um, and so, and, and, and all sort of on the grounds that, um, yes, it's all very well to read romanticism to conduct, come to understand it, even to be fascinated by it.

Speaker 1:          33:06          But we can't be romantic. In other words, our reading of Romanticism, if we are to be social animals, politically engaged, invested, uh, in the world as a social community, uh, our reading of Romanticism must necessarily be an auntie romantic critique. This is a, as I say, still essentially the position taken up, taken up by [inaudible]. I mean, I'm sorry by him again. All right. So I've, I've explained the ways in which he defers from Greenblatt and leaning more toward Bach teen than toward Fuko. Um, I've explained that, uh, McGahn is engaged primarily and talking about issues of textual scholarship in this particular essay that he defends Keats's last deliberate choices that he believes the so called indicator text of 18, 20 of Lavelle. Don saw marriage song. Mercy is Keats's last deliberate choice, uh, as opposed to the 1848 text, uh, published, uh, by a monk to mills, uh, in the addition of Keats, his poems that he brought out at that time.

Speaker 1:          34:17          Now I think that in that, in the time I, I want to sort of linger over McGann, I do want to say a few things about what he says about Keats. I want to, I want to, to, to emphasize that his general pronouncements about the historicity of texts, about the permeation of texts by the circumstances of their production, uh, their conditioning by ideological factors, uh, is unimpeachable. Uh, it seems to me that this is a necessary approach at least to have in mind, if not perhaps necessarily to emphasize in one's own work of literary scholarship. Uh, the idea that a text just falls from a tree, um, if anybody ever had that idea, by the way, is plainly not a tenable one. Um, and the, uh, and the opposite idea that the tax that it texts is a, is emerges from a complex matrix of social and historical circumstances is, uh, is certainly a good one.

Speaker 1:          35:26          So if one's to criticize, but again, it's not a question of criticizing his basic pronouncements. It seems to me, um, nothing. I think it'd be said really against them. The trouble is that in the case of McGann, who's a, who's a terrific prominent romantic scholar, uh, with whom one I suppose hesitates to disagree. And in the case of McGann, everything he says about the texts that he isolates for attention. And this essay is simply consistently wrong. I mean, it is, I mean, it, it, it's almost as if pi compulsion that he says things that are wrong about these texts. And I just, and the reason I asked you in my email last night to take a look at them if you got a chance is so that, um, so that these few remarks that I make now might have some substance. Uh, take for example, La Beldam.

Speaker 1:          36:21          So I'm artsy, uh, in the first place. Who says, we only read the 1848 text us scholarly edition and his main object of attack is Jacksonville injures scholarly edition of Kate's. A scholarly edition gives you basically a variorum apparatus. Yeah. Maybe it gives you a particular text in bold print, but it gives you the variant text in smaller print and the in a footnote it, you know, it, it doesn't withhold the variant texts from him. He says, it says, no, look, there's this to, you know, take your choice. Really the, the, the, the atmosphere of a variorum scholarly edition is an atmosphere of take your choice, not a kind of tyrannical, a imposition on the public of a particular version of the text. Everybody knows the 1820 indicator texts. What can nail the wretched white is at least as familiar to me as a romanticist, as what can l the United arms, the way in which the 1848 tax begins.

Speaker 1:          37:29          And frankly, how many raw mat people who aren't romanticist know anything about either text. I mean, what are we talking about here for the wrong? The romanticist know what going on. They're not in any way hornswoggled by this historical conspiracy against the 1820 indicator taxed. And people who aren't romances don't care. That's what, that's what it comes down to. But I mean, if it's not enough simply to say that, you know, turning to the question, which text is better? Well, it's hard to say which text is better. Mcgann's argument is that the 1820 is better because it's a poem about a guy and a girl who sort of meat and the next thing you know, they're having sex and that doesn't turn out so well. In other words, it's about the real world. These things happen. Uh, it's not a romance, whereas the, what can LD wretched night, the 1848 version and all of its, uh, other variants, the kisses for and so on.

Speaker 1:          38:31          Uh, the 1848 version, um, is, uh, kind of unselfconscious in McGann's view, romance, subscribing to certain medieval ideas about women, uh, simultaneously putting them on a pedestal that pedestal and, and, and fearing at the same time, uh, that they're invested with a kind of black magic which, which, which destroys the souls and s and dissipates the SAP of deserving young gentlemen. Um, all of this, you know, is ideologically programmed according to him again in the 1848 version. Why? Because Charles Brown behave despicably toward women. He didn't like fanny Brawne. Uh, and because Monkton millions, the actual editor of the 1848 edition loved pornography and was a big collector of erotica. Uh, so that's why the 1848 text with it's, uh, w w w w with, it's a fear of and denigration of women in contrast to the 1820 texts is superior. Well, two things. First of all, who's to say the 1848 texts wasn't Keats's last thoughts.

Speaker 1:          39:46          In other words, yes, he was already ill when the indicator taxed was published in 1820. It is pretty close to the end of his ability to think clearly about his own work and to worry very much about the forms in which it was published. But at the same time, we don't know when Brown received his version of the text. We can't suppose as Mcgann, more than half applies that Brown just sort of sat down and rewrote it. And then nobody, nobody has ever really said that. And if he didn't rewrite it, then Keith's must've given it to him in that form. Who's to say that wasn't his last and best thoughts. Who's to say Kate's didn't really want to write a poem? This kind of after all the title taken from Amy and evil ballad by eyelash shock, Jay [inaudible] mercy, it bears out the, the, the, the, the what can l the United arms version.

Speaker 1:          40:43          It's about a Morgan La fe type. It's about, I mean, for better or worse, whatever we think of that ideologically it is about if the title is right, uh, the kind of woman who is, who is, uh, evoked in the 1848 version as opposed to the kind of woman who is evoked in the 1820 versions. So the 1848 is simply more consistent with the title. That's one point to be made, but the additional point to be made is that taking advantage of the new historicist acknowledgement that one's own subjectivity, one's own historical horizon is properly in play. In thinking about these things again, uh, is then able to infuse Keats's texts and therefore Keats his intentions with a pleasing political correctness. That is to say Keith's cat possibly have thought in that demeaning way about women by the way, everything, I mean I like kids, but everything in his letters suggest that he did a key Keats Keats can't possibly have thought in that demeaning way about women.

Speaker 1:          41:52          Therefore, the 1820 text is the text that he intended and preferred. Okay. That of course, makes Keats more consistent with our own standards and our own view of the relations between the sexes. But does it make Keats, does it? In other words, make sense? Uh, visa vi the Kate's whom we know and despite his weaknesses and shortcomings love, uh, and so there is a great deal, in other words, to be sad, uh, over against McGann's assertions about this textual issue. Not necessarily in defense of the 1848, but agnostically with respect to the two of them saying, yeah, we better have both of them were better put them side by side, we'd better read them together. But if by some theology, the 1820, where somehow subsequently preferred to the 1848, that would be every bit as much, uh, of an historical misfortune as the preference insofar as it has actually existed of the 1848 for the 1820 [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          43:04          Uh, and so I think that's the perspective one wants to take. Now, I was going to talk about, um, to autumn, I'll only say about his reading of, to autumn that McGann who, who doesn't seem to like the poem very much. I mean, he likes La Belden Song mercy. So it makes it politically correct. Uh, he doesn't like to autumn because he thinks that autumn was published in collusion with Keats's conservative friends and the poems of 1820, uh, which burglarized everything he had to say of a progressive political nature. And he thinks that to autumn is a big sellout. In other words, that eight, yes, 18, 19 happened to be a year of good harvest. And so Kate's turns that year of good harvest into something permanent, into a kind of cloud cuckoo land, uh, in which, you know, the, the fruit falls into your basket and the fish jump into your net and everything is just perfect.

Speaker 1:          43:56          Well, do you think the poem is really like that? You've read the third stanza which began totally ignores apart from where the songs is spring. I, where are they in there was he, he, he gives you the opening but it doesn't give you any sense of the rest of the stands it for, because for him to autumn is all about the first stanza for him. Kate seems to identify with the bees who think warm days will never cease for summer has or Brynn, their clammy cells. Keats is like a B. He's all into the sensuous. Well again, just in terms of historical evidence, this is outmoded by at least 18, but by at least 18 months. If we consult Keats's letters. He was like that early in his career. But he has had severe misgivings, uh, about a PR point of view, which is, uh, which is represented.

Speaker 1:          44:47          And what he said in an earlier letter o for a life of sensations rather than thoughts that's no longer Keats's position when writing to autumn. Kate's his position when riding off to autumn is the position of a guy who has a sore throat justices, tubercular brother did, who is increasingly afraid that he's going to die soon and is trying to confront mortality in writing. What is in fact a, and I say in fact advisedly, the most perfect lyric ever written in the English language, which is Ma and which is most certainly not a celebration of, you know, uh, sort of wandering around like an aimless be thinking that the autumn is perfect, but that autumn is always perfect. Uh, and that warm days will never cease. Uh, and that everything is just lovely. And the garden that is not that kind of poem. Uh, and it's really a travesty of it to suppose that it is simply on the grounds that it was published in the poems 1820 a as a kind of sell out to the establishment, uh, under the advice of Keats's conservative friends.

Speaker 1:          45:53          All right so much then, um, for McGann's remarks on Keets, which has a, which I want to say again, you know, in no way in Pune or undermine the general validity of the claims that he's making about, uh, taking historical circumstances into account precisely. We need to take them into account and we need to get them right. That's the challenge of course, of working with historical circumstances. You have to get it right. Uh, and so, uh, with that said, uh, let me turn quickly to a review of Tony, uh, from Bactine to the new historicism. I'm a, uh, glide over, uh, Tony according to Jameson because we did that at the end of the last lecture. So let me go back to Bactine. Uh, you can see the way in which in the structure of Tony The tow truck, uh, the first part of the poem is absolutely saturated with the first person singular.

Speaker 1:          46:49          I do this, I do that. I liked my job, I am stuck. I then as you read along through the text, you'll see that the I disappears or if it's still appears, it's in the middle of a line rather than at the beginning of the line. In other words, that the eye, the subjectivity, the first person singular, the sense of having a unique voice is gradually subsumed by the sociality of the story as it unfolds. I am no longer I defined as a romantic individual. I am, I rather defined as a friend. That is to say as a person who has relation with otherness is what constitutes his identity. And in that mutuality of friendship, the first person singular disappears. What is spoken in tone of the tow truck, in other words, in the long run, is not the voice of individual subjectivity, but the voice of social togetherness, uh, the voice of otherness according to your house.

Speaker 1:          47:57          Uh, the important thing about Tony the tow truck is that it is not the same story as the little engine that could and other words in each generation of reception. Uh, the aesthetic standards that prevail at a given time are reconsidered, uh, and rethought, reshuffled a new historical horizon, a new aesthetic horizon emerges, uh, and texts are constituted in a different way, much also as the Russian formalists have said, only with the sense in the house of the historical imperative little engine that could, is all about the, uh, inversion of power between the little guy and the big guy so that the little guy helps the big guy. Uh, and that is unequivocal, uh, showing as in Isaiah in the Bible that the, uh, uh, the valleys have been raised and the mountains have been made low. Uh, that's not the way Tony, the tow truck works.

Speaker 1:          48:54          The little guy himself needs help. He needs the help of another little guy. There is a reciprocity, not dialectically between little and big, but a mutual reinforcement of little by little. Uh, and that is the, uh, change in aesthetic horizon that one can witness between the little engine that could and Tony, the tow truck and van, you mean the important thing as I think we've said is the idea that the narrator is the apparatus. The humanization of the natural world of, I'm sorry, the humanization of a mechanized world through our identification with it is what takes place in Tony the tow truck. In other words, all these cars and trucks, all these smiling and frowning houses, uh, of course have as their common denominator there non humanity, but the anthropomorphization of the cars and trucks and have the houses constitutes then as the human, they are precisely the human.

Speaker 1:          49:59          We see things. In other words, from the point of view of the apparatus we see just as the film goer sees things from the point of view of the camera. So we see Tony the tow truck from the point of view of the tow truck, right? And so it's all liquid and, and what happens just as the camera eye point of view leaves the, that which is seen as Benyamin puts it equipment free. So oddly enough, if we see things from the standpoint of equipment, what we look at is the moral of the story. In other words, the humanity of the story. What we see, in other words, surrounded by all of this equipment is precisely the equipment free human aspect of reality. So to honor the tow truck works in a way that is consistent with Benu means theory of mechanical reproduction for Adorno.

Speaker 1:          50:54          However, the acquiescence of this very figure, the, the, the apparatus of mechanical reproduction of towing again and again and again, the acquiescence of there's very figure in the inequity of class relations rejected as always by Nieto and speedy. The acquiescence to this figure proves that the apparatus which Benyamin is there a tax to be independent of the machinations of the culture industry, that the apparatus in turn can be suborned and commandeered by the culture industry for its own purposes. All right, I will skip over Jameson, the old historicism, which, which read simply reconfirms [inaudible] the old historicist reading of Tony simply reconfirms a status quo in which virtue as clear vice is clear, uh, and both are uncontested, uh, and nothing changes. In other words, a status quo, uh, which reflects, uh, a stagnant, existent, unchanging social dynamic, the newest sources from a lot of ways of doing this.

Speaker 1:          52:08          But let me just conclude by suggesting that if literature influences history, Donny, the tow truck might well explain why today we're promoting fuel efficient cars. Uh, why the attack on the gas guzzler and the SUV or minivan? I am too busy. Uh, why the attack, what, what, why the attack on these vehicles is so prevalent in the story. Uh, and why, uh, if we read today's headlines, we need to get rid of the Humvee if GM is to prosper, uh, and we need to downsize and streamline the available models. The little guy, Tony and bumpy reaffirm the need, uh, for a fuel efficient, smaller vehicles. Uh, and don't you can plainly see that Tony, the tow truck is therefore a discourse that produces history. All of this, uh, according to the prescription of Tony is actually happening. All right. Thank you very much. Um, one thing that needs to be said about Tony the tow truck is it has no women in it. Ah, and that is the issue that we'll be taking up on Thursday. Right.
