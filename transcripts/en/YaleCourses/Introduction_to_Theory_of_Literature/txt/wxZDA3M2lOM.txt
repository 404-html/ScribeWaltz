Speaker 1:          00:01          This lecture I think starts with a series of preliminaries. Uh, but so the, in the technical term for preliminaries of this kind in literary study prolapses that is to say the form of anticipation, which in a certain sense covers what will be talked about later. Uh, they are, uh, prolapses of this kind. Uh, I, at first I wanted to say that in entering upon the phase of this course, which concerns a series of particular identities as perspectives, as points of departure for thinking about the literary text ad of course, for thinking about identity itself. Um, we come upon a, a, a form of, of critical endeavor, which is in practical terms, incredibly rich, uh, and productive. Uh, it is simply amazing how as Jonathan Color wants to put a reading as a woman or reading as an African American or reading as, uh, any of the other, uh, uh, sort of, uh, focuses of identity that we're going to be talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:18          It's simply amazing how this kind of reading, if it's done alertly transforms everything that is to say it has a, an incredible practical payoff. Um, you know, last time, uh, in the context of the new historicism, uh, Steven Greenleaf Greenblatt's brilliant anecdote begins with Queen Elizabeth Sang, I am Richard the second. No, you not that whoa. Well, I mean, Stephen Greenblatt isn't concerned and investigating, uh, a pronouncement of that sort from the standpoint of feminist criticism or indeed, uh, from the standpoint of something we'll be taking up later on gender theory, uh, but still it's rather than amazing thing for Queen Elizabeth to say, isn't it? Uh, it suggests really that cut that it's, that it's after all remarkable, let she, a woman, uh, would find herself in a position not so much, uh, needing to endure the kind of suffering and peril that her own sex has traditionally endured, but, uh, rather and potentially enduring the suffering and peril that one would experience in the masculine gender position made perhaps even more interesting and complicated by the fact that Elizabeth knows perfectly well that despite the rarity of her being Richard the second, uh, it's nevertheless not a unique position.

Speaker 1:          02:48          She has some subjected Mary Queen of Scots to precisely that position. She has deposed a and B headitor ultimately, uh, in just the way that she fears the Earl of Essex. We'll depose and behead her. So the way in which, uh, this remark, uh, I am Richard the second no, you're not that, uh, so easily commandeered and made use of from the standpoint of the new historicism can, uh, come to life in a completely different way when we think about it, uh, as a question of a gendered experience, um, is I think in itself a fascinating one. Now I'm at the end of the last lecture, just as by way of further preliminary, um, I told a little fib, I said that there were no women in Tony the tow truck. And of course in your prose texts, the one that you've been clutching to your bosom feverish Lee for the entire semester.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Uh, in your prose text, there are no women. There are just guys talking. However, if to the prose text, and I've told you about these, you add the illustrations, uh, and this is one of them. Roughly speaking, I did it from memory. Um, uh, if you add the illustrations, you have to realize that it's not just the cars you see the little smiles on the faces of the cars. It's not just the cars that are happy about what's going on when bumpy finally comes along and pushes Tony. Uh, but it's the houses in the background, the houses in the background which have been expressing disapproval, uh, at the reactions of Nieto and speedy to the predicament. They're big frowns on the faces of those houses in that illustration. And now express beaming approval when the morally correct thing is done now in the Victorian period.

Speaker 1:          04:50          And in a certain sense, I think Tony did the tow truck in this regard hearkens back to the Victorian period. There was a poet named Coventry Pat Moore, who actually are rather good poet who became notorious however, and the feminist tradition for having written along poem in which he describes woman as the angel in the house. You probably, you're probably familiar with that expression, but the idea is an idea which is also I think embodied, uh, in the, in a monumental book of some 25 years ago by an Douglas called the feminization of American culture. Uh, the idea is that moral and aesthetic and cultural values are somehow or not or another in the hands of women, uh, in the drawing room at the tea table dictating to the agencies of society, all of which are strictly male prerogatives. Uh, what a proper ethical sense of things ought to be.

Speaker 1:          05:59          In other words, the role of the angel in the house is not just to wash the dishes and take care of the kids, although that's a big part of it. The role of the angel in the house is also to adjudicate the moral aspect of life at the domestic level. And that's exactly what these houses obviously inhabited by angels. How else could they be smiling and frowning? Ah, that's what these houses are doing. And so it is the case after all that there are women in Tony the tow truck. All right. Now, as I say, this moment is not exactly a crossroads in our syllabus. It's not like moving from language to psyche to the social because obviously we're still very much in the social, in fact, it's not even as though we haven't hitherto and countered the notion of perspective. Uh, obviously we have in all sorts of ways, but particularly in the work of Bactine or Jameson, uh, were introduced to the way in which class conflict that is to say being of a certain class.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Therefore having an identity gets itself expressed in literary form. Dialogic Lee gets itself expressed even as the expression of either as the expression of conflict, uh, between or among classes, uh, or as a more cacophonous. And yet at the same time, very frequently harmonious a chorus of voices of the sort that in, uh, notions of Carnival, Carnival Association, uh, and other such notions one finds in [inaudible]. In other words, the way in which the language of a text, the language of a narrative or of a poem or have a clay gets itself expressed is already ha, eh. As, as we've encountered it, a question of perspective that it say it needs to be read with notions of identity in this case, notions of class identity, uh, in mind if it's to be understood. Well, what's interesting though, what's also interesting though about turning to questions of identity is that perhaps more sharply now than hitherto, although I have been at pains to point out certain moments in the syllabus in which one really does arrive at a crossroads and you've got to take, you can't, you simply can't take both paths.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Uh, nevertheless, uh, within the context of thinking about identity in these ways as literary theory, we begin to feel, uh, uh, an increased competitiveness among perspectives. I'm going to be pointing out, pointed this out from time to time in the sequence of lectures that we now undertake. But from the very beginning, there's a, a, a sense of competition between actually a competition, which is in some ways unresolved to this day. Uh, for example, between the feminist and the Marxist perspective. That is to say what is the underlying determination of identity and consciousness? Is it class or gender? Just for example, and this is not a new topic, this is not, this isn't a topic that we stumble on today. Um, uh, as a result of some belated sophistication we have achieved, listen to Virginia Woolf on page 600 of a room of one's own where she says top of the left hand column for genius.

Speaker 1:          09:48          Like Shakespeare's is not born among laboring undereducated survival people that was not born in England among the Saxons and the Britons. It is not born today among the working classes. How then could it have been born among women whose work began according to professor Trevelyan almost before they were out of the nursery, who were forced to it by their parents and held to it. But all the power of law and custom yet genius of a sword must have existed among women as it must have existed among the working classes. Now in a way, wolf is pulling her punches here. She's not saying class has priority over gender Norris. She saying gender has priority over class. If we're to understand the history of the oppression of women, uh, or the history of the limits on the forms of women's expression, uh, she's pulling her punches and yet at the same time I think we can see a point of view and wolf's [inaudible] room of one's own, which is after all rather surprising.

Speaker 1:          10:54          Think of the title. Think of the later title of attract in some ways, similar about sort of possible possible scope for contemporary activity for women. Three guineas. Uh, these titles are grounded in material circumstances. Wolf stands before her audience, her Oxbridge audience of women and says, all she really has to say is just this one thing. If you're going to expect to get anything done in the way of writing or in the way of any other activity that's genuinely independent of patriarchal limitation. You've really got to have 500 pounds a year and a room of your own. That's all she really says. She has to say. In fact, as you read through the six chapters of a room of one's own, you find that as if, uh, on an elastic band after the extraordinary range of impressive impressionistic thinking that each chapter manifests, she is pulled back to this one particular as she sees it necessary factual, precondition material, precondition.

Speaker 1:          12:06          You want to get anything done. You're not Jane Austin. You're not a gene. You're not a genius sitting on your parlor, whisking your, your, your novel in progress under a piece of blotting paper. Every time a servant comes into the room, you know, you're not like that. You really do need today the independence of having 500 pounds and a room of your own. In other words, I think one could show that even in a row of one's own, which is, which is if not the greatest, certainly the most eloquent, uh, so feminist treatise on the conditions of women's writing ever written one could show that even in that, uh, there is a certain priority given to the perspective of class as opposed to the perspective of gender. Uh, gender, uh, will continue to be conditioned by the effects of money and power if in fact something isn't done.

Speaker 1:          13:09          Let's face it to redistribute money and power on this too. And this is a perspective which by the way is even clearer in three guineas. Uh, and uh, and at we're at suggesting that, um, despite, uh, its main agenda, which is a feminist one, that underlying that there is a sense of the priority of class, these sorts of tensions continue to haunt not just feminist criticism, but other forms of criticism having to do with other forms of identity. Really to this day, uh, conferences, uh, featuring this variety of perspectives very typically are develop into debates on precisely this issue and the one ops persons of conferences. Of this kind are, is the one who somehow it ones who somehow get in the last word a and say you're all naive. Uh, you suppose that this is the basic issue, but there's an underlying issue, which is the basic issue.

Speaker 1:          14:09          Uh, and that's the one that I'm going to demonstrate must absolutely prevail. It's not necessarily always, uh, the Marxist card, which has played in this context, although it frequently is, uh, it could be some other card, but it's always a card played. It's always the last word at the conference, which makes everybody go away. I said, oh, I, I thought this was about women. Oh dear. It must be about something else. And we will, uh, and, and we will have to come back to that because, uh, in a way, the material we covered today and the way that we're enabled to discuss it by its own nature, uh, uh, is something that, uh, calls for another lecture and a lecture that we will actually provide. Um, there's a very real sense as I hope to show by the end of the lecture, uh, in which, uh, traditional I call this classical feminist criticism in which traditional art, classical feminist criticism needs to be supplemented perhaps in the [inaudible] sense needs to be supplemented by something more, which is gender theory.

Speaker 1:          15:13          Um, and I'll try to, as I say at the end of the lecture, I'll try to explain what that might, what that might entail and then come back to it when we discuss, uh, uh, Judith Butler and Michelle Fuoco, uh, a few lectures from now. All right, so run one zone is an absolutely amazing tour de force. Uh, it's actually one of my favorite books. I read it like a novel and in many ways it is a novel. Um, uh, and I think immediately that might give us pause because if Charlotte Bronte is to be called to task for tendential snus that is to say for writing from the standpoint of complaint of perceived oppression. And if Charlotte Bronte's tendentious dangerousness gets in the way of the full expression of what she has to say, which is to say the unfolding of a novel. Uh, and if as Virginia Woolf, I think actually rightly remarks, at least from an aesthetic point of view, we wonder why on earth grace pools suddenly appears after, after, you know, the sort of Jane's diatribe about wishing that she could travel and wishing that her horizons had been broadened.

Speaker 1:          16:26          Somehow j, uh, Virginia will says Grace Pool, uh, is out of place and that there's been, there's been a rift, uh, in the narrative fabric. If this criticism of Charlotte Bronte is fair and we'll be coming back to it in other contexts, then of course it could be turned against the narrative, the choice of narrative style of narrative approach in a room of one's own itself. Uh, this I suppose, good only strike you forcefully if you read the whole of room of one's own all six chapters, which I urge you to do. Um, because it's so much fun. If you read the whole of a room of one's own, you'd say, well, Gee, this is sort of a novel to the Speaker says, Oh, call me anybody you like not unlike Melville speakers saying, call me Ishmael. You can call me Mary beaten. You can call me Mary seat and call me Mary Carmichael doesn't really matter.

Speaker 1:          17:19          Um, but I've had certain certain adventures, at least that person speaking has had certain adventures. What's your fictitious, um, or at least I reserve the right to sub to have you suppose that they're fictitious. Uh, in other words, this is a narrative that moves quite by design in the world of fiction and other words, Virginia Woolf was saying it really isn't true. As, as, as she tells us in the first chapter that she marry beaten after sitting at the river thinking, wondering what on earth she's going to tell these young ladies about women and fiction as she's been thinking about that. Finally, she gets a little idea. It's like pulling a bit of a fish out of the river and the fish starts swimming around in her head. She becomes quite excited and she walks away across the grass. At that point up arises a beetle, a formidable person, you know, wearing oxone and gowns and pointing at the gravel path where she as an authorized woman should be walking as the grass is the province only for the men enrolled in the university.

Speaker 1:          18:26          Uh, and so, and then she has repeated encounters of that kind. She goes to the library on thinking Lee only to be told by an elderly race like gentlemen, that since she's a woman, she needs a letter of introduction to get in. Um, and, and so it's her day, her fictitious day, thinking about what on earth she say to these young women about women and fiction, uh, begins somewhat unpleasantly, um, as a presented fiction and other words, a room of one's own is in a sense, a novel. It continues, um, uh, with a very pleasant lunch that she has. She's been invited to the campus as a distinguished writer. It's okay to be a novelist, um, uh, to be a woman who's a novelist as long as you, uh, as, as, as, as long as you don't rock the boat too much. Um, and in that respect, in that regard, she can have been invited to such a lunch has is very pleasant lunch because it's provided by men, uh, in an atmosphere which is designed for men.

Speaker 1:          19:31          Then she goes to visit a friend who is teaching at this fictitious college. Uh, she has dinner with a friend in that college, has dining hall, uh, and the dinner is extremely unfair, earlier inferior and plain. Uh, and then they go to her rooms, uh, and they start talking about the conditions in which this college was built. Bunch of women in the 19th century had all they could do to raise 30,000 pounds, no frills. Thank you very much. None of them had any money. There were no major donor donations. And so the grass never gets cut. The brick, the brick is playing an unadorned. Um, and that's the way life is in this particular women's College. Uh, then, uh, she, uh, the next day she goes to, she goes to the library because she decides she's really got to find out something about what people think of women.

Speaker 1:          20:22          Um, and so, you know what, you know, what is a woman? I don't know exactly. So I'd better, I'd better look it up in the library. And she finds out that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of men have written books about women, uh, you know, the inferiority of women. They moral sensitivity of women, the lack of physical strength of women on and on and on. And she lists them as items in the library catalog actually are there in the library catalog. All of them, of course, uh, getting themselves expressed in these hundreds and hundreds of books about women by men. Well, this is very frustrating, but as you can imagine, it's a cause. It's a, it's an occasion for wonderful satire. Uh, what has to say 10 inches a satire, because obviously it's male bashing. And my point is, my point is that she wouldn't let Charlotte Bronte get away with that.

Speaker 1:          21:16          You know, Charlotte Bronte has, sorry, Charlotte Bronte has to suspend her anger. Virginia Wolf wants to say if she's going to get the whole of what's on her mind expressed. Well, Virginia Wolfe who is of course not sort of, doesn't sound very angry. Um, but you could well be mistaken about that. Uh, she's venting her anger in comic effects. Uh, Virginia Woolf allows herself because that really is the case. Uh, a measure of anger. Uh, so, so it is in that chapter, then she goes home, uh, and the rest of the rest of the room of one's own takes place in one's home. She's in her study pulling books off the shelf of her library. Uh, and this is more or less chronological. It starts with the, with a time when she looks, uh, where, uh, on the shelf where the women writers ought to be. And there aren't any women writers.

Speaker 1:          22:10          Uh, and then later, yes, there are women writers. Uh, there are quite a few novelists. Uh, and then later, uh, in the trying to, in century women, writers get a little bit more scope for their activity. Um, and as she passes all of this and review, uh, we continue to get her reflections on the state of literary possibility for women in literary history. So that is, that's the structure of a room of one's own, uh, overall. And, uh, it is within this structure, which is an impressionistic and narrative. Undoubtedly novelistic structure. I mean, there, there are precedents for it. Oscar Wilde's portrait of Mr wh is, is one in particular, but which is w, but which is, um, in a, in a way what it's talking about. It is a novella. Uh, and in the context of the Novella, as I say, there's a certain tension or contradiction, uh, in an author who is allowing herself tendentious opinions, uh, while denying the right to have such opinions, uh, on the part of one of her predecessors.

Speaker 1:          23:21          As you can imagine, what she says about Charlotte Bronte has been, has been controversial, uh, in subsequent feminist criticism. There are a number of ways in which feminist critics feel that, uh, Virginia Woolf is misguided or needs to be supplemented. Uh, and this is one of them by and large feminist good ex, uh, feel that Charlotte Bronte or other writer has the right to be 10 dentures. Uh, we'll have more to say about, uh, Virginia Woolf's criterion of Androgyny, uh, uh, which is not thinking like either sex in park. We'll come back to that. Um, but, but, but, but most feminist criticism has felt, uh, for a variety of reasons that, um, uh, androgyny isn't necessarily the ideal, uh, uh, toward which women's pros a ought to be aspiring, uh, and Take Virginia Woolf to task therefore for having taken this view of Charlotte Bronte. Now, yes, feminist criticism has taken a room of one's own to task and a variety of ways, but at the same time, and I think this is freely enhancing, we acknowledged a by a feminist criticism.

Speaker 1:          24:40          It is amazing when you read the whole text and even when you read the excerpts that you have in your anthology, it is amazing how completely Virginia Woolf's arguments anticipate, uh, the subsequent course of the history of feminist criticism. I just want to point out a few of the ways in which it does, um, as show older points out. The first phase of modern feminist criticism, uh, was the kind of the kind of work that primarily pays attention to men's treatment of women in fiction. Uh, uh, Mary elements, uh, Mary almonds book of, of, uh, of of 1968 called thinking about women, Kate Millet's, a sexual politics, uh, in 1970 are both books which, um, which are focused primarily on sexist male novelists, uh, who, uh, whose demeaning treatment of women, uh, as something that, that the feminist perspective perspective needed to bring out. This criticism is superseded in, uh, Elaine Showalter's account by what she calls and prefers a gyno criticism or the gyno critics.

Speaker 1:          25:54          Uh, and Gyno criticism is not so much concerned with men's treatment of women in fiction as with the place of women as writers in literary history and as characters, uh, regardless whether their characters in men's or women's books in their own right in, uh, the history of fiction. In other words. In other words, Gyno criticism turns, uh, turns the topic of feminist criticism around 19, late sixties, and seventies, and early seventies, from the history of oppression by men to the history of the a or the women's tradition. Now, this, this sense of the, of the unfolding of things, it seems to me is already fully present. And Wolf, she too wants to talk about the possibilities for women writers about the need, uh, for women writers to feel that they're not alone and above all. At the same time. However, uh, she frames this emphasis on the woman's perspective.

Speaker 1:          27:04          She frames it with the sort of, uh, of, of, of trenchant, uh, frequently satirical, uh, observations about men's treatment of women, uh, man's way of demeaning women and keeping them in their place. Um, as for example, uh, all the men, most of them professors who wrote books about women, uh, as she discovered, uh, in the British library. All of this is very much in the tradition of that first phase of feminist criticism that show Walter identifies, uh, with, uh, Elman, uh, and millet and others of that generation. So the capacious snus of Wolf's approach, um, is, uh, in one sentence can be understood as precisely her ability to bridge, uh, both sorts of modern tradition, uh, no longer chronic chronological, uh, as show altered presents them as being correctly, but rather as a kind of simultaneity, simultaneity, uh, in which, um, in, in, in which the emphasis on, on, on, on men's marginalization of women and the emphasis on women's consciousness and traditions, uh, can be, uh, uh, set forth at the same time.

Speaker 1:          28:23          Now, also in Virginia Woolf, there's ha there's, there's what, um, uh, since the publication of the fascinating book by Sandra Gilbert and Susan goober called the madwoman in the attic. This is also, uh, an allusion to Jane Eyre. You remember Bertha, the madwoman in the attic of Jane Eyre, um, since the publication of a, of the madwoman in the attic. Um, feminist criticism has, has talked about the mad woman thesis, the idea, in other words, uh, that because they could not, um, um, openly express themselves creatively as writers or as artists of other kinds, uh, women were forced to channel their creativity into subversive divis and perhaps psychologically self destructive, as in, for example, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, uh, the, uh, the yellow wallpaper, uh, perhaps, um, self destructive forms. And, uh, you find wolf already on page, on page 600, uh, Eh, just actually below the passage about class and gender that I read before you find her touching on this madwoman theme long before, uh, Gilbert and Gavar, she says, when, however, one reads of a witch being duct or of a woman possessed by devils of a wise woman selling herbs, and then of course she ads and even have a very remarkable man who had a mother there.

Speaker 1:          29:56          In other words, a one strongly suspect that there's a person who's creativity has been oppressed, uh, and, uh, unfortunately channeled, uh, in, uh, unsocial or anti social directions. Um, and this, uh, as I say is, uh, is, is, is a tradition that sustained, uh, it still exists in show alter when she says on page 13, 83, I mean, it's not just Gilbert and goober. Uh, in other words, when show Walter says on page 1383, um, she does, I can't say that I think she does. Uh, uh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I, I, what I wanted to say about show Walter, um, is that, uh, in her gyno critical perspective, that is to say her, her insistence on, are registering chronicling, uh, becoming familiar as scholars with, uh, the history of women as well as the history of women's writing. Uh, the recognition of such forms of repression as witchcraft, as madness, as urbalism as whatever it might be, a need to be, need to be taken into account.

Speaker 1:          31:16          Um, also very much on the mind of wolf already as it still is, particularly for Showalter, because this is show up to his understanding of the task of Gyno criticism is the notion that one needs a tradition. That one of the great difficulties and shortcomings facing the woman's writer is that a yes, there are a few greats, the same ones always named Austin. The Bronto has George Elliot. There are a few grades, but there is not a sense of an ongoing tradition of a developing tradition within which one could write. So that a wolf on paid six oh six right hand column talks about, um, the man's sentence. You know, the difficulty of coming to terms with, uh, with, uh, not having, not just a room of one's own, but a language of one's own, uh, toward the top of the right hand column. Perhaps the first thing she would find setting pen to paper was that there was no common sentence ready for her.

Speaker 1:          32:24          Use all of the literary models, all the models of novelistic pros, uh, most of them in any case, uh, are developed, are, are, are, are, are engendered male, um, because, uh, the atmosphere of writing, uh, and this is a point that we'll be getting too soon. The very fact of writing, uh, is something that we have to understand as having a male stamp on it. Uh, further down the right hand column, that is a man sentence. She's just quoted a long sentence that is a man sentence behind it. One can see Johnson Gibbon and the rest, it was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman's use. Charlotte Bronte with all her splendid gift for Bros stumbled and fell with that clumsy weapon in her hands. George Eliot committed atrocities with it. That beggar description, Jane Austin looked at it and laughed at it and devised a perfectly natural shapely sentence, proper for her own use and never departed from it.

Speaker 1:          33:24          Thus, with less genius for writing than Charlotte Bronte. She got infinitely more said Jane Austin. And by the way, this is disputable because, um, certainly it's possible to understand Jane Austen's pro style as emerging from the work of Samuel Johnson and Samuel Richardson in particular. Uh, so it is disputable, but at the same time, wolf point is that that w that Austin was able to shake herself free from this terrible problem of wanting to say something, but finding, uh, that one doesn't have one's own language, a language suitable to a appropriated by and for. And as one's identity for saying it. So I want to write as a woman, as a woman, I want to say the things that a woman wants to say, but all I've got to say it, which is a man sentence, that's a wolf's point. Um, and of course it has, uh, it has, uh, many, uh, and long ramifications.

Speaker 1:          34:27          It is, uh, I'm, I'm, I'm holding at bay, um, the criticism of a great deal of this that has to be leveled at it by feminist criticism and genders, gender theory roughly since 1980. But in the meantime, uh, the ramifications are interesting and they are reinforced by the theoretically very sophisticated wing of feminist criticism that we call French feminism. Some of you may know the work of, uh, of, of loose [inaudible]. He got, Hey, a lens, see sue, a writers of this kind of insist that there is such a thing as women's language women, right? Not just, you know, with their heads in their phalluses, but with their whole bodies. Uh, women don't write a carefully constructed periodic sentences, women, right? Ongoing paratactic impressionistic, a digressive, uh, ad hoc sentences, uh, that this is a sentences without ego, uh, being without structure, more or less corresponding to being without ego.

Speaker 1:          35:37          We'll come back to this in a minute and show Walter, but in the meantime, fresh feminism was willing to settle on. And four and I, Dhea of women's writing and implicitly behind this idea and idea of what a woman is, that it's very easy to, to identify as somehow or another, um, essentially rising. Why can't a woman, right, a rigorous periodic sentence after all, that's the kind of sentence that Jane Austin did in fact. Right? Uh, why can't, why can't, um, uh, integrate in a, in, in a whole variety of ways that one that one might think of, why can't a woman, uh, if she is to be free to be whatever she wants to be, write a sentence, which isn't necessarily of this, uh, gendered feminine sort. Um, why does women's writing, in other words have to be women's writing? It seems to me that this, that, that it is free.

Speaker 1:          36:40          It is French feminism and the critique, the possible critique of French feminism that Virginia Woolf is anticipating in advance when she embarks on this perilous idea of Androgyny of the kind of mind that needs to be both male and female. Uh, and that needs to write in a way that Virginia Woolf says is actually very sexy, uh, precisely in the moment when one is not thinking about one's sex. Uh, the moment, in other words, when there is no longer a question of the man sentence and the woman's hands, I think it has to be said that although one could emphasize in a room of one's own this sort of advanced criticism of French feminism and also have the idea that there is essentially something that we call woman and I'm not through with that topic. I think it has to be said that although we could read a room of one's own in this way, at the same time, we have to recognize an ambivalence on Virginia Woolf's part on this subject.

Speaker 1:          37:47          There is a difference between her insistence that Jane Austin wrote like a woman that is, that she shrugged off the tyranny of the man sentence and wrote her own sentence, uh, her own kind of sentence, a woman sentence regardless whether or not that is actually in literary historical terms. True. Uh, the idea on the one hand that it's important to write like a woman. Uh, and the idea on the other hand that it's important to write androgynously we have to, we have to concede I think to the impressionistic form of these lectures that she's giving. Uh, we have to concede that she waivers on this point that there is that, that somehow or another, well, it's very difficult to pin in wolf the question whether there is essentially something to be called women's writing. Just as the question behind that, whether there's essentially something to be called woman or the question on the contrary, whether the ideal of all writing is to shed as full as it can precisely it's gendered aspects. Uh, there is, there is perhaps a kind of, uh, creative or rich inconsistency on this point that it should be said. One also fines and needs to take into account in reading a womb, a room of one's own.

Speaker 1:          39:18          All right. Now getting a little closer to the, uh, to, uh, to this whole question of beyond, uh, the Gyno critical because, uh, show Walter for example, and talking about the history of the novel, uh, talks about those three phases. First, the fee, the feminine, that the phase in which women try very much to write as though they were a man by deferring completely to male values, uh, in all the ways that they can, uh, perhaps, um, introducing a kind of, uh, uh, again, um, Angel in the house, uh, cultural, um, uh, a benevolence and benignity into perspectives of men that can be sometimes rather militaristic and harsh. Uh, but nevertheless hiding behind, uh, frequently male names, curve bell act and bell, George Elliot and so on. Um, and, uh, not really, uh, not really, uh, entering into questions of, um, uh, of the place of women and society.

Speaker 1:          40:24          A show, Walter then says, this is a phase supplanted by a feminist moment in the history of the novel in which novels as the late work of Mrs Gaskell, for example, and other such novels become 10 dentures. Uh, and the place and role of women becomes the dominant theme of novels of this kind. Uh, it's a plant. And by the way, this takes a wolf's critique critique of Charlotte Bronte, a little bit out of chronology because presumably Charlotte Bronte belongs to what show Walter is calling the female phase and the history of the novel. Um, but, uh, and, and so it's interesting that wolf finds a kind of Tropo feminism damaging to the texture of Jane Eyre already in Charlotte Bronte's novel. And then finally, uh, what, what Elaine Showalter likes best, the supplanting of the feminist novel because a Elaine show Walter to is nervous about the 10 benches of fiction, uh, does the planning of that by what she calls the female novel.

Speaker 1:          41:26          Um, which is the novel that simply takes for granted the authenticity and legitimacy of woman's part of you writes from that part of you. But as in Virginia, Woolf having shed or shaken off the elements of, uh, anger or adversary consciousness that, uh, earlier, uh, novels had typically manifested. Uh, and this is very much very similar in the history. This history of the novel is very similar to what show Walter is doing with her sense of the history of recent feminist criticism that's in two phases. First, the feminist as she calls it, uh, when the treatment of men of women by men in fiction is the main focus. And then the Gyno critical, which is the appropriation for women of a literary tradition, show Walters at pains to point out that the most, much of the most important work of recent feminist scholarship, the feminist scholarship of the 1970s is end simply the unearthing of an expanding of a cannon of women's writing.

Speaker 1:          42:35          Uh, not exclusively novelistic because there had been a time, uh, when, um, the novel was sort of half conceited to women as a possible outlet for their writing. But this concession was accompanied by the, um, by the sovereign assertion that they couldn't write poetry and plays. Uh, and so an expansion of the cannon such that all forms of writing are available and made visible and recognized as actually existing in a tradition, uh, so that we can trace women's writing as show Walter puts it from decade to decade and not from great book, two great book. Uh, so that there really is a tradition comparable to the male tradition that one can think about, think within a and draw on as a creative writer oneself. Uh, so both show alters history of the novel and her history of modern feminist or modern women's criticism. One had better say, uh, and at the point when it is still a question of the woman's perspective, but this raises a question and I mean, and, and it's, and it's, it's, uh, I've, I've been touching on it in a variety in a variety of ways, but it really raises the question that has to hunt, thinking of this kind, and we're going to be encountering it again and again and again.

Speaker 1:          44:04          Uh, as we move through other forms of identity perspective in criticism and theory, the raises the question whether if I say that a woman or women's writing is of a certain sort, that is, that is if I identify a woman in a way that I take somehow to be recognizable, let's say identify a woman as intuitive, imaginative, impressionistic, sensitive, illogical, opposed to reason, our refuser of that periodic sort of subject predicate sentence that we associate with men's writing. I can appropriate that for women like the French feminists and I can identify women in so doing as such people. But isn't that simply inverting what men in Virginia Woolf's discover isn't in the British Museum in the second chapter of a room of one's own? Isn't that just inverting all the negative values that men have attached to women all along? Isn't it ultimately to accept men's opinions of women men's ways of saying that because they are avatars of reasons, science, logic, uh, and all the rest of it, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          45:33          Isn't it a way of saying that the head is higher than the heart and accepting, in other words, the lower or inferior status of this Oregon to this Oregon, even though one supposes oneself to have trans valued them and insisted in promoting women's consciousness that the heart is higher than the head. What hasn't done anything? In other words to the essential identities that have governed patriarchal thought from the beginning. It is precisely this characterization of women that has enabled and, and gendered patriarchy. And so, and this is where the problem, this is where the theoretical problem arises and it calls forth, it calls for it seems to me, uh, uh, a sense that somehow or another one has to put the possibility and there's really no other way to say it. And this is something that Judith Butler frequently says and, and, and people who work in the mode of Judith Butler, one has to put the suggestion, but perhaps the best thing one can say as a feminist is there's no such thing as a woman.

Speaker 1:          46:49          There is no woman. Now, of course, this is perilous and this is what, and this is, and this is what drives such at such an unfortunate wedge in the midst of feminist thought in real life, in real material existence. There are certainly are women, they are oppressed by laws. They are, they are oppressed by men, uh, and their, and, and their, their rights and their very lives need to be protected with perpetual vigilance. The idea, in other words, the theoretical idea that there's no such thing as a woman is not an idea that can be sustained in life. And yet at the same time, the implications of what the language of identity politics is always calling essential ism. The implications of saying woman is one particular thing, and it might be better if we said woman was one particular thing, but it was something other than what men have been saying she was all along.

Speaker 1:          47:52          But, but making the problem worth saying that woman is one particular thing, which is, uh, just what men have always said, she was only, it's a good thing, right? That, that, that, that positions of this kind taken up in this way. Uh, despite the fact that there are absolutely necessary for practical feminism, for real world feminism are nevertheless, uh, detrimental to a more sensitive theoretical understanding of gender. Um, and of the possibilities of gender. It's all very well to be, um, to be, you know, intuitive and emotional and, and, and impressionistic. Uh, but one last to say two things about that and the first place a guy gets to be that if he wants to write, and in the second place, why does a woman have to be that? Right? And it's perfectly clear, it's perfectly clear in both cases that there are exceptions which go vastly beyond the exception that proves the rule.

Speaker 1:          48:50          It's perfectly clear that in both cases, uh, there are sensibilities across gender that completely mix up, uh, and, and, and discredit these categories. Uh, and so for all of those reasons, uh, there's a problem. Uh, just very quickly, just I wanted to point out that, that, I mean, looking at show Walters essay that this is a bind, that criticism around 1980 really hasn't gotten past. I'm not going to take, it's time's up. I'm not going to take time to quote passages, but notice, uh, her animus. And here in a way we go back to the beginning, her animus against Marxism and structuralism on the grounds. And of course we've said this ourselves on the grounds that both of them present themselves as sciences. Aha. There are gendered male, you know, uh, Marxism and structuralism aren't anything we want to have to do with because this is just, uh, Virginia Woolf's beetle, uh, raising its ugly head again and imposing its will through it.

Speaker 1:          49:53          Superior rationality, uh, on women. Uh, so we don't want any of that. What we want instead is a form of criticism. And this is what she says at the end of the essay on pages 1385 and 1386 what we want instead is a form of criticism that evades scientific city, a form of criticism that engages with the reality of texts and of the textual tradition, but doesn't trouble. It's pretty little head doesn't trouble it's head with theoretical matters. In other words, this socio writes itself from the logical, from the old, from overarching structure, from scientific city show altar leaves herself in this position and a sir and, and, and she leaves feminist criticism in this position as, um, how might one put it, um, a colonized enterprise that can do anything at likes as long as it's not reasonable. Uh, and if that's an and, and if that's the case, then of course it imposes an essential Ising limit on the possibilities of feminist criticism just as of course, the characterization of men's criticism, uh, in the way that it's characterized.

Speaker 1:          51:10          Needless to say also imposes limits on that, uh, fair and legitimate limits or perhaps exaggerated limits, uh, is open to question that's not nearly as important to point as the, the reminder, uh, that, um, there's a kind of marginalization of the possibilities for a feminist criticism, uh, involved in saying that it has to be something other than the sort of thing that Marxist instructure was paradigms make available. Uh, okay. Now I think that, uh, Henry Louis Gates will have a very influenced by buck teen will have a very interesting way of coming to terms with this question of what's available for a marginalized minority criticism, uh, once it avoids or has succeeded in avoiding the terms of the mainstream criticism. Uh, and I want you to read gates his essay, uh, with that particularly in mind, then we'll come back with the question of, as it were, the future of feminist criticism, feminist criticism in a way since 1980, uh, when we turn to the work of the gender theorists, uh, in particular, Judith Butler.
