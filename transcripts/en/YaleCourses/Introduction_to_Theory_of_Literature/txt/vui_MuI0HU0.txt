Speaker 1:          00:01          So I'll, I'll tell you a little bit about, I'll tell you a little bit about Harold blooms career later in the lecture. Uh, those of you who know how to read a poem, the books on religion, Shakespeare and the invention of the human, um, may and PR and perhaps only know those books may feel a little surprised at finding him on a literary theory syllabus. Uh, but the great outpouring of work beginning with the anxiety of influence, the map and bus reading, poetry and repression, great many other books in the 70s, uh, put bloom in the very midst of the theoretical controversies then swirling. He was associated with the so-called Yale school. In fact, he was willing to put his name as editor and also contributor on a volume that was called deconstruction and criticism. I think though that even in reading what you have before your, you can see how relatively little bloom has to do with deconstruction.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Uh, and certainly in his more recent career, he's distanced himself from a well from theory. I mean, he, he's, uh, he hasn't really changed his views of anything, although he doesn't any longer read poems through the machinery of the six revisionary ratios. Perhaps I should stop there and say the six revisionary ratios won't be on the test. Now, you know, I mean, I think that nothing could be more exciting than to understand clean oven Tessera, you know, sort of Kinosis us cases, demonization, appa, Fraydi's Whoa. You know, to wander in the realms of these, uh, of these ideas and actually to use them as a machinery for practical criticism, to take a poem and to see what you can actually do with these ideas really is, and I'm serious, uh, an exciting process. And you may sit, you may very much resent not having these six ratios on the exam.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Uh, and you may wish to hear more about them and you'll hear something about a few of them in passing today. But, uh, uh, if you do wish to hear more about them, perhaps perhaps your sections will provide, provide some guidance. Um, in any case, in any case, uh, the, the contributions of bloom, uh, to theory in my opinion, and I hope to bring this out in the long run, have primarily to do with the fact that I think he can legitimately and authentically be called an important literary historiography. That is to say together with, uh, people like Dan Yanoff and Jakobson, uh, in earlier in the chorus, Hans Brobeck yellows later in the course bloom does seriously deserve to be considered a literary historian. That is to say a, with a theory about literary history on a par with those, with those other figures. Uh, uh, it's, this hasn't always often been remarked.

Speaker 1:          03:09          As a matter of fact, the general, the general critical attitude toward bloom is that he's hopelessly a historicist cares. Nothing about history, cares nothing about the way in which the real world impinges on literature. Um, and in a certain measure as, as we'll also see there's some truth in this, but he has a powerful argument about the relationship among texts as they succeed each other in history. Uh, it's an argument which I think, which I think really we ignore at our peril. It's an important one, a, and it is a psychoanalytic one, which is, which is one of the things that places him at this point in the course, you'll notice that as we turn, you know, you remember the sort of try partition of the subject matter of our course, which it's all headed up in the syllabus and all clearly to be understood.

Speaker 1:          04:01          You know, first we have logo genesis, the production of literature by language. Then we have psycho genesis, the production of literature by the human psyche. Then we have socio genesis, the production of literature by social, economic and political and historical factors. Okay, fine. Well and good. But you may have noticed how much trouble we've had getting into psycho genesis. We keep saying we've arrived at psycho genesis, but we actually continue to be working obviously with linguistic models. Here's Lacan telling us, you know, the, uh, the unconscious is a, resembles a language, is structured like a language books telling us that it's the verbal, uh, structure, uh, arising out of the relationship between metaphor and Matana me that constitutes the narrative text. And we keep sitting around twiddling your thumbs, waiting for somebody to say, let's now think about the psycho genesis of the text. Well, bloom brings us closer, uh, uh, big and he himself, you know, when he speaks of the poet in the poet, uh, is uh, is, is, is concerned to describe what he calls an agon, a psychological agon or struggle between the belated poet and the precursor, uh, taking place, uh, at that level in the psyche.

Speaker 1:          05:20          But even bloom of course is talking about the relation of texts to text. He is talking about relations which are arguably verbal, um, verbal influenced by the way. Uh, he always professes contempt for, he calls it moldy fig philology. Uh, but I think that as you study the examples of literary influence in Bloom's text, anxiety of influence, map of minutes reading and so on, uh, you will see that there is a kind of dependence on verbal, uh, Echo, verbal continuity that his theory, the strong version of, of his theory struggles against. But I think nevertheless does, does link itself to, and, um, and I want to move into a general exploration of the topic of influence by talking in fact about how unstable the relationship between an idea of influence, which is let's say psychological or a world based and an idea of influence, which is word based, uh, can be, it's not as simple and straightforward a distinction as one might imagine.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Um, so we're, we, we linger in these linguistic models and there's a long tradition in which the, uh, confusion between the psychic and the linguistic, uh, is manifest. And it has to do with the traditional subject, the very traditional subject of imitation. Plato and Aristotle agree that art poetry is an imitation. It's, it is both of them say an imitation of nature. Plato thinks it's done badly. Aristotle thinks it's done well, but they both agree that poetry is an imitation of nature. Uh, and then, uh, as time passes, this idea of mummy says, uh, imitation, the imitation of nature gradually becomes transformed so that by the time you get to the silver age of a Roman literature, uh, a high water mark of elegance in the Latin language, by the time you get there, you have rhetorical theorists like quintile in and Cicero and others talking not about [inaudible], but about in Latin.

Speaker 1:          07:42          Of course, any Tatio same idea seemingly that they're still talking about imitation. But the strange thing that's happened is now they're not talking about the invitation of nature anymore. They're talking about the imitation of literary models. In other words, the imitation of language. Uh, the way in which we can establish cannons by thinking about the relationship of particular poets and other writers with a tradition of literary expression, uh, from which they emerge. So this then he, me Tacho becomes a language based theory of influence, uh, or Ising seemingly spontaneously out of a nature based theory of influence. Now take a look at the first passage on your sheet, uh, from Alexander Pope's essay on criticism. He's talking about Virgil here. Homer, the argument is, has to have imitated nature. After all, there were no literary models to imitate. So of homer imitated anything. It must've been nature.

Speaker 1:          08:47          Well, fine, homer imitated nature. But then along comes Virgil in this same period of, by the way, when a rhetorical theories, we're redefining imitation as the invitation of verbal models along comes verb Virgil. Then he says, I'm going to write my own national epic. Uh, and you know what, I'll just sit down and write it. But then he starts looking at homer. This is all what the pope is thinking as he prepares to write the cup that's on here. She, uh, he said that he then, you know, he's, he starts to write, but then he rereads homer. And at first he feels terrible because he realized that homer has said it all. You know, there's two poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey, there's nothing left to say. Homer has covered. The entire homer has covered the entire waterfront. And you know, so, so what verbal is co Virgil is sort of stock.

Speaker 1:          09:40          What is he going to do? Well, what he can do if he can't imitate a nature anymore because homer has done that is he can imitate homer. And the result is he comes to a sort of realization that pope epitomizes in this couplet. But when to examine every part he came, that is to say every part of Homer's compositions, every part of his own composition as he undertook to write his own epic, when to examine every part he came, nature and homer were, he found the same. And so here you have emerging the idea that to imitate nature and to imitate art, to imitate the things of the world, people of the world, and to imitate language is part and parcel of the same process. To do one you necessarily and perforce do the other. And that's what I mean by saying that we still, we're still struggling to get away from the logo genetic model to the psychogenetic model.

Speaker 1:          10:46          We are still, even in the most traditional expressions of how influence works like pokes. We are still concerned, uh, to, uh, to distinguish and find it very difficult to distinguish between nature and art. Uh, when Samuel Johnson, uh, 50 years after pope is still saying nothing can please many or please long, but just representations of general nature. He is in this idea of representations and in the idea of general nature teetering between a sense that it's things in the world that are imitates and it is existing literary models that are imitates and from which art takes its cue. All right, so this, there's a kind of collapse then of it in the, in the idea of imitation, there's a kind of a collapse, a surprising collapse perhaps when you think about it between, uh, the notion of the imitation of nature and the notion of the imitation of art.

Speaker 1:          11:51          Now when we, we turn then to the two texts that you read for today, both of which are theories of influence, uh, you can see that ts Elliot to, uh, is a little bit unclear as to the relationship of these two sorts of imitation for Elliot. The individual talent that inserts itself into, that engages with tradition has to cope with what Eliot calls the mind of Europe. Page five 39 lefthand column. I'll read a fairly extensive passage because this is one of the, one of the most accessible summaries of what Elliot has to say. The poet must be quite aware of the obvious fact that art never improves, but the, but that the material of art, am I in the place I want to be in? Yes, but that the material of art is never quite the same. He must be aware that the mind of Europe, the mind of his own country, a mind which he learns in time to be much more important than his own private mind.

Speaker 1:          12:58          And let me just stop there and say, this seems as much unlike bloom as it can possibly be because bloomed the romantic, you know, there's all about one's own private mind, the struggle of the individual mind to define itself over against, uh, all of those mines, jostling for attention that preceded to overcome them to the point where they are in effect he faced. And the belated, uh, ego, uh, can finally establish itself as prior to all preceding egos. I mean, this sort of struggle scenes and I say seems because I'm going to be lingering over this for a while, seems to be absent from Elliot. Elliot seems to be all about selfie face meant about the recognition that the mind of Europe is more important than one's own mind. That if one is to contribute anything as an individual talent to tradition, that contribution has to be a matter of the most, uh, acutely sensitive, uh, awareness of everything.

Speaker 1:          14:05          Not that one is struggling to be, but that one is not. Uh, it seems in other words like a very different perspective to continue the passage, uh, is a mind. The mind of Europe is a mind which changes and that this change is a development which abandons nothing on route, which does not superannuation either Shakespeare or homer or the rock drawing of the Magdalena Ian draftsman. This is a development refined that this development refinement perhaps complication certainly is not from the point of view of the artist. Any improvement. In other words, the relationship between tradition and the individual talent is a relationship of entering into a vast matrix of literary, philosophical, uh, and other sorts of expression that changes and yet never really transforms itself and certainly can't be understood as a grand march or progress toward some great goal because nothing is ever lost and nothing radically innovative can ever really be introduced.

Speaker 1:          15:20          I hope you're thinking in, in, in reflecting on a passage of this kind about a good deal that we've passed through already got hammered sense of tradition, uh, as something which depends absolutely on the awareness of continuity, on the willingness to meet the past half way, uh, to enter into a merger of horizons, uh, in which the past and the present can speak in an authentic way to each other. Uh, and that, um, in other ways this, uh, this, this idea or possibly also the Russian formalist idea, uh, and it's Darwinian sense that the dominant and the recessive elements of any literary texts are always present at any time. It's just that, uh, they tend perpetually in a kind of oscillation to be changing places with each other. So the whole gamut of literary possibility of expressive possibility is according to theories of, of history of this kind is always already there and one's own entry into this vast sea of expressive possibility is always a subtle thing that certainly can't in any way be seen to showcase or to manifest any sort of original genius, uh, as the romantic tradition might want to insist on it.

Speaker 1:          16:48          All right, so this, I this, this is basically the perspective of Elliot and one. Um, and, and, and one from which, uh, certainly, you know, uh, bloom would obviously seem to be diverging. Now I want to say, I want to argue that actually, uh, there's a tremendous amount of continuity between Elliot and bloom and that blooms a tradition in the balloons. Sorry, anxiety of influence. I've never discussed this with health, by the way. I, those of you who may be taking his seminars, I, you know, I leave it up to you whether you want to take this up with him. You know, I, you know, I, as I say, I leave that up to you. Um, but I think, um, I think a strong argument can be made and I have made it in print. So Harold has seen it, uh, that, uh, that, uh, bloom misreads is a strong ms reader of ts Elliot, which is to say such as the logic of strong misreading the, that said everything bloom has to say already.

Speaker 1:          17:51          And I do, despite this extraordinary appearance of total difference in perspective, the traditional versus the romantic, uh, and so on. Um, and I don't want to go into detail in this argument for fear of being considered obsessive, but I, I'd, I'd, I'd like to, I'd like to make a few points about it in passing because I think it's such a perfect exemplification of how the anxiety of influence works. Bloom has always denied the influence of traditional tradition and the individual talent. He said, I mean, he acknowledged his influences, but there Amerson Nicha the great romantic poets and so on. Uh, but, and, and he's, as I say them and were denied the, the influence of Elliot. And yet as one reads, Elliot, I'm going to spend some time with Elliot. Now. It seems to me that at least in skeletal form, in suggestion, bloom is all there already, which is after all, all bloom ever says about the relationship between a precursor and a belated writer.

Speaker 1:          18:53          So it can't beat surprising Kenneth all right now, um, now first of all, a bloom of course, uh, it's very important to bloom, uh, to show the way in which the new reconstitutes the old that is to say the appropriation of the precursor text, which is not unknown optional text, although it, and that's one of the things that's sort of counter about, about blooms, uh, writing in this period. He insists that there is a particular precursor text. I mean, you know, the precursor texts for Tintern Abbey has listed us, don't tell me about other precursor tax. It's less of this. And he shows, he shows how this is the case. So the, but the relationship between the belated text and the precursor text is such that we can never read the precursor taxed the same way again. The, the, the strong misreading of the precursor text is so powerful and other words that it becomes our strong misreading.

Speaker 1:          19:58          We just can't think about, listen this in the same way on this view, after we've read Tintern Abbey, and I mean if, and if this seems counterintuitive, um, just, I mean, just think they think about certain examples that might come to mind. Um, the most obvious example is the famous as is, is the famous text by bore has called Prm and our author of Don Quixote, I imagine a number of, you know, that text, but, uh, what it consists in basically is, uh, it's a kind of an anecdote about a freshmen writing. I, as I recall in the end of the 19th century, uh, in Spanish, uh, a text and this text is, as it turns out, verbatim word for word Cervantes, Don Quixote, all it's not Cervantes. Don Quixote is pyramid. Ours don't Don Quixote and think how different it is. This is a Frenchman, the end of the 19th century, a Frenchmen writing in Spanish.

Speaker 1:          21:00          Ooh, that's pretty impressive. Much more impressive than Cervantes, merely writing and his own language, you know? And, and it's a completely different historical perspective, whereas Cervantes thinks he's being a little bit ironic about his own historical moment. You know, the death of chivalry and all that. Think about how ironic you can be about that historical moment writing several centuries later with everything that you know now. I mean it's, I mean, what a tour de force to be able to write don Quixote at the end of the 19th century in another language, a toll, a whole new ballgame. How can you read? How can you ever read so Avantis Don Quixote in the same way? It seems naive right now. That's now that's not the point of the store. The front of the story is actually to be little pyramid are, but this is, but, but you can see this as a, as a theory of strong mystery pyramid pay.

Speaker 1:          21:55          I'm on our thinks he's doing something new. All right. Fact is he's not doing anything new at all. His belief that he's doing something new is precisely his misreading of the precursor taxed. And yet, and by the way, you don't have to have read the precursor text. You don't have to have read the precursor to it's precise. It's precisely his misreading of the precursor tech. But that miss reading after all is something in it's very power, which, uh, as it were, infiltrates our own understanding of the precursor text making it impossible for us to read it the same way again. Think of Joyce's Ulysses and we all know that you listened his life. Virgil's Aeneid is based on the odyssey that it as it were, recycles the Odyssey. But it seems to be looking at the Odyssey through the wrong end of a telescope. I mean, it's just, I mean it's dragging all the, all the sort of heroic dimension of the poem down into a kind of nitty gritty account of everyday life in recent society.

Speaker 1:          22:59          And, and, and in other words, it's it implicitly, precisely. And following the artists, he debunks the heroic myth of the Odyssey. How can we read, in other words, the Odyssey in the same way, again, after we've read, you'll listen. He's now, it has to be said in bloom would say this. Ulysses is not a strong misreading of the odyssey because it's perfectly conscious of what it's doing. It knows exactly what it's doing with respect to the text of the Odyssey. So it's a, so it's a, it's a deliberate misreading, uh, which has other virtues is not quite the same thing, but what it does have in common with blooms theory and what it has in common also with Elliot idea about the relationship between the individual talent and tradition is that it reconstitutes tradition. It makes us see, it doesn't just provide something novel. It makes us see tradition itself, uh, in a different way.

Speaker 1:          24:00          Page five, 38, the right hand column, about halfway down the existing monuments says Elliot Forum an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new, the really new work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new year. New Work arrives for order to persist after the supervision of novelty. The whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly altered. We can't quite see it the same way again. So it's, it's a dynamic mutual relationship between tradition and the individual talent, the strong precursor and they'd be laded poet in each case, which is mutually transforming and the, and the basis, the principle of transformation as the belated poets strong misreading of the precursor, which simultaneously asserts the egotistic, the egoistic priority of the belated poet. I'm doing something new, I'm going where no one has ever gone before and I'm doing so, so powerfully that it's a question whether there actually was anybody before, uh, on the one hand and the strong precursor who turns out as one reflects more and more and more about the relationship to have said everything the belated poet says already, right.

Speaker 1:          25:30          So simultaneously a what blooms theory of literary history, his literary historiography places a premium on innovation and on conservatism or tradition simultaneously unlike God, them are leaning toward the conservative or traditional, either Lee or the Russian formalists leaning toward the innovative, the blooming and idea simultaneously countenances the idea of tradition as something absolutely continuous and also of tradition as something which is constantly being remade or at least rethought. And that I have to tell you is very similar to TSL, its position. So now again, you know the famous aphorism of Elliot on page five 39, uh, the lefthand column at the bottom, someone said, the dead writers are remote from us because we know so much than they did precisely. And they are that which we know rather good. I think, uh, the famous aphorism of Tsl, it can also be understood as something that bloom in his own way might very well say.

Speaker 1:          26:52          The past is what we know, but we're not aware of knowing it. In other words, I write the past when I write my belated poem, but I don't think I'm doing it. I think instead that I'm doing something new, I am in the first revisionary ratio clean. Amen. I am swerving from the past. I swerve out and down. I find my own space, like a Lucretia Adam. I mean if it weren't for swerving and Lucretia says, you know, all the items would fall in the same place, that wouldn't be good. So, so they all swerve so they can all fall in their own place. Well that's the, that that is the belated poets sense of what he's doing in relation to the precursor. He's swerving out and down from the precursor port, uh, from the precursor put. Uh, but of course he's not, and we'll come back to this.

Speaker 1:          27:45          He's not, he's actually falling in the same place, but the strength of that swerve, the rhetorical gesture of the swerve is so powerful that we do feel transported. Once again. We feel both at once. The innovation and the necessary conservative conservatism or preservational aspect of the new poets composition. All right. So, um, I think as I say that this too is very much that, that, that Elliot's aphorism too, very much anticipates blooms view, uh, of the agonistic struggle among poets. And then finally, you know, La is famous emphasis and this of course, nothing could seem to be less bloomin'. And this, uh, Elliot's famous emphasis on the poets impersonality on the wish to escape personality a lot. Of course he says right hand column, page five, 41 and of section two. But of course, only those who have personality. Any emotions? No. What it means to water escape from these things.

Speaker 1:          28:54          Uh, you know, in other words, to enter a world of art and effect, to abandoned, uh, the sense that what's important is, uh, my personal, uh, psychological agony to, uh, to, to enter, uh, by contrast the mind of Europe to recognize the complete insignificance of any individual mine, certainly my own, uh, and to immerse oneself as a poet, as an artist, as a creator, if one can still retain this term, uh, in that which is, uh, infinitely more vast than one is oneself. Well, that doesn't sound very bloomin', but look on page 1160, the right hand column, add blooms a third revisionary race, yo a [inaudible] or maybe it's Kenosis. Huh? We'll see in a minute. Soon as I can find the page 1160,

Speaker 1:          29:59          that's cases and it's the fifth revisionary ratio. Uh, he's talking about, he's talking about what the later poet, the belated poet does, uh, in order to find a defined space for himself. What, what can I do in order to make myself different from other people? While you would think the answer would be make yourself bigger than anybody. I mean, Wallace Stevens has a wonderful poem called rabbit as King of the ghosts and the rabbit swells up. Uh, so to become so big that it just kind of overwhelms everything. And I always think of this as blooms, belated poet, but if you have, but, but, but if you have, um, a ski races as one of the authentic revisionary ratios, something very different is happening to this same and, uh, about halfway through the definition definition five, um, he, and by the way, the, uh, the masculine pronoun is something that Harold has never apologized for.

Speaker 1:          30:56          Uh, what he means is that a poet, um, is gendered masculine, but that of course, any woman can be a poet. Uh, we'll come back to distinctions of that sort of later. He does think of Emily Dickinson, for example, as a strong poet. Uh, but it's obviously that's a controversial aspect of Bloom's work, but he, but he uses the, he is as the masculine prologue unapologetically. And of course his theory is very much caught up in the idea of oedipal conflict, which as Freud is always being criticized for is unless you, uh, unless you projected into the realm of the symbolic as Lacan and feminists luck. Candians Du do is undoubtedly a masculinist idea. You know, the, if the essential generational conflict of human beings is between father and son, well, you know, obviously, uh, problems can be seen to arise from that. Um, and uh, in Bloom's rhetoric in his vocabulary, this, this, the, the masculinist, uh, oedipal conflict is still central in any case, uh, returning to this point about the effacement of the self in the very act of trying to find a place for, for oneself as an innovator and he faced which, however, once again seems to me to catapult bloom back into the position of Elliot that he is trying to misread strongly.

Speaker 1:          32:21          He says he yields the poet yields up part of his own human and imaginative endowment. In other words, he curtails himself. He shrinks himself. He makes himself less than he might have been. Of course, in order to be more than he has been, he yields up part of his own human and imaginative, a dominant so as to separate himself from others, including the precursor. So in, in [inaudible] and also in Kinosis. By the way, there is a self shrinking or self effacement on the part of these particular moves of strong misreading with respect to the precursor. It's not another, it's just a question of the rabbit as king of the ghost is not a question of a massive ego, uh, swelling to the point where it fills all space. It is more complicated than that. And in being more complicated, it is frankly more Elliot. Like, all right, so turning then more directly to a bloom, his career begins his car.

Speaker 1:          33:28          It has always involved a sense of struggle in their relationship among poets. In his earliest work, uh, uh, Shelley's mythmaking Blake's apocalypse visionary company and his earliest work, uh, the idea of struggle was embodied plainly as what he called Protestantism. In other words, he saw the tradition he was talking about arising in relation to the reformation. Uh, that time when, as I said, in my thumbnail history of Hermeneutics, uh, everybody, everybody suddenly realized he had his own Bible, his own relationship with God. And other words that time when human, uh, individuality, uh, emerges also of course called by many others. The emergence of the bourgeoisie in that moment, the idea of Protestantism purely in the sense as a character in DRL says that I protest, uh, emerges so that each poet, uh, takes in some sense and adversary stance toward previous literary models. This is present in Bloom's work from the beginning of his career.

Speaker 1:          34:37          The, uh, the, the word Protestant gradually gives way to the word revisionary. And then, uh, that's the word that he uses primarily in the visionary company, for example. Uh, and then finally becomes the notion of misreading the protest of the belated figure is the protest, which takes the form of transfiguring, the precursor taxed, uh, in such a way that one can find oneself to be original. It is an oedipal struggle. Now th th th this idea of oedipal struggle, which is largely unconscious, is not new to bloom. Just quickly to review the next three passages on your sheet lawn, Gina's the, uh, the author who's actual identity, we cannot quite determine, uh, but who's on the sublime, uh, an extraordinarily interesting texts is available to us to read. Um, I've got two passages from him. The first is, as if instinctively this is in the moment of the sublime, as if instinctively our soul is uplifted by the true sublime fine.

Speaker 1:          35:47          That's what you would expect anybody to say. It takes a proud flight and it's filled with joy and vaunting. And this is where the surprise comes as though it had itself produced what it has heard. And other words, there is a kind of, they're there, there's a kind of possession by the other that takes place, which is simultaneously experienced psychologically as possession of the other, right. You know, it is speaking through me. It's making me very excited. Like a little kid, you know, the watching TV and somebody hits a home run and the little kid goes like this and thinks he thought he hit the home run. I mean, he's, he's, he's completely into the fantasy of being that hero. It's the same thing with the, uh, with the response, uh, to something that we haven't said so such that in a certain moment we think we have said it.

Speaker 1:          36:43          It's a, it's, it's a mutual possession. It possesses us causing the psychological reaction that we think of ourselves as possessing it. And that, uh, uh, it seems to me that there's real insight in what launch ionist is saying and that it has and that it has an important influence on Bloom's position. Another passage from launch dryness and a boat. And by the way, I think what longe Anna says here is absolutely true. Plato is constantly abusing homer, and yet nothing can be easier than to show the ways in which the great Homeric actions, uh, and even tropes, uh, uh, uh, help shape platonic thought. Uh, it's, it's, it's a fascinating topic and Laryngitis, it seems to me, again, uh, is exactly right about it. There would not have been so fine a bloom, sorry. So find a bloom of perfection on Plato's philosophical doctrines, unless he had with all his heart and mind struggled with homer for primacy.

Speaker 1:          37:46          He even thinks in bloom in terms of that, of wanting to be first, even though in some part of your mind, you know, your second, he even struggles for primacy showing perhaps too much love of contention and breaking a lance with him as it were, but deriving some profit from the contest. Nonetheless, for as he says, this strife is good for mortal mortals. Quickly and more commonplace example taking from, uh, uh, bird, a famous acid, his called what is a classic, which is all about influence. There's, you know, the, the, the tradition of essays, uh, called what is a classic, Eliot wrote a great one in 1944, uh, is very much a contribution to the history of the theory of influence. Uh, so sad bird rights, uh, Gerta spoke the truth when he remarked that Byron great by the flow and source of poetry feared that Shakespeare was more powerful than him side.

Speaker 1:          38:44          It's true. Byron was always abusing Shakespeare, fear that Shakespeare was more powerful than himself and the creation and realization of his characters. He would have liked to deny it the elevation, so free from this as Gerda talking the elevation, so free from egoism irritated him. He felt when near it that he could never display himself at ease. He never denied pope because he did not fear him. He knew that pope was an, you know how short pope was. He knew that pope was only a low wall by his side. So in other words, he chose as his literary model, somebody he knew he was better than not true by the way, but he thought he was better than Alexander Pope. And he perpetually denied a very, very powerful influence on his writing. Quarrelling constantly with Shakespeare and Shakespeare and bar, dollar tree and, and, uh, excessive love of hamlet and all the rest of it.

Speaker 1:          39:44          Um, he's constantly sort of denying the any influence or power over himself on the part of Shakespeare he chooses and other words for his precursor a week precursor instead of a strong precursor. And all of this is a continuous theme, uh, in the psychodynamic of, uh, of, of Bloom's theory as, as he elaborates it. So what complicates bloons argument apart apart from the vocabulary and the, and the philosophical range of the thought is what I began with this, the traditional idea of uh, influence as a, as an art nature problem, trying to figure out in fact whether, uh, the, uh, whether the crisis of influence is the sense of one's orientation to nature, one's ability to imitate nature, have nature available to one or whether it's word or I added the sense of ones, which it seems to be, uh, more in bloom, the sense of one's relationship with texts.

Speaker 1:          40:49          But notice on page 1157, that blown really doesn't want to say it's just about texts. He doesn't really want to say that it, that it has exclusively to do with the strong precursor understood as it were, as an author. There is in some sense a text of nature as well. So that bloom says a bottom of 1157 right hand column, uh, uh, Freud's disciple auto rock shows a greater awareness of the artists fight against art end of the relation of this struggle to the artist antithetical battle against nature. In other words, nature is death. Nature is that into which should he not sustain himself in the triumph of his assertion of priority. Nature is that into, it's the author will fall back into, into in the form of death. Weight'll they try to transcribe that sentence. Okay. Well but, but, but you, you got, you got what I mean?

Speaker 1:          41:59          Um, so, uh, and, and this is an interesting problem and bloom and bloom wants to insist that part of the struggle of the belated poet is a struggle for mortality. Part of what it means to come first and to know nothing ever having been there before you is also to suppose that you're going to be last, that you're going to be immortal, that you really do not belong in an unfolding, inexorable sequence of the sort that we call history. But that you are rather something, a force, a genius, a power that transcends history. And this entails as much the lie against time as bloom calls it, holding off death as it does, insisting, uh, on their having been no beginning, no priority, no genesis in what you do. You were there first or to illustrate this very quickly, let's look at passages five and six on your sheet.

Speaker 1:          43:09          Wordsworth, uh, the strong miss reader, uh, and belated poet with respect to Milton, uh, the particularly important strong miss reader a and belated put with respect to Milton and blooms view Wilton, right Wordsworth rights in a kind of programmatic or promissory poem, uh, written actually in 1800, not, not published, uh, until 1814 as part of his, as part of the preface to a poem of his called the excursion. Uh, he wrote a prospectus, uh, to the recluse. That's what at one time they incur the excursion was supposed to be part of. And he says, I'm not interested in writing. Paradise lost. Paradise lost for me as a thing of the past. It's just, it's just archaic. Who would care about the things Milton cares about all strength, all terror, single or in bands that ever was put forth in Personal Form Jehovah. Where this thunder and the choir of shouting angels and the imperial Thrones, I passed them on alarm, paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          44:18          You know, so that's just playing with toy soldiers. You know what I mean? That's, that's that, that, that's nothing compared with what I myself am going to do. Not Chaos, not the darkest pit of Lowest Aramis nor ought of blinder vacancy. Scooped out by help of dreams can breed such fear and awe and has fall upon us. Often when we look into our minds, into the mind of man, my haunt and the main region of my song, I'm not talking about God. I'm not talking about heaven. I'm not talking about hell. I'm not talking about war heaven. I'm not talking about anything mythological or archaically, heroic. I'm talking about this. I'm talking about the mind of man. I'm talking primarily about my mind, but my mind is your mind. Mind is universal and in talking about mind, I'm not falling back into the pit of nature.

Speaker 1:          45:20          I'm keeping my focus not on the sky gods that on the transcendent, you know, so starry junk as well as Stephen called it of my precursors, all those people with their outworn superstitions. I am not interested in any of that, but I'm not interested in any of this either. I'm not interested in nature and I'm not interested in that in which I would be buried if I reduced myself to that. I'm interested in consciousness, the psyche. In other words, uh, my focus is Wordsworth says, altogether psychological. All right, no interest in paradise lost. You know, that's just archaic. Well, look at passage. Five, three statements by Satan, which bloom and cysts are. Say, it's not so much Milton because at bloom follows Blake and Shelly in this. It's not so much Milton who's the strong precursor of Wordsworth. It's actually Satan. It's Milton's Satan who says the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.

Speaker 1:          46:26          Okay. Gee whiz. I guess. I guess Satan is writing the perspectives to the recluse, isn't it? Because that's what Wordsworth and saying in the first practice to the recluse. I know no time says Satan when I was not as now. That's what the belated poet all with says. I came first elsewhere in the poem. Satan tells his troops, you know what you God keeps saying he created you. Do you remember being created? I don't remember being created. I've always been there. Right. You know, and that's, and, and, and that is in effect what he says again, what he repeats in this passage. Finally myself and hell. Well that's of course rather an uncomfortable thing to say, but at the same time it's the rabbit as king of the ghost, isn't it? It is. You know, whatever you can throw at me, I'm it already, right?

Speaker 1:          47:17          That is, uh, and because the sole region ma, the main heart and soul region of my song is the mind is my own mind. Alright? So Satan has already said in paradise lost everything Wordsworth can possibly say and the perspectives to the recluse. He has strongly misread paradise lost such that he thinks he's doing something completely new while revealing precisely that the strong precursor poet has always already written what the successor poet can, right. The tension, the dynamic, in other words between conservation and innovation is intact in all such moments. In all of the moments that involve, that involve the anxiety of influence. I'm sorry, I have so little time for this. Give me a minute or two because we have to, we have to honor Tony. Uh, and it's rather obvious that for Lacan Tony, the tow truck is a text in which Tony Saddles for the orb.

Speaker 1:          48:24          J Patea, right. Little bumpy, the car and imperfect being, but a helpful one and a friend. That's what I call a friend. Whereas the objects of desire neato speeding. Oh, you know, uh, those are cars. The objects of the objects of desire are improper object choices on the face of it. That's what an American eat ego psychologist would said, but they are in a more Boone well esque way of putting it obscure objects of desire as they motor on down the road, which are simply unavailable to Tony, uh, as object relations at all. And so the Nido and speedy are the big other, right and bumpy is the object t all right. Now, uh, it's perfectly obvious that for Harold Bloom, Tony, the tow truck is a strong misreading of the little engine that could, it's, it's perfectly clear because, you know, but bumpy af is bumpy.

Speaker 1:          49:24          W is the hero of the little engine that could, the misreading involves making Tony the hero, uh, uh, who, who needs the help of bumpy and other words, bumpy in the folkloric sense of the story becomes the helper, not the hero. Uh, but, but, but, but we can see after all that the essential narrative model, the model of, of the small, uh, turning out through perseverance and energy, uh, to, uh, necessarily reinforce the strength of the strong. And it is about the strong and the weak, both little engine that could and Tony the tow truck or about the strong and the weak, uh, that the strong, uh, must in some sense or another be supplemented or supplanted by the week if the strong is fully to self realized. We can't ever read Tony the tow truck, the character Tony, quite the same way again after the appearance of bumpy.

Speaker 1:          50:25          And yet bumpy is nothing other than the hero of the little engine that could, uh, who, who, uh, a subject position that has been appropriated by Tony in this text. And so the relationship is again, an agonistic one, uh, involving the transposition of heroism from one character focus to another while at the same time as anybody can recognize who read both stories to their kids. Uh, well, at the same time, simply rewriting the story in a way that the little engine that could completely anticipates all right. Uh, so much then for that, we'll be returning to more Lacanian pastures on Tuesday, uh, when we, uh, when we study their lives and got Tommy and slower Gj.
