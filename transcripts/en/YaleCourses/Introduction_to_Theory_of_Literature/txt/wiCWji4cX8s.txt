Speaker 1:          00:02          I'm not sure how long this lecture is going to be. We could be finished in 10 minutes though. I doubt that. Um, and if we're not finished at the end of the 50, um, there is some things that I've reserved for the end of the lecture that I definitely do want to get said. I don't know if you've noticed. There are times when, uh, the last point or two that I appeared to have been preparing to make, never did get made, but in this case, I want to make sure that they are made so that if I don't finish today, uh, or if I still have a point of tooth to make, I'll definitely be taking up those points at the beginning of Thursday's lecture. All right, now, um, the African American tradition of literary production is rich and longstanding as Henry Louis Gates tells you, uh, the first, uh, really rather important poet and the tradition Phillis Wheatley is, uh, a, an American colonial writer.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Uh, the flourishing of the slave narrative form begins in the 18th century, continues into the 19th, uh, in the 19th century witnesses, uh, extraordinary works of fiction. And in the 20th century, of course, most conspicuously in the Harlem Renaissance, but throughout the century, uh, there has been a extraordinary work done in the African American literary tradition. It's a very rich tradition. In other words, uh, somewhat in contrast with the very rich but also very recent tradition of African American literary theory and criticism, it's possible to argue that the development of theory and criticism in this tradition was somewhat barked by a preliminary way in which it found itself at odds with itself. Um, black criticism and black feminist criticism from the beginning saw that they didn't have quite the same agenda. This is something that can resonate perhaps later in this lecture when we moved to other topics. Uh, but in the meantime, critics like Barbara Christian, Barbara Smith, Debra McDowell, Hazel Carby, bell hooks were in there a variety of ways, uh, working with emphases that, uh, other, uh, and sort of typically male, uh, African American critics, uh, weren't quite comfortable with.

Speaker 1:          02:32          And so while a work, especially beginning in the 80s, a proliferated there was, as I say, a kind of internal divide, which has been a complex matter to negotiate and which, uh, is I think now largely a sort of detente has been achieved. Uh, and, uh, African American literary theory is moving forward unfettered any longer by these concerns or at least, uh, by any excess of these concerns. But in the meantime, that may partly account for a certain delay and the emergence of theory and criticism, uh, given the, uh, uh, sort of longstanding richness of the literary tradition. Now the role of Henry Louis Gates in a African American criticism is it seems to me a exemplary, although there are some rather harsh moments in this essay moments that I, that I, I wished to take up, uh, that would suggest, uh, an element of what shall I say, extremism or overkill, uh, in, uh, gates is thinking this is actually not at all the persona that he has, uh, projected.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Uh, and indeed. Um, what's extraordinary about gates? Who's, who's, uh, uh, administrative power, whose, whose abilities as a program builder, as we say, are remarkable. After he left Yale to go to Harvard, he was able to gather to Harvard, Anthony Appear, Cornell West and others, uh, who have since departed from Harvard. Um, but gates is in a way an empire unto himself. And, uh, he, he has been an extraordinary figure. The earliest work, which is actually among the earliest work is, is what you've been reading for today. Uh, established his reputation together with, um, a, the, his discovery of not so much discovery of but authentication of a manuscript by Harriet Wilson, which he published an important contribution, uh, to 19th century, uh, uh, our, our knowledge of 19th century African American literature. Uh, in any case, uh, what happened then was that gates, who's who by some miracle or an or other, he was a perfectly good writer in the first place, but gradually became a marvelous writer, began writing for the New Yorker, and during this phase of his, uh, of his career when, among other things, he produced a remarkable autobiography about growing up in West Virginia.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Um, during this phase, Gates really became a spokesperson for a detente among, uh, races and racial factions. In other words, uh, he was a voice of moderation without incurring any amputation of Uncle Tom Ism or anything of the sort. Uh, his very, his sheer urbanity as the remarkable writer that he is, uh, in those years when he wrote under Tina Brown, uh, for the New Yorker, uh, it was just a remarkable achievement and his career, uh, is still, is still going strong now for gates as for Elaine Showalter last week and for Wolf before her, uh, the problems surrounding the, the concept of identity possessed identity, uh, which of course is, um, uh, an important anchor for the thinking of people who feel the need for voices for a place, uh, in the literary and cultural horizon is nevertheless, at least potentially as we've begun to notice already a kind of quicksand. Um, the problem that there are two problems really that dog, uh, I, the, the issue of identity.

Speaker 1:          06:37          One of them is the problem of essentializing, which I'll take up now and then as I'll take it up next. Also the problem of what might be called the identity queue. Uh, in other words, I am a, um, a lower class, a black lesbian feminist who's, uh, who's a nation is Palestine. Uh, needless to say, I have a variety of identity options to choose from. Uh, but the result is the result is I've got to figure out which of them has priority. In other words, which of those identities do I suppose is, has the underlying, uh, integrity and essence, sensuality, uh, that can motivate, um, as it were, the characteristics of my other identities, uh, at which are therefore somehow or another placed, uh, further down the cute. Uh, so this, uh, is, is, is a topic that I'll come back to in a minute, but in the meantime, the problem of essentializing as we say a as we call it, um, for example, uh, uh, as gates describes it on page 1893 in the right hand column where he's very clear on the dangers of ascribing whether positively or negatively attributes to any group that is constituted as, or thought of.

Speaker 1:          08:07          Because of course, the notion of race and whether there is race is in itself according to gates problematic. Um, the problem of ascribing attributes, uh, even unethically, uh, to erase race as he describes it on page 1893, the sense, the sense of difference defined in popular usages. Finally, finally, my voice is changing. Uh, the set, the, the sense of difference defined in popular usages of the term race has been used both to describe an inscribed differences of language, belief system, artistic tradition, gene pool and all sorts of supposedly natural attributes such as rhythm, athletic ability, cerebration, usury and fidelity and other words, obviously a portioning out stereotypes to the various groups that may come forward as candidates to be racist. And pointing out that all of these stereotypes do nobody very much. Good. Um, so the problem of essential Ising which, which under girds they wish to make manifest the existence of race because, because, think about it.

Speaker 1:          09:31          On the other hand, Gates seems to be divided in the beginning of, as of his essay between a certain candor about race as in the work of [inaudible] 10 that he describes in which race, uh, [inaudible] a and cultural moment are considered the key determining issues of any kind of artistic or cultural production. He says, well, at least race is being talked about while at the same time obviously wincing away from the implications of race and from the belief that there is such a thing as rice, which goes all the way back to Montesquieu and others, uh, in 10. Nevertheless, he's rather cheerful about the fact that at least race is being discussed unlike the 20th century when the whole thing is swept under the rug. Uh, and, uh, kind of birth sites and hypocritical politeness prevents anybody from talking about such categories at all. Uh, and gives rise to the idea that we all exist in the same great tradition.

Speaker 1:          10:32          Uh, that work either belongs to that tradition or if it for some reason seems egregious or outside the tradition, it just can be shoved aside and neglected. That's the supposition of the 20th Century When folks don't talk about race. And so, you know, the very questioned whether it is an issue, uh, is part of this problem that is dogged, uh, by the more complicated, uh, the issue of a centralized for example, suppose as, and of course you've been reading about this and in, in show Walter as well, suppose you ascribe positive value to what another person might call a stereotype. This is what, uh, the, uh, the, the important a francophone African poets Song Gar does a as gates says at the top of page 1901 the right hand column Gates says, when we attempt to appropriate by inversion race as a term for an essence, as did the negritude movement, for example, we feel therefore we are a song Gar argued of the African we yield too much, such as the basis of a shared humanity.

Speaker 1:          11:48          Such gestures as Anthony of Pia has observed are futile and dangerous because of their further inscription of new and bizarre stereotypes. So you can see there are a lot of land mines to be avoided and negotiating the discourse of race. Uh, and certainly, uh, certainly gates is aware of them. Now, there's also the problem, as I say, of the identity Q and Gates himself may have a little difficulty with this, at least from time to time because as I said at the beginning, he does have this sort of uneasy detente with feminism in the African American, uh, critical tradition, uh, still to work within. And so exact, for example, on page 1894, um, uh, somewhat problematic passage in which the identity queue, uh, seems to be at issue about a third of the way down the left hand column, he says, the sanction of biology contained in sexual difference simply put, does not, and can never obtain when one is speaking of racial difference.

Speaker 1:          13:05          Yet, we carelessly used language in such a way as to will this sense of natural difference into our formulations. So what he's saying is in biological term, there's definitely a difference between the sexes, but in biological terms, uh, there is not necessarily a difference among, uh, the, uh, so called primary races. So that, so that at least when one speaks of women and men in the feminist tradition, one has to come face to face with it, with the problem of actual difference. Whereas one, one speaks of black and white in the traditions of discourse about race. One isn't actually talking about a genuine difference at all and their [inaudible] and the therefore, uh, the, uh, the discourse with the greater integrity of the two as the one which is about differences that are absolutely a femoral as opposed to the one which is about differences, which whatever one thinks of them and whatever one wants to make out of them are nevertheless essential.

Speaker 1:          14:18          Now, plainly, when we go back to feminist criticism, particularly the, the gender theory of Judith Butler, we'll see of course, that the whole question of the biological basis of sex, uh, the biological, uh, difference between the sexes, uh, which essential AISES. Uh, what we will be wanting to talk about is of course, something that is profoundly in question and not just because of so-called transgender transgender issues, but also at the same time, uh, because of the way in which, uh, are very sexual identity is something which according to Butler we construct. And so there is, um, an insistence here on biological difference between these two forms of discussing identity, which may or may not seem to us to be problematic. Now, I think this is the point at which we can see the importance, uh, the extraordinary essay that I've also asked you to read by Tony Morrison.

Speaker 1:          15:26          You know, her best of course as a novelist, but she's also a distinguished critic as she has been a distinguished editor, uh, of, of, of, of other important work. Um, and here, uh, it seems to me that her reflections in some ways give us a sideways exit from the predicaments that I've been talking about. The problem of, of essential ism, the problem of the identity queue because what Morrison wants to say, and I think she borrows a here particularly from the famous discussion of the master slave dialectic in Hegel's phenomenology of mine. What Morrison wants to say is that it's not, is that identity isn't so much a question of what something is, but rather a question of what it is not. She says it's not that we should be so much preoccupied with what it is to be black, but rather as we think about the way in which, uh, being black is inscribed within the white tradition.

Speaker 1:          16:36          As we think about that, we need to think about what white is not at about. In other words, as she says repeatedly about black as absence, as negation, as negativity. And that we, and we have to understand the absolute, and this is where, this is where she drives her argument from the master slave dialectic, uh, the absolute necessity in the construction of white identity for there to be as an absence, as a lack a over against white identity, the existence of the African American. And more particularly for the better part of the American cultural tradition of the slave. Uh, let me quote then, uh, from her essay on page 1795, the left hand column where she says, construction of black, this is third of the way down construction of blackness and enslavement could be found not only the, not in that construction of blackness and enslavement could be found not only the, not free, but also the projection of the not me.

Speaker 1:          17:55          The result was a playground for the imagination. What rose up out of collective needs to la internal fears and rationalize external exploitation was an African Islam, a fabricated brew of darkness, otherness, alarm and desire that is uniquely American. And then she points out that although her subject is the American tradition, there also exist to European Africanism with its counterpart in its own colonial literature. Um, to reinforce this, she takes a remarkable example, which must've reminded you those, those of you who know Faulkner of Thomas Satanic at least reminded, reminded you in some ways of Thomas Sut pen of this character Dunbar, uh, who actually rose up not so much out of the swamp. Has Out of the Scottish enlightenment and came to the United States. And according to Bernard Bailyn, the historian from whom she takes this information, um, uh, who became a transformed character. Um, I won't quote to the long passage from Baylands tax too, which makes what, uh, Morrison wants to take from it clear, but rather from what Morrison summarizes of it.

Speaker 1:          19:10          Uh, on page 1796, the top of the right hand column I take says Morrison William Dunbar to be a succinct portrait of the process by which the American as new white and male was constituted. It is a formation that has several attractive consequences, all of which are referred to in Balan summation of Dunbar's character and located in how Dunbar fields within himself a power, a sense of freedom he had not known before. This is uncannily parallel, by the way, to the rational, the rationalization for slaves in Greek culture. The way the Greeks always said that the reason they had slaves with so they could be free, in other words, uh, so that the home or ruling population could, was liberated. Uh, in the case of the Greeks from a performing the daily necessities of, uh, that our life sustaining and keep us going. Uh, in other words, to be free, uh, according to the citizen of the Greek Polis is to be free from work.

Speaker 1:          20:17          Now, in a certain way, this is still a rationalization that Toni Morrison sees in, uh, the American slave owning tradition. But it's not so much in the case of this Dunbar of freedom from work. It's, it's the case of a more broad and insidious idea of freedom, freedom from responsibility, freedom from the need, uh, to acknowledge otherness as human freedom and other words from the sorts of confront constraint imposed by all world civility in Scotland and in London, uh, freedom on this frontier, in this wilderness, in this swamp, simply to be whatever one wants to be. And that freedom is a achieved on the backs of the black slave. It is, uh, in some ways, similar, as I say, to the rationalization, rationalization for first slavery in grace. But it is in a way more insidious, uh, and certainly more, uh, in the terms that Morrison's giving it to us and more dialectical that is to say it is that the question whether a person could become white without the availability of a black absence of a, of, of that, which a of that which can be oppressed like a kind of like, like it like a kind of a spring, uh, for the Jack in the box, which allows the White Jack in the box to leap out of the box, uh, because of that, which is suppressed down below all of that.

Speaker 1:          22:02          Uh, as part of Toni Morrison's concern at, at colors her, well, certainly controversial, uh, reading of huckleberry Finn, which nevertheless it seems to me, uh, has, uh, a quite profound interest. Now, uh, my own first instinct when when people single out huckleberry Finn as to wince away because, uh, it's an extraordinary novel. Um, the controversy about it, uh, in the school districts which made it, um, banished book, uh, had mainly to do with the n word, uh, to which we'll return the question who has the right to use the n word, which is not an easy question to answer as we'll see. Um, but that controversy while it had a, an authentic basis, uh, seeing was nevertheless, certainly in literary terms and in terms of the imagination, uh, perhaps, um, perhaps rather limited. Uh, Morrison gives rise to another equally and intensely critical way of thinking about huckleberry Finn.

Speaker 1:          23:09          She argues that to liberate gym, which of course is the tremendous failure at the end of the novel, a failure of imagination on the part of Tom Sawyer, a failure of a will or independence of mind on the part of huck himself that the failure to liberate gym, which would have been the easiest thing in the world. All they had to do was point, was point out. The right fork in the river is a, is an absolute necessity for the ongoing self definition of whiteness as it's available both to hop to Tom and to huck. And after all, by implication to mark Twain himself, he couldn't figure out how to end the novel. He wrote it, uh, it lay on his desk for a long time because he just couldn't figure out what to do with it. And he finally comes up with this as we all agree, a polling ending.

Speaker 1:          24:08          Toni Morrison says it's the only of ending available. It's the only ending available because in ways that the, uh, as she, as she sees it sentimentality of the novel, the sentimentality of the relationship between hock and, uh, uh, Jim, which is so strong that it caused another critic named Leslie Fiedler to talk about, uh, uh, um, homoerotic relation between them. The, the, the title of Fiedler's famous essay has come up on Duran huck honey. Uh, you know, with all w w w with all that in the background, uh, Toni Morrison says, the basic structure of consciousness in Twain's novel is obscured a basic structure, which makes it absolutely imperative that Jim not be free. If Jim has freed, then there is no other over against twitch. Whiteness can define itself. That's the way in which she makes use of the general argument about the traditions of American literature and culture, uh, in applying it to huckleberry Finn.

Speaker 1:          25:17          All right, let's go back to, uh, skip gates. Oh, sorry. Henry Louis Gates. Sorry. Wait. And another person who was at Yale and whom I knew very well. I actually had little bit to do with the origin of the notion of the signifying monkey. Uh, I'll come back to that later. Barbara Johnson also now at Harvard. Um, and I, uh, had a lot of conversations with skip at that period, uh, about this. And so it's not that I feel proprietary, it skips idea. Um, but I, you know, I was in on that. Um, and so, uh, and, and so, um, I, it's not just name dropping. I get to, I get to call him by what his friends caught. So, so in any case it is, however, I'll try to remember to say Henry Louis Gates. Um, and, uh, in any case to return to him. Um, I want to talk a little bit about simply in the before moving on to this, to this crucial central issue.

Speaker 1:          26:15          I want to talk a little bit, uh, simply about his understanding and the other staff, the understanding of other African American tradition, a critics, both of the critical tradition and of the literary tradition. First of all, the grasp of the critical tradition as basically a two step or two part progression is something that he shares with Elaine Showalter from last time. You remember, Joe Walters says that the important movement of, um, of feminists interventions in literary criticism begins with the moment that she calls feminists. That is to say the moment of Kate Millet, uh, and other authors who talk about the degradation, uh, and unfair treatment of women in male books. And then what Showalter perverse and suppose as to have super, to have to have, uh, uh, uh, uh, supervened, uh, and to have become more important gyno critical, uh, criticism, which as women's appropriation of literary traditions for themselves, uh, the, uh, the archival work that makes the Canon of women's literature, not just, uh, leaping from great name to great name, but an actual unfolding and continuous development from decade to decade as show Walter puts it.

Speaker 1:          27:37          Um, now gates on page 1896, uh, the right hand margin sees it in much the same way, uh, for the development of African American. Because you can do two things. Basically says gates. He doesn't put them chronologically, but you could see, you could, you could map onto what he's saying here, the same chronological sequence. He says what I mean by citing these to overwork terms he's talking about the other in particular, uh, is precisely this. How blacks are figures in literature. That is to say how they're represented in literature demeaningly even perhaps terrifically, how blacks are figured in literature and also how blacks figure as it were, literature of their own making. You can see, in other words, the same movement and his thinking about these issues now as show, alter argued the question or the literary tradition is more complicated. It has more steps. The, in other words, the powers of self expression available to women from the beginning of their, uh, creative expression, um, pass through more than just two stages.

Speaker 1:          28:49          And the same thing is true of African American literature. Now I think that, uh, Gates simply takes for granted as an implicit premise. Uh, the work that was done the year before he published, uh, this essay in critical inquiry, uh, by another colleague of ours here at Yale who died tragically not too long thereafter named Michael Cook, who in 1984 wrote a book called African American Literature in the 20th century. The achievement of intimacy and cook argued in his book that the history of Afro African American literature passes essentially through four stages. It begins with what Cook Calls Self veiling, uh, the period in other words in which people attempting for the first time, uh, uh, two, right. And of course, gates talks about the way in which, uh, writing is really writing oneself into the human community. Uh, for black people, the people who first attempted to write used white models, Phillis Wheatley, the poet whom gates talks about a remarkable poet.

Speaker 1:          30:00          And a very interesting one, nevertheless wrote, uh, in the manner of Alexander Pope. So much so that a great deal of her work is almost impossible, which is of course, as you know, point of praise, almost impossible to distinguish from that of Alice Alexander Pope. So she is an instance of the first phase, uh, which, which cook calls self veiling. Second Phase, which cook calls. Solitude involves continuing to use white models, a white pro style, uh, uh, way of, uh, of narrating, um, which is obviously derived from, uh, white teachers and white models, but which nevertheless involves as its central theme self-definition here. Uh, you might want to think of Douglas, uh, and of slave narratives in general where the emphasis is, where the emphasis is on being taught by white people, but nevertheless, the tension which never w which exists, uh, and which founds, uh, and governs the possibility of self liberation and self freedom.

Speaker 1:          31:09          In other words, uh, the slave narrative, uh, as an ongoing form, uh, partakes of, uh, this second phase in the development of African American literature is cook understands it. Thirdly, there's what cook calls kinship, uh, a literature in which African Americans reach out to each other, identify themselves as a community and not as individuals struggling to be free, but rather as a community. And Cook identifies this phase with the experimentation with dialect, uh, and uh, the A and a way of, of, of, of, of narrating and poets [inaudible], uh, which is which, which, which involves a self conscious, uh, uh, uh, insistence on verbal and linguistic difference. You can think of many of the poems, for example, of Langston Hughes in this regard and have a great deal else that goes on in the Harlem Renaissance. So that's the third phase kinship. And then the last phase, and what I'm going to want to say is that gates doesn't think we've reached this.

Speaker 1:          32:16          Uh, in other words, the point of disagreement between Cook and Gates is precisely about this. The last phase which cook calls intimacy is the freedom to expropriate any and all models, not in other words, to insist necessarily on one's own, uh, uh, on, on one's own creative paradigms, uh, as a racial tradition, uh, to expropriate anything that comes ready to hand Ellison's invisible man, for example, as a masterpiece of high modernism. Uh, it, it, it takes freely, in other words, from whatever traditions si come, come to hand, uh, and are most readily available for the kind of work that Ellison wants to do. A cook identifies this perhaps rather optimistically with what he calls intimacy. In other words, a merger of finally achieved merger of traditions such that, and this is plainly the ideal of Virginia Wolfe as well, such then one such that one no longer has to write as a spokesperson.

Speaker 1:          33:23          One no longer needs to be concerned, uh, for Thema [inaudible]. Uh, the kinds of identity that out of which one writing one's writing has arisen. One can write just anything one wants to, uh, in other words, a, the Utopian vision of no matter who I am, uh, having access to absolutely any forms, uh, and themes, uh, I care to work with. That is the vision of Michael Cook, which gates, um, I think unfortunately rightly feels that we haven't quite arrived at. And that's why, um, I deliberately use the word expropriate in talking about Cook's fourth phase. If I use models other than models made available by my own tradition, I'm not just kind of pulling them out of the air. I'm using them with a calculated purpose. I always have something in mind and choosing the model that I choose. Uh, we're, we're not, you know, we're, we're not really quite at intimacy because self definition is still at issue.

Speaker 1:          34:35          You can talk about the high modernism of the invisible man, all you like. But think of what the invisible man is a bout. The invisible man is still about what it means to be black. You know, what is it? I said, what is passing? Uh, what does it, what does it mean? In other words, uh, to have, um, this racial identity so that, yeah, traditions, uh, US manners styles have been, uh, have been expropriated, but at the same time, the business of writing avid as an African American continues and it is as much after all a question of self definition, uh, as it has been hither too. So that as, as Gates sees it, uh, is, is, continues to be the issue. We use other models. We need to make them our own. Otherwise we're just colonized by them. And after all, we're back in phase one.

Speaker 1:          35:37          Right? We're back in self veiling because after all, Phillis Wheatley used other models. Phyllis, Phyllis Wheatley actually aspire to the idea that she was just deport. She could write about anything. She wanted to write about the tears of Nivea and the painting by Richard Wilson, whatever it might be. She could write about it. Uh, because, um, she was just a poet. That was her great aspiration was to be, was to be received, not as, uh, you know, that amazing thing. Uh, a young black slave woman who could write, she wasn't interested in that. She wanted to be a poet. And so in a certain sense, you can see the problem if intimacy as achieved in the fourth pays fourth phase, well then that's finally just the realization of what Phyllis Wheatley wanted in the first phase. And, uh, we have to admit, uh, for all of the complicated reasons that these critics go into, that this is not a moment which can be said yet to have been achieved.

Speaker 1:          36:44          Okay. Now this brings us to gates is key concept. What does it mean and what is the advantage of x two to expropriate, uh, uh, other people's traditions? Eh, more particularly, uh, the white tradition. And here, uh, gates is after all thinking primarily about criticism. How can we do theory and criticism in the White Man's language? How can we appropriate expropriate for ourselves? The white man's language and the necessity of bending language to one's own purposes is what is emphasized in the remarkable epigraph on page 1891 that gates takes from [inaudible]. Uh, this is, it seems to me as central a passage in Bakhtin by the way, as anything that we studied when we were actually reading Bactine. And I'd like you to make note of it, uh, because I think it really can eliminate a great deal, uh, that's going on in Bactine that we didn't, uh, perhaps fully articulate at the time.

Speaker 1:          37:56          This is what buck teen says, language for the individual consciousness lies on the borderline between oneself and the other. The word in language is half someone else's to become one's own only when it becomes one's own. Only when the speaker populates it with his own intention, his own accent. And you can, you can hear gates wanting to emphasize that word, accent, his own accent when he appropriates the word, adapting it to his own semantic and expressive intention. Prior to this moment of appropriation, the word does not exist in a neutral and impersonal language. It is not after all out of a dictionary that the speaker gets his words. You know how true, how true it is. Not after all out of a dictionary that the speaker gets his words, but rather it exists in other people's mouths, in other people's contexts, serving other people's intentions.

Speaker 1:          39:03          It is from there that one must take the word and make it one's own. Now actually, during the course of his essay, uh, uh, uh, gates echoes the sentiment of Bactine by quoting dairy. Dot. At the very top of the right hand column on page 1901 where he says, uh, we must master as Derrida wrote, how to speak the other's language without renouncing our own. Now how do you do this? What does, how do you set about taking the language you are given? And this isn't of course, just a question of the difference between the races. It's a question of all of us in relation to each other. As black teen, uh, says in what you have already read, most of the time we're speaking other people's languages, um, are, it is rare indeed that we can say, uh, feeling very much like creative writers when we do so that we've somehow wrenched other people's language out of its conventional usages.

Speaker 1:          40:10          And made it our own, slightly rewritten it so that it is truly our own. So, uh, more broadly speaking, this is the challenge that faces, uh, a theoretical tradition or a theoretical enterprise I should say. That doesn't want to be just derivative, uh, from what other folks have already said. The word, the concept that gates brings to bear on this because after all he recognizes as does show Walter to that the notion of the sign is probably the cornerstone of white male literary theory. They are agonizes that in order to perform this x procreative act, he's got to do something with the notion of the sign. And so he talks about the way in which one can signify on something. He introduces it very quietly, uh, on page 1900, uh, the right hand column just seemingly in passing since we're top of near the top of the right hand column.

Speaker 1:          41:17          Since writing according to Hume, was the ultimate sign of difference between animal and human. These writers implicitly we're signifying upon the figure of the chain itself. Notice the accent. You don't necessarily pronounce the GE, they were signifying on the chain. And of course the great chain of being, which is hierarchical is very different from the vertical chain of the chain gang, isn't it? It's very difficult. It's very different from the chain that holds slaves together. That's part of what it means to signify on something. The signifier, at least allegedly, the signifier in the white male, uh, theoretical tradition is just a kind of placeholder in a play of linguistic differences. The question of the underlying sociological and cultural basis of this play and or the way in which this play take shape isn't taken into account again, allegedly because well, you know, in ways that you can probably grasp from what we've said all along, this is slightly to oversimplify, but this is the position taken up.

Speaker 1:          42:32          Uh, and in any case, you therefore need to take the signifier and signify on it. Well, what is it to signify on something? This is an expression that gates takes from the trickster tradition, the tradition of African storytelling in which the weaker is also the smarter and the monkey or a non-key the spiders. Some of you may remember the songs of Rafi from your childhood. About a non-key, the spider and which the monkey or the spider tricks, the big bad guys, the elephant, the lion, all the bad guys get tricked because they're stupider. And the Little Guy, uh, is always able to signify on them, to trick them, to lie to them without their realizing what's going on. And this way of talking about signifying is very much in the tradition of African American folklore and is, and, and, and his first comes to public consciousness, uh, in a song by the Scott Singer, Oscar Brown, Jr written by Oscar Brown, Jr called the signifying monkey.

Speaker 1:          43:47          If I could sing, I would sing it to you. Uh, fortunately I can't sing. Uh, but you can, it, it, it, it became extremely popular and was picked up by various instrumental jazz groups, uh, and was, and was a staple in the jazz tradition of the fifties and sixties. Uh, in any case, uh, Oscar Brown jr his notion of the signifying monkey, uh, is where gates takes his essays title from a and which is where, uh, also, um, uh, he gets this idea of, uh, taking somebody else's discourse out of its context, uh, and insisting on bending it into an African American context. In other words, a context which is one's own and not just the context one is given. Now, uh, the other example of signifying on, uh, that gates gives as the culminating example of, uh, of, of, uh, the color purple, uh, and the conversation about getting the men, getting the man out of your eye, uh, which, uh, is a way of taking back a problem that exists even within the African American tradition as gates has been pointing out Wheatley and later Rebecca Cox, uh, or rather Rebecca Jackson, um, take their models, uh, of education and self development from white male figures who have taught them how to read.

Speaker 1:          45:24          And in each case, of course, this is pernicious because the existence of the white male figure is, um, is, uh, very much still in the, in your eye. You got to get the man out of your eye, at least according to the dialogue gates quotes from the color purple. Well, the interesting thing there is that in a way the issue of feminist criticism comes back to haunt gates. His argument, because plainly shook doesn't just mean the white man when she says the man. A big issue in the color purple of course, is the emergence of a possible feminism, uh, from, uh, social constructions that aren't just defined by race. So that when Gates says, you know, the man, which all of us recognize, uh, as shorthand for the white man, uh, can be signified on by an African American tradition making it a term of opprobrium, right?

Speaker 1:          46:25          Get the man out of your eye. At the same time, it can be signified on by the feminist tradition, making it a term of opprobrium, not in a completely different way, but in an overlapping and partially different way. Uh, and gates in emphasizing the one as opposed to the other is perhaps tilting again, uh, toward a certain imbalance. Now finally, I want to take up, uh, the example, uh, the most controversial example in his essay one, uh, which is a source of outrage for most readers. Uh, at the bottom of page 1893 in the left hand column, he's been talking about the new, he's been talking about the new agrarian moment, uh, out of which there emerged a number of figures associated with the new criticism, uh, including Robert Penn Warren, who very early on repudiated the new Agrarians, uh, and became, um, uh, a politically progressive figure in his own writing.

Speaker 1:          47:29          You've, many of you have probably read all the king's men, uh, certainly in his poetry as well, but who was a, an Avatar, a central figure in the, in the development of the thinking of the new criticism, which we have briefly studied. Now, Warren wrote a poem called Pondi Woods, which, uh, is quoted completely out of context by Sterling Brown, uh, uh, and unfairly out of context, uh, in the passage, which I'm not going to read because I don't think I have the right to speak the n word. Uh, and so, uh, I'll just have you look at it. Um, but then, and I'll come back to that in a minute. Um, and then, uh, uh, the sterling Brown's response, uh, is also recorded there, uh, for you. Well, the problem is this for this from the standpoint of anybody who's actually read the poem, but remember in, in some ways it's a problem raised by a new critical perspective.

Speaker 1:          48:29          And I'll show, and I'll explain what I mean in a minute. That expression is spoken by a buzzard or vulture from, I forget whether it's Tennessee or Kentucky. They episode takes place in northern Louisiana, uh, and the buzzard is sitting expectedly on a tree waiting for a fugitive slave who has been chased into the swamp by his white pursuers to die. And the vulture is sitting there. Well, if it could, it would be rubbing his hands with glee waiting for this to take place. And it's the vulture that says it and the poem, nothing to do. In other words, as we say with the author of the poem, Warren, who is writing a completely sympathetic evocation of what it's like to be a fugitive slave in this state of terrible, uh, and overwhelmed panic. And so it seems completely unfair and it is, I think, unfair as sterling brown took it up and as gates then perpetuates the idea in his own reference.

Speaker 1:          49:43          The one thing I would add, however, is that it's a new critical idea that we invoke to say that it's unfair. It's the new criticism of which robbery in which Robert War. Penn Warren was a participant that tells us we shouldn't confuse speakers in poems with authors. In other words, and author, as someone according to Lou criticism, who's dispassionate and who introduces dramatic voices, even in lyric poems, voices with which we are merely confusing ourselves. Uh, if we associate them, uh, with, uh, with an author. Now this is, uh, something that we just for granted when we read poems, all poems for us are to some degree dramatic monologues on the model of Browning and others, uh, in the 19th century. We read them that way now. But it is, as I say, a new critical idea. And it comes back to the question, who has the right to use the n word?

Speaker 1:          50:49          It's a frequently, it's a frequent sort of term used on the street as you know, and African American culture used almost with a certain fondness, uh, as a form of mutual greeting. But at the same time, it is a term that continues rigorously to be rejected as available to anyone other than someone who belongs within this community. And so that issue lingers. It's an issue that Warren, because of course he wrote long before, uh, this sort of controversy began to arise around the word. Uh, the controversy really boiled over precisely at the time of the banning of huckleberry Finn from public schools. Uh, uh, and so, uh, there's a kind of innocence perhaps, uh, in Warren's use of the word. But nevertheless, uh, in the critical tradition, it's a question who has the right to use it? And this gives rise perhaps to the suggestion of a certain insularity in the thinking of the new criticism.

Speaker 1:          51:52          Take the fee, let let use any model you like. The model of the Floridian unconscious, the model of the political unconscious. In other words, we've been reading a lot in this course about are never quite saying what we mean to say of our never quite being fully in control of our discourse because it bubbles up from the unconscious right now, if you take a model like this, even though it's a nasty buzzard from Kentucky that's saying what gates quotes. Nevertheless, there is an author and it has bubbled up from the unconscious of that. Well, what are you going to do with that? There's a kind of impasse there. We feel distinctly and vividly and even bitterly because I love Warren. I love Ponti Woods and I also am something of a new critic, so we feel a bitterness about the expropriation, the signifying on what Warren says in this fashion, but at the same time we have entertained these ideas of a subliminal author, not an authority, but an author welling up from below.

Speaker 1:          53:03          And if that's the case, if that's the case, then we have to worry a little bit about how an expression like that got into the poem afterwards, after all. Um, and so that to, I call it a lingering problem because it strikes me as one of those moments when probably would have been better if gates, uh, hadn't followed sterling Brown. Uh, one of those moments when there is a kind of, uh, overkill in the zeal of argumentation, uh, but which at the same time, we can't absolutely dismiss out of hand for the variety of reasons that I've mentioned. Okay. I'll leave it like at there, and we'll return to many of these issues in a new vocabulary and in new forms. When we read the examples of postcolonial criticism on Thursday that you've been assigned.
