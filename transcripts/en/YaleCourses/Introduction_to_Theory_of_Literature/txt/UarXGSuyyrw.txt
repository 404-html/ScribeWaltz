Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, postcolonial studies is a really, by far the most varied and eclectic of the identity fields that were passing in review, uh, in this, in this portion of the, uh, of the course. Uh, uh, eclectic really I've necessity of course, because of the immense of the immense variety of the materials are covered, but also because of a swirling issues and controversies within postcolonial studies or Poco as it's affectionately known, uh, which, um, but which kind of pose a number of questions, um, from the side that, uh, that, that, that keep things lively to say the least. We, um, are taking up only one strand, a developmental strand in postcolonial studies today, uh, uh, kind of a progression from the work of sight to the work of Baba, which is relatively easily map simply in terms simply in terms of the, uh, of the intellectual agendas of each of them.

Speaker 1:          01:08          But there's a great deal else going on. And I, and I suppose I should, I should just mention in passing a certain topics that we won't be discussing, uh, at least, uh, except possibly in passing. And that however you might really be interested in considering if you do have an interest in this field. Um, the first, the first issue of course is who says post colonial. That is who says that we're necessarily out of colonialism. Just because the local viceroy packs up and goes home doesn't necessarily mean that things change all that significantly in the so called postcolonial setting. Uh, and it needs to be taken into account, seriously considered whether or not one isn't still in colonial or colonial studies. Uh, and that the moniker postcolonial postcolonial might therefore be inappropriately applied. There's also, there's also the question, uh, that arises in the study of the so called Third World, which is obviously in itself a controversial term.

Speaker 1:          02:19          You know, it arises as that which is not comprised as either of the great, uh, sort of trajectories of the superpowers during the Cold War. Uh, there is no cold cold war, at least allegedly no cold war any longer. And so the question of the status, nature and structure of the third world is obviously wide open. But the issue I mean to touch on in terms of postcolonial studies is whether in fact a crises, uh, and, uh, and concerns with respect to the third world are necessarily always, uh, to be understood in terms of coloniality that, you know, I mean is, is it just that, uh, certain parts of the globe have been colonized that constitutes them as they are, uh, and shapes their identity. So Aden and in a, in a very interesting way, takes this up in trying to figure out how it is that German orientalism so very closely resembles French orientalism.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Even though the Germans had no colonial interests in the Middle East. Uh, they are, uh, they, during the whole period, early 19th century in particular, when German orientalism is practically indistinguishable from the French, takes up the same concerns, has the same interest. How is it that the France are undoubtedly in some sense insides view, uh, determined by their colonial interests and the Germans who seems so much to reflect a French attitudes have no colonial interests, at least in the Middle East. Uh, and it's quite, you know, sort of quite honestly tries to come to terms with this. His answer is, well, German, uh, orientalism is simply derived in scholarly terms from French, uh, or anilism. It has the stamp of that thinking, uh, and reflects that thinking. And so there you are, he could have said on the other hand, however, that a certain mindset toward the third world, and this is, and this is the point I've been making about this particular issue, dictates a certain way of structuring one's thought about that world, irrespective of whether or not there are colonial interest involved.

Speaker 1:          04:46          And so that's, that's what I mean by raising the question, uh, is coloniality always at issue in cases of this kind. Finally, there's a kind of confusion, uh, in thinking about these things like confusion, which is w which is a distilled in the history of the British east India company, which is both nationalists and as it were globalizing, but a confusion, uh, which comes out more in more recent, uh, the more recent history of, um, of coloniality. And that is, well, what drives coloniality? Is it always nationalism or as seems increasingly the case in the modern world? Is it trans national, uh, interests of glue in globalization? Is it, in other words, is the relationship between the colonists and the colonized a relation of ace of some sort of metropolitan nation with respect to a provincial empire? Or is it a relation which is dictated and generated by the economic interests of globalization?

Speaker 1:          05:57          This is a complex subject, which generates a great deal of debate in the field, uh, that we take up today. Uh, but, um, but in a way, I mean, it's, it's, we, we can't just say, well, nationalism isn't important anymore. Now it's globalization because actually, um, nationalism seems to have reappeared, ah, in the Bush foreign policy even possibly to be continued in the Obama foreign policy. Uh, and so there's a complex relationship still between nationalism and globalization, uh, that, uh, needs to be considered and thought about. If these, uh, social relations are to be clearly understood. And finally there is within postcolonial studies, especially among those, uh, who, uh, represent, uh, the various are colonized interest of the world. There's the question to borrow an expression from Gaietry speeback, how should the subaltern speak? And it has to do, uh, most vividly with the very question which language should the, should the subaltern speak in Spi vacs?

Speaker 1:          07:10          Own question is, can the subaltern speak at all? Uh, and Saeed raises that question as you notice, uh, during the course of his analysis. Um, but the, but, but the related issue is, okay, suppose the subaltern can't speak, uh, I suppose, um, in Googie Wafi Django for example, can write a novel what not, what language should it be written in, in Googie, uh, campaigned, uh, in his more recent career, um, not to write in English and also to urge other, uh, African writers to write in a native languages, uh, and not in the language of the colonizer. Uh, and this is a, and this is a, uh, a frequently heard opinion, um, from within postcolonial studies, but debates worlds around it. Because of course, the means of circulation of literary, uh, influence, uh, is, uh, languages that, uh, draw upon, uh, international publishing possibilities, uh, and not languages, uh, that can only be grasped and published.

Speaker 1:          08:22          And disseminated locally. So there are two, you have a complicated issue, uh, but uh, or controversy on both sides of which there's much to say. But as I say for us today, it's simply a question or more simply a question because when you've got Homi Bhabha on the syllabus, there's no such thing as simplicity. So I should say, uh, it's a question of following the trajectory or development, uh, between specifically between, uh, side and Baba and then beginning to think about say aid. I thought we wouldn't think about it. And we'd think instead for a moment, at least about once again about Virginia Wolf and the second chapter of a room of one's own, uh, this young woman, Mary Beaten Mary seat and Mary Carmichael, whoever she is, it sitting in the British library. Uh, and she's thought that she'd spend the morning trying to figure out, um, what, uh, scholars thought about women.

Speaker 1:          09:23          You know, after all, you know, this, this is sort of where the subject is women and fiction. Um, I'm supposed to be addressing these undergraduates on this subject. What do I know about women? I had better go to the library and find out. So she expects to get, uh, you know, to just to find a couple of books and she'll be all set and instead she simply overwhelmed and she, and there's this avalanche of material and she submits, you know, maybe a dozen or two, uh, call slips, uh, and then sits back waiting for the material to appear. And of course, the point of it is that everything in the British library on the, what turns out to be the voluminous subject of women is written by Matt. All right. Everything and she begins to take note of the way these things are described in the, you know, sort of pre computer database.

Speaker 1:          10:18          Uh, that is to say, how do you classify the various things that men have to say about women. And this is the way it goes. Condition in Middle Ages of habits in the Fiji Islands of worshiped as goddesses by weaker in moral sense than idealism of greater conscientiousness of South Sea Islanders, age of puberty, among attractiveness of offered as sacrifice to small size of brain, of profounder, subconsciousness of less hair on the body of mental, moral and physical inferiority of love, of children of greater length, of life, of weaker muscles, of strength, of affections, of vanity, of higher education, of Shakespeare's opinion of Lord Birkin heads, opinion of dean ends, his opinion of library areas, opinion of Dr Johnson's opinion of Mr Oscar Browning's, opinion of and.dot dot. The list can continue. In other words, she sits there, she, she simply overwhelmed. And what she of course is telling us is that there's lots and lots and lots and lots of opinions on record about women.

Speaker 1:          11:46          All of them expressed by men. So now thinking about Edward Psyche, if Edwards had taken up Virginia Woolf's project, if Edward aid had undertaken to write a room of one's own, the title of it would have been female ism. Alright? Because that's precisely what he means by orientalism, the vast body of information. Some of it's scholarly, some of it just sort of sheerly doc's illogical. The vast body of information about people's called oriental by and large, especially in the 19th century tradition, uh, Osi eads main concern is the peoples of the Middle East. Uh, and he shows how it is that there's a, there's a certain reason why this is an appropriate term to use for that tradition of scholarship and philology in the 19th century. In any case, the vast body of material published about these people. And there are, and it's perfectly true that there, there's the, there are the infinitely long shelves of the library devoted to multivolume treatises on this topic. All of them written by us in the West us, you know about this other who is perpetually in our imaginary and constructed by us in the variety of ways. That side discusses a page 1811, uh, the right hand column.

Speaker 1:          13:24          I'm sorry. Ah, yes. The right hand column. He says toward the bottom of the column, orientalism is premised upon exteriority. That is on the fact that the orientalist poet or scholar makes the Orient Speak, describes the orient renders his mysteries playing for and to the West. Just as in Wolf Man's opinions about women getting themselves expressed in books. Make the subject of woman clear to the an audience of men. All right, so let me in bef before moving in with some more depth and precision into sides text. Uh, let me quickly explain what I mean by saying that's I aid and Baba constitute a kind of sequence. I'm thinking in particular of Elaine Show Walters distinction between feminists and Gyno. Critical criticism. You remember the distinction which is echoed by the way in gates, his essay, the distinction is first you get criticism in which the treatment of women in literature by men is the focus of attention.

Speaker 1:          14:43          And then subsequently you get criticism in wet. The women's tradition, the voice of women themselves is the focus. Uh, and uh, as Showalter believes the more fruitful terrain for criticism. So you can see that in that, that in that context, in way of making it, by way of making that distinction, you can see that site is decidedly phase one because of course, or anilism is about the treatment of the Middle Eastern other by the West. Uh, and so it is sort of, it can be slotted in to that same moment, but what's interest and then Homi Bhabha, uh, is obviously in a variety of ways, uh, takes up, uh, the subject position of the colonized of the subaltern. He doesn't leave out the subject position of the, uh, of the colonizer, uh, because he sees them as being radically interrelated. Uh, but he plainly is as interested in a variety of ways of talking about the traditions of the colonized as he is of talking about the way in which colonization takes place and expresses itself.

Speaker 1:          15:57          So in that sense, we can see aid and Baba as belonging to these two phases, uh, as mapped by show Walter. And as I say also in passing by gates. But actually, and I'm sorry for the confusion of this heading, actually, there's another way in which side and Baba can be understood as phase one and phase two. And that has much more to do with the tradition of literary theory, which in their ways both show Walter and gates have rejected insisting that one needs to commandeer white male literary theory for one's own purposes. I suppose it's a question how it does, how this issue doesn't come up inside eight and Baba, it could perhaps be answered by saying that precisely in the situation of colonialism, uh, the intellectuals, a third world colonized intellectuals, nevertheless, are educated, uh, in, uh, high octane male, uh, metropolitan institutions by which of course one means primarily Oxford and Cambridge.

Speaker 1:          17:13          Um, and so in a certain sense, uh, they come to identify, um, and this is not a, this is not actually a thing, apart from Baba has argument about, uh, about hybridity. They come to identify in some measure with the educational agenda of the colonizer and participate in it. Now that speculative, it may simply be that we have missed out on those moments when I'm [inaudible] and Baba to maybe talking about the way in which the white male traditional literary theory needs to be appropriated. But for the moment, what I want to point out is this side's are anilism works very much in the historical moment of what we call structure Elysium. That is to say it's primary concern is with the binary opposition, a mutual and interdependent binary opposition of central self and decentralized other, uh, including as we'll see in a minute, the way in which the construction of the otherness of the other is actually covertly.

Speaker 1:          18:28          Also at the same time, a means of constructing, defining d limited than delimiting, the nature of selfhood or in this case of being western. And so there's a fundamental by binarism insights point of view, which by the way has also been often been criticized and it's been criticized, uh, most often from the standpoint of Baba whom you can see. Because if only because he's constantly referring to dairy dies. Famous Essay, the double session of which is about Malheur, may, uh, about all. And, and also because, uh, he appropriates a great deal of the language and style of Derrida. You can see that Baba takes with respect to the binarism of structuralism, a deconstructive attitude. In other words, his sense of these relations breaks down into, at the very least a redoubling sense of what he calls double consciousness. So that one can't clearly identify colonizer and colonized as a binary opposition.

Speaker 1:          19:38          It's more complicated than that. And it's a series of issues that turns on a highly Derridean sense of what one might mean by difference. And so all I'm out of say is that the relations I eat, Baba is phase one, phase two in that regard as well. And by the way, this is a tendency that one can find in other forms of litter of theory having to do with identity. The relationship between the classical feminism that we have been discussing so far and the gender theory that we will be discussing on Tuesday is one, especially in the case of Julio Butler is once again, uh, a relation that could be understood as between structuralism and deconstruction. So, um, so, so there too, you have a not completely overlapping but from the standpoint of our concerns in literary theory, nevertheless rather interesting a way in which this succession [inaudible] Baba is phase one, phase two in two different ways, uh, that can be, uh, identified I think usefully.

Speaker 1:          20:51          All right, so that then about their relationship. So what, what about site? How do we, how do we get at, um, the issues that side wants to talk about, um, and understand the way in which he thinks they have integrity. Um, before I think I'd like actually to begin with a word or two about truth because side, uh, makes it clear that in a way, the demonization of orientalism that his project undertakes isn't really undertaken because orientalism is necessarily a pack of lies. He's, he, maybe he waffled a little bit about this, but it's not really ultimately the point for him whether or anilism lies or tells the truth. This is, this is the way he puts it on page 1802 in the right hand column, a third qualification, one ought never to assume that the structure of orientalism is nothing more than a structure of lies or myths, which were the truth about them to be told would simply blow away.

Speaker 1:          22:07          I myself believe that orientalism is more particularly valuable as a sign of European Atlantic power over the orient than it is as a verb Riddick discourse about the RN. Uh, nevertheless, what we must respect and try to grasp is the sheer knitted together strength of orientalist discourse. In other words, you know, I mean, so one of Napoleon's adjutants during Napoleon's campaign through Egypt wrote a 10 volume east wide leg reaped. Many of the texts whom to whom Cy aid mansions in passing in his, uh, in his introduction to orientalism are just as long. I mean you've got 50 volume, sort of a gigantic scholarly undertakings and you've got to admit, well, you know, if they're saying that much, there's gotta be something in it. That's true. Um, there is after all a great deal of knowledge, uh, of a certain kind, at least that has gone into thinking of this kind.

Speaker 1:          23:07          And so one can't just say, my point is that none of it's true. And so he'd, uh, is at pains to make a distinction therefore, between truth and value. It's not that, um, orientalist discourse is necessarily true or false. It is the case though that it is insidiously d valuing of its object of attention that there is an implicit Eurocentrism which side does go so far as to consider a form of racism in our animalism quiet, irrespective of any measure or degree of truth that what are after all the meticulous researches have a lot of these characters turn up. Uh, for example, on page 18, 12, uh, the lefthand column, he says, my analysis of the orientalist text therefore places emphasis. This is about a third of the way down, which is by no means invisible for such representative on the evidence, which is by no means invisible for such representations as representations not as natural descriptions of the Orient.

Speaker 1:          24:27          Now we might pause for amendment minute over that as a possible object of critique, uh, yet because at the end of his essay or at the end of the introduction as you have it, uh, you notice side saying, look, I don't take up here the question of how one might actually write correctly about, you know, about these people. He doesn't take up, for example, the question of what it might be like to be, um, uh, uh, sort of a representative of these minorities, uh, or colonized figures and to write about oneself. He doesn't really take up the question whether the bias of somebody else writing about me. You know, a man writing about a woman is worse than the bias of my own pride, preconceptions and prejudices about myself. He admits that he doesn't really have, and advanced theory that's a cure is one kind of representation as true or authentic and secure is.

Speaker 1:          25:29          And other kind of representation as biased, uh, and inauthentic. He says, another scholar will perhaps take this up. I leave it alone in my book and it is left alone. Uh, the problem being that the claim remains that that he, that he does, um, uh, anticipating, uh, many other people who have written on this subject, he does impugn orientalism as mere representation at is to say as not, uh, as the opposite because it is a representation the opposite of a natural evocation of an ethos or world. Um, so we just do want to put a little question mark in the margin then say there and say, well, fine, fine. Granted, this is all representation. Uh, where is the text? Where could the text be that would be natural? Is there, for example, any such thing as we've asked ourselves over the course of this semester as a natural sign, the sign being arbitrary, it does place us already pretty securely in the realm of representation.

Speaker 1:          26:42          All right? All of these questions then posed a buy sides, a sense of the relationship between truth and value in the history of orientalist scholarship. Now, where is he coming from? Uh, he's quite open about it. Uh, and um, and it's perhaps worth pausing over. And I over an idea common to the two scholar theorists who matter most to him. Michel Foucault and the Italian Marxist on Antonio Gramsci. Uh, first of all, uh, just uh, to pass and review, uh, his, the way in which he's indebted to ground g on page 1803, the lefthand column sites as culture of course is to be found operating within civil society where the influence of ideas of institutions and of other persons works not through domination, but by what Graham she calls consent. That was, it's not just a question of having forced down your throat certain ideas or concepts or laws for that matter, but a circulation of knowledge.

Speaker 1:          27:54          So called of feeling about things of ideology, which through consent establishes certain attitudes, uh, uh, of bias. And so this is what Graham, she, the distinction that grime she makes between the way in which one is imposed on by actual power and authority and the way in which one is imposed on by the circuit by the circulations of what we've been exposed to in the past, uh, as being called ideology seems so to continue in any society, not totalitarian says Sa Ead, certain cultural forms predominate over others just as certain ideas are more influential than others. The form of this cultural leadership is what Graham she has identified as hegemony and this is the ta and this is a term that you will frequently and counter particularly in Marxist criticism, but it is also a term very closely related to what for most western readers is more famous in the work of Michel Foucault, the term power or sometimes power slash knowledge.

Speaker 1:          29:12          As you will learn in the excerpt from Foodco that you'll be reading on Tuesday, Fuko light grumpshe sheet makes a distinction between power merely as that which is exercised by the police or by the legal arm of society or by the dictator or by the government. And power as the ways, the frequently insidious ways in which knowledge is circulated and made hedge. I'm on it. That is to say made authoritative and Fuko is, pat is fascinated by the structure of this circulation of knowledge that is in fact the essential subject matter of all of his late work, the way in which we are thinking that we are sort of free contemplative agents in the world. In fact, browbeaten by structures of opinion circulating around us that low us into feeling that we're in the presence of the truth. Whereas of course we're only in the presence of one form or another of motivated bias.

Speaker 1:          30:28          Uh, so both grumpshe and Fuko make the distinction between absolute power. And as Graham, she calls it hegemony. And as Fuko calls it power knowledge, Saeed is talking here about power knowledge. He's not talking about the imposition of law through force or any other means on a colonized world. He's talking about the way in which opinions construct that world and simultaneously reinforce the authority of those who generate the opinions he does. However, and I think it's important to point this relatively subtle distinction. Oh, he does, however, disagree. Um, from Fuko in one respect. On page 18, 13, he goes back to what we already know about food co, which is who co's interested interest in the author function as opposed to the author authors generally speaking, Fuko wants to say, or not authorities, uh, but simply but simply vessels of forms of opinion, certain authors who come very close to being an authority we call founders of discursivity, but even in their cases, it's the nature of the discourse.

Speaker 1:          31:49          Uh, and not their existence as authors, which is important. Side wants to say, I take authors a little bit more seriously than that and he does on page 1813 in the right hand column where he says food Coby leaves that in general, the individual texts or author counts for very little empirically. That is to say through my experience empirically in the case of orientalism and perhaps nowhere else I find this not to be. So, in other words, the authors, the central philologists and, and social historians and explorers and demographers who have written so extensively on this part of the world are authorities. They are the oracles from which generalized, uh, and ultimately commonplace opinions disseminate, uh, as power knowledge. And it's not a question, therefore a kind of silent drumbeat of opinion expressing itself over and over again, which is more what interests Fuko. So, uh, so site as I say, uh, distinguishes himself, uh, subtly, uh, from Foodco in that regard.

Speaker 1:          33:05          Well, nevertheless, uh, confessing openly, uh, the influence both of food co and grumpshe fee on his way of approaching his material. So the circulation a of power, uh, as, as a circulation of power. I should say the effect of orientalism is something that ultimately concerns Saeed. Well, he says the somewhat rhetorically because he obviously does concern if that it has an effect on the peoples in question. But what ultimately concerns side is the effect of orientalism on the Euro centric mind. Indeed, the degree to which it even can be said to construct the euro centric mind. Page 1806, the right hand column.

Speaker 1:          33:57          My real argument is that orientalism is and does not simply represent a considerable dimension of modern political intellectual culture. And as such, has less to do with the orient than it does with our world. Now here you can see the degree to which side is saying something very similar to what Tony Morrison said in her essay. The existence of black as absence needs to be understood. For example, if we're studying the history of American literature as the means of constructing whiteness, of the, of that which liberates whiteness from the forms of constraints under which it's been chafing at the beat at the bit. And Morrison of course, develops this argument beautifully and she, uh, quite clearly takes it from the Fourth Chapter of Hegel's phenomenology of mind, uh, as a way of understanding the master slave dialectic. In other words, in Hagle, uh, it's clear, uh, as Hagle, uh, develops the idea that master and slave are absolutely necessary to each other in a structure of mutuality.

Speaker 1:          35:15          The master isn't, the master can't define himself as free or a superior without the existence of the slave. The trickiness that the slave learns. Being in this position of subordination involving the development of all sorts of complicated skills means ultimately that the slave, uh, becomes as it were, that which drives the master technologically and ultimately controls the master, uh, in a kind of, uh, a fable of class reversal, uh, which is, uh, which continues to reverse itself again and again and again on various grounds. Um, this is, uh, the fable, uh, the or w which at the same time is a philosophy of class relations that we find that that structure's Morrison's argument, uh, and which I think also, uh, also structures sides. And I want to make the transition to Baba, um, because obviously this is a form of binarism, uh, the, the, uh, the two signifiers in relation to each other need each other in the way that we described when we were discussing.

Speaker 1:          36:29          So Sir and structuralism, I said, I can't simply say that our red light has positive value. You remember the whole argument? I have to see, uh, the red, the red light in the context of the semiotics system to which it belongs. I have to see it as being different from or opposed to something else in order to grasp it. I cannot know it positively. In other words, I can only know it negatively. This basic concept of structuralism in the, so Syria and tradition is what creates is what shapes binary arguments of the kind that one finds in [inaudible]. We know ourselves negatively as the not other is. The bet is, is, is the basic principle, the theoretical principle, which under which underlies, uh, obviously, uh, aspect of the argument which are also as a side says empirical. I mean, yeah, I can say it's a structuralist idea, but I really believe it because I've seen it in operation.

Speaker 1:          37:35          It's not just structure, it was him. In other words, it shares, however, with structuralism, uh, a, a theoretical predisposition and Baba, if you look at page 18, 79 openly criticizes the premise of binarism of this kind, not just anybody binarism but he actually does go directly back to Hagle. In other words, he identifies the source of thinking of this kind bottom of 1879 right hand column when he says it is this ambivalence that makes the boundaries of colonial positionality, the division of self, other the question of colonial power, the differentiation of colonizer, colonized, different from both the Hungarian master slave dialectic or, and he goes on to mention other things, but I just want to focus on this as a moment in which Baba is, uh, is, is, is, is distinguishing himself as clearly as he can from the project of Saeed. Alright, now this, the passage I just read begins with the word ambivalence.

Speaker 1:          38:49          What does Baba mean by ambivalence? Let's try to start there and see if we can work our way into. Bob has complex thinking on these matters. Uh, first by way of the notion of ambivalence. Well, and I'm going to put this in terms of an historical example. Uh, I, because I hope that will make it a little clearer. There is the ambivalence of the colonizer toward the colonized. In other words, it's not just one mindset that drives colonization. In the historical experience of England in the east, in the east India company, there are two distinct phases, phases which actually repeat themselves recurrently even throughout the 20th century. The first in the 18th century is the period of the government of the east India Company by Warren Hastings, who in a certain sense was interested in what we call going native and also encouraged, uh, all of his provincial administrators to do likewise Hastings and other words, insight in terms knew a great deal about the or analyzed other.

Speaker 1:          40:07          He knew all the local languages and dialects. He knew all the customs he knew, he really knew everything there was to know. Uh, and in a certain sense was a person who did go native while at the same time, uh, wielding an iron with an iron grip of authority, power over the colonized other, his ambivalence, it himself then embodies a certain ambivalence in not giving an edge as to the actual control of authority, while at the same time seeming to become one with the other. But then there's the historical ambivalence, which expresses itself in a completely different attitude and attitude, which surfaced in the east India company. Early in the 19th century, uh, under the, uh, under the supervisor ship of Charles Grant. Now, Charles Grant, uh, was, uh, as a d there had been a tremendous revival of fundamentalist religion, mainly methodism in England. Uh, and this and this evangelical enthusiasm spread itself into the interest of the empire.

Speaker 1:          41:19          And so Charles Grant and others like him, no had no longer had any interest at all and going native, uh, but on the other, but, but on the contrary, insisted that a standard of Englishness and in the staff, the standard of the English Bible, the coming of the English book that Bhabha talks about at the beginning of his essay be firmly implanted, and that the imposition of Englishness on the colonized other be the agenda of colonization. The famous historian, Thomas Babington, Macaulay, uh, codified this attitude, uh, in Wa in a famous document he wrote, and it'd be assumed to be infamous document called the minute on education, uh, which insisted that the education of the Indian peoples, uh, in the, uh, under the regime of the east India company B be conducted, can strictly according to English models that missionaries no longer try to adapt their ideas to local customs, uh, and folkways, but that everything be strictly anglicised.

Speaker 1:          42:31          So this is a completely, completely different attitude toward colonization and it can be understood as a sort of historical ambivalence. Um, I'd actually, I, I'd actually like to pause over an example of what you might call the Warren Hastings moment. Um, uh, vicious example, although an absolutely fascinating one in the disturbing masterpiece by John Ford called the searchers. I hope some of you at least know that film. Uh, the John Wayne Character, uh, is a, uh, kind of, um, so lone stranger anticipate, which is of course not infrequent in the western, um, who, uh, shows up at the house of some relatives. And here's that w that a daughter has been abducted by the native Americans, by the Indians. Now, the thing about John Wayne is that he's a vicious in this film, is that he's a vicious racist. That he absolutely hates the Indians, but he is not a vicious racist from the standpoint of ignorance.

Speaker 1:          43:41          He is in fact a person who is, has an himself in a certain sense, gone native. He knows all the Indian languages and dialects. He knows all their customs. He has, uh, he has throughout a lifetime, made a careful study of the people he hates. And this is a, and this is a volatile mixture to be exposed to in a film because we're a much more comfortable with the idea that hatred arises out of ignorance. All right? And the, and, and what is so deeply disturbing about, about John Ford's, the searchers as that is, it is a portrait of absolutely vicious racism. Uh, which is, which again, you know, so he'd says, hey, it's not necessarily truth, but we do have to acknowledge, you know, a certain local, thick description we have. We have, we have to acknowledge that there's a, that there's quite a bit of information at this person's disposal.

Speaker 1:          44:42          Um, and all of that is born out in the, uh, characterization of John Wayne in this film or in Hastings was a lot like that. Warren Hastings knew everything about people whom he ultimately didn't really respect and whom he insisted on a ruling with the Iron Fist of authority. Uh, and that's the kind of thing that's the Baba is thinking about when he thinks about the ambivalence of the colonizer, the relationship between knowledge and value as it's already been enunciated inside, but also the fact that there's more than one mindset for the colonizer. There's the local knowledge mindset and there's, and there is the sort of raising the absolute unequivocal standard of the colonizing, uh, uh, uh, of, of the colonizer, uh, that these are two different attitudes, each of which dictate different strategies, particularly strategies of education. So that's ambivalence, uh, the ambivalence of the colonizer. Then there's the ambivalence of the colonized.

Speaker 1:          45:53          Um, and that too has to be, uh, understood as a complex relation to cooptation. The anecdote with w with which Baba begins, I think is fascinating, uh, and well worth attending to. You have, um, not a colonizer, but someone thoroughly co-opted, uh, an evangelical, a converted Christian, uh, of Indian descent. Um, who is, who represents in a way that the people he finds sitting under the tree root trees, reading the Bible considered to be completely authentic because he believes, uh, and is perfectly happy to believe that the Bible and for that matter and for that matter of Christianity itself is an English gift. But he's met with the response of people who resist that, who say, you know, this is very interesting stuff. You know, we wish we could have some local authority for it. Our understanding as we got this, this book, this book directly from God, that's our understanding and we have our own attitude toward it.

Speaker 1:          47:04          Sure they will get baptized one of these days. But in the meantime, we got to go home and take care of the harvest. So, you know, W we, we'll get around to that. Don't worry about it. And by the way, if we get baptized, we certainly can't take the Eucharist, uh, because you know, that's, that's eating meat. We don't eat meat. You know, we are who we are. And so that, and, and you can see that these cunningly in situ insinuated provisos, uh, to the attitude that, um, that the, the missionary wants to inculcate in them in a very real way completely undermines his purpose. They don't think of it as the English Bible. They won't accept it as the English Bible. They will only accept it as an authority that's mediated by their own values, which transforms the document. I mean, you can see it again as this is 18, 13, as Bob points out, this was precisely at the moment when we're moving, when the regime of authority is moving from the Warren Hastings Paradigm to the Charles Grant Paradigm. And it's no longer possible to think in terms of adapting the Bible to local beliefs and circumstances. And so this is a moment in which the complexity of the attitude of the colonized is brought up as the attitude of the suborned missionary. And there's the more complicated and interesting attitude of the people he encounters sitting under these trees. Um, the, uh, at page 1886, the right hand column,

Speaker 1:          48:46          that's actually not the passage I wanted to read. A page 1881 on the left hand column.

Speaker 1:          48:54          This is a very difficult passage. Everything in Baba is difficult. Um, I want to, I think I want to gloss it by a suggestion to you that what he's talking about is that the ambivalence which, and, and we might as well say right out that this ad ambivalence is, he has a term for, and it's hybridity is the double consciousness of the cow colonized hovering between submission. That is to say submission to authority, but with a difference submission to authority on one's own terms. And on the other hand, acquiescence acquiescence in authority as given, which of course is basically the position of the missionary. And with that said, uh, I'll read the passage in which, uh, Baba describes this hybridity in the double consciousness of the colonize, the place of difference and otherness or the space of the adversarial within such a system of disposal.

Speaker 1:          49:56          As I've proposed is never entirely on the outside or implacably oppositional, not just in other words, again as a question of us versus them. It is a pressure and a presence that acts constantly if unevenly along the entire boundary of authorization, which is also authority that is on the surface between what I've called disposal as be stole at. I take that meaning submission. You simply, okay fine, I give in and disposition as inclination, which is, Hey, I kinda like that. I go along with it. Uh, I given spontaneously now to give in a simply as a form of recognizing one's beaten, you know, as a form of submission is puts one and the position of what Baba calls sly civility. And this is the position, uh, that I'd like to go back to for a moment as being very closely related to what gates calls signifying.

Speaker 1:          51:04          A Baba gives a number of examples of this slide civility, uh, in his texts. But of course, it's all present in the clever and wonderfully rich ironies of these figures sitting under the trees in his opening anecdote. But let me just give you an example of how sly civility works as a form of signifying and as a stats of colonized resistance, a recuperation of the will perhaps in a postmodern sense, which is nevertheless not rebellious, not in any way, um, and visioning and overthrow of authority, but is a means of living in the framework of authority. Just a quick example and then I'll let you go to African American people are having a conversation and the presence of a white person and they cheerfully and, and, and, and with, you know, with, with, with broad smiles on their face referred to this person in his presence as bill.

Speaker 1:          52:10          Now, Bill is a derisive and derogatory term for white people. Uh, and as the white person standing there has two choices in response to hearing himself referred to as bill. He can either take umbrage and say, Oh, why are you saying that about me? I'm a nice guy. You don't, you, you know how to say that. Uh, in which case the needling effect of the term, um, has taken hold. Or he can play the fool and pretend that he doesn't know that he's being signified on, uh, and pretend that well, it's perfectly okay to be called bill. And either way, you see it's a win win situation. They, uh, the, the, this, you know, this is this, this guy bill is the slave owner, right? You know, he likes to get along with people. Uh, so he's sitting around having this conversation and he hears them calling him bill.

Speaker 1:          53:07          Alright? So because he's, he, because there's an element of good nature in his slave owning personality, he's stuck. He can either complain that people are treating him unfairly, which of course is neither here nor there in terms of the power, in terms of the structure of power involved. Or he can play the fool and pretend that he doesn't even notice that he's being made fun of. Uh, and so either way, this is an example of that sly civility, which signifies on the man and which makes it clear that while the structure of power can't be overthrown anytime soon, there are nevertheless is a way of living at least a, of keeping one sense of humor within the existing structure of power, uh, while giving the man a hard time. Uh, that is the attitude, the set of attitudes that Baba is articulating in his notion of the hybridity of the colonized, uh, which takes the form in performance. We're going to have a lot more to say about performance on Tuesday, which takes in the form, takes the form in performance of this sly civility. I think it's page 1889 that he gives us that expression, which I think you should keep hold of. Which I would compare very closely with what Henry Louis Gates calls signifying. Okay. See you on Tuesday.
