Speaker 1:          00:02          Today today we're, we're still focused on individual consciousness, uh, why you might ask, well, as the site or model for symbolic patterning of one sort or another, uh, uh, we can speak of the psycho genesis of the text or film, uh, perhaps in the case, certainly have Jijak, uh, to some extent also have Dilas. Uh, and, and therefore we can still understand today's readings online, uh, Thursday's readings as belonging to the psychological emphasis in our syllabus. This is actually our farewell to the psychological emphasis. And, uh, it is, uh, so arranged because there are intimations in today's authors that there are political stakes. That is to say in one way or another, we're to understand their argument about the way in which the psyche functions as a, as having political implications. Uh, [inaudible], uh, is fascinating. It seems to me and his brilliant reading of the crying game, uh, at the very end of your essay in the moment when he says, look, this isn't just a kind of abdication from responsibility for, um, uh, the IRS republican revolution.

Speaker 1:          01:39          Uh, the, the soldier has not merely walked away from his role in revolutionary activity. He has discovered in his private life that is to say in the, in, in, in the erotic dimension of his consciousness, the need for revolution from within, he has disrupted his per necessarily disrupted his own thinking, uh, in ways equally radical too and closely parallel to the disruption of thinking that's required to understand, uh, one's relationship with the emerging, uh, stat republican status of Ireland. And so says [inaudible] Jack, there are political implications for the upheaval in consciousness. That is, uh, it, it ultimately tragic and counter with the big other and tails. Uh, I should say in passing also about Jijak that, um, as your editor I think goes into this a little bit in the italicized preface up, that there are temptations, political temptations entailed in this fascination with, uh, and, or even perhaps transcendent object of desire for the individual, but also for the social psyche.

Speaker 1:          03:09          In religious terms, there is a perhaps surprising or counterintuitive friendliness toward religion in Jack's work on the grounds that faith or the struggle for faith, uh, after all does constitute and effort to enter into some kind of meaningful relationship with that which one desires yet at the same time can't have. And by the same token, and this is where, uh, this is where in certain moments he confesses to a kind of instability in his political thinking, even though he is by and large on the left and partly needs to be understood, uh, as a disciple of Mark's. Nevertheless, he recognizes that in politics there's a kind of excitement but also perhaps potential danger in fascination with a big idea. Uh, it could be of course, some form of progressive colleague activity. It could, on the other hand be the kind of big idea that countenance is the rise of fascism.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Uh, Jijak acknowledges this, that the, that public identification with a kind of, uh, of almost or completely inaccessible otherness, either as a political idea or as a charismatic political leader. Um, can after all, uh, open up a, uh, a vertigo of dangerous possibilities. I use the word vertical advisedly because I'm going to be coming back to Hitchcock to, I'm going to be coming back to Hitchcock's vertigo, vertigo in just a minute. Um, but in the meantime, they're also obviously political stakes in Dulles to those of course presents to us in the for in this first chapter of his book a thousand plateau. Uh, he presents to us a kind of thought experiment, both as something recommended to the reader, see if you can think in this new, so radically, radically innovative way, but also providing a model for thinking of this kind in the style and organization and composition of the chapter itself.

Speaker 1:          05:27          So as a thought experiment, uh, once again, uh, Delores has to do in thought with what you might call a revolution from within. But the implications once again in politics as indeed also for Jijak, uh, are somewhat ambiguous. That is to say the rhizomatic mode of thinking. And we'll come back to the rhizomatic, uh, mode of thinking as we go along, um, with which radically de Centering, uh, and which lends itself to identification with, as it were, the mass movement of Kali activity can plainly be, uh, uh, uh, progressively democratic. That is to say democratic beyond even what are social and cultural cultural hierarchies accommodate. But at the same time, or I should say it can once again be fascistic because, because, uh, the, because the organization of fascistic culture, while nevertheless a kind of top down arrangement where the fruit her involves is nevertheless as, uh, the mass is mobilized nevertheless in this mobilization, uh, rhizomatic delos is careful to point out that in the, that, that there, that, that rhizomes and rhizomatic thinking is as he says repeatedly for the best and worst, rats are rhizomes.

Speaker 1:          06:57          Crab grass is a rhizome. In other words, everything which organizes itself in this fashion, uh, is rhizomatic. Much of it as a I'll be coming back to, uh, try to explain with a little more care is for the good into those as view. By the way, I say de Luz, and the same way I said, Wimsatt got tare is an important colleague. And ally, uh, they wrote many books together, including one that I'll mention later. They also wrote things separately, but Dullas simply because his oeuvre is more ample. And, and people feel somehow or another that he's more central to this work. Um, is a, is a Synecdoche d for Dilas and [inaudible]. And so I'll be saying to those, but I don't mean to slight. Got Dowry. Uh, in any case, uh, so, so, uh, we'll be, we'll be examining, uh, the, the delivery and rhizome a little bit more closely, but in the meantime, um, as to its political implications and we are moving closer to the political, uh, as we, as we began to think about figures of this kind, uh, is really on the admission of both of them, somewhat ambiguous.

Speaker 1:          08:11          In other words, they're introducing new possibilities of thought and as, and, and they're very different from each other as we'll see. They're introducing new possibilities of thought, uh, but there Canada enough to admit that they don't quite know where these possibilities are going. That you know, what, what, what the implications or consequences of successfully entering the thought world of either one of them might be. All right. So, um, yes, uh, they, they certainly have very different ideas that I wouldn't blame you for saying why on earth are we reading these two texts together? Uh, the overlap isn't altogether clear. I'm going to suggest what it is in a minute. But in the, uh, they are certainly on about very different things. Diller's uh, concerned with the, with as I say, introducing a kind of thought experiment which has to do with the de-centering of thought. Getting away from the tree or rars model of thought.

Speaker 1:          09:13          We'll have more to say about that. And uh, [inaudible] on the other hand, following lock cause distinction between, uh, the object, uh, ready to hand that you can have a, if you want and the object of desire, which such is the chain of signification is perpetually something that exceeds a, are out distances. Our grasp, uh, in developing this idea, uh, and thinking about what the object desire in all of its manifold forms might be, develops this curious idea, which is at the center of his thinking, uh, of the blot that, that the, the element in narrative form the element and the way in which our storytelling capacities are organized, which really can't be narrative, which were narrated, which really can't lend itself to meaning. Meaning of course, concrete specific meaning being that which can be tied down, uh, to, uh, to an accessible object. And so, uh, so the, the central idea that Jijak is attempting to develop in his essay is this has to do with this notion of the relationship between the big other and the blood as we'll see.

Speaker 1:          10:30          So these, these, these strike one is being extremely different ideas. And as I say, I wouldn't blame you for wondering, uh, just what overlap there can be. Well, at the same time, I would think that as you read these two, uh, rather, the somewhat a bouncy and frantic pros of both of these have both of these texts. You did say that they had a kind of mood or stance or orientation toward the critical and theoretical project in common. They seem in other words, uh, to be of the same moment and then even though their ideas seemed to, to be so very different, that is the basic idea is they're trying to get across seem to be so very different. You could perhaps imagine these two texts as being written if it was just a question of considering their style by the same person. Uh, I actually, I think that's not quite true, but at the same time, the, the, the, the, the kind of high energy too caffeinated, a feeling that you get from the pros of both, uh, is, is, is something that might give you pause, uh, and ask and make you wonder, well, just what, what moment does this belong to?

Speaker 1:          11:48          The answer is important and in a way obvious. I'm sure. I'm sure all of you are ready to tell me what moment it belongs to. It belongs to post modernism. This, these, these are, these are two exemplars of what is by far the most slippery. Um, if one likes it, one wants to say versatile, if one doesn't like it, one wants to say murky concept, uh, to which we've been exposed in the last 20 or 30 years. And, and, and I think that, um, I think that in a way we can bring them both into focus as a pair a little bit. If we pause somewhat simply over the concept postmodernism, I mean, maybe that's one of the things you wanted to learn and taking a course like this. So, so, uh, I'm just providing a service, um, you know, so, so, so postmodernism, what is, what is postmodernism?

Speaker 1:          12:45          I think we know what it is in artistic expression. Uh, we've, uh, we've encountered enough examples of it. Uh, we are, we have perhaps even taken courses in which in the context of artistic form and expression, it has come up postmodernism in artistic expression, particularly in the visual arts. But I think this is, this is true of us. Have of certain movements in both narrative and poetry as well. Postmodernism is an eclectic orientation to the past. In a certain sense, it's a return to the past. It's an opening up of textual possibility to traditions and historical moments of expression, which modernism had tended to suppose obsolete and to have set aside. So that in artistic expression, as I say, postmodernism is an eclectic return to possibilities thrown up by the history of art and literature. So that, I mean in architecture, um, many examples are quite extraordinary and many unfortunately are also hideous.

Speaker 1:          13:54          You know, that there was a certain point 15 or 20 years ago when every strip mall, every shopping mall was redecorated or what's the word I want, renovated every shopping mall was random. And how did they renovate it? Uh, they'd been flat, you know, they'd been sort of means Vander roa, sort of sixties modern before then it just sat there flat and so the renovators came along and put little gables on, on the, on the shopping mall so that each, each little shopped in the mall now has a gable and this is postmodern and the most awful things were done with suburban houses. Also it also in the name of a, of, of a kind of blind, completely, completely tasteless return to the neoclassical and, and certain other aspects of tradition. So the postmodern in what you might call suburban culture has been pretty awful.

Speaker 1:          14:48          Uh, but at the same time it has entailed a great deal of interesting work in painting. All of a sudden, you know, the New York scene isn't just one school and that's the sign of it. It's not just a certain kind of abstraction. It's not just a wholesale, a return agreed on by everyone to realism. It's a mixture of everything. Uh, so that, so that every, it's not just the artists are always just completely obsessed with their place in art history. It's not just a groups of artists together wanting to identify a certain place for themselves in art history. It's every artist and a kind of a narcotic independence from the thinking of other artists, uh, coming to terms with our history in his or her own way. Uh, so that the scene, the art scenes of New York and Berlin and Los Angeles and saw on the scene isn't something that you can identify as having a certain character anymore.

Speaker 1:          15:47          It's postmodern precisely in that it's gone global. It has a million influences and sources and there's very little agreement among artists about how to amalgamate and put these sources together so that in terms of artistic expression, the way in which the postmodern moment after modernism, in other words, the postmodern moment presents itself and I, and I put it deliberately as a medical symptom, the way that the way the postmodern moment presents, uh, in, in artistic expression. Now, philosophically, philosophically, postmodernism can be understood about as doubt, not just about the grounds of knowledge or you know, the, the, the widespread sorts of dot, which, which we've been talking about more or less continuously in this course. It can be understood as doubt in particular about the relationship between or among parts and wholes. In other words, can I be sure that my leg is part of my body when plainly it is at the same time, all whole with respect to my foot.

Speaker 1:          17:00          How, how is it that I know, uh, in any stable way? What a part or a whole list to take a more interesting example, uh, this, this is in Vichtenstein Phillip Philosophical Investigations. There is the flag, the French flag, which is called the tri color. All right, now the tri color is made up of three strips of color, white, blue, and red. I'm sorry if I've gotten the order wrong. In fact, I'm almost positive that I have, uh, um, but there are those three strips of color, uh, existing in relation to each other. And plainly, those three strips of color are parts of the flag and they, and, and they have a certain symbolic value. That is to say each color represents something, uh, and editors and enters into the symbolic understanding of what the flag is. But at the same time, red, white, and blue. Oh, sorry.

Speaker 1:          17:54          Yes. Red, white and blue aren't confined to this piece of cloth. The little strips of white, red and blue are obviously parts, uh, of whiteness. They can't be, they can't be understood as parts simply in and of themselves or parts specifically of one thing. There are parts of other things as well, but what's more, you know, if you look at the tri color without knowing what you're looking at, uh, how can you say that it's the part of a whole, you say, well, you know, they're just, they're just parts, uh, they are, or their holes unto themselves, which somebody happens to have laid a side by side. By the same token, if you look at the part of the tri color, which was white and you say white, well, obviously with respect to the vast universalizing concept, white, a little flag is simply a kind of met a Nimic relationship with that sense of white, but to, but to concretize this idea of the problematic relationship between part and whole and a different way, how can we be, why are we so confident about what we see as, as, as most of you know, I'm sure philosophical thinking tends to be tyrannized by metaphors of vision.

Speaker 1:          19:23          We assume that we understand reality because I'm not altogether as consciously, metaphorically speaking about this as perhaps we might be. Um, we say that we can see it, but how do you see it? You see it because of the Lenzing or focusing capacities of the eye, which exercise a certain tyranny over the nature of what you see. If you look too closely at something, all you can see is dots. If you close your, if you look at something and close your eyes, uh, that too becomes a kind of vast retinal mark Tobey painting. And, and, and, you know, it has a relation to what, to what to what you see, but is at the same time something very different. So if you get too far away from objects, they dissolve what you thought was an object dissolves into a much vaster, greater space, which has seems to have another objective nature.

Speaker 1:          20:23          The space that you, if you're in a jet and you're looking down a, what you're seeing certainly looks like it has form and structure, but the form and structure is not at all what you're seeing if you're standing on the ground. Uh, looking at exactly the same, shall we say, a square footage a insofar as you can, you're simply seeing different things. And if you recognize what might be called the tyranny of focus in the way in which we orient ourselves to the world, you can see that this perpetual dissolve and refocus constituting objects perpetually in new ways. And this happens to, you know, and the history of science. Uh, the relationship between subatomic particles sometimes turns itself inside out. And the particle that you thought was the fundamental unit, uh, turns out in fact, to have, uh, to, to, to, to have, uh, within it a fundamental unit of which it is apart and there.

Speaker 1:          21:26          And I mean, all of this was, uh, I'm just, I'm just referring to what happened during the golden age of the linear accelerator, when, when, uh, when all sorts of remarkable sort of inversions of what's taken to be fundamental, um, seemed, uh, to be, uh, made available by the experimental data. So that in all of these ways, uh, ranging from scientific to, uh, to sim to the most subjectively visual ways of understanding the world, there are possibilities of doubt that can be raised about part whole relationship. What is a whole, how do we define a unity? Should we be preoccupied with the nature of reality as a set of unity's obviously delivers is extremely upset about this, but he doesn't want anything to do with unity. Uh, he doesn't, he, he, he, he, his whole, the whole function of his thought experiment is the decentering of things.

Speaker 1:          22:28          So that's that one can no longer talk about units or holes or isolated entities. It's the being together and merging together and flying apart, uh, and reuniting and nieces, movement of entities if they can even be called entities that diverse is concerned with. Now, another aspect of the postmodern is what the postmodern philosopher, uh, uh, John Francois [inaudible] in particular has called the inhuman or the process of the dehumanization of the human. Now this isn't this, this is a weird term to choose because it's not an all addy humanistic. It's really a new way of thinking about the human dilemmas. You'll notice talks not just here in, in, in this episode, by repeatedly throughout his work, uh, which is why he has a little to say about it here. That's explanatory. He talks about Oregon's without bodies that might've brought you up short. Uh, but what it suggests is that we are, as delivers would put it machinic rather than organic.

Speaker 1:          23:41          Uh, if the problem with centered flaw is that it thinks of everything as Arba real as a tree. That problem has to do with the fact that a tree is understood in its symbolic extensions to have Oregon's, the roots are muscles and circulation. The blossoms are genital in nature. The crown or canopy of leaves is the mind of the tree reaching up to the sky, the mentality of the tree. And by the same token, if we think of our own bodies as Arba Real, we think of certain parts of those bodies as cognitive, other parts of those bodies, as having agency, as doing things. And if that's the case, then we think of a centered, uh, uh, and, and ultimately genital or genetic understanding of the body as being productive. Dullas wants to understand the body as being interactive, as being, uh, polymorphous perverse. So among other things, he wants to, he wants to understand it as being everywhere and nowhere and unsaturated body among other bodies.

Speaker 1:          24:58          And in order for this to happen, it's interface with other things has to be without agency and also without, uh, with, with, with, without co cognitive, uh, intention, uh, on the model of I think therefore, I am the world comes into being because I think, uh, without any of this in play, in other words, we, the d the dehumanization of the postmodern has to do not at all with denying the importance of the human, but with this radical way of rethinking the human among other bodies and things. Plainly, this emphasis involves a kind of dissolving into otherness, a continuity between subject and object, uh, in which the difference ultimately between what is inside me, what is authentic or in integral to my being me, uh, and what's outside me become completely permeable and interchangeable. The late 19th century, a author and philosopher, aesthetic philosopher, Walter pater, in the conclusion to a famous book of his called the Renaissance, had a wonderful way of putting this.

Speaker 1:          26:17          He said, we're too used to thinking that we're in here and everything else is out there. And that somehow or another, our perspective on everything out is a kind of, of of, uh, saving isolation are enabling our power of objectivity, but then paid her says, how can this be? Because we're made up of the same things that's out there. We to our molecular and other words, what does in us rusts iron and ripens corn. There is a continuousness between the inside feeling we have about ourselves and the x Doria, the exteriority with we're with which we are constantly coming in contact. Uh, so this is a, I mean the Dolos and Guattari of course have their own, um, excited junk be away of putting these things, but it's not really a new idea that we exaggerate the isolation of consciousness from its surroundings. There is a, there is a permeability of inside and outside that this kind of rise ohmic or d centered thinking, uh, is Matt to focus on?

Speaker 2:          27:34          No,

Speaker 1:          27:36          you could say that Wa Dullas is interested in it. If you go back to our coordinates that we kept, you know, when we're, when we're talking about the formulas, so sewer through structuralism deconstruction. If you go back to those coordinates, you can say that what does is interested in, ah, like so many others we've read is a rendering virtual or possibly even eliminating of the vertical axis. In other words of that center or head or crown of the tree, which constitutes everything that unfolds on the horizontal access, be it language, be it the unconscious, structured like a language, be it, whatever it might be. You could say that, uh, the, that, that the project of villas to as the undoing or rendering virtual virtual of this vertical access. Well, in a way I think that's true, but then what is the horizontal axis that, that, that is where the relation of dilemmas to, let's say deconstruction becomes a little problematic and where are we can actually see a difference.

Speaker 1:          28:46          I got to compare him in, there's one respect with luck call, but I want to hasten to point out as I will in a minute. Uh, a divergence from Lacan as well. You remember that? And Lock Cause Agency of the letter essay, he says, you know, he, he doesn't just talk about the access of combination as a series of concentric circles, each one of which is made up of little concentric circles. He's, uh, he doesn't just talk about that. He also talks about the way in which the combinatory, uh, powers of the imaginary in language or desire and language take place is like a musical staff,

Speaker 1:          29:27          uh, the w and so that the organization of signs in their Kata guity with each other can be either melodic or harmonic. Uh, but in any case, the, you can't just think of the axis of combination as a complete linearity. It has, it has a dimensionality of different kinds, well for, for, and that's why Deleuze and Guattari introduced the concept of Plateau toward the end of your excerpt. The book in which your excerpt appears is called a thousand plateaus. Uh, and ultimately the concept of Plateau is even more important to them than the concept of rhizome. The what, when they introduced the concept of Plateau, they're doing exactly the same thing. They're saying we jump from sign cluster to sign cluster. And not all zine clusters are linear and uniform. This is where there is perhaps a difference from deconstruction. Deleuze and Guattari are interested in multiplicity of coding as they put it.

Speaker 1:          30:31          They're interested in the, in the way in which, um, when I think I'm not just thinking in language, I'm not just thinking, uh, pictorially. I'm not just thinking musically, uh, but I am leaping around among codes so that, uh, the actual thought process is eclectic in this way. Um, now you could say that this is something actually anticipated also by Lacan. You remember also in the agency essay that Lacan reminds us a true inheritor of Freud, which he takes himself to be. Lecar reminds us that at the beginning of the interpretation of dreams, Freud said that the decoding, the dreamwork as like figuring out the puzzle of a reverse, a reverse being, one of those, uh, uh, trick sentences which are made up not exclusively of words but have the odd syllable. But then of pictures I heart New York, I heart New York is a rebus, uh, and that and that the dream work functions constantly in Freud's view as a river.

Speaker 1:          31:40          So you could say that luck on already introduces a four Dullas the possibility of thinking of a multiple coding that needs to be decoding a on a variety of decoded on a variety of plateaus if it's going to make any sense. Um, now d delays his relationship with all the figures we've been reading is rather problematic. Really. Um, the book preceding a thousand plateaus was called Auntie Oedipus. And it is a continuous systematic attack on, for, on the eye. He always calls Freud the general, uh, and the I, the idea that, um, that, that, that Freud feels that the whole of our psychic lives is completely saturated and, and, and dominated by the Oedipus complex and does, you know, with his idea of decent thinking of rise of the rhizome ah, so that's out to show in a variety of ways how limiting, uh, and how unfortunate for the legacy of psychoanalysis, this kind of, of, of, of, of focus on a particular issue.

Speaker 1:          32:53          It turns out to be this is, this is delivers his critique of Freud, not mine. And it's, and, and you would think that does, then we'd be a lot closer to Lacan just for the reasons that I've just described. But you know what call too, there's a, at the very bottom of page, uh, what page is it at the very bottom, bottom of, um, uh, in your text, uh, oh three, four left on the right hand column, very bottom of the page. He says, it is no accident that psycho psycho analysis linked it's destiny with linguistics. Now it's, it's impossible to say, I think quite by design, it's impossible to say whether Diller's is referring to Freud or Lacan and saying that because it's locked car who claims that Freud said it. In other words, that the interpretation of dreams is the text in which we discover that the unconscious is structured like a language.

Speaker 1:          33:51          Um, but at the same time, uh, uh, posterity has taken a lot cause focus on linguistics to be a massive, perhaps inappropriate revision of Freud, uh, and uh, to be a very different matter. So, uh, it's interesting that delivers quite ambiguously scenes to suppose for us that Freud and Lacan are part and parcel of each other. And the reason he can do that is that he is interested in a form of thinking about language, which no linguistics has successfully, uh, accommodated as far as he's concerned. In other words, he keeps talking about Chomsky. Uh, you know, uh, John's can seems to be in a way the villain of your essay. Uh, but, but I think in a way that's just the way of evading talking about so serve because you wouldn't want to get in trouble with all those structuralists uh, because so sort of to, uh, the problem was so sir too is that there is a certain tyranny or Arbor ask tendency and so Syria and thinking, uh, to be focused on the binary, that is the relationship between the signified and signifier as fixed, as inflexible as lacking in what dairied I would call free play, uh, and therefore to, or kind of a kind of of tyranny.

Speaker 1:          35:16          So very quickly on the rhizome, how do we know a rhizome when we see it? I think probably in the long run, whatever frustrations, uh, uh, the don't delivers his essay puts in your path. I think probably in the long run you're, you're pretty clear on what a rhizome is, but if, but, but if there's any lingering doubt, just think about the flu. Um, there, there is, uh, what Dolores calls rhizomatic flu. That's something we get from other people. The circulation of disease as we all come down with it around midterm period. The circulation of disease is rhizomatic. It's a perfect example of Ah, to use another tool to use another instance from, from dilemmas, the relationship between the wasp and the orchid, the wasp like the, like the, the virus, um, sort of flits about from blossom to blossom, descends and then constitutes the flu.

Speaker 1:          36:19          And by contrast there is hereditary disease that is that which is lurking in us, uh, because we're programmed for it. We're hardwired for, for it. Uh, it is, it is genetically in our nature and this, uh, the Dilas associates with Arbarella, with the arb arrest, it is, uh, it comes from an origin. It is, it is something that is a cause within us or a cause standing behind us as opposed to something coming out of left field, uh, in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion and descending on us brats. Also not unlike 10 yon offs, distinction between modification and evolution. The arborist evolves. The rhizomatic is modification that you know, the, the, the, the give and take of tensions among entities. The rats tumbling over each other, the maze of the borough, they spreading of crab grass. All of this, all of this has a kind of randomness, unpredictability of the power of linkage at all conceivable points without any, without any predictability.

Speaker 1:          37:38          Uh, all of this, uh, is entailed in the rhizomatic now as to what's being attacked. And again, the value system surrounding these things are not absolute. Dulles is not going so far as to say arborist, bad. Rhizomatic good. He's coming pretty close to it, but he acknowledges the perils, as I say, of the rhizomatic. But in the meantime, just one point in passing because I'm running out of time to talk about Jijak. Just one point in passing about the arborist. They're actually in the first pages of your essay. Two forms of it. One is what he calls the route book and other, the traditional classical book which presents to you a theme I am going to write about. So and so. And I'm going to do so systematically, uh, one thing at a time in a series of chapters. That's the route book, but then there's what he calls the fascicle book, the, uh, a book which consists of complicated offshoots of roots.

Speaker 1:          38:43          But nevertheless, and tailing a tap root. And this is what he associates with modernism precisely in your text. He says the fantastical book is like Joyce's Ulysses. Everything including the kitchen sink is in it. It looks as though it were totally rhizomatic, but it is of course controlled by unified, by brought into coherence by a single, uh, focusing authorial consciousness so that it is not truly rhizomatic. It's a fast sickle book here. Thousand Plateaus is going to be a rhizomatic book. So you have not just two kinds of books, uh, in this idea, but three, all right then very quickly about Jijak I think it can help us understand a [inaudible]. I hope you agree and having read it, but I think in a way it also takes us back or allows us to revisit, uh, Peter Brooks. Uh, the, the, uh, the best example it seems to me of the way in which, uh, the tension of desire in narrative works for z Jack is, is, although these are splendid examples and I think, and I think largely self explanatory.

Speaker 1:          40:00          I think the best example is actually an another book by, she's Jack called everything you wanted to know about Lakai, but were afraid to ask Hitchcock. And, and, and, and in that book, uh, of course you get a lot of attention paid to vertigo and just think about Vertigo as an instance of the kind of plot Jijak is talking about. You know, there's that, I forgotten her name, but there's, there's that really nice woman. You remember the painter, you know, and Jimmy Stewart just pays absolutely no attention to her. She's right there. She's available. She's in love with him. Oh, you know, he doesn't even see her except as a confidant. Uh, you know, oh, yes, you, ah, I'm so glad you're here. Uh, but, uh, but he is on the other hand, obsessed with, with a woman who, whose identity he can't even be sure of.

Speaker 1:          40:56          It's not, it's not just that she's inaccessible for some reason that she's, that she's a distant object of desire. Her identity and the question whether or not she's being placated by somebody else remains completely unclear, unclear for many spectators, even as they watched the ending of the film, completely unclear. And that is an obscure, not just a distant, but an obscure object of desire. And of course the premise of her and accessibility is what drives the plot. Now I think that the interest that it's interesting to think about the relationship between the element of detour and delay as eugenic implies it and understanding narrative, uh, the relationship between that and what Peter Brooks is talking about. Peter Brooks is, uh, is, is talking about the way in which middles in plots protract themselves through, uh, episodes, all of which manifest some sort of imbalance or need for a need for further a repetition in a new key.

Speaker 1:          42:05          And much of this hat, because the characteristic plot of the kind of fiction books is mainly thinking about as the marriage plot. Much of this has to do with inappropriate object choice, which, uh, indeed can also in many cases, Allah, what I began by mentioning and Jujitsu, uh, political inappropriate political object choice. Think, for example, about the plot of James's Princess Casamassima in that regard, uh, uh, poor hyacinth Robinson strikes out on both counts in rather completely parallel ways. He, he's, he ends up on the wrong side of politics. He ends up on the wrong side of love. Uh, and in a way the princess castle, Princess Castle mass is an exploration of these two sides of the issue. But so in any case, uh, for Brooks, the resolution of the plot is a way in which closure can be achieved. That is the, it is a final moment of equilibrium as one might say, or quiet or reduction of excitation such that the Floridian death wish can be realized as we know, uh, in the way we want it to be realized as opposed to, uh, are being afflicted by something from the outside.

Speaker 1:          43:29          So, so in Brooks, who's closest ties are to structuralism, there is a sense there isn't achieved sense of closure, which is an important aspect of what's admirable in fiction. Jijak is more postmodern, Geez. Axes following Laca, he sees the object of desire as um, uh, a sim tonic as being, uh, ultimately and always inaccessible. Or if it becomes accessible, uh, as for example, on page 1193 and the right hand column or one might say almost accessible, this gives rise to as many problems as it seems to eliminate bottom right hand column. Page 1193 [inaudible] says, perhaps in courtly love itself, the long awaited moment of highest fulfillment when the lady Renders Grenada Mercy to her servant is not the lady's surrender, not her consent to the sexual act nor some mysterious right of initiation, but simply a sign of love on the part of the lady, the miracle that the object answered, stretching its hand out to this applicant.

Speaker 1:          44:48          The object. In other words, it has become subject in this moment of exchange or a mutuality of recognition or becoming human on the part of the lady who, uh, who of course Jijak Jack has been associated with the dominate tricks, ah, in a sadistic relationship. Um, in this moment of becoming human, of offering love, the object becomes more accessible. That is to say there is now the possibility of some form of neutrality, but in becoming more accessible, the energy of desire is threatened with dissolution. In other words, closure in Jijak is a threat to the energy of desire. Desire is something which inheres in our very language according to Zach and which, uh, and, and, and which were it to be understood as, as, as, as, as brought to closure. The Lady, you know, the, the, the, I mean, Jeez, that gives lots of examples of the lady, you know, after all this sort of seeming and accessibility says, sure, why not, you know, of course, uh, and, and you know, and the person is, and the person is completely upset and then refuses, refuses the act because there's nothing more to desire.

Speaker 1:          46:16          All of a sudden, all of a sudden, the whole structure of that energy that drives language that drives consciousness, comes tumbling to the ground and desire has become need. It's become sort of merely a matter of, uh, of gratification through what's ready to hand, uh, and no longer a question of sustaining a dream. And this and this. Generally speaking, is what Dziedzic wants to focus on in talking about these plots that the object of desire must be not just distance but also obscure. I'm going to make two more points. First of all, as you can no doubt tell this is a perfect replica of Hans Holbein owns the ambassadors. Uh, I mean, I, I'd be, I'd be amazed if anyone in the room hadn't recognized it, but there it is. There it is. Um, there's two guys, there's a table between them. They are negotiating probably over one of Henry the eighth marriages.

Speaker 1:          47:21          And this I think is not insignificant. They are there, you know, in the service of Henry the eighth negotiating one of those extremely complicated marriage as possibly even the one that led to the, uh, the, uh, application, uh, uh, of the Anglican Church from the Roman Catholic Church. Who knows, who knows? But the lore about the painting is that it has to do with the negotiation of an object of desire and that object is absent. In other words, there's something really only implied by the painting in the foreground of the painting, notorious to art historians. There's this thing. Now this is pretty much what's in the painting. I go, this is not a replica of the two guys standing there, but this is pretty much what you see when you look at the foreground of the painting. If you look sort of from the side, it turns into something very much like a skull.

Speaker 1:          48:22          And generally speaking, there's a kind of consensus among scholars that it may be a, uh, a weirdly distorted shadow or representation of its color. What's a skull is doing in the foreground of course, uh, causes us to wonder as well. Obviously you can have some ideas on the subject, but it's still not exactly realist painting we're talking about if he sticks a skull and the forager, well it also has a certain resemblance to other things we could mention. Uh, but the rate, but the main point about it is that we don't really know what it is. It is. And other words, uh, something we've already become familiar with and thinking about luck call. It is that signifier, that ultimate signifier, which is the obscure object of desire called sometimes by Lacan the Phallus. And it seems simply to be there before us in this painting. Now, both in the book in Hitch on Hitchcock where he finds something like this in just about every film Hitchcock ever made and also in whole binds painting, Dziedzic calls this the blot.

Speaker 1:          49:36          It's, it's, it's, you know, we have nothing else to call it. It's a blog. What's it doing there in fiction we would call it irrelevant detail. We can think of. We can find a way of, of placing formally, absolutely everything in fiction, the weather, what the flowers on the table, whatever it might be. We can place formally, but there may be something in fee in fiction, which is simply unaccountable. We cannot account for it. And that's the block that's the block for Gj. All right. Now finally undesired and language. There's a partner's EGX essay, which you may have thought of as a digression and he's suddenly talking about jail. Austin's ordinary language philosophy. He suddenly talking about the linguist, uh, do crows idea of predication in both cases. What's important about in, in the one case, the element of performance and any other, in any utterance.

Speaker 1:          50:37          And in the other case they dominance of an entire sentence by predication. What's important in both of those elements is that they take over and aspect of language of which they were only supposed to be a part. In other words, in Austin, there are both performatives and constant it, but in the long run, the argument of how to do things with words suggest that there are only performatives. I mean, I thought this was a constant, if I thought this was just straight forward language, but I can now see an element of performance in it. And that's the way that's, that there's a gradual changing of his own mind in Austin's book, uh, which, um, to which judge executive sensitive by the same token do crow talks about the way in which the predicate element of a subject predicate relation has a kind of energy of agency that simply, uh, takes over the grammatical subject, uh, and constitutes a kind of performance in the sentence performance in both cases, meaning desire.

Speaker 1:          51:41          When I promise to do something, I also desire to fulfill the promise when, uh, when I, when I predicate something, I'm also evoking a desire that, that something be the case possibly through my own instrumentality. This is the argument. That's what Dziedzic means by desire and language and by the in escape ability of desire in language and the way in which it permeates everything we can say to each other. And most particularly the way in which it permeates the plot or as they say in film studies Daya Jesus of the kinds of filmic examples that Dziedzic gives us. Uh, I'd better stop there. Uh, I, I hope that this somewhat rapid fire survey of some key ideas in these texts are helpful. And I think in the long run, perhaps, I hope mainly that you see these two energetic authors as exemplars of what we call postmodernism and see the relevance of the concept of the postmodern to the study of literary theory.
