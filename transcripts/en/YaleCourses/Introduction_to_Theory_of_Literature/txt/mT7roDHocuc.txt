Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Uh, moving then as quickly as possible into our subject matter for today. Uh, we began a series of lectures on various aspects of 20th century formalism, a big word, uh, at the end of our run through the varieties of 20th century formalism. I hope it doesn't seem quite as big and that it's many meanings, uh, but finite number of meanings have been made clear to you. Uh, in the meantime, uh, this aspect of our subject, uh, is that is to say what we're taking up this week is as much really, you remember in the first lecture I said there's a difference between the history of criticism and theory of literature. Uh, one difference being history of criticism has a great deal to do with literary evaluation. That is to say, why do we care about literature and how can we find means of saying that it's good or not good?

Speaker 1:          01:07          Um, this is an aspect of thought concerning literature that tends to fall out of literary theory, but not out of the materials that we're reading this week. You can see that when whims sat and Beardsley talk about the success of the poem, they understand the whole critical enterprise, including its theoretical underpinnings. The question, what is a poem? The question, how should we best read it? That the whole enterprise is still geared toward a literary evaluation. And that's, and that makes this subject matter that we'll be discussing this week. As I say, as much a part of the history of criticism as it is of literary theory, we're going to be reading it with a theory spin. Uh, that is to say, we're going to focus on the question, what a poem is, and the question, what criteria should we invoke in order to read it, uh, for the best and correctly.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Uh, but there are other ways of approaching this material. Uh, in any case, a website Beardsley, uh, is act was actually a philosopher who taught at temple university, a good friend of his, a in the book in which this, uh, the essay, the intentional fallacy appeared a book called the verbal icon, uh, women's that collaborated with Monro Beardsley on three essays. Uh, and this is one of them. Uh, so we try to remember to say William Sat and Beardsley, even though it is what it is when sat who taught at Yale, that in itself needn't be significance, except that the new critics, the school of critics do, which he belonged, have always been identified with Yale and indeed consolidate it. A kind of teaching method and attitude toward literature, which constituted the first wave, uh, first of two waves of involvement in literary theory, uh, which amount to the Yale English and comparative Literature Department's claims to fame.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Uh, the new critics, um, many of the, many of those figures who belonged to the new critics did much of their important work before they arrived at Yale. Uh, others never were at Yale. And yet at the same time, it's a movement closely associated with this, with this institution. When I arrived at Yale, a website was still teaching clearance. Brooks was still teaching. Uh, and so I feel a kind of per personal continuity, uh, with these figures, uh, and understand as, as we all will more fully later on the way in which, uh, the style and emphasis on style of close reading that evolved within the new criticism, um, meaningfully and importantly left its mark on much subsequent criticism and theory that hasn't, uh, in fact always acknowledged the new criticism perhaps to the extent that it might have. Um, what I'll say because much of this should be reserved for next time when I talk about cleaning, it's Brooks and returned to the whole subject to the new criticism and the way in which it's viewed historically.

Speaker 1:          04:14          So much of it can be reverted for reserve for next time. But what I do want to say now is this, if it weren't for the new critics, none of you probably would have been able to sit patiently through any of your middle or high school English classes. When Clarence Brooks and Robert Penn Warren published a book called understanding poetry first published 1939 and then subsequently reissued again and again and again as it swept the country. Suddenly school teachers had a way of keeping kids in the classroom for 50 minutes, close reading the idea that you could take a text and do things with it, that the, that the interpretation of a taxed wasn't just a matter of saying, Oh yes, it's about this and isn't it beautiful? Reciting the text, emoting over it and theorizing about it. Uh, and then looking around for something else to say.

Speaker 1:          05:11          It was no longer a question of doing that. It was a question of constructing and elaborate formal edifice to which everybody can, could contribute. Students got excited about it. They saw certain patterns or certain ways of elaborating patterns that the teachers were talking about. And Lo and behold, the 50 minutes was over and everybody had had a pretty good time. Uh, this, this had never happened in an English class before. Seriously, your English majors because of the new criticism, I admit, especially if you went to private school, this, this, this, this way of teaching did not perhaps quite so much, uh, for a variety of reasons, uh, permeate published public school literature teaching. Uh, but it was simply as a result of understanding poetry. Uh, the way to go. It took time. If you had more than 50 minutes, you could actually make ample use of it.

Speaker 1:          06:09          A Tsl at who is in many ways associated with the new criticism. Some of one of its intellectual forbears nevertheless took a somewhat dim view of it and called it lemon squeezer criticism, you know, but, but what this meant is, you know, it takes time. You gotta squeeze absolutely everything out of it. Uh, and so it was ideal from the standpoint of teaching. And it was, it seems to me also wonderfully galvanizing intellectually because p because it really did make people think, look how intricate what I thought was simple turns out to be, uh, the new criticism, uh, incontestably and without rival created an atmosphere in which it was okay to notice that things were a little more difficult than they'd been supposed to be. And this in itself, uh, was extraordinarily useful and constructive, not just for scope, subsequent literary theory, I think, but for the way in which English teaching actually can help people think better.

Speaker 1:          07:12          Uh, all of this, the new criticism had a great deal to do with, um, and when I talk next time about the way in which it's been vilified for the last 40 or 50 years, naturally I will have this, uh, in, in the back of my mind. So in any case, in any case, where did this preoccupation with form? Because we're beginning to think about the way in which theory can preoccupy but not necessarily, but can preoccupied itself with form. Where does it come from? Well, needless to say, I'm about to say, it goes back to the beginning. You know, when Plato Writes His Republic and devotes book 10, as I'm sure most of you know, to an argument, uh, in effect banishing the poets from the ideal republic. Part of the argument is that poets are terrible. Annotators they imitate reality as badly as they possibly can.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Uh, not, it's not there three times removed from the ideal forms of objects. In reality, there are hopeless mass. They get everything wrong. Uh, they think that a stick reflect refracted in the water is therefore a crooked stick. They're subject to every conceivable kind of illusion not to be trusted, and Socrates calls them liars. Okay. Now, when Aristotle, when Aristotle writes his poetics, he does so and, and this is true, and, and, and, and rewards and rewards scrutiny. If one thinks carefully about the poetics, he does so very consciously in refutation of Plato's arguments in the republic and one perhaps the keystone of this reputation. Refutation is simply this. Plato says, poets imitate be at badly. Aristotle says, this is a category mistake because poets don't imitate reality. Poets don't imitate, says Aristotle things as they are. They imitate things as they should be. And other words, the business of poets is to organize, to bring form, to bear on the messiness of reality and in so doing, to construct not exactly not an alternate reality in the sense that it has nothing to do with the real world.

Speaker 1:          09:34          That is to say it doesn't mention the real world or at somehow or another advance, you know, human beings made out of chocolate or something like that, but ideally rises the element's existing in the real world such that it's object is something other than reality as such. And this is really the origin of formalism. Aristotle is considered, uh, the ancestor of the varying sorts of thought about form. And it's this move that's moved that he makes in the poetics, uh, that in genders, this possibility. Now turning to your sheet in the early, early modern period, the poet and courtier, Sir Philip Sidney wrote an elegant, really wonderfully written defense of poetry and want addition called the apology for Posey. And in this edition he develops a while actually a fervent admirer of Plato. He nevertheless develops this idea of Aristotle with, uh, with a remarkable, uh, rhetorical ingenuity.

Speaker 1:          10:42          Uh, and I think very impressively lays out the case that Aristotle first makes a first passage on your sheet said, and he's talking about the various kinds of discourse, divinity, hymnody, science, philosophy, history. And I was all the ways in which you can contribute to a human betterment, human welfare. And he says all but one of them. There is, is, is a serving science that is to say it is subservient to the natural world. It's, its importance is that it refers to that world. The first sentence of your hand, of your passage, there is no art but one delivered to mankind that hath not the works of nature for his principle object. This, by the way, although it's not exactly a work of nature, this by the way, is why even that which is incontestably better than secular poetry hymnity and also divine knowledge theology.

Speaker 1:          11:46          That's why even these fields, which are the supreme fields, are also serving sciences. They are subservient to an idea that they have to express, which is the idea of God and God is real. Nobody. I mean we're, we're just sort of, if there's, there's no sense that we're making God up in this kind of discourse. Sydney's a devout, uh, uh, uh, a devoutly religious person, uh, and there is no scent. There's no semblance of doubt in his attitude. Uh, and yet he is saying something very special about the poet who is somewhere in between divinity and the other sorts of discourse with which poetry is traditionally in rivalry, science, philosophy and history. And he says, this is what's unique about poetry. Only the poet disdaining to be tied to any such subjection, subjection, in other words, to things as they are to standing to be tied to any such subjection lifted up with the vigor of his own invention.

Speaker 1:          12:55          Duff grow any fact, another nature, he nothing affirms and therefore never live. In other words, Plato is wrong. The poet is not a liar because he's not talking about anything that's verifiable or falsifiable. He is simply talking about the parameters of the world he has brought into being. Sydney thinks of it as a co, as a kind of magic. Uh, he invokes, for example, the science of the pseudoscience of alchemy. The, the poet, he says range is freely within the Zodiac of his own wit. He also invokes the pseudo science. I'm sorry, I meant to say astrology. Uh, he also invokes the pseudoscience of alchemy when he says that the poet in habits of brazen world and have this brazen brass of this brazen world, he makes a golden world. In other words, poetry is transformational in representing not things as they are, but things as they should be. It transforms reality.

Speaker 1:          14:03          All right, so this is an argument which an outline a once again justifies the idea of literature as formed as that which brings form to bear on the chaos and messiness of the real. Now I hit, I don't mean to say things just stood as Sydney said. They were until you get to con, a great deal happens. But an aspect of cons, famous Copernican revolution and the history of philosophy is his ideas about aesthetics and the beautiful and about the special faculty that he believes, uh, has to do with and mediates our aesthetic understanding of things. A faculty which he calls the judgment so that in the critique of judgment 1790 he outlines a philosophy of the beautiful and have the means whereby the judgment makes judgments of the beautiful. He does a great deal else in it, but I'm isolating this strand, which is what's relevant to what we're talking about in many ways.

Speaker 1:          15:14          Con Without knowing anything about Sydney, nevertheless follows from Sydney, particularly in this, as you'll see, I'm going to look sort of with some carrot, these passages so all will become clear, but particularly in this Sydney and, and I didn't exactly quote the passage in which Sydney does this, but I urged you to believe that he does. Sydney actually racks poetry somewhere between divinity and the other sciences. In other words, poetry is not the supreme thing that that that a person can do. Sydney believed this so much in fact that when he knew himself to be dying, having been mortally wounded in a battle, he ordered that all of his own poems be burned. I mean, he had, you know, from the standpoint of a devout person, he had no doubt that poetry was inferior to divinity. Now in a way, that's what [inaudible] saying too, and the passages you'll read, you'll see that it's that the point is not that art and the judgment of the beautiful is the supreme thing that humanity can be engaged with.

Speaker 1:          16:19          The point is only that it has a special characteristic that nothing else has. That's the point that this whole tradition is trying to make. So this is the way can't puts attorney first to the second passage. The pleasant and the good. Both have a reference to the faculty of Desire, the pleasant as the way in which our Appleton see our sensuous faculty, which comp calls. The understanding by the way, understands things. Things are either pleasant or unpleasant. The good on the contrary is the way in which our cognitive and moral faculty, which comp calls the reason, understands things. Things are either to be approved of or not to be approved of. But in each case, as con argues, they have a reference to the faculty of Desire. I want, I don't want, I approve, I disapprove, and they bring with them the former. That is to say the pleasant, a satisfaction pathologically conditioned the ladder, a pure, practical, purposeful satisfaction, which is determined not merely by the representation of the object.

Speaker 1:          17:39          That is to say by the, by the fact that the representative object exists for me. Right? Not Merely by the representation of the object, but also by the represented connection of the subject with the existence of the object. In other words, by the way in which I want it or don't want it, approve of it or don't approve it, my subjectivity, in other words, determines my attitude toward it. Whereas Khan, what God is saying is that my attitude of that which simply stands before us as what is neither pleasant nor good but is rather something else, isn't, doesn't exist for me. It exists in and for itself. The next passage taste is the faculty of judging of an object or a method of representing it by an entirely disinterested satisfaction or dissatisfaction. In other words, yeah, I still like it or don't like it, but my liking has nothing to do either with desire or with approval.

Speaker 1:          18:49          Moral political as the case may be. I just like it or I just don't like it according to principles that can be understood as arising from the faculty of Judgment and not from the Faculty of the understanding which is a petitive and the faculty of reason which is moral. So with that said, ah, the PA perhaps just to add to that, the fourth passage, uh, beauty is the form of the purposive nus of an object. So far as it is perceived in it without any representation of a purpose. Whoa. You'll say, well let's hunt makes a distinction between the purposive and the purpose full. What is the distinction? The purpose full as the purpose of the object. In practical terms, what can it do? What can it do for me? How does it go to work and the world? What is its function among other objects? What bearing does it have on in particular my life.

Speaker 1:          19:59          But the purposiveness of the object is the way in which it is sufficient unto itself. It has its own purpose, which is not a purpose that has any bearing necessarily on anything else. It has in other words and internal coherence. It has a dynamism of parts that is strictly with reference to its own existence. It is a form, it is a form and that form, because we can see it has structure because we can see it has organization and complexity is purposive. That is to say it has it, it manifests its self sufficiency. So that's cons. Famous distinction between the purpose of which is the, uh, organization of an aesthetic object and the purpose full, which is the organization of any object insofar as it's, it, it goes to work in the world or for us. And aesthetic object can be purposeful. That is to say, we can view it as purposeful.

Speaker 1:          21:14          Uh, I see a naked body, uh, which the art historians call a nude. Uh, I don't accept that it's merely a nude I wanted or I disapprove of it. Um, and Lo and behold, it's no longer aesthetic. I'll come back to that in a moment, but I hope you can see that that is a distinction between the purpose of and the purposeful. Now, um, just in order to reprise these important distinctions, uh, uh, I want to turn to a passage from in Samuel Coleridge who is at least on this occasion a disciple of Khan and his, I think usefully paraphrasing the arguments of con that we've just been engaged in fifth passage on your sheet. The beautiful says Coleridge is that wants distinguished both from the agreeable which has beneath it and notice the sort of stationing of the beautiful as Sydney stations. It between let's, let's beneath it and what's above it from the agreeable, which has beneath it and from the good, which is above it for both these necessarily have an interest attached to them both act on the will and excite a desire for the actual existence of the image or idea contemplated while the sense of beauty rest, gratified in the mirror, contemplation or intuition.

Speaker 1:          22:40          Regardless whether it be a fictitious Apollo or a real, and Tim says, in other words, they judgment of beauty does not depend on the existence of the object for its satisfaction.

Speaker 1:          22:59          Now, Oscar Wilde ever the wag and a person who put more good literary theory in ways that didn't seem like literary theory at all. Uh, perhaps in the entire history of thinking about the subject says in the famous series of Aphorisms, aphorisms, which, which constitute his preface to the picture of Dorian Gray. He concludes this series of Aphorisms by winking at us and saying all art is quite useless. I hope that after reading these passages and enduring the explication of them that you've just heard, you can immediately see what wild means by saying all art is quite useless. He's appropriating a term of opprobrium, you know, and the utilitarian tradition. Oh my goodness, that's something would be useless, right? He's appropriating a term of a program and pointing out that it is an extraordinarily unique thing about art, that it's useless. And other words that it appeals to know merely a pedal [inaudible] or other form of subjective interest.

Speaker 1:          24:14          We don't have to have an interest in it and the sense of owning part of a company, we don't have to have an interest in it in order to appreciate it. In other words, we can be objective about it. We can distance ourselves from our, from our subjective wants and needs and likes and dislikes and we can coexist with it and I happy and constructive way that is good for both of us because if we recognize that there are things in the world which have intrinsic value and importance and what we call beauty and yet are not the things that we covered or wish to banish, we recognize in ourselves the capacity for it disinterestedness we recognize in ourselves a virtue which is considered to be the cornerstone of many systems of moral understanding to realize that we're not interested in everything and merely for that reason take a view of things but that there are things that we don't have to have that kind of interest in and can nevertheless recognize as self sufficient and valuable is important.

Speaker 1:          25:43          The suggestion is wild suggestion, but I think also constantly Justin before him is important for our recognition of our own value. And by the same token all this harping on the autonomy of art. That is to say the self sufficiency of the art, the way in which it's not dependent on anything. As soon as Sydney says the way in which it's not a serving science existing merely to represent things other than itself. All right. The way in which this is possible for art is also as our own capacity to be disinterested is a way of acknowledging that freedom exists, that I am free, that things are free, things are free from my instrumental interest in them. So that in general, what's implicit in this view of art and this view of human judgment and what makes it so important and the history of thought is that once again, and this is not the first time we've brought this up and in these lectures and won't be the last, is that once again, it's a way of recognizing that in addition to all the other things that we are, some of them wonderful.

Speaker 1:          27:11          In addition to all of that, we are also free. There is in us at least an element that is free in dependent serving nothing autonomous. And this idea of our freedom and by implication of the freedom of other things from our instrumental entrusts is what sustains the formalist tradition and against various kinds of criticism and objection that will be taking up, uh, in turn as the case arises, sustains and keeps bringing back into the history of thought on these subjects. The notion that form simply for its own sake as this, as, as the notorious aesthetist movement at the end of the 19th century put it is valuable. All right. Now, John Crowe ransom, who was never at Yale, but nevertheless, uh, um, one of the founders or first members of a self identified school of figures who called themselves the new critics, um, published a book called the new criticism.

Speaker 1:          28:41          And that's where, and that's where the term the new critics comes from. You may have noticed in your whims that essay that there's a footnote to somebody named Joel Spingarn who wrote an essay called the new criticism in 1924 not to worry, that has nothing to do with the new criticism. That just means criticism, which is race and different matter altogether. By the same token, uh, there is a, there the, the work of Roland backed at his, some of his contemporaries, Palais whom I mentioned, John Stocker Verbinski and others, ah, was called in the French Press, La Nouvelle Critique. And that too, you know, then is, uh, a, an instance of the new criticism being used as a term. But that too has nothing to do with our subject. Uh, the new critics, the American new critics, as they are sometimes identified. Uh, we're a school and I, and I use that advisedly because they're self identified as a group.

Speaker 1:          29:40          We're a school of people who evolved this idea of the independent status, uh, um, ransom calls it, uh, a discreet ontological object, the independent status of the work of art, uh, and the means whereby it can be appreciated as independent in all of its, of all of, in all of its complexity. Uh, and the first foray, our first foray into the thinking of this school will be our rating of whimsy and beards leaves, uh, the intentional fallacy, which I'll get to in a minute, but simply as a reprise, uh, take a look at the two passages from ransom, which complete what's on your sheet, uh, and which, um, uh, I think you can see, create a link between the sort of thinking you've encountered in reading. The intentional fallacy and the tradition that I've been trying to describe passage seven ought to be completely transparent to you now because it is simply a paraphrase of the passages I've given you from con and Coleridge.

Speaker 1:          30:51          The experience says ransom, the experience called beauty is beyond the powerful ethical will precisely as it is beyond the animal passion. And indeed these last two are competitive and coordinate. In other words, what they have in common with each other ethical will and animal passion is that they're both grounded in interest. Right? That's, I mean, that's the point of, you know, sir, kind of Clarks were the nude, you know, I mean, we have for the naked human being as viewed both by the appetites and by moral reason as a common term from the standpoint, both of what con calls the understanding and from what Kant calls the reason the, the, the expression naked body is just fine. But if we've got, but if we do believe there's another category, the aesthetic viewed by an independent faculty called the judgment, we need another word when we're looking.

Speaker 1:          31:55          I mean, you know, I mean, modern painters like Philip Pearlstein and Lucien Freud would strongly disagree, but in a way, that's the point. When we're looking at a painting of a naked body, we not say, oh, that's a naked body. We say that's a nude. And that, and that distinction, that distinction is what, uh, as it were, bears out the implicit way, the semi conscious way in which all of us acknowledged there to be a category that we call the aesthetic judgment. On the other hand, a lot of people think it's, it's all hokum. Uh, and in fact, in fact, the predominant view in the 20th century has been that there's no such thing as disinterestedness, uh, that we're looking at. Uh, we formed, we have an interest in, uh, and form views of, and that, um, and that this content moment of, of, of dispassionate or disinterested contemplation is what, uh, the early 20th century critic I a Richards called a phantom aesthetic state.

Speaker 1:          32:59          Uh, and so the predominant view is of this kind, but you know, I mean, just to do it justice in passing, there is a certain sense is they're not in which we suddenly find ourselves without meaning to. And without being simply victims of sort of cultural tyranny, we suddenly find ourselves standing in front of something clasping our hands tilting our head and feeling somehow or another different from the way we feel when we typically look at things. And that too, you know, is an intuitive way of saying yes, something like this. However, rigorously we can define it or defend it. Something like this does seem to go on in our minds at certain kinds of moments of experience. You know, we just feel differently looking at a certain work of art. Then we feel, uh, or a certain landscape, let's say. Then we feel looking at other sorts of things. Maybe we don't know why. Maybe we doubt that the differences is absolute in the way that caught wants to insist it is. But nevertheless, we have intendancy feelings of this kind and we should acknowledge them because again, uh, at least in terms of it's of, of, of a, of a, of a, a weak understanding of these positions, it, it does tend to justify them, at least, at least it explains to us why people can't have had such thoughts. Okay. When set

Speaker 1:          34:31          website right off, I keep saying women side, again, its whims that and leave, but I already explained, you know how that is, um, whims that right off the bat attacks what he calls the romantic understanding of literature. Now what does he mean by romantic? It's the attitude which supposes that a poem and that's whims. That's privileged privileged word, which I'll try to explain that a poem is an expression that is to say is the expression of some passion or profound genius working its way into a form, but that the important thing is the expression this much, by the way, when's that hasn't common with God I'm or because you know God I'm or doesn't talk much about authors either. And Garber is interested in what he calls, meaning the subject matter dissolve, right? He's not interested in in your sort of expression of that meaning or my expression of that.

Speaker 1:          35:36          Meaning he's, he's, he's interested in the way in which a reader can come to terms with a meaning. And that much as I say, despite the profoundly different nature of their projects, uh, winds that and got him or have in common so upon is not an expression but an independent object with a self contained meaning. And if this meaning is not self evident to the attentive reader, then we don't judge the poem a success. This is where evaluation comes in. The success or failure of a DePaul of, of a poem depends on the realization of meaning. It doesn't depend on are going to the archive. Finding out what the author said in his letters about it, finding out what he told his friends, what he told the newspapers. It doesn't involve any of that. If the meaning is not clear in the poem, we judge the poem a failure.

Speaker 1:          36:38          We don't refer. We have no reason to refer. If we respect the autonomy of the poem as such, we don't refer, we don't appeal to an authorial intention. Hence on page eight 11 lefthand column. But third of the way down the design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art. So that and and, and it follows from this that um, even a short poem, even a short lyric poem and here you could see whims that following food co. I mean he's obviously not following anticipating Fuko and again they have nothing to do with each other, but there is this overlap. Even a short poem doesn't really have an author. It has a speaker, a figure speaking in the poem that needs to be understood dramatically. That is to say as though the poem, we're one of Browning's or ts Elliot's dramatic monologues. In other words, so so that the speaker of any poem on websites of you is this beaker and doubt with a certain character, a certain viewpoint, a certain argument to be put forward and that in order and that our concern about the speaker has to be a concern within the poem of the way in which this character is elaborated and not, uh, reinforced somehow by biographical reference to that which is not the speaker but the author standing back there somewhere behind the poem.

Speaker 1:          38:29          Now, why focus on the poem? Notice we never hear about literature. We never had, we never even hear about poetry. The object of attention for an analysis of this kind is the poem. While the poem is as John as John Dunn puts it, a little world made cunningly. It's a microcosm. It is a distillation or quintessence. It is a model, in other words, for the way in which literature can be understood as world making. Not a representation again of things as they are, but of things as they should be. Whereas things whereas they should be is not whereby things as they should be is not necessarily an ideal, but rather that which is formal, that which is organized that which has a coherence and make sense self sufficiently and within its self. That's why poem the poem, the lyric poem is privileged among the forms of literary discourse in the new criticism.

Speaker 1:          39:41          All literature is by implication a poem, but the poem is the privileged site of analysis whereby this broader statement can be made to seem reasonable. Hence the emphasis on, on the poem, um, the, the absence of the romantic word poetry, uh, is therefore not in significant poetry, is that which just sort of spills out of me. It's by spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. Nevermind that, uh, the new criticism and isn't interested in spontaneous overflows of powerful feelings. Whims sat has his little joke about drinking a pint of beer, taking a walk, you know, I mean, that's sort of the new criticism just isn't interested in those sorts of spontaneous overflow. Uh, sorry, I, I won't go there. Um, but in any case, uh, he goes, he goes on, he goes on to say, all right, if we're focused on the work of art in and of itself, on the poem, we obviously in thinking about what it means, need to come to terms with three kinds of evidence.

Speaker 1:          40:55          That is to say some things have a bearing on what it means and some things don't. What does have a bearing is language. That is to say words in the public domain, which all of us share and which we can study in order to come to terms with the exact meaning of the poem. A certain word. And this is of course, what kept you in your high school classes for so long. A certain word has five or six different meanings. Uh, the new criticism delights in showing how all five or six of those meetings do have some bearing on the meaning of the Po. That's all legitimate evidence. That is what one uses to build up the structure of the interpretation of the pond. What is not relevant is what I've mentioned already. Uh, what the author said about the palm, uh, in letters, uh, two friends, two newspapers and so on, uh, that has no relevance.

Speaker 1:          41:52          Then when's that acknowledges that there's a sort of Massey third category of evidence which has to do with language and is therefore a legitimate to a point, but also has to do with the author's idiosyncrasies. That is to say the way that author in particular use language, certain codery words, uh, a simply a private misunderstanding of certain words. Uh, uh, you know, you got to know when you're reading Whitman what he means by Comarado. You know, it's not exactly what the rest of us typically mean. Uh, when we, when we went, well, we don't use that word exactly, but, but it's what we, what we typically mean when we speak of comrades or a comradeship. Uh, there is an, in other words, the word is loaded in ways that women that would probably acknowledge need to be taken into account if we're going to understand what Whitman is up to.

Speaker 1:          42:44          Now this is very tricky. And he spends the rest of his essay talking about the murky boundaries between evidence type of evidence to which is out of play and type of evidence. Three, which may be in play but has to be dealt with in a gingerly and careful way. Um, and, but I'm more interested actually in a footnote, which arises from this argument about the idiosyncratic nature of language as a particular author may use it because the footnote says, you know what, that's just one consideration we bring to bear on the function of language and a poem. This is this footnote number 11, bottom of page 18 for eight 14 over to eight 15 is just about as devastating and counterintuitive a pronouncement as is made anywhere in our entire syllabus. I mean, you know, the, the new critics, what you would think you would find, uh, the most, the most earth shattering pronouncement, that one that anybody could ever possibly make in the new critics.

Speaker 1:          43:56          Well, look at this footnote and the history of words after a poem is written, may contribute meanings, which if relevant to the original pattern, should not be ruled out by a scruple about intention that is bold. The great creator raised his plastic arm, all right, everybody knows Aiken signed, didn't mean Paula didn't mean polymers, but now we're all into cyber borgs and we're, you know, we, we, we, we take all of this very seriously and it, and it, in a way it's a tribute to the great creator and also an of the fact that the great creator lives in the terminal moment. He's not subject to history. I mean the great creator new in the 18th century that someday plastic would mean polymer, right? And, and, and obviously that's, that's one of the, one of the divine attributes. Therefore, if the great creator chooses to raise his prosthetic limb, that is simply a way of understanding what it is like to be everything omnipotent and omniscient in the eternal moment.

Speaker 1:          45:01          In other words, if you take wind sites, 11th footnotes, seriously, that is a perfectly legitimate way. Not too ironically undermine Aiken sides line. But actually to reinforce it and to give it a kind of formal richness, which it does not otherwise have. Uh, I realized that I'm out of time. So I'll begin the next lecture by talking about a bomb of Yeats called Lapis lazily written in 1935. Uh, and which he talks about the way in which people who build up things that have been destroyed are always gay. And of course, and of course, nature doesn't mean we say invoking intention. Nature doesn't mean that they're always gay. Uh, he is using the English translation of the German word ferulic from, from a niche as the gay science. Uh, he is, uh, a, an astute and, and careful reader of Nita and in some ways elaborating on what nature says in that book, in his poem, Lapis Lazily. But beginning of the next lecture, we will do the same thing with the word gay that we've just done with the word plastic. And then we will go ahead, uh, and we will consider the SIF, Clarence Brooks and other aspects of the new criticism.
