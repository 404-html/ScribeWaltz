WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.200
Last time we introduced the way in which the preoccupation with literary and

2
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.391
other forms of theory in the 20th century is shadowed by a certain skepticism.

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.990
But as we were talking about that,

4
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.330
we actually introduced another issue which isn't,

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.320
which isn't quite the same as the issue of skepticism,

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.480
namely determinism and other words.
We said that in intellectual history,

7
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.640
first you get this movement,
uh,

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.700
of concern about the distance between the perceiver and the perceived a concern

9
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.491
that gives rise to skepticism about whether we can know things as they really

10
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.340
are.
Uh,
but then,
uh,
as a kind of,

11
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.460
as a kind of aftermath of that movement in figures like Mark's Nietzsche and

12
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.551
Freud,

13
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.450
and you'll notice that foodco reverts to such figures when he turns to the whole

14
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.790
question of founders of discursivity.

15
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.460
We'll come back to that in figures like that,
you,
you be,

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.340
you get the further question,

17
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.470
not just how we can know things in themselves as they really are,

18
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.420
but how we can trust the autonomy of that.
Which knows,

19
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
in other words,
how we can trust the autonomy of consciousness.

20
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.060
If in fact,
there's a chance,
a good chance,
according to these writers,

21
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.210
that it is in turn governed by controlled by hidden powers or forces.

22
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280
And this question of determinism a is as is as important,
uh,

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.140
in the discourse of literary theory,
uh,

24
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.610
as the question of skepticism there plainly inner interrelated in a variety of

25
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:49.250
ways.
Uh,
but it's more that question too rich.
Uh,

26
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.270
I want to return today.

27
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.850
Now last time,
uh,
following recur,

28
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.830
uh,
I mentioned Marx,

29
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.831
Nietzsche and Freud as key figures in this sort of secondary development that

30
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.710
somehow inaugurates theory.
Uh,

31
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:11.711
and then I added Darwin and it seems particularly important to think of Darwin

32
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
when we begin to think about the ways in which in the 20th century a variety of

33
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:23.430
thinkers are concerned about human agency.

34
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.260
That is to say what becomes of the idea that we have autonomy,

35
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.030
that we can act,
or at least that we can act with a sense of integrity,

36
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.680
uh,
and not just with a sense that we're being pulled,

37
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.480
uh,
by our strings,
like a puppet.
Uh,
the,
uh,

38
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.130
in the aftermath of Darwin in particular,

39
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.530
our understanding of natural selection,

40
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:51.420
our understanding of genetic hard wiring and other factors makes us begin to

41
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.421
wonder in what sense we can consider ourselves each of us to be autonomous

42
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.630
subjects.
And so,
as I say,

43
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.850
the question of agency arises and it's in that context.
Needless to say,

44
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.980
that I'd like to take a look at these two interesting pack passages on the sheet

45
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.940
that has checkoff on one side,
uh,
and James on the other.

46
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.050
Let's begin with the checkoff.
Uh,
the Cherry Orchard,
you know,

47
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.840
is about the,
a threat,
uh,

48
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:25.120
owing to socioeconomic conditions,

49
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:30.121
the conditions that do ultimately lead to the Menshevik revolution of 1907 to a

50
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.730
landed estate,
uh,
and the perturbation and turmoil,

51
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.770
uh,
into what's the cast of characters is thrown by this threat.

52
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.120
Now,
one of the more interesting characters who's not really a protagonist in the

53
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.080
play for class reasons is a house servant named,

54
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.130
you'll pick it off.

55
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.110
And if triggered off is a character who is among other things that kind of

56
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.080
autodidact,
that is to say he has scrambled in,
uh,

57
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.420
to a certain measure of knowledge about things.
Uh,

58
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.470
he is full of a kind of understandable self pity.
And,

59
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.950
uh,
his,
uh,
speeches,
uh,

60
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.951
are in some ways more characteristic of the gloomy,

61
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.340
intellectual [inaudible] that is reflected in checkoffs text really than almost

62
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.270
anyone else's.
And I wanted up to quote to you a couple of them.
Uh,

63
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.790
toward the bottom of the first page,
he says,
well,
I'm a cultivated man.

64
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.050
I read all kinds of remarkable books,

65
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.770
and yet I can never make out what direction I should take,

66
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.180
what it is that I want properly speaking.
And as I read,

67
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.330
pay attention to the degree to which he's constantly talking about language and

68
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:53.170
about the way in which he himself is inserted into language.

69
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:57.760
He's perpetually seeking a mode of properly speaking.
Uh,

70
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.880
he is a person who is,
uh,
uh,
uh,

71
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.730
somewhat knowledgeable about books,

72
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:08.590
feels himself somehow to be caught up in the Matrix of book learning.

73
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.090
Uh,
in other words,

74
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.180
a person who is very much preoccupied with his conditioning by language,

75
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.480
uh,
not least,
when perhaps unwittingly,

76
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.040
he alludes to handle it.

77
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.520
Should I live or should I shoot myself properly speaking to be or not to be?

78
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:28.391
In other words,

79
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:32.410
he inserts himself into the dramatic tradition to which as a character,

80
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:37.210
he himself belongs,
uh,
and shows himself to be,
uh,

81
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.300
in a debased form derived from one of those famous charismatic moments in which

82
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:49.750
a hero utters a comparable concern.
Uh,
and so,

83
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.690
and all sorts of ways in this simple passage,

84
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.680
we find a character who's caught up in the snare,
if I can put it that way,

85
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.300
caught up in the snare of language,
uh,
to continue,

86
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.390
uh,
in the,
uh,
he says,
uh,

87
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.790
properly speaking top of the next page,

88
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.570
properly speaking and letting others subjects alone,

89
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.720
I must say everything in terms of what other discourse does and what he himself

90
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.530
can say,
I must say.
And of course,

91
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.770
it's mainly about me regarding myself,

92
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.860
among other things that fate treats me mercilessly as a storm treats a small

93
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.630
boat.
The end of the passage is,
is have you ever add buckle?

94
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.780
Now buckle is a forgotten name today,

95
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.790
but at one time he was just about as famous as awesome us faults Spangler who

96
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.630
wrote the decline of the West.
He was a Victorian historian,

97
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.520
preoccupied with the dissolution of Western civilization.

98
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.480
In other words,

99
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.480
buckle was the Avatar of the notion in the late 19th century that everything was

100
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.890
going to hell in a handbasket.
Uh,

101
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.270
the one of the texts that you pick it off has read that in a certain sense

102
00:07:05.271 --> 00:07:10.160
determines him.
Uh,
is buckle.
Have you read buckle?

103
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.550
I wish to have a word with you of Dorchester fueled or often in other words,

104
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.150
uh,

105
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.150
I'm arguing that the saturation of these speeches with signs of words,

106
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.250
language,
speaking words,
books,

107
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.730
is just the dilemma of the character.

108
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
That is to say he is in a certain sense book and language determined and he's

109
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.850
obscurely aware that this is his problem,

110
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.030
even as it's a source of pride for him.

111
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.110
Turning then to a passage in a very different tone from James's ambassadors and

112
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:54.440
altogether charming character,
the elderly Lambert stressor,

113
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.470
who has gone to most of you know,

114
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.620
has gone to Paris to bring home the young Chad Newsome or relative who's to take

115
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.810
over the family business,
uh,

116
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.310
the manufacturer of an unnamed household article in it,

117
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.970
Massachusetts,
probably toilet paper in any case.

118
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.420
Lambert stressor as he arrives in Paris,
uh,

119
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:22.421
has awakened to the sheer wonder of urbane culture.

120
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.220
And he's rent and he recognizes that he's missed something and he's gone to a,

121
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.320
to a party given by a sculptor.

122
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.560
And at this party he meets a young man named Little Bilam whom he likes and he

123
00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:41.030
takes little bill 'em aside by the Lapel,
uh,
and he makes a long speech to him,

124
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.960
uh,
in effect saying,
don't do what I have done.

125
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.280
Don't miss out on life.
Live all you can.

126
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.800
It is a mistake not to.

127
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.400
And this is why he goes on to say the affair.

128
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.290
I mean the affair of life.

129
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:03.030
It's as though he's anticipating the affair of Shad Newsome and not I'm the VNA,

130
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.840
which has revealed at the end of the text the the,
the affair.

131
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.120
I mean the affair of life couldn't,

132
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:14.130
no doubt have been different for me for it,
it meaning life.

133
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.540
Life is at the best.
Our Tin Mold,

134
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:24.170
either fluted or embossed with ornamental excrescence is or else smooth and

135
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.690
dreadfully plane into which a helpless Jelly one's consciousness is poured.

136
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.880
So that one takes the form as the great cook says,
Great Cook by the way,

137
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:43.290
it's Briana Sat,
alright.
One takes the form as the great cook says,

138
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.040
that is more or less compactly held by it.

139
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.300
One lives in fine as one can still.

140
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.780
One has the illusion of freedom and here's where stressors says something very

141
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.110
clever that I think we can make use of.
He says,

142
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.260
therefore don't be like me without the memory of that illusion.

143
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.660
I was either at the right time,

144
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.460
too stupid or too intelligent to have it.

145
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.480
I don't quite know which.
Now,

146
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.400
if it was too stupid to have it,

147
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.740
then of course he would have been liberated into the realm of action.

148
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.630
He would have been what Nisha and an interesting precursor text calls historical

149
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.350
man.

150
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.350
He simply would have plunged ahead into life as though he had freedom even

151
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.050
though he was too stupid.
That it was to recognize that it was an illusion.

152
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.640
On the other hand,

153
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.110
if he was too intelligent to as it were,

154
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:53.970
Barry the illusion and live as though he were free,

155
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.370
if he was too intelligent to do that.

156
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.810
He's a kind of an Avatar of the literary theorist and other words,

157
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.900
the sort of person who can't forget long enough that freedom is an,

158
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:12.300
is an illusion in order to get away from the preoccupations that as I've been

159
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:13.494
saying,
uh,

160
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500
characterized a certain kind of thinking in the 20th century and it's rather

161
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:23.160
charming at the last that he says,
because how can we know anything?

162
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.040
I don't quite know which.

163
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.250
And so that two strikes me as a helpful and also characteristic passage that can

164
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.040
introduce us to today's subject,
which is the loss of authority.

165
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.070
That is to say in roller inbox terms,

166
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:45.030
the death of the author in food coast terms,
the question,

167
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.450
what is an author?
In other words,

168
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.170
the first sacrifice in the absence of human agency,

169
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.130
the sacrifice for literary theory is the author,

170
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.350
the idea of the author.

171
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.590
And that's what we'll concern us in this second still introductory lecture to

172
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:07.890
this course.
We'll get into the proper,
uh,
or,

173
00:12:07.891 --> 00:12:11.470
or at least more systematic business of the course.
Uh,
uh,

174
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.760
when we turned to Hermeneutics next week,
now let me,

175
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.740
let me set the scene.
This is parents wouldn't have to be Paris,

176
00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:25.240
it could be Berkeley or Columbia or maybe Berlin.
It's 68,

177
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:30.241
69 spilling over into the 70s students and most of their professors are on the

178
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:38.680
barricades.
That is to say in the aft,
in,
in,
in,
in protest,

179
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.780
not only against the war in Vietnam,

180
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:45.781
but the outpouring of various forms of authoritative resistance to protest that

181
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.670
characterized the 60s.

182
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.510
There is a ferment of intellectual revolt which takes all sorts of forms in

183
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:04.171
Paris but is first and foremost perhaps organized by what quickly in this

184
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:10.150
country became a bumper sticker question authority.

185
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:16.020
This is the framework in which the then most prominent intellectual and France

186
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.720
writes an essay at the very peak of the student uprising.

187
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.000
What is an author and poses and answer,

188
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:33.130
which is by no means straight forward and simple.

189
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:36.790
You're probably a little frustrated because maybe you sort of anticipated what

190
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:39.760
he was going to say and then you read it and you said,
Jay,

191
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:43.640
he really isn't the saying that in fact,
I don't quite know what it is saying.
Uh,

192
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.650
and,
and,
and struggled more than you expected to,
uh,

193
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:51.850
because you anticipated what I've just been saying about the setting and about

194
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:56.851
the role of Fuko and all the rest of it and were possibly more confused than you

195
00:13:56.861 --> 00:14:01.450
might have expected to be.
And yet at the same time you probably felt,
oh yeah.

196
00:14:01.451 --> 00:14:01.661
Well,

197
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:06.370
I did come out pretty much in the place I expected to come out in despite the

198
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:11.371
roundabout way of having gotten there because this lecture is introductory.

199
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.880
I'm not going to spend a great deal of time explicating the more difficult

200
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:18.220
moments,
uh,
in his argument,
uh,

201
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:23.221
I am going to emphasize what you perhaps did anticipate that he would say.

202
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.680
Uh,
and so that can take us along rather smoothly.

203
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.040
There is an initial issue and because we're a skeptical about skepticism as we

204
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:37.750
are about anything else,
we're likely to raise our eyebrows and say,

205
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.510
doesn't this guy full co think he's an author?
You know,
I mean,
after all,

206
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:46.560
he's a superstar.
He's a,
you know,
he,
he,
he,

207
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.000
he's used to being taken very seriously.

208
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.910
Does he want to say that he's just an author function,

209
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:58.300
that his textual field as a kind of set of structural operations within which

210
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:03.320
one can discover an author?
Does he really want to say this?
Well,

211
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:08.321
this is the question raised by the skeptic about skepticism or about theory and

212
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:11.360
it's one that we're going to take rather seriously,

213
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.970
but we're going to come back to it because there are ways,

214
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:18.410
it seems to me of keeping this question at arm's length.
In other words,

215
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:23.090
Fuko is up to something interesting and probably we should meet him at least

216
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:27.140
halfway to see,
to measure the degree of interest.

217
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.520
And so yes there is the question,
there is the,

218
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:36.260
there is the fact that stands before us that this very authoritative sounding

219
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:39.470
person seems to be an author,
right?
Mean never,

220
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.600
never met anybody who seemed more like an author then then,
then this person,
uh,

221
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:49.220
and yet he's raising the question whether there is any such thing or in any case

222
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.360
the question how difficult it is to decide what it is if there is.

223
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.680
And so let me digress with an anecdote,

224
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:02.681
which may or may not sort of help us to understand the delicacy of this

225
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:06.830
relationship between a star author,
a person,

226
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:08.630
undeniably a star author,

227
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.190
and the atmosphere of thought in which there is in a certain sense,

228
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:18.170
no such thing as an author and old crony and former colleague of mine,
uh,

229
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.640
was taking a course at Johns Hopkins in the 1960s.

230
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:27.820
This was a time when Hopkins led all American universities in the importing a

231
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.260
important European scholars.
Uh,

232
00:16:32.261 --> 00:16:35.450
and it was a place of remarkable intellectual ferment.

233
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.720
And this particular lecture course was being given by George Palais,

234
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.330
uh,
of,
uh,
so-called phenomenological critic.
That's one of the,

235
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.470
it's one of the Isms we aren't covering in this seminar.
But in any case,

236
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.480
Fulic Pula was also a central figure on the scene of the 60s and pull.

237
00:16:54.661 --> 00:16:58.660
I would be lecturing along and there's the students had some are formed the

238
00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:00.920
habit of from time to time.
By the way,

239
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:04.370
you can form this habit too of raising their hand.

240
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.190
And what they would do is they would utter a name,

241
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.230
at least this is what my friend noticed.

242
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.300
They would raise their hand and they would say Malarne May and Palais would look

243
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:19.040
at them and say,
maybe we exact the mall,
Moma I monavie it's,
yeah,

244
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.870
yeah.
And then he would go on.
He would,
he would go on and,

245
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.450
and continue to lecture for a while and somebody else would raise his hand and

246
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:30.860
say,
boost.
Ah,
I sees him off Pat Lacey,

247
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.000
Bruce Proust.
And then,
you know,
he'd continue along.

248
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.060
So my friend decided he,
he'd give it a try

249
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.500
and he raised his hand and he said,

250
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.140
Voltaire and pull this quad the whole

251
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.823
call.

252
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.760
And then paused and hesitated and continued with his lecture as though my friend

253
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:57.320
had never asked his question.
Now this is a,

254
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.620
this is a ritual of introducing names,
but,

255
00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:06.120
and in a certain sense,
yes,
the names of authors,
the names of stars,

256
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.190
but at the same time,

257
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:13.191
plainly names that stand for something other than their mere name,

258
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.620
names that stand for domains or fields of interesting discursivity.

259
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.630
That is to say,
I mean,
pooky,
Pele was the kind of critic who,

260
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:29.750
who believed that the oeuvre of an author was a totality that could be

261
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:34.380
understood as a structural hole and his criticism work that way.

262
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.630
And so,
yes,
the,

263
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.660
the signal that this field of discursivity is on the table is introduced by the

264
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:47.280
name of the author,
but it remains just a name.

265
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.730
It's an author without authority simply at yet at the same time,

266
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.660
it's an author who stands for,

267
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.980
whose name stands for an important field of discourse.

268
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.960
And that's of course what my friend,

269
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:08.640
because he knew perfectly well that when he said Voltaire Boulay would have

270
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.330
nothing to do with it.
Uh,
that,
that's,
that's the,

271
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.670
that's the idea that my friend wanted to experiment with you.

272
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.010
There are relevant and interesting fields of discourse and there are completely

273
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.000
irrelevant fields of discourse.
And,
uh,

274
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.040
some of these fields are on the sides of angelic discourse and some of these

275
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:31.630
fields are on the side of the demonic,
uh,
and so,
and,

276
00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:36.631
and we simply kind of spontaneously make the division discursivity discourse.

277
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.090
That's what I forgot to talk about last time when I said that.

278
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.670
Sometimes people just ultimately throw up their hands when they tried to define

279
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.980
literature,
uh,
and say,
well,
literatures,

280
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:54.810
just whatever you say it is,
I'm fine.
Let's just go ahead.
Uh,

281
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.220
are much more likely,

282
00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:01.310
rather than using the word literature to use the word discourse or textual

283
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:05.820
field,
uh,

284
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.490
discursivity you begin to hear the slight or,

285
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.190
or perhaps smell the slight whiff of jargon,
uh,

286
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.760
that pervades theoretical writing.
It always does.
So for a reason,

287
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.300
uh,

288
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.220
this is the reason one hear so much about discourse simply because the day of

289
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:28.221
doubt about the generic integrity of various forms of discourse.

290
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:33.720
One can speak hesitantly of literary discourse,
political discourse,

291
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.970
uh,
anthropological discourse.

292
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.380
But one doesn't want to go so far as to say,
literature,

293
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.190
political science,
anthropology.
And so it's,

294
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.320
it's a habit that arises from the sense of the permeability of all forms of

295
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:55.060
utterance with respect to each other.
Uh,
and that habit,

296
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.950
uh,
as I say,
is a kind of,

297
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:02.030
is a breakdown of the notion that certain forms of utterance can be understood

298
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.630
as a d limited structured field.

299
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.960
And one of the reasons this understanding seems so problematic is the idea that

300
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:18.811
we don't appeal to the authority of an author in making our mind about the

301
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:22.750
nature of a given field of discourse.

302
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.870
We find the authority of the author instead somewhere within the textual

303
00:21:29.471 --> 00:21:30.370
experience,

304
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.380
the author is a signal is what Fuko calls a function.

305
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.450
The author certainly appeared by the way,

306
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.200
this isn't at all a question of the author not existing.
Yes,

307
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.320
back talks about the death of the author,
but he doesn't.

308
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.580
But even Bach doesn't mean that the author is dead like nature's God.

309
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.830
They are there.
Is there,
sure,

310
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:56.160
it's a question rather of how we know the author to be there at firstly and

311
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:58.324
secondly,

312
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:03.330
whether or not in attempting to determine the meaning of the attack of a text.

313
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:05.500
And this is something we'll be talking about next week.

314
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.520
We should appeal to the authority of an author.

315
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.890
If the author is a function,
that function is something that appears,

316
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.510
perhaps problematically,

317
00:22:16.511 --> 00:22:20.410
appears within the experience of the text.

318
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.420
Something we get in terms of the speaker,
the narrator,

319
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.020
or in the case of place,
the orchestrator of the text,

320
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:33.340
something that we infer from the way the text unfolds.

321
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.970
So as a function and not as a subjective consciousness to which we appeal to

322
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:46.000
grasp a meaning,
the author still does exist.

323
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.690
So we consider a text as a structured entity or perhaps as an entity which is

324
00:22:52.601 --> 00:22:56.620
structured and yet at the same time somehow or another passes out of structure.

325
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.050
Uh,

326
00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:02.050
that's the case where Roland backed and in so doing and here I want to appeal to

327
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:05.090
a couple of passages.
I want to be,
I want to have,

328
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.880
I want to quote from the beginning of roll on backs essay,

329
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.450
which I know I only suggested,

330
00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:14.000
but I'm simply going to quote the passage so you don't have to have read it.
Uh,

331
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.870
the death of the author.
It's on page eight 74.

332
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.060
Those of you who have your text as I hope you do

333
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.550
box get birthed is while writing this,

334
00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:29.551
he's writing what has perhaps in retrospect seem to be his most important book.

335
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.770
It's called s z.
It's a huge book,

336
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:37.360
which is all about this short story by Balzac Sakae seen,

337
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.960
uh,
that he begins this essay by quoting,

338
00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.410
and this is what he says about,
sorry.

339
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:48.430
Seen in his stories are seen Balzac describing a Castrato disguised as a woman

340
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.620
writes the following sentence.

341
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:57.110
This was woman herself with her sudden fears her irrational whims,

342
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.990
her instinctive worries,
her imperious boldness,

343
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.080
her fussings and her delicious sensibility and quote box as who is speaking.

344
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:12.160
Thus is that the hero of the story bent on remaining ignorant of the Castrato

345
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.720
hidden beneath the woman?

346
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:20.470
Is it Balzac the individual furnished by his personal experience with a

347
00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:23.060
philosophy of woman?

348
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.990
Is it Balzac the author professing literary ideas on femininity?

349
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.540
Is it universal wisdom,
romantic psychology?

350
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:41.770
We shall never know for the good reason that writing is the destruction of every

351
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:46.910
voice of every point of origin.

352
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.570
Writing is that neutral composite or bleak space where our subject,

353
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.030
and this is a deliberate pawn,

354
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.450
our subject slips away our subject meaning that we don't quite know what's being

355
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:06.530
talked about sometime but also and more importantly thus subject the authorial

356
00:25:06.531 --> 00:25:07.364
subject,

357
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:12.320
the actual identity of the given speaking subject.

358
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.800
That's what slips away the negative where all identity is lost starting with the

359
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:22.970
very identity of the body writing.

360
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.180
So that's a shot fired across the bow against the author,
uh,

361
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.650
because it's box up position that we really,

362
00:25:30.651 --> 00:25:35.120
it's that the author isn't maybe quite a an author function because that that

363
00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:40.121
function may be hard to identify in a discreet way among a myriad other

364
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:41.744
functions.

365
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:47.230
Food Co who I think does take for granted that a textual field is more firmly

366
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:50.264
structured.

367
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:55.430
Then backed supposes full code says on page nine 13

368
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:06.170
when we speak of the author function as opposed to the author.

369
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.200
And here I began quoting a at the bottom of the left hand column on page nine 13

370
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.080
when we speak in this way,
we no longer raise the questions.

371
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.230
How can have free subject penetrate the substance of things and give it meaning,

372
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.800
how can it activate the rules of a language from within and thus give rise to

373
00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:31.280
the designs which are properly on its own?
In other words,

374
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.720
we no longer say,

375
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.840
how does the author exert autonomous will with respect to the subject matter

376
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.850
being expressed.
We no longer appeal.
In other words,

377
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.940
to the authority of the author as the source of the meaning that we find in the

378
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:53.430
text Fuko continues.

379
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.960
Instead these questions will be raised how,

380
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:03.170
under what conditions and in what forms can something like a subject appear in

381
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:06.000
the order of discourse.

382
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:10.230
What plays can an occupy in each type of discourse,

383
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:15.470
what functions Canada assume and by obeying what rules.

384
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:20.340
In short,
it is a matter of depriving the subject.
That is to say,

385
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:22.920
when we speak in this way of an author function,

386
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.100
it is a matter of depriving the subject or it's substitute a character for

387
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:31.230
example,
or a speaker,
as we say,

388
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:35.430
when we don't mean that it's the poet talking.
But,
uh,

389
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.510
the guy speaking in my last duchess or whatever,
right?
It's role.

390
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:44.570
So we have depriving the subject or it's substitute of its role as originator

391
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.980
and of analyzing the subject as a variable and complex function of discourse.

392
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.660
The subject here always means the subjectivity of the speaker,

393
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.380
right?
Not,
not the subject matter that's you'll get,

394
00:28:01.381 --> 00:28:04.920
you'll get used to it because it's a word that does a lot of duty.
Uh,

395
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:09.060
and you need to develop context in which you're recognizing,
wow,
yeah,

396
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:11.130
I'm talking about the human subject or well,

397
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:14.010
I'm talking about the subject matter.
Uh,
but uh,

398
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:18.860
I trust that you will quickly kind of,
uh,
uh,
adjust to,
to,

399
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:21.330
to that difficulty.
All right,

400
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.120
so with us said,

401
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.400
probably it's time to say something in defense of the author.
I mean,

402
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:33.900
I know that you wish you could stand up here and say something in defense as the

403
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:34.291
author.

404
00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:39.291
So I will speak in behalf of all of you who want to defend the author by quoting

405
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.600
a wonderful passage from Samuel Johnson's preface to Shakespeare in which he

406
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:50.601
explains for us why it is that we have always paid homage to the authority of

407
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.124
the author.

408
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:58.230
It's not just a question as obviously Fuko and bark or I was suggesting of

409
00:28:58.231 --> 00:29:03.060
deferring to authority as though the authority where the police with a baton in

410
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:04.140
his hand,
right?

411
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:09.380
It's not a question of deferring to authority in that sense it's,
it's,

412
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:14.390
it's a question rather of affirming what we call the human spirit and this is

413
00:29:15.751 --> 00:29:17.220
what Johnson says,

414
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.850
there is always a silent reference of human works to human abilities

415
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.590
and as the inquiry,

416
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.800
how far man may extend his designs or how high he may rate his native force is a

417
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:34.770
far greater dignity.

418
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.900
Then in what rank we shall place any particular performance.

419
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:45.530
Curiosity is always busy to discover the instruments as well as to survey the

420
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:47.374
workmanship,

421
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.620
to know how much is to be a scribe to original powers and how much to casual and

422
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:58.390
adventitious help.
So what Johnson is saying as well,

423
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:01.780
it's all very well to consider a textual feel the workmanship,

424
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:07.140
but at the same time we want to remind ourselves of our worth.

425
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:11.470
We want to say,
well,
Gee,
it's not just sort of,

426
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:16.060
that wasn't produced by a machine that was,
that's not just a set of functions.

427
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:18.400
Variables as one might say in the lab.

428
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.680
It's produced by genius.
It's Pr.
It's,

429
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:27.700
it's something that allows us to rate human ability high and that,

430
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.920
especially in this veil of tears and Johnson is very conscious of this being a

431
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:35.470
veil of tears.
That's what we want to keep doing.

432
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.630
We want to rate human potential as high as we can,

433
00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:44.800
and it is for that reason in a completely different spirit and the spirit of

434
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:49.830
homage rather than cringing fear that we appeal to the authority of an officer.

435
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.300
Well,
all right.
That's an argument for the other side,

436
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.880
but these are different times.

437
00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.420
This is 69 and the reason,

438
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.480
the purpose that's alleged for appealing to the author as a paternal source,

439
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:13.470
as an authority is according to both back and Fuko to police the way texts are

440
00:31:16.121 --> 00:31:17.500
read.
In other words,

441
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:22.501
both of them and c'est that the appeal to the author as opposed to the

442
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:28.060
submersion of the author and the functionality of the textual field,

443
00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:33.510
that the appeal to the author is a kind of de limitation or policing of the

444
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:38.020
possibilities of meaning.

445
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.800
Let me just read to text to that effect.
First,

446
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:45.700
going back to Roland embarked a on page eight 77

447
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.360
<v 1>right</v>

448
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.390
<v 0>mocked,
says once the author is removed,</v>

449
00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:00.670
the claim to decipher a text becomes quite futile.

450
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.300
By the way,
once again,
there's a bit of a riff there between backed and Fuko.

451
00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:08.290
Fuko wouldn't say quite futile,
he'd say,
oh no,
we can decipher it,

452
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:12.250
but the author function is just one aspect of the deciphering process.

453
00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.810
But bark has entered a phase of his career in which you actually think that

454
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.250
structures are so complex that they cease to be structures and that week and,

455
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:21.790
and,
and,

456
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:26.290
and that this has a great deal to do with the influence of deconstruction.

457
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:30.550
And we'll come back to that much later in the courts.
But in any case,

458
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.640
he continues to together a text and author is to impose a limit on that text to

459
00:32:37.721 --> 00:32:42.320
furnish it with a final signified to close the writing.

460
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.810
Such a conception suits,
criticism and criticism is a lot like policing,

461
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:51.830
right?
Criticism mean being a critic,
you know,
criticizing such a,

462
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:54.950
such a solution suits criticism very well.

463
00:32:55.310 --> 00:33:00.310
The ladder then allotting itself the important task of discovering the author or

464
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:07.400
it's hypotheses,
society,
history,
Psyche,
liberty,
beneath the work.

465
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.470
When the author has been found,

466
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:14.180
the text is explained a victory to the critic.
In other words,

467
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.300
the policing of meaning has been accomplished and the critic wins just as in the

468
00:33:20.751 --> 00:33:25.100
uprisings of the late sixties.
The cops when,
and this is,
you know,

469
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.080
again the atmosphere,
uh,
in which all of this,
all of this occurs.

470
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.000
Uh,
just then to reinforce this,
uh,
with the,
uh,

471
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.660
with,
with,

472
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.660
with the pronouncement of Fuko at the bottom of page nine 13 right hand column,

473
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.380
the author is the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we

474
00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:53.090
fear the proliferation of meaning.

475
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.580
Now this May I once again,
I mean you sort of the skepticism,

476
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:01.670
skepticism and you and says,
why should I fear the proliferation of meaning?

477
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.250
I want to know what something definitely means.

478
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.040
I don't want to know that it means a million things.
You know,

479
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.520
I'm here to learn what things mean in so many words.

480
00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:13.740
I don't want to be told that I could sit here for the rest of my life.

481
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.330
Just sort of parsing one sentence.
Don't tell me about that.

482
00:34:17.331 --> 00:34:22.040
Don't tell me about these,
these complicated sentences from Balzac short story.

483
00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:27.110
I'm here to know what things mean.
I don't care if it's policing or not.

484
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.500
Uh,
whatever it is,
let's get it done.
And that if that,

485
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:34.170
of course is approaching the question of how we might,
uh,

486
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:38.950
delimit meaning in a very different spirit,
there isn't,
uh,

487
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.160
I acknowledge they,
the,

488
00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:47.190
the legitimacy of responding in this way is that to a certain extent,

489
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.770
the preoccupation with what shall we say,

490
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:56.771
the misuse of the appeal to an author is very much of its historical moment.

491
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.650
That is to say when,
uh,

492
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:05.690
one can scarcely say the word author without thinking authority.

493
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:10.730
And one can definitely never say the word authority without thinking about the

494
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:15.230
police.
This is a,
they know this,
this,
this is a structure of thought,
um,

495
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.550
that perhaps pervades the lives of many of us to this day has always the

496
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.830
pervaded the lives of many people,

497
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:26.950
but it's not quite as hedge amount hedge demonic in our thinking today perhaps,

498
00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:32.450
uh,
as it was in the moment of these essays by barked,

499
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:36.980
uh,
and,
and Fuko.
All right.
With all this said,

500
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.680
how can the theorist recuperate honor for a certain names like for example,

501
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.700
his own,
all right.
It's all very,
well,
you're not an author,

502
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.670
but I secretly think I'm an author,
right?
Huh?
Let's,

503
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.650
let's suppose someone where dastardly enough,
uh,

504
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.750
to a harbor such thoughts,
uh,
how could you develop an argument?

505
00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:04.890
How could you develop an argument in which a thought like that might actually

506
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:09.870
seem to work after all Fuko setting himself aside.

507
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.370
He doesn't mention himself.

508
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:16.080
Fuko very much admires certain writers in particular.

509
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.130
He admires like so many of his generation and other generations,

510
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:24.870
Marx and Freud,
it's a problem.
It's a problem.

511
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.140
If we reject the police,

512
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.200
like authority of authors of who we may have a certain suspicion on those

513
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:37.950
grounds.
Well we certainly don't feel that way about Marx and Freud.

514
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.660
What's the difference then?

515
00:36:39.661 --> 00:36:44.290
How is Fuko going tomorrow to mount an argument,
uh,

516
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:49.370
in which privileged authors that is to say figures who won sites positively and

517
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:53.550
without a sense of being policed,

518
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:58.770
can somehow or another stay in the picture?
Fuko by the way,

519
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:01.770
it doesn't mention niche of it.
He might very well because niches,

520
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:06.660
idea of genealogy is perhaps the central influence on food co's work.

521
00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.610
Uh,
I think it's frankly,

522
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:11.700
I think it's just an accident that he doesn't mention him would have been a

523
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:15.090
perfect symmetry because last time we quoted,
uh,

524
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.410
Paul Ricoeur to the effect that these authors,
Marx,

525
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:23.730
Nietzsche and Freud were,
and this is Rico recurs word masters.

526
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.640
Whoa.
That's the last thing we want to hear.

527
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.820
You know that they're not masters food Fuko couldn't possibly allow for that

528
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.380
because plainly the whole,

529
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.820
the whole texture of the discourse would be undermined by introducing the notion

530
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:43.821
that it's okay to be a master and yet Ricker fields that these figures dominate

531
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:49.590
modern thought as masters.
How does Fuko deal with this?

532
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:51.840
He invents a concept.

533
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.600
He says there aren't authors,

534
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.860
they're founders of discursivity,

535
00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.450
founders of discursivity.
And then he says it's kind of,

536
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:08.130
he grants that it's kind of difficult to distinguish between a founder of

537
00:38:08.131 --> 00:38:11.970
discursivity and an author who has had an important influence,
right?

538
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.860
And then he talks about the gothic novel and he talks about Radcliffe's Anne

539
00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:19.020
Radcliffe's.
God,
he's wrong about this.
By the way,

540
00:38:19.021 --> 00:38:22.160
the founder of discursivity and gothic novel is not an radically,

541
00:38:22.161 --> 00:38:25.260
if it's Horace Walpole,
that's okay.
Um,
he talks,

542
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.470
he talks about an Radcliffe,
uh,

543
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.560
as the person who establishes certain tropes and tope boy and premises,

544
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.410
uh,

545
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:40.030
that govern the writing of gothic fiction for the next hundred years and indeed

546
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:45.031
even into the present so that she is Fuko acknowledges in a certain sense,

547
00:38:45.371 --> 00:38:49.990
a person who establishes a way of talking,
a way of writing away of narrating,

548
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:55.300
but at the same time,
she,
she isn't a person Fuko claims,

549
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.040
uh,
who is,

550
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:02.100
who introduces a discourse or sphere of debate within which ideas without being

551
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.960
attributable necessarily can nevertheless be developed.

552
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.150
Well,
I don't know.
It seems to me that literary influences not at all unlike,

553
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.170
uh,

554
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:21.760
so speaking or writing in the wake of a founder of discursivity,

555
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.400
but we can let that pass.
And on the other hand,

556
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:28.300
Foodco is very concerned to distinguish figures like this from scientists like

557
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.570
Galileo and Newton.
Now,
it is interesting,
by the way,

558
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:36.240
maybe in defensive Foodco that whereas we speak of people as Marxist or

559
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:37.083
Freudian,

560
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.480
we don't speak of people as red cliff in or Galilean or Newtonian.

561
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:45.700
I mean we use the adjective Newtonian,

562
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:48.700
but we don't speak of certain writers who were still interested in quantum

563
00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:53.470
mechanics as Newtonian writers.
Uh,
and that's interesting in a way.

564
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.730
Uh,
and,
and,

565
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:59.731
and may somehow or another justify who goes understanding that the texts of

566
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:06.630
those author functions known as Marx and Freud whose names might be raised in

567
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:10.310
Pula,
his lecture class,
uh,

568
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.360
with an enthusiastic response as place holders for those fields of discourse.

569
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.900
It made it made in some sense,

570
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:24.901
reinforced Fuckos argument that these are special inaugurations of debate of

571
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:32.611
developing thought that do not necessarily kowtow to the originary figure.

572
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.490
Certainly debatable.
I mean,
we don't,
we don't want to pause over it,
uh,

573
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.730
in the case either of marks or of Freud.
Plainly,

574
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:47.230
there are great many people who think of them as tyrants,
right?
But it is,
but,

575
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.590
but within the traditions that they established,

576
00:40:50.591 --> 00:40:55.591
it is very possible to understand them as instigating ways of thinking without

577
00:40:57.551 --> 00:41:02.530
necessarily provide presiding over those ways of thinking authoritatively.

578
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.830
And that is the special category that Fuko wants to reserve for those privileged

579
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:14.230
figures,
whom he calls founders of discursivity.
All right.

580
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.360
Very quickly.
Then to conclude,
one consequence of the author,

581
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.980
the death of the author,

582
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.040
the disappearance of the author into author function is as Fuko curiously says

583
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.740
in passing on page nine oh seven,

584
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.070
that the author has no legal status and you say what?

585
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.950
What about copyright?
What about intellectual property?

586
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:40.910
That's a horrible thing to say that the author has no legal status.

587
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.210
Notice once again,
the intellectual context,

588
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.650
it is a copyright arose as a bourgeois idea.

589
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.770
That is to say,
I possess my writing.

590
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.550
I have an ownership relationship with my writing,

591
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.690
the disappearance of the author,
like the disappearance of a,

592
00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:04.280
a kind of corollary,
corollary disappearance of borzois thought,

593
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.050
um,
and tails.

594
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:11.051
In fact a kind of bracketing of the idea of copyright or intellectual property.

595
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.900
And so there's a certain consistency in what Fuko is saying about the author

596
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.970
having no legal status.

597
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.530
But maybe at this point it really is time to dig in our heels.

598
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.550
I am a lesbian Latina.

599
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.710
I stand before you as an author.

600
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:35.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

601
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:40.860
<v 0>Articulating and identity for the purpose of achieving freedom.</v>

602
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:43.080
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

603
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.670
<v 0>Not to police you,
not to deny your freedom,</v>

604
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.120
but to find my own freedom.

605
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:57.660
And I stand before you precisely and in pride as an author,

606
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.690
I don't want to be called an author function.

607
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:07.150
I know how to be called an instrument of something larger than myself because

608
00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:09.100
frankly,
that's what I've always been

609
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:16.270
and I want precisely as an authority through my authorship to remind you that I

610
00:43:19.641 --> 00:43:21.770
am not anybody's instrument,

611
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.510
but that I am autonomous and free.
In other words,

612
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.430
the author,
the idea,

613
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:33.431
the traditional idea of the authors so much under suspicion and the work of Fuko

614
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:35.150
and back in the late sixties,

615
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.950
the traditional idea of the author can be turned on its ear.

616
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:45.550
It can be understood as a source of new found authority of the freedom of one

617
00:43:49.311 --> 00:43:54.311
who has been characteristically not free and can be received by a reading

618
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:58.520
community.
In those terms,

619
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
it's very difficult to think how a food co might respond to that insistence.

620
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.250
And it's a problem that in a way,
dogs,
everything.

621
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:12.730
Many of the things we're going to be reading,
uh,

622
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.480
during the course of the semester,

623
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:19.610
even within the sorts of theorizing that are characteristically called cultural

624
00:44:19.611 --> 00:44:24.260
studies and concern questions of I have the politics of identity.

625
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.830
Even within those disciplines there is a division of thought between people who

626
00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:35.900
affirm the autonomous integrity and individuality of the identity in question

627
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.840
and those who say any and all identities are only subject positions discernible

628
00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:52.290
and revealed through the Matrix of social practices.

629
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:58.550
There is this intrinsic split even within those forms of theory and not to

630
00:44:58.771 --> 00:45:03.000
mention the kinds of theory that don't directly have to do with the politics of

631
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:08.001
identity between those it for whom what's at stake is the discovery of

632
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:14.871
autonomous individuality and those for whom what's at stake is the tendency to

633
00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:20.490
hold at arm's length such discoveries,
uh,

634
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:25.550
over against the idea that the instability of any and all subject positions is

635
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:30.870
what actually contains within it as Fuko embark thought,

636
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:35.490
as they sort of sat looking at the police standing over against them.

637
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.601
That's it.

638
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:41.601
That this alternative notion of the undermining of any sense of that which is

639
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:43.620
authoritative,
uh,

640
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.680
is in its turn a possible source finally of freedom and these sorts of vexing

641
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.060
issues,
as I say,
in all sorts of ways,

642
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.010
we'll dog much of what we read during the course of the semester.
All right,

643
00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:02.160
so much for the introductory lectures,
uh,

644
00:46:02.161 --> 00:46:07.161
which touch on aspects of the materials that will keep returning to on Tuesday,

645
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:14.700
we'll turn to a more specific subject matter.
Hermeneutics,
what hermeneutics is,

646
00:46:14.701 --> 00:46:19.590
how we can think about the nature of interpretation and our primary text will be

647
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.960
the excerpt in your book from Hans.

648
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:26.961
Gail got Amar and a few passages that I'll be handing out from Martin Heidegger

649
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:28.890
and Ed Hirsch.
