1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.330
No,
I don't think it's ever happened to me before,
although it might have,

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.590
but I can't recall.

3
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:12.591
It's having happened that I found myself lecturing on a person who had lectured

4
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.630
yesterday,
here at Yale.
But that's what happened.
In this case.

5
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.350
You read,
um,

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.140
let's just call it the facetious article on the lecture and the Daily News this

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.250
morning.
Some of you may actually have been in attendance.
Um,

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.790
I unfortunately could not be a,
but as it happened,

9
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.420
I ran into her later in the evening and talk to some of her colleagues about

10
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:41.130
what she'd said.
So I,
I do have,
um,
uh,
a certain sense,

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.810
a certain sense of what went on.
Um,
in any case.
Uh,
yeah.
And,

12
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:47.720
and as to what went on,
um,

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.880
I'm going to be talking today about the slippery just phenomenon,

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.230
intellectual phenomenon in her essay having to do with what she called psychic x

15
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.123
excess.

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.450
That is the charge or excess from the unconscious,

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.600
which in some measure up unsettles even that which can be performed.

18
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.570
We perform identity,
we perform our subjectivity,

19
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.590
we've performed gender and all the ways that we'll be discussing in this
lecture,

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.000
but beyond what we can perform.
There is sexuality,

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.400
which I'm going to be turning to in a minute.

22
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.660
And this has something to do with the,
uh,

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.040
authentic realm of the unconscious from which it emerges.

24
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.250
So what Butler did in her lecture yesterday was to return to the psychoanalytic

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.830
aspect of the essay that you read for today.
Um,

26
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.790
emphasizing particularly the work of law,
cons,
disciple John Lobb launch,

27
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.530
uh,
and,
and,
and,
and developing the ways in which,

28
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.920
um,
sexuality,
uh,

29
00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.090
is something that belongs in a dimension that exceeds a and is less accessible

30
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.270
than those more coded,
uh,

31
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.590
concepts that we think of as gender,
uh,

32
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.940
or as identity in general.
Um,
and so,
um,

33
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.910
conveniently enough for those of you who did attend her lecture yesterday,

34
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.871
in many ways,

35
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.871
she really did return to the issues that concerned her at the period of her

36
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:26.130
career when she wrote gender trouble.

37
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.240
And when she wrote the essay that you read for today.

38
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.350
All right.

39
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.030
Now I do want to begin with what ought to be an innocent question.

40
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.720
I mean,
surely we were entitled to an answer to this question.

41
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.980
And the question is,
what is sexuality right now?
Of course,

42
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.630
you may be given pause,

43
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:49.020
especially if you've got an ear fine tuned to jargon.

44
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.680
You may be given pause by that very word,
sexuality,

45
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:56.730
which is obviously relatively recent in the language people didn't use to talk

46
00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:59.880
about sexuality.
They talked about sex,
which,
you know,

47
00:02:59.881 --> 00:03:03.670
seems somehow more straight forward.
Um,
but the,
but,

48
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.190
but sexuality is a term,
uh,

49
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.780
which is not only pervasive and cultural thought,

50
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.710
uh,
but also has a certain privilege.

51
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.510
I'm on other ways of describing that aspect of our lives.
In other words,

52
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.480
there's something authentic,
uh,

53
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:26.230
as I've already began to suggest about our sexuality,

54
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.950
something more authentic about that.
Then,
uh,

55
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.720
the sorts of aspects of ourselves that we can and do perform.
That's,

56
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.710
that's Butler's argument.
Uh,
and it's an interesting starting point,

57
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.970
but it's really not.
It's,
it's not yet,
or perhaps not at all.

58
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.750
An answer to the question,
what is sexuality?

59
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.190
No for food co actuality,
uh,

60
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.230
is arguably something like desired and experienced bodily pleasure.

61
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.010
But the problem is that this pleasure is always orchestrated by a set of

62
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.180
factors,
uh,
that surround it.

63
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.120
A very complicated set of factors,

64
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:13.270
which is arc articulated perhaps best,
um,

65
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.970
on paid 1634 in his text.
Uh,

66
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.790
the lower right hand column,

67
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.310
he's talking about the difference between and the interaction between,

68
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.060
uh,

69
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.060
what he calls the deployment of alliance and the deployment of our word

70
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.730
sexuality.
Uh,
and I want to read this passage and then comment on it briefly

71
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.540
in a word.
And it's of course not in a word,
it's several words.

72
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.960
The deployment of alliance is attuned to a homeostasis of the social body.

73
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.940
The deployment of alliance is the way in which in a given culture,

74
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.240
the nuclear reproductive unit is defined typically as the family,

75
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.870
but the family in itself changes in its nature and its structure and the way in

76
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.520
which the family is viewed,

77
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.200
the sorts of activities that are supposed to take place and not take place in

78
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:18.790
the family.
Because Fuko lays a certain amount of stress on incest.
And the,

79
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.280
and the atmospheric threat of incest,

80
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.550
the sorts of things that go on in the family and are surrounded by certain kinds

81
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.260
of discourse conveying knowledge.
Uh,
and we'll come back to,

82
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.190
to,
to the latter part of that sentence,

83
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.270
all have to do with the deployment of alliance,

84
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.530
the deployment of sexuality.
Uh,
on the other hand,

85
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.330
the deployment of sexuality,

86
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.920
we understand as the way in which whatever it,

87
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.850
this thing is that we're trying to define,
uh,
is talked about,

88
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.600
uh,
and therefore,
uh,

89
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.570
not by any state apparatus or actual legal system necessarily,

90
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.440
but nevertheless,
simply by,
um,
the,
uh,

91
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.000
the prevalence and force of various sorts of knowledge,

92
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.460
uh,
policed.
Okay.

93
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:16.370
To continue the passage in a word,

94
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:21.230
the deployment of alliance is attuned to a homeostasis or regularization.

95
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.790
That's what,
that's what he means by homeostasis of the social body,

96
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.240
which it has the function of maintaining went it's privileged link with the law.

97
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.200
That is to say the law tells us all fit all sorts of things about the family,

98
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:40.350
including whether or not there can be gay marriage.
Just incidentally,
I'll,
I'll,

99
00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:42.740
I'll come back to that in a minute.

100
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.280
It's to the fact that the important phase for it is reproduction.

101
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.460
The deployment of sexuality has its reason for being not in reproducing itself,

102
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:57.740
but in Liferay innovating a Nexin,

103
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.770
creating and penetrating bodies in an increasingly detailed way and in

104
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:08.741
controlling populations in an increasingly comprehensive way.

105
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.110
What he's saying is among other things that a deployment of sexuality,

106
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.330
which isn't necessarily a bad thing,

107
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.340
these deployments aren't meant somehow or another to be terroristic regimes.

108
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.850
Uh,
a deployment of sexuality,
which for example,

109
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:30.851
favored forms of sexuality such as birth control or homosexuality,

110
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.530
uh,
would certainly be a means of controlling reproduction.

111
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.010
That is to say,
and,
and,
and just in that degree,

112
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.190
the deployment of sexuality could be seen as subtly or not so subtly at odds

113
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.160
with the deployment of alliance alliance,

114
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.520
which is all for the purpose of reproduction or at least takes as its primary

115
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.360
sign as food goes,

116
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.370
suggests the importance in [inaudible] to a given culture or socio biological

117
00:08:02.841 --> 00:08:07.700
system,
if you will,
of reproduction.
And so this is the way,

118
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.300
these are the ways in which the deployment of alliance and the deployment of

119
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:15.830
sexuality converge don't converge conflict with each other.
Uh,

120
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.500
but in all of these ways,
um,

121
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.310
we keep seeing this concept of sexuality.
But as I say,

122
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.130
it continues to be somewhat elusive.
What precisely it is.
Um,

123
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.030
just to bracket that for the moment,

124
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.600
let me make another comment or two on the concept in the passage that I've just

125
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:35.834
read,

126
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.960
let's say once for all at the outset that the central idea in food costs tax,

127
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.980
the idea of which he continues to develop throughout the three volumes on the

128
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:48.510
history of sexuality.
Uh,
the,

129
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.560
the central idea is this idea of power as something other than that which is

130
00:08:56.221 --> 00:09:01.221
enforced through legal policing or state apparatus means power,

131
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:07.221
which is enforced as a circulation or distribution of knowledge,

132
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.550
which is discursive in nature,

133
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.800
which enforces its norms for all of us.

134
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.820
For better or for worse.
Because discourse can release,

135
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.500
can constitute sites of resistance as well as oh press,

136
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.690
which for better or worse,

137
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.870
circulates among us ideas that are in a certain sense,

138
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.560
governing ideas about whatever it is that's in question.

139
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.190
In this case,
obviously sexuality.
So,

140
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.340
and Foodco calls this sometimes,
uh,

141
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.890
hyphenating it power knowledge.

142
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:52.370
This is absolutely the central idea in late Fuko I introduced it,

143
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.680
you remember last time in talking about site,

144
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.950
I come back to it now as that which really governs and guides you through the

145
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:03.790
whole text of Fuko,

146
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.200
the distinction between power as it's traditionally understood as Authoritarians

147
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:15.150
dative as sort of top down coming from above imposed on us by law,

148
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:19.290
by the police,
by whatever establishment of that kind.

149
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:23.580
There might be distinction between power of that kind,
uh,

150
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.503
and power,

151
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:29.510
which is simply the way in which knowledge and knowledge is not by the way,

152
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.470
uh,
necessarily a good word.
It's not necessarily knowledge of the truth,

153
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.600
but the way in which knowledge circulates and,
uh,

154
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.720
imposes its effects on us behavior the way we are or the way,

155
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:49.170
at least that we think we are.
Uh,

156
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.140
the way in which we perform in Butler's term,
uh,

157
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.740
all of that in Fuko his dick is,
is,
is,
uh,

158
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.490
to be understood as an effect of power knowledge.

159
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.130
Now notice,
however,
in terms of our question,
what is sexuality?

160
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.350
That Fuko is being quite coy.
He's talking about sexuality,

161
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:16.140
but he's not talking about it in itself.

162
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.630
Whatever it in itself might be,

163
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.380
he's talking about the deployment of it.

164
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.480
That is to say the way in which power and knowledge constructs it makes it

165
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:30.000
visible,
makes it available to us,

166
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:35.001
makes it a channel through which desire can get itself expressed.

167
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.740
But a channel which is still not necessarily in and of itself,

168
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:45.410
that natural thing that we look for and long for,
uh,

169
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.080
and continue to seek the nature of sexuality.

170
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.330
So when the,

171
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.960
when the emphasis in fruit discussion Israeli on deployment,

172
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.640
that is the way in which alliance,
the family,
whatever the,

173
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.930
whatever the nuclear social structure might be,
or sexuality,

174
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.560
whatever it is that gets itself expressed,
uh,

175
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.300
as desire.
Uh,
the way in which these,
these,
these matters,

176
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:17.860
these aspects of our,
uh,
of our lives can be deployed.

177
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.970
We still aren't necessarily talking about the thing in itself.

178
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.650
Cuco isn't an anthropologist,
he's not talking about the family in itself either.

179
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:31.651
He's talking about the way in which a basic concept of alliance out of which

180
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:38.200
reproduction arises and gets itself channeled,

181
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.850
can be deployed,

182
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.970
understood as manipulated by the circulation of power knowledge.

183
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.520
The issue of gay marriage is very interesting by the way,
between these con,

184
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.600
the concept of the deployment of alliance and the deployment of sexuality

185
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.300
because there's a certain sense in which the deployment of sexuality is at odds

186
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.960
with the deployment of alliance.
If you know,

187
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.100
if sexuality is something that is really just looking around for ways to get

188
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:14.290
itself expressed,
uh,
you know,

189
00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.260
taking advantage of deployment where that's a good thing.

190
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.740
Trying to resist deployment where that seems more like policing.

191
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.500
If it's just looking around for a way to get express,

192
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.020
it's not particularly interested in alliance.

193
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.040
It's not interested in the way in which,
um,

194
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.160
a in which relationships involving sexuality could set her in,

195
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.970
could settle into any kind of a coded pattern or system of regularity.

196
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.430
So that there is this tension,

197
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.940
which of course gets itself expressed whenever within the gay community,

198
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.660
uh,
people strongly support gay marriage and see that as the,

199
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:57.661
as the politicized center of contemporary gay life or people also in the gay

200
00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.651
community.

201
00:13:59.651 --> 00:14:04.651
Many of them theoretically advanced think of as a nonissue or a side issue

202
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.480
which,
which,
which,

203
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:12.481
which loses track precisely of what Fuko calls the deployment of sexuality.

204
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.120
Simply trying to extend the domain,

205
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:21.990
arguably a tyrannical domain of the deployment of alliance to extent.

206
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.150
In other words,
in other words,

207
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:30.010
to redefine the basic concept of alliance in such a way that doesn't really

208
00:14:30.011 --> 00:14:33.760
touch very closely on the deployment of sexuality.

209
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.260
So it's an interesting and rather mixed issue.
Uh,

210
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.550
that the whole question,

211
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:44.170
the whole sort of profoundly politicized question of gay marriage gives rise to.

212
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.190
So that's what's actuality

213
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.440
is and [inaudible] and Butler,

214
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.550
it's just clearer that to ask the question,

215
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.020
what is sexuality as well?
It's just been a false start.
You know,

216
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:07.430
we thought it was an innocent question,
but whoa.
You know,
you get into,

217
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.550
you get into Butler and you and,

218
00:15:09.551 --> 00:15:14.551
and you see very clearly that you simply can't be of a certain sexuality.

219
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.220
You can perform and identity as we'll see by repeating,

220
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.500
by imitating,
by parodying in drag.

221
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.200
You can perform an identity,

222
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.530
but you can't wholly perform sexuality precisely because of this element of

223
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:40.580
psychic excess to which her thinking,
uh,

224
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.640
continues very candidly and openly and honestly to return.

225
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:51.290
Butler's work in other words is not just about the construction of identity.

226
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.660
It's not just about,
uh,

227
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.050
the domain of performance as one might say.

228
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.810
It acknowledges that there is something,

229
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.700
something very difficult to grasp and articulate beyond performance.

230
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.820
Its main business is to explain the nature and purview and purposes of

231
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:15.370
performance,
but it's nevertheless always clear in butler,
uh,

232
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.820
as she returns to the question of the unconscious in particular,

233
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.450
that there is something,
uh,
in excess of,

234
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.480
or not fully to be,
uh,

235
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.530
to be encompassed by ideas of performance.

236
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.860
Okay.
So we've made a false start.

237
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.920
We've asked a question we can't answer,

238
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.210
but at the same time we have learned certain things.

239
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.260
We've learned certainly that sexuality,
whatever it is,

240
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:49.790
is more flexible and also in some sense more authentic.

241
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:54.590
That is to say closest to the actual nature of the drives.

242
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.180
Yesterday,
uh,
Butler made a distinction between instinct and drive,

243
00:16:59.181 --> 00:17:03.560
which I won't go into because it had to do with her reflections on what is

244
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.490
cultural and what is,
uh,
uh,
biological or not cultural in the,

245
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.200
in the life of the unconscious.
But for our purposes,

246
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:17.280
whatever role sexuality may play in the unconscious,
uh,

247
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.320
and however that,
however authentic that is to say,
however,

248
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:26.060
not culturally determined,
uh,
that role may turn out to be,

249
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.480
um,
it's more flexible and that's the important thing.

250
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.220
Then any kind of social coding,
the sort of coding for example,

251
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.220
that,
uh,
that Fuko would,
uh,
uh,

252
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.360
intimate in speaking of alliance or deployed sexuality and the sort of coding

253
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.200
that Butler refers to repeatedly as gendering,

254
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.020
but still for both of them.

255
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.900
And this is the other thing we've learned.

256
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.040
Even sexuality through deployment or through the way in which it can get

257
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:05.580
expressed in relation to gender and performance,

258
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.240
even sexuality is discursive.

259
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.640
It's a matter of discourse.

260
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.300
It arises out of linguistic formations,

261
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:20.301
formations that Fuko understands as circulated knowledge and that Butler

262
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:26.180
understands again as performance Fuko sees sexuality as the effect of power,

263
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.210
knowledge,
power as knowledge.
Butler sees it as the effect,
uh,

264
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.640
as it's insofar as it's visible and so far as it is acted out,

265
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.040
sees it as the effect of performance.

266
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.460
So now to,
to take,

267
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:53.050
to take the way in which Butler makes this relationship between what one might

268
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:55.350
suppose to be authentic,

269
00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.590
actual about oneself and that which is perform that which that which is one's

270
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:05.550
constructs to be a self.

271
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.010
Let's take the one of the most provocative sentences in her essay,

272
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:13.260
which is on page 1711,

273
00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:17.160
about a third of the way down since I was 16,

274
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.880
being a lesbian is what I've been being a lesbian is what I've been now,

275
00:19:26.311 --> 00:19:29.100
what she's doing.
And remember at the very beginning of the essay,

276
00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:33.390
she says that her whole purpose is to reflect is,
is,

277
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:38.391
is somehow or another to register a politicized intervention in gender studies

278
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.640
in terms of a philosophical reflection on ontology,

279
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.760
on being,
what is it?
In other words,

280
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.850
she says to be something now what she's doing in this sentence,

281
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.770
which is an awkward seeming sense,

282
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.370
being a lesbian is what I've been,

283
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:08.330
what she's doing is pointing out to us that to be something is very different

284
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:14.910
from to B being something that,

285
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:16.380
for example,
you know,

286
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.240
I can say I'm busy by the way I am.
I can say,

287
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.360
I can say I'm busy and I expect you to to to take it,

288
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.490
that there's a certain integrity,

289
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:34.410
there's a certain authenticity in the fact that I'm busy.
Yes,

290
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:35.244
I'm busy.

291
00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.550
But suppose you say suspecting that I'm not really busy.

292
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.750
Suppose you say,
oh,
he's being busy.
All right?

293
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.960
In other words,
he's performing buisiness,

294
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.900
he's going around being busy,
you know,
so imposing on me.

295
00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:00.970
The idea that this lazy person is actually accomplishing something.

296
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.180
Right?
So the performance of being busy.

297
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.480
But here's the interesting point that Butler is making.

298
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:13.110
The ontological realm is supposed to be about the simple being or existence of

299
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:18.550
things.
And it's always in philosophy,

300
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:23.110
contrasted with agency,
with the doing of things,

301
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.740
with getting something done with the performance of things.

302
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.510
But what Butler is saying and that's why she says that she takes an interesting

303
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:33.790
in the ontological aspect of the question,

304
00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.150
what she's saying is that there's an element of the performative which actually

305
00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:43.540
creeps into the ontological even being,

306
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.860
she says as something that in some measure,

307
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:53.350
perhaps not altogether,
but in some measure something we perform.

308
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.990
Hence the double mint,
the doubling,

309
00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.550
the doubling up of the word being in the sentence.

310
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.640
Since I was 16 being a lesbian is what I've been in one science.

311
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.190
Yeah I am.
That's what I am.

312
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.220
But in another sense I've been performing it.
I've been being why,

313
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.520
ah,
I've been outing myself if you will.

314
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:23.730
I have been taking up a role that can be understood as all roles can

315
00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.870
intelligibly in terms of its performance.

316
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.200
So that's the why she puts the sentence that way.

317
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.880
And if you said if you kind of made a big mark in the margin and said Aha,

318
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.930
got her right,
this is where she says she really is something.

319
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.960
No more of this stuff of just constructivism,
you know,
making,
you know,

320
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.470
making oneself up as one goes along.

321
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.530
This is where she says she really is something you're wrong.

322
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:56.030
She's escaped your criticism because she says,
oh no,
no,
no,
it's be I,

323
00:22:56.031 --> 00:23:00.370
I have been being a lesbian.
I've been being one,

324
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.780
which is a different thing,

325
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:05.740
although not an altogether different things from being one.

326
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.020
She is deliberately,
in other words,

327
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.290
on the fence between the sense of the ontological as authentic and her own

328
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.280
innovative sense of the ideological as belonging within the realm of

329
00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:24.820
performance.
All right.
And she doesn't want to get off the fence.

330
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.960
She doesn't want she,

331
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.970
she really doesn't want to come down squarely on either side because for her,

332
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:34.480
and this is what I liked best about her work,

333
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:38.530
even though it's perhaps the most frustrating thing about it because for her,

334
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.030
what she is talking about is ultimately mysterious.

335
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.560
She has a great deal to about it,

336
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.580
but she's not pretending that in what she has to say about it,

337
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.020
she's exhausted the subject.

338
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.470
That's why it seems to me to be admirable that she stays on the fence about this

339
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:01.190
and not simply,
um,
uh,
you know,
an occasion for our frustration.

340
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.950
Come on,
come out with it.
I want to know what sexuality,

341
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.240
sorry.
Okay.
All right.
So,
um,

342
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.350
with all this said,
it seems plain that,
and,

343
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.700
and sort of mystification aside if you will as well.
With all this said,

344
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:24.701
it seems playing that Fuko and Butler do have a common political agenda who co a

345
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:31.400
gay writer,
uh,
who was,
uh,

346
00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:35.690
in the later stages of writing the history of sexuality,
um,

347
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.950
dying of aids,
uh,
uh,
Butler,
a lesbian writer,

348
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:44.951
both of them very much concerned for the political implications of their

349
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:50.020
marginalized gender roles while at the same time,
um,

350
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:53.510
of course being theoretically very sophisticated about them.

351
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.720
They're common political agenda is two d stabilize the heteronormative by

352
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:06.131
denying the authenticity or in Butler's parlance originality of privileged

353
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.910
gender roles.
In other words,

354
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.600
who says heterosexual sexuality came first?

355
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.590
Who says the nuclear family is natural?

356
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.860
Who says sexuality,
AH,

357
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.860
can only get itself expressed in certain ways.

358
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:28.190
That power knowledge deploys for it.
All right.

359
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.050
These are the sorts of questions,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the politicized questions,

360
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.590
which these discourses raise in common.
Um,

361
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.480
uh,
so it,

362
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.100
so it seems to me that they have a very broad agenda in common and it also seems

363
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:50.420
to me that they are very closely in agreement.
And so,

364
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:55.400
and I say that just in order to pause briefly on the moment in which they seem

365
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:59.440
not to be,
you've probably noticed that um,

366
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.890
one text is referring to another at one point in your reading.

367
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.170
And so let's go there.
Paid 17,
12,
the right hand margin.

368
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.191
Uh,

369
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:14.900
and the context for this of course is Butler talking about Jesse Helms,

370
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.710
um,

371
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.710
having deplored male homosexuality in attacking the photography of Robert Maple

372
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.180
Thorpe.
Uh,
and by implication,

373
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:31.210
Butler argues simply erasing female homosexuality because his diatribe pays no

374
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:33.830
attention to it.

375
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.900
And Butler then complains that there's a certain injustice in that,
um,

376
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.740
because in a way it's even worse,
she says,
uh,

377
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.760
so to be declared nonexistent than it is to be declared deviant,
right?

378
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.500
At least the male homosexual gets to be declared deviant.
We're simply erased.

379
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.570
That's the position she's taking here.

380
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.720
And then at that point and show what.

381
00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.940
And so what she says is to be prohibited explicitly is to occupy a discoursive

382
00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:07.750
sight from which something like a reverse discourse can be articulated.

383
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:12.751
To be implicitly proscribed is not even to qualify as an object of prohibition.

384
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:17.970
And here's where she,
she gives us a footnote on food.

385
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.840
Go Footnote 15 you know,
we love footnotes.

386
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.290
It is this particular rules of Eraser,

387
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:31.320
which food co for the most part fails to take account of in his analysis of

388
00:27:31.601 --> 00:27:36.070
power.
Butler's argument is that in food,
in terms,

389
00:27:36.071 --> 00:27:39.880
there's gotta be discourse for there to be identity,
right?

390
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:45.030
Helms is refusal of the category of lesbian simply by omission because,

391
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.710
and,
and of course we know by the way,
that this is a refusal only by omission.

392
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:55.490
Helen says,
refusal of this category is at the Sa is,
is,

393
00:27:55.491 --> 00:27:59.710
in other words,
any ratio of discourse.
No discourse,
no identity.

394
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.790
That is,
in other words,
what Butler is claiming,

395
00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.050
who co's position and towels.
Discourse creates power.

396
00:28:08.051 --> 00:28:11.080
Knowledge is power.
Knowledge creates identity.

397
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.190
Therefore where there's no discourse,
there can be no identity.

398
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:20.310
And since Helms has erased the lesbian by refusing discourse about it,

399
00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.820
it must follow that there's no such thing as a lesbian,
right.
That,
that,
that,

400
00:28:24.821 --> 00:28:27.580
that's the implication of this footnote.

401
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.870
He almost always presumes,

402
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.180
and we must do honor to that word,

403
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:39.210
almost almost always presumed that power takes place through discourse as its

404
00:28:39.881 --> 00:28:44.260
instrument and that oppression is linked and that oppression,
sorry,

405
00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.650
is linked with subjection and subjective position.

406
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:53.100
That is that it is installed as the formative principle of the identity of

407
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:57.920
subjects.
All right?
Now in defense of food co,

408
00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:02.950
let's go to page 1632 the upper right hand column,

409
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:10.270
a passage that fascinated,
that's fascinating on a number of grounds.

410
00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.630
It's rather long.
Um,
but I think I will read it.

411
00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.690
Upper right hand column Fuko says,

412
00:29:16.691 --> 00:29:21.691
consider for example the history of what was once the great sin against nature,

413
00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.110
the extreme discretion of the texts dealing with sodomy.

414
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:31.260
That utterly confused category and the nearly universal reticence in talking

415
00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:36.310
about it made possible a twofold operation.
Okay.

416
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.820
Here's food saying this is a category,

417
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:46.350
the hall of us actual identity as a understood in terms of sodomy as a category.

418
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.910
He's about,
he's going to go on to say that it's a,

419
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.560
that it's punishable in the extreme by law.

420
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.010
But in the meantime he's saying there's no discourse.

421
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.020
That's a kind of almost universal silence on the subject.
You don't get silence.

422
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:04.230
And Dante,
as I'm sure you know,
uh,

423
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.530
but in most cases in this period,
nobody talks about it.

424
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.100
It's punishable severely punishable by law.

425
00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:17.101
And yet nobody talks about this would seem to violate food coes own premise that

426
00:30:18.161 --> 00:30:20.920
discourse constitutes identity.
Uh,

427
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.980
but also plainly does contradict Butler's claim that Fuko supposes that

428
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.390
discourse always constitutes identity.
So let's continue

429
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.110
the nearly universal reticence and talking about it made possible a twofold

430
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.040
operation.
On the one hand,
there was an extreme severity.

431
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:46.660
Punishment by fire was meted out well into the 18th century without there being

432
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:49.960
any substantial protest expressed before the middle of the century.

433
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.690
Discourse is here failing also.

434
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:55.300
And that it's not constituting a site of resistance.

435
00:30:55.301 --> 00:30:58.780
Nobody is complaining about these severe punishments.

436
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.680
Just as on the other hand,
nobody's talking very much about them.

437
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.710
There is and other words and eraser of discourse and he continues on the other

438
00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:14.740
hand,
a tolerance that must have been widespread,

439
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:20.280
which one can Dedoose indirectly from the infrequency of judicial sentences and

440
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:24.730
which one glimpse is more directly through certain statements concerning

441
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.170
societies of men that were thought to exist in the army or in the courts.

442
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:29.950
In other words,

443
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:34.950
he's saying there was an identity and that identity was not,

444
00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.330
at least not very much constituted by discourse.

445
00:31:40.331 --> 00:31:43.540
And he's going to go on to say,
as you read down the column,

446
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:48.750
he's going to go on to say that in a way the plight of the homosexual got worse

447
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.420
when it started being talked about.
Yes.

448
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.720
Penalties for being homosexual were less severe,

449
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.650
but the surveillance of of homosexuality,

450
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.610
the way in which it could be,
um,

451
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.710
sort of dictated to by therapy and by the clergy and by everyone else who might

452
00:32:09.971 --> 00:32:14.530
have something to say about it became far more pervasive and determine it.

453
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.540
Then it was when there was no discourse about it.
So that,
um,

454
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.830
in a certain way Fuko has going.

455
00:32:20.831 --> 00:32:25.831
So I'm going so far as to say silence was while perilous to the few a good thing

456
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.020
for the many,
whereas discourse,
uh,

457
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:37.210
which perhaps relieves the few of extreme fear nevertheless,

458
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:41.950
so imposes a kind of hedge your monic,
uh,
uh,

459
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.080
authority on all that remain and constitutes them as something that power

460
00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.080
knowledge believes them to be rather than something that in any sense according

461
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:57.950
to their sexuality,
they spontaneously are.

462
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.520
So it seems to me that this point of disagreement with Fuko raised by Butler is

463
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:07.610
answered in advance by food coke.
And that evens there.

464
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:11.750
When you think about it,
they're really an agreement with each other.
They are,

465
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.590
you know,
it is,
it is Foo Co's,

466
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.350
Foo coast position is more flexible than she takes it to be,

467
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:23.000
but that just means that it's similar to her own.
Uh,
and as I say,

468
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.610
so that,
that,
uh,

469
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.890
fact together with the broad shared political agenda that they have seems to me,

470
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.160
uh,
to,
uh,
to suggest that they're writing very much in concert,
uh,

471
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.920
and in keeping with each others views.
Now in method,

472
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:45.350
they are somewhat different.
Fico is a more historical writer,

473
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.000
although historians often criticized him for not being historical.

474
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.040
Uh,
nevertheless,
that is,

475
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:57.041
I mean the reasons historians don't think he's historical is that he never

476
00:33:57.111 --> 00:34:01.700
really explains how you get from one moment in history to the next.

477
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.500
He talks about moments in history,
but he talks about them in terms of,

478
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:11.270
of bodies of knowledge,
epistemically moments as he sometimes says.

479
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:11.870
Uh,

480
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:16.870
and then these moments somehow mysteriously become other moments are transformed

481
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.860
and the kind of causality that might explain such a thing,
uh,

482
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:26.480
from an historian's point of view,
tens in food coast arguments to be left out.

483
00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.270
He nevertheless is concerned.
However,

484
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.530
with the way in which views of things change over time.

485
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:38.890
And it's the change in those views that his argument in the history of sexuality

486
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:44.770
tends to concentrate on so that he can say that starting in the 19th century and

487
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:47.210
continuing to the present,

488
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:52.660
there are essentially four [inaudible] beings around which,

489
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.350
uh,
power knowledge,
uh,
deploys itself.

490
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.460
And he describes them as the hysterical woman,

491
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.330
the masturbating child,
the Malthusian couple,

492
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:10.010
meaning the couple who is enjoyed not to reproduce too much because the economy

493
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:11.120
won't stand for it.

494
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.300
That's the s which is a way of see of deploying alliance in such a way as to

495
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:21.460
manipulate and control reproduction.
Uh,

496
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.500
that's a moment by the way in which the deployment of alliance and the

497
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:29.501
deployment of sexuality may be in league with each other because obviously birth

498
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:34.340
control and homosexual practices can also control reproduction.
So,

499
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.610
so as you see,
it's not always a question of conflict between,
uh,
between these,

500
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.340
these,
uh,
these two forms of deployment.

501
00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:46.160
So in any case at the mouth is Ian couple and the perverse adult meanings,

502
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.140
the queer person in whatever form.
Uh,

503
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.140
and he says about this on page 16,

504
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.770
34 and the left hand column,
you get,
you,

505
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.200
you get these four types.
Uh,

506
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.880
and he says that therapy,
the clergy,

507
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.290
family parental advice,

508
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:10.740
the various ways in which knowledge of this kind of circulates,

509
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.510
have to do primarily with the preoccupation,

510
00:36:15.511 --> 00:36:18.990
with tension about anxiety,
about these four types.

511
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.140
The hysterical woman as this is determined to be hysterical once her whole,

512
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:28.830
once,
once it begins to be thought that her whole being is her sexuality,

513
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:34.370
the masturbating child violates the idea that children are born innocent,
uh,

514
00:36:34.371 --> 00:36:36.770
as both his is and,
and,

515
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.380
and must because it suggests,
you know,

516
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:43.740
something terribly wrong about the,
uh,

517
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.800
the cult of the innocent child that begins in the 19th century is something that

518
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:54.090
is subject to extreme and severe surveillance.
Who knows what will come of this,

519
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.890
uh,
scientific thinking about masturbation had to do with the fact,

520
00:36:58.891 --> 00:37:01.740
with the notion that it led to impotence that,
you know,

521
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.750
by the time you get around you,
you got around to being in a relationship.

522
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.120
It wouldn't be anything there anymore.
Uh,
just terrible thoughts.
Also,

523
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:15.360
it stunted your growth.
You've died sooner.
You know,
the terrible,

524
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:18.540
terrible thoughts about masturbation.
All of us,
uh,

525
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:23.460
dominated the scientific literature until well into the 20th century.
Uh,
the,

526
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.960
um,
and,
and,
and then the Malthusian couple,
um,

527
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:31.980
which was primarily a phenomenon of what's called political economy and the

528
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:36.920
earlier 19th century,
but has prevailed by the way,
um,

529
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:42.030
in,
in what we supposed to be.
And indeed what is our progressive,

530
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:47.070
uh,
technology of the promotion of birth control around the world.
Uh,

531
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:52.130
we must control population is still the valproate Malthusian principle on which

532
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:58.251
we base the idea that people really need to be enlightened about the possibility

533
00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:03.060
of not just having an infinite number of children.
Um,
and so,
uh,
again,

534
00:38:03.061 --> 00:38:07.050
you see that foo co's right still to suppose that the,

535
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:12.000
the notion of the Malthusian couple,
uh,
prevails,
prevails among us.

536
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.000
And then finally,
the perverse adult,
uh,

537
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:20.080
who is first discoursed about in the 19th century as the earlier passage that I

538
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:25.740
read suggested and is still of course widely discoursed about.

539
00:38:25.741 --> 00:38:30.150
And of course now has a voice discourses,
uh,
in its own right.

540
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.940
Um,
uh,
literature,
uh,
you know,
sort of,
uh,

541
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.980
sort of a journalism and all the rest of it,
uh,
at,
uh,

542
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:42.490
is in other words,
very much in the mainstream of discourse.

543
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:47.491
And still has controversy swirling around it precisely because of the discursive

544
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:52.300
formations that attached to it.
So all of this,
uh,

545
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:56.890
Fuko takes to be in the nature of historical observation for Butler.

546
00:38:56.891 --> 00:39:00.610
On the other hand,
uh,
as you can tell from her style,

547
00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:03.340
I'm sure that as in the case of Reading Baba,

548
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.520
you recognized a lot of Derrida in Butler's style in Butler.

549
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.690
It's a question of taking these same issues and orienting them more in the

550
00:39:13.691 --> 00:39:15.130
direction of philosophy.

551
00:39:15.131 --> 00:39:20.131
I've already suggested the way in which she understands this particular essay as

552
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:25.120
a contribution to that,
uh,
uh,
branch of philosophy called ontology,

553
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:27.000
that philosophy of being,
uh,

554
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:32.100
and in general she takes a particular and acute interest in that and what she

555
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:33.760
does,
I think by the,

556
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:38.170
I mean her basic move is something that I hope by this time you've become

557
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:42.910
familiar with and recognize and perhaps even anticipate,
uh,
for us.

558
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:46.840
Perhaps the inaugural move of this kind,
uh,

559
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.130
were the various distinctions made by Levy Strauss.
Uh,

560
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.940
the one that I mentioned in particular,
uh,
as accessible.

561
00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:59.320
And I think immediately explanatory of how the move works is the raw and the

562
00:39:59.321 --> 00:40:04.300
cooked.
Uh,
and I,
I tried to show that intuitively,

563
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.620
obviously the raw precedes the cooked,
you know,
first it's raw,

564
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.320
then it's cooked and yet at the same time,

565
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.280
if we understand the relationship between the raw and the cooked to be a

566
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:18.910
discursive formation,
we have to recognize that there would be never,

567
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.440
there'd be no such thing as the Ra if there weren't the cooked.
You have to,

568
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:26.080
I mean if,
if you talk about eating a raw carrot,

569
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.860
you have to have had a cooked carrot and then you get,
you know,
you don't,

570
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.560
you don't just pick up a carrot which,
which,

571
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.230
which you've never seen before and say this is Ra.

572
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.970
The only way you know it's raw is to know that it can be and has been cooked

573
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.280
well.
This is the Butler move,

574
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.520
the move that she makes again and again and again.

575
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:50.670
What do you mean the heterosexual precedes the homosexual?

576
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:51.550
What do you mean the,

577
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:56.670
the heterosexual is an original and the homosexual is just a copy of it.

578
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:02.140
Who would ever think of the concept of the heterosexual,

579
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.020
the heterosexual,
you know,
you,
you,
you're,

580
00:41:05.021 --> 00:41:07.690
you're the only person on earth and you stand there and you say,

581
00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:12.310
I'm heterosexual.
You don't do that.

582
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:15.400
You're just say,
well,
I'm,
I have sexuality.
Right?

583
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.970
You could say that if you had enough jargon at your disposal,

584
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:23.410
but you could say that,
but you can't say I'm heterosexual.

585
00:41:23.411 --> 00:41:28.150
You can't have the concept heterosexual without having the concept homosexual.

586
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:33.270
They are absolutely mutually dependent and w and this,

587
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:38.000
and it has nothing to do with any possible truth of,
uh,
of,
uh,

588
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:40.040
of a chicken and egg nature.
You know,

589
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.850
as to WordCamp in sexuality,
the Sup,

590
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.660
the very strong supposition is for Butler.
Neither came first.

591
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:51.530
They're always already there together.
Uh,
um,

592
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.510
in that psychic access,
uh,
with which we identify sexuality,

593
00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.490
but in social terms,

594
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:03.670
the idea that what's natural is the heterosexual and what's unnatural secondary

595
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:05.140
derivative,
uh,

596
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:10.210
imitative of the heterosexual is the homosexual is belied simply by the fact

597
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.720
that you can't have one conceptually without,

598
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.160
without the other.
And it's the same thing with gender and drag.

599
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.880
Drag comes along and parodies mimics annotates gender.

600
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:31.180
But what it points out is that gender is always in and of itself precisely

601
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:35.030
performance.
I,
you know,

602
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:40.310
anybody this could of course take the form of a critique I suppose,

603
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.340
but we're all quite virtual Osa when it comes to performing.
Here I am,
I'm,

604
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.620
I'm standing in front of you performing professionalism,

605
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.120
I'm performing whiteness,
I'm performing masculinity,

606
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.230
I'm doing all of those things.
I'm quite a virtuoso,
you know,

607
00:42:57.231 --> 00:43:02.060
I mean it water performance.
Um,
and uh,
and uh,
and,

608
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.520
and so perhaps it's,

609
00:43:04.521 --> 00:43:09.200
it's kind of hard to imagine my standing here sort of exclusively performing

610
00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:13.670
masculinity as opposed to all the other things that I'm performing.
But okay.

611
00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:18.560
I'm certainly doing that too.
And I'm insecure about all these things.

612
00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:22.370
Butler,
I guess because I keep performing,
in other words,

613
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:27.260
I keep repeating what I suppose myself to be.

614
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.820
I don't just,
I'm not comfortable in my skin,
presumably,

615
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.990
and I don't just relax into what I suppose myself to be.

616
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.010
I perform it.
Uh,
it is,
it is,
in other words,

617
00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.490
a perpetual self construction construction,

618
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:47.570
which does two things at once.
It stabilizes my identity,

619
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.890
which is its intention,

620
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:54.100
but at the same time it betrays my anxiety about my identity in that I must

621
00:43:55.131 --> 00:43:58.120
perpetually repeat it to keep it going.
All right.

622
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:03.170
And so all of this is going on in this notion of performance.

623
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.580
So what drag does is precisely bring all this to our attention.

624
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:12.670
It shows us once for all that that's what's at stake in the seemingly natural

625
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:18.350
categories of gender that we imagine ourselves to inhabit.

626
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.480
A like a pair,
like a set of comfortable old clothes,
uh,
drag,

627
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.950
which is not at all comfortable old clothes,
reminds us how awkward,

628
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:29.060
you know,

629
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:34.060
are the apparel of ourselves that we can call our identity actually is.

630
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:35.970
Um,

631
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:40.830
and so it plays that role and the relationship between identity and performance

632
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:41.940
is just the same.

633
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:48.350
This notion of performing identity should recall for you signifying in the

634
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:52.710
thinking of Henry Louis Gates.
It should cough,
it should recall for you.

635
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:53.521
In other words,

636
00:44:53.521 --> 00:44:58.521
the way in which the identity of another is appropriated through parody,

637
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.530
through derision,
through self distancing,
through,
uh,

638
00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:09.560
a sense of the way in which one is something precisely insofar as one is not

639
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:15.630
simply inhabiting the subject position of another.

640
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.310
It should also recall for you,
uh,

641
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.170
the sly civility of the subaltern in Homi.

642
00:45:22.171 --> 00:45:27.150
Bhabha is thinking the way in which double consciousness is partly,

643
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.640
uh,
in the subject position of another,

644
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:34.730
partly in one's own in such a way that one liberates oneself from the sense that

645
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:38.160
it's the other person who's authentic.

646
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.590
And that one is oneself somehow derivative,
derivative,

647
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:47.060
a subordinate,
uh,
dependent.
Uh,

648
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.920
and so all of these relations,
uh,

649
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:55.070
ought to a gel in your minds as belonging very much to the same sphere of

650
00:45:56.341 --> 00:46:00.870
thought.
Uh,
the way in the way in which,
uh,
the,

651
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:05.871
you can't have the raw without the cooked is the way in which generally

652
00:46:06.691 --> 00:46:07.500
speaking,

653
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:12.500
categories of self and other of identity per se simply can't be thought in

654
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:18.900
stable terms in it for themselves,
but only relationally.

655
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.140
Now,
Oh boy,

656
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.030
why is this literary theory you ask yourself,

657
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.100
you have been asking yourself very quickly.

658
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:34.430
And of course Butler gives the greatest example at the end of her essay when she

659
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:39.420
says,
suppose Aretha is singing to me.
Uh,

660
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.500
you make me feel not a natural woman because there's no such thing as a natural.

661
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:46.050
You make me feel like a natural woman.

662
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:51.290
You presumably being some heteronormative other who shows me what it is really

663
00:46:53.371 --> 00:46:54.204
to be a woman.

664
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:59.370
But suppose a wreath is singing to me or I suppose she's singing to a drag

665
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:03.520
queen,
right?
That is reading,
that's reading,
uh,

666
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.530
a song text.
Uh,

667
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.570
in a way that is precisely literary theory.

668
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.390
Now obviously I'm thinking of Virginia Woolf's,

669
00:47:12.391 --> 00:47:14.460
Mr Ramsay and writing the sentence,

670
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.370
it's a terrible sentence for which I apologize,

671
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:21.750
Virginia Wolfe never would have written it.
Um,
but,
but just,

672
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.260
but just to pass and review the way in which what,
which we've,

673
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.420
what we've been doing is literary theory.

674
00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.820
The Marxists critic would of course focus on his,

675
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:35.821
because the nexus for the Marx's critic in this sentence would be possession.

676
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.230
That is to say the deployment of capital such that,
uh,

677
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:44.530
a strategy of possession can be enacted.

678
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.920
The African American critic would call attention to white color coded metaphors,

679
00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.590
insisting,
uh,

680
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.830
and other words that one of the ways in which literature needs to be read is

681
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:01.120
through a demystification of processes of causation,

682
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.310
whereby white is bright and sunlit and,
and,
and,
and,

683
00:48:05.311 --> 00:48:09.820
and central and black as Toni Morrison suggesting her essay isn't,

684
00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:13.720
is an absence is a negation,
is a negativity.

685
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.250
This is bad.
A dark mood for the postcolonial as critic.

686
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.850
Obviously the problem is an expropriated,

687
00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:24.940
but also undifferentiated commodity.

688
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.160
Who Oriental you don't mean,

689
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:31.990
or in huddle you mean Kazak or Bacara or key Liam or any number of other

690
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:34.060
possible in a,
in,
in other words,

691
00:48:34.061 --> 00:48:37.490
the very lack of specificity in the concept,
uh,

692
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:42.550
suggests the,
uh,
the reified or objectified other,

693
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:46.810
uh,
in the imagination or consciousness of the discourse.

694
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:51.040
And finally,
uh,
for gender theory,
uh,

695
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:55.570
the masculine anger of the philosopher,
Mr Ramsay,
you remember,

696
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:58.600
he could so frustrated because he can't get past our,

697
00:48:58.601 --> 00:49:03.601
he wants to get s he can't get past or the masculinize anger of the philosopher

698
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.240
masks the earthiness of the aesthetic of somebody who has an oriental rug.

699
00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.460
And that in turn might mask,
you know,
the,
the feet prophets,

700
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:20.020
soil type might mask,
uh,
all and altogether too Hetero,

701
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:24.790
t heteronormative,
sexual predation,
and on and on and on.

702
00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.620
Dialectically if you read the sentence as a,
uh,

703
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:33.250
an aspect or element of gender theory,
okay,
I will certainly end there.

704
00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:36.160
And next time we'll take up the way in which,

705
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.680
what we've been talking about for a few lectures,

706
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:42.760
the construction of identity of things,

707
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:47.910
which has obviously been one of the common features of this course is theorized

708
00:49:48.971 --> 00:49:53.590
at an even more abstract level with certain conclusions.
