WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.250
Okay,
well,
last time we saved theory,

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.600
uh,
from the clutches of nap and Michaels,

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.050
and we did so by saying that there really is a difference between language and

4
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.440
speech,
uh,

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.470
ad that's a claim that I want to continue investigating and today's concluding

6
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:28.590
lecture.
Um,
but in the meantime,
uh,
you know,

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.040
when,
when I say we saved very,
uh,
uh,

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.150
you may well be asking by this time,
well,
okay,
so you saved it.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.060
But for what I mean,
why,
you know,
we,
we,

10
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.160
we began to suggest last time,
uh,
that in a certain sense,

11
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:49.161
especially in view of neo pragmatist claims about the agency of language and

12
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:55.380
speech understood to be one in the same thing.
Um,

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.070
in view of claims of this kind.
Well,

14
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.530
do we have to conclude that theory is impractical?
That that is,
that it,

15
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:05.040
it,
it,

16
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.040
it can't have anything to do with pragmatist objectives now.

17
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.070
And so that too is something I want to worry a little bit about today.
Uh,

18
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.280
why do we bother to say theory literary theory?

19
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.590
Well,
it has something to do plainly with communication.
Speech,

20
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.750
as we said last time is unquestionably for,
uh,

21
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.470
that is to say we have made it for communication.

22
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.570
So the old frankly,
incredibly tired question,

23
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.200
how well do we communicate with each other is unfortunately in a way not

24
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.770
irrelevant to what we're trying to get at here.

25
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.240
I want to say a couple of things about what the French during the

26
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:59.190
existentialists period called La Delac community Castillo,
uh,
uh,

27
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.150
and,
uh,

28
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.530
in a way there they're not really on the same page with each other.

29
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.280
First of all,
I want to say that we actually communicate rather well,

30
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.320
congratulations to us.
In other words,
um,

31
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.580
I think that in many of the conventional ways in which people worry about

32
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:20.640
whether or not we can understand each other,

33
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.150
I think that many of those ways are actually a,
of thinking about the problem.

34
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.660
We're actually exaggerated,
uh,
my own,

35
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.620
my own feeling is that perhaps a good deal of the time we understand each other

36
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:32.454
all too well,

37
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.790
and that might be better in a way if we didn't have quite such an acute sense of

38
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:43.230
where each of us,
uh,
are coming from.
Uh,

39
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.090
it probably would,
would,

40
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:49.740
would improve human relations rather than the other rather than otherwise.

41
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.791
Uh,
and the,

42
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:54.840
and this may have something to do with what I take to be a certain measure of

43
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:59.770
bad faith in the ways in which we try to get together and raise each other's

44
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:01.200
consciousness.
Our,
our,
our,

45
00:03:01.201 --> 00:03:04.910
our supposition is that the whole problem is that we don't communicate well and

46
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.890
now if we don't understand each other's subject positions well enough,

47
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.790
as I say,
I'm not completely convinced of that.
Uh,

48
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.310
so there's a certain sense in which I say,
hey,
speech is great.
It's,

49
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.570
it's doing just fine.
Don't worry.

50
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.160
We're communicating perfectly well possibly to,
well,
uh,

51
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.080
so why on earth should theory come along and say,
well,

52
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:32.500
there's sort of a problem with communication.
Uh,

53
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.020
and the problem is this,
this,
this,

54
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.590
this nagging entity called language,

55
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.000
which keeps sort of poking up through the communication process,

56
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.030
getting in its way impeding communication as the Russian formalists suggested,

57
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.860
uh,
all for the better as they saw it.
Ah,
that language does.

58
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.940
Um,
why should it matter what's at stake as nap?

59
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.530
And Michael's might say,

60
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.740
what's at stake in calling attention to the way in which language does impede

61
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.650
communicate.
In other words,
we communicate fine.

62
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.140
But what we really mean in saying that is we communicate fine for everyday

63
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.740
purposes.
Uh,

64
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800
speech has a rough and ready efficacy and anybody who denies that,

65
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.500
as I say it simply exaggerating problems,
uh,

66
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.120
that may exist on grounds other than difficulty of communication.

67
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.800
Um,
so,
so speech speeches really fine up to a point,

68
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.190
part of the function of theory is precisely to interrogate the degree to which

69
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.310
speech in an unimpeded way communicates the level of accuracy and detail at

70
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.350
which speech can ever be expected to communicate.

71
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.330
These are the sorts of questions that we might expect theory to ask.

72
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.500
And if you say,
well,

73
00:04:56.501 --> 00:05:00.520
I'm still not very convinced that that's an important aspect of,

74
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.720
of one's intellectual life.
I don't blame you.
I hope to have convinced you,
uh,

75
00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:10.060
over the next 45 minutes or so that it's pretty important and a variety of ways

76
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.500
and that it's,
that it's worth keeping in mind.
But in the meantime,

77
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:19.501
just to start on this issue tentatively we can understand theory and of course

78
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.070
we began the semester by defining it,

79
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:27.910
by trying to distinguish between theory and philosophy,

80
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:32.360
theory and methodology,
perhaps even those sorts of uh,

81
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.850
approaches to literature that nap and Michael's call poetics.
Uh,

82
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.910
maybe even to distinguish between theory and hermeneutics because after all the

83
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:47.071
whole drive and function of hermeneutics is to discover meaning and there is a

84
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:52.240
certain sense as we have come sadly to realize in which,
uh,

85
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.830
theory is more interested in the way in which meaning is impeded.

86
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.730
Uh,
so,
uh,
it may be as we suggested,

87
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.460
as I say at the beginning of the course,
that theory,

88
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.290
if we're to get comfortable with it at all,
you know,

89
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.670
we have to keep in mind that it's not philosophy.
That is to say,

90
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:14.480
even though you're good at theory and you understand the purpose of theory,

91
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.600
you can still be a system builder.
That is to say,

92
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:20.750
you can still have a sense of,

93
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.400
of x of explaining that to her totality of things.

94
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.200
That's that philosophy needs,

95
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:31.440
if it's going to function as philosophy or his philosophy properly should,
um,

96
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.670
you can still as nap and Michael Osei and gauge empirically with questions of

97
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.680
literary data,
uh,
um,

98
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.000
summarized in such a way as to amount to what we call poetics.

99
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.530
You can do all these things.
Um,

100
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.790
and you don't really have to feel as though theory is somehow or another

101
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.460
standing on the sidelines,
uh,

102
00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.490
sort of shaking his fist at you and wagging its finger theory doesn't have to be

103
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:06.170
understood as a watchdog.
Uh,
theory,
it,

104
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:09.750
at least in my opinion and not everyone agrees with me,
uh,

105
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.610
theory really lets us go our own way,
uh,

106
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.120
and simply reminds us that there are certain

107
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.610
limits or reservations that need to be kept in mind.

108
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:26.020
That one is perhaps why is to keep in mind,
uh,

109
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.800
as we think through problems of interpretation and meaning.
All right,

110
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:35.630
so theory I would define as,
and I've used this word,

111
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.670
negation a lot.
Uh,

112
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:42.470
I would define theory as a negative movement of thought.

113
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.670
Mapping the ways in which it is legitimate as opposed to the ways in which I

114
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:50.750
have suggested it's perhaps not legitimate,

115
00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:55.751
but mapping the ways in which it is legitimate to be suspicious of communication

116
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:02.350
theory is an ad athetic will counter force to that which is commonly supposed to

117
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.660
be true,
posited as true.

118
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.400
And here of course one comes to the point spoken as true,

119
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.990
you announced,
articulated,
spoken as true.

120
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.360
So if that's the case,
why the fuss about language,

121
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:28.010
why do we so quickly narrow the issue down to language?

122
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.530
What I said last time,
uh,

123
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.120
about language and the relationship between language and speech may have seemed

124
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:39.500
unconvincing to you because it was so narrow.
Uh,

125
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.620
and I want to broaden today a considerably broadened the sense of what I mean by

126
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:51.200
language.
It seems to me that theory,
uh,
uh,
uh,

127
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.820
encourages,
uh,

128
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:57.821
measure of suspicion about the efficacy of speech that which is spoken as true

129
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.420
in three ways.
Last time I mentioned one,
but,
but,
but,
but now,

130
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:05.580
let me emphasize three.

131
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.090
The first and the one I did mention last time as the way in which language of

132
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:16.380
truths itself as sound.
In other words,
if we think that,

133
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.251
uh,
if,
if,

134
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:22.251
if we think of the efficiency or functionality of speech as a medium of

135
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:23.250
communication,

136
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.540
we're forced to ask ourselves even as we engage in speech.

137
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.870
How and why it is that speeches so much burden in ways that are of no use

138
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:38.320
whatsoever to us for the most part.
Sometimes they are of use.
Uh,
one of the,

139
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.460
one of the pre frosh asked me last time,
well,
isn't,

140
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.340
isn't sound a reinforcement of meaning.

141
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.830
I told you when we did new criticism that all of you had done the new criticism

142
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.000
in high school.
That's the way you learned literary interpretation.
Well,

143
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:58.590
this was a perfect embodiment of a bright person coming out of Hud high school

144
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:01.620
saying,
interpretation just is the new criticism.

145
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.910
And I've been taught that sound reinforces sense.

146
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.350
That's what it says in Pierides handbook about understanding poetry.

147
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.180
Sound reinforces sense.
Well,
it does of course.

148
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.520
Uh,
and,
and on those occasions,

149
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.980
we can revel in the complexity of an intentional meaning or intentional

150
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:24.830
structure that is,
uh,

151
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.740
augmented by the way in which sound patterns are used.

152
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.870
But at the same time as the Russian formalists,
it sort of discovered,

153
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.560
uh,

154
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.560
working through materials that weren't perhaps so much materials like John

155
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.790
Donne's,
the canonization,
uh,

156
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.740
or texts of the kind that lent themselves to a met to a degree readily to the

157
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:51.090
new credit,
but to illiterate,
illiterate,
alliterative verse,

158
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:56.130
a folk lore and folk verse in the Russian tradition,

159
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.790
uh,
pro verse verse embodies in proverbs.

160
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.420
And what they noticed in studying these materials is that there is simply no way

161
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.680
of grasping a semantic purpose,
purpose,

162
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:13.280
having to do with meaning,
uh,

163
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.050
in the sound elements that are involved.

164
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.440
And I think that as we recognize the way in which there's a strange pull in our

165
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:26.850
spontaneous peaking speaking,
uh,
uh,

166
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.280
toward repetitiousness of sound,
uh,

167
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.220
it's not just that we all speak,
I am Vic pentameter without knowing it,

168
00:11:35.221 --> 00:11:39.150
which by the cases,
by and large,
true.
It's not just that,

169
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.710
it's that there are,
there is an extraordinary amount of alliteration,

170
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.770
uh,
and,
and,
and rhythmic determination.

171
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:51.180
And what we say Yaka Epson has an interesting point in linguistics and poetics

172
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.160
sort of about moment when we're,

173
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.660
when we're nearby and an accident takes place.
So something like that.

174
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.760
Um,
he says you could call a person in a situation like that,
anything,

175
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.930
but we call that person innocent bystander.

176
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.200
And there isn't,
we do is metric right?

177
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.360
A person has an innocent bystander,

178
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:17.970
not because that expression has any particular meaning or sematic valence.

179
00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:20.110
He as over against other expressions,

180
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.370
but because it's catchy because it sort of sticks in our,

181
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.380
it sticks in our mind,
um,
as a alt perhaps for Nima,

182
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.240
Nima,
technical reasons,
it sticks in our mind.
Uh,
as a catchy,

183
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.140
um,

184
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.140
Eisenhower won the election against Stevenson because I like Ike is a more

185
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:45.841
efficient taught of sort of way of engaging with the repetition of sound than

186
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:50.320
madly for Adley.
Jaak Hopson doesn't go into that.

187
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.280
But I think an interesting political analysis could be made of,
as I say,

188
00:12:54.281 --> 00:12:56.080
the greater efficacy of,

189
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.290
I like Ike and all of these and all of these purposes of or,

190
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:02.591
or,
or,

191
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:07.591
or functions of sound or I should say appearances of sound in speech are what an

192
00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:13.090
economist might call irrational.
You know,
they're there,

193
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.470
they're doing a job,

194
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.850
but it's not really a job of anything that we could call communication.

195
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.480
The job they're doing,
uh,
is,

196
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.160
is sort of a free spirited and the part of language.

197
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.110
It's just there,
uh,

198
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:34.290
in an arbitrary relation with the sematic pattern of speech so much then for

199
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:39.710
sound.
But it's not only that,
if it were only that,
if,
you know,

200
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.710
if literary theory,
we're only about the first two or three years,

201
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:49.540
worst worth of research performed by the Russian formalists,
uh,

202
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.400
privately,
we wouldn't be having an introductory survey course in the subject.

203
00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.480
Speech is impeded by language in two other ways.

204
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.210
First of all,
I mean,
second of all,
I should say,

205
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:09.211
I suppose a speech is disturbed by the way in which language produces in what's

206
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:18.421
being said and uncontrollable semantic drift.

207
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.760
That's what I want to call it.
And that is the language.

208
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.210
The language of an utterance is crafted to say some particular thing,

209
00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.960
but actually it was so sir in um,
in,
in,
in a,

210
00:14:33.961 --> 00:14:37.900
in a work of his that's less known than the course in general linguistics,
uh,

211
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.850
who actually published a monograph on the way in which you can find,
uh,

212
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.390
um,
uh,
acronyms of various kinds,

213
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.470
buried or embedded in Latin verse.
In other words,
there's meaning within meaning,

214
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:56.180
which can't possibly have been planted there.
And yet miraculously enough,

215
00:14:56.181 --> 00:15:00.410
you can find it there.
And so you can recite a well known poem,

216
00:15:00.411 --> 00:15:03.110
the one that we took up last time,
uh,

217
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:07.790
because it was the example given in Napa and Michael's against theory.

218
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.690
You can recite a poem while reading this,
uh,

219
00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:16.460
slumber did by spirits seal.
I had no human fears.

220
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.890
She seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of earthly years.

221
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.630
No motion has she now no force.
She neither.

222
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.840
Here's North seas rolled round and earth Stier and of course with rocks and

223
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:35.960
stones and tree.

224
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.910
Now you can see that to write the poem and this way

225
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.270
is to perform an exercise,

226
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:48.410
which is essentially what Joyce is doing and Finnegans wake.
As a matter of fact,

227
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.540
uh,
as I transcribe the poem out of my text,

228
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.840
as you can see,
I transcribed it.
I kept,

229
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.700
I kept saying to myself,
you know what?
This could be in Finnegan's wake.

230
00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:04.160
I was actually quite pleased with myself.
As you can imagine,

231
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.590
this could be invented because notice that I have used all words.
I mean there,

232
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.010
there,
there,
there is nothing in these eight lines,
which is not a word.

233
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.840
Um,
I have certainly engaged in a certain amount of anachronism,
right?

234
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.800
But I have,

235
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.800
but I have also used punctuation and I have worked out ways in which this

236
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:29.210
discourse makes sense.

237
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.020
And I could have just left it at nonsense.

238
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.820
Twas Brillig and this lie,
they toves did gyre and Gimble in the way by at which,

239
00:16:37.821 --> 00:16:42.821
which is another way in which language is affected by uncontrollable sematic

240
00:16:43.521 --> 00:16:44.030
drift.

241
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:49.030
The point of Lewis Carroll's a famous nonsense verse is that we all think we

242
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:50.570
know what it means,
right?

243
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.630
Twas blusters and the slimy toads did a leap and frolic and the way,

244
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.730
so why we think that it means something like that.
Um,
but then,
uh,
but,
but it,

245
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.290
but sematic draft,
which is what Lewis Carroll deliberately introduces too,

246
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.880
it prevents us from,
uh,
in any secure way,

247
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.900
uh,
drawing any conclusions about that?
Well,
maybe I'm,

248
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.110
I of course am making no claims,
uh,

249
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.030
for this transcription of Wordsworth slumber.
Did my spirits seal at all.

250
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.760
But maybe this can show us the ways in which,
um,

251
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.610
there is semantic drift.
I mean,
let's say,
let's say that you're a person,

252
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:37.090
not really as Stanley fish would put it in the interpretive community to which

253
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:39.020
all the rest of us below.

254
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:44.650
And so you don't really know what a poem is and somebody recites in your

255
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:49.230
presence.
What I just recited to you.
Well,
you know,

256
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:52.320
if you were quick good writing and you transcribed the thing,

257
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.110
you might very well produced something like that.
In other words,

258
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.460
it wouldn't just be,

259
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.610
be spontaneously occurred to you that what Wordsworth wrote was what you were

260
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:05.244
hearing.

261
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.820
And that's because the kind of sematic drift that I'm talking about really is

262
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.190
inescapably present in any utterance that we make.

263
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.890
The utterance is not often mistaken because we're really actually good at

264
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:23.340
understanding context.

265
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:28.340
That's one of the reasons why the called problem of communication isn't as great

266
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.600
as people.
Sometimes climate is we're at,

267
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:33.150
we're really good at understanding context.

268
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.060
Hence we're not likely to go badly wrong,

269
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.680
but certainly there are occasions on which we go badly wrong.
I mean that's,

270
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.180
as we all know,
that's the irritating thing about spellcheck.

271
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.740
You put on spell check,
you write your term paper,

272
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.440
you don't bother to edit it and you turn it in.

273
00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:53.790
It's full of howlers because of course the language is full of harm and Emond.

274
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:58.230
Spellcheck always gives the wrong word,
you know,
and you're,
and you're,

275
00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.950
you're in the soap frankly because of course your teacher is just kind of

276
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.630
slapping his knee and go far.

277
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.090
In short,
don't use spellcheck,
but spellcheck is,
but,
but,

278
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:19.050
but spellcheck is a phenomenon that shows you the way in which sematic drift

279
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.610
permeates language all right now.
But it's not just that either.

280
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:29.190
There's a third way in which language impede speech.
Remember I said,

281
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.310
ah,
and so sir,
so Soren ever says this in so many words,
but he,
but,
but he,

282
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.660
but this is definitely what he means by long.

283
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:42.410
Remember I said that language long is a virtual entity because we could never

284
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:48.660
actually and counter it written down in any codified form.
Yes,

285
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.680
it is the,
the dictionary,
the lexicon,
right?

286
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.690
But that's only part of it.

287
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:59.370
And so far notice that we've only been talking about the lexicon when we talk

288
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:03.030
about somatic drift.
But in addition to the lexicon,

289
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.360
language long is a set of rules,

290
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.260
rules of grammar and syntax rules in by,

291
00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.510
by means of which,

292
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:17.400
and only by means of which speech can make sense.
In other words,

293
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.630
language,
uh,

294
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.660
has this sort of bearing on the choices that we can make while producing speech.

295
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.820
But unfortunately those rules can be a little bit slippery.

296
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.120
Why don't we talked about the innocuous expression?

297
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.870
It is raining as an illustration of Yacob upson's six sets of the message.

298
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.700
We were brought up short for just just as an example,

299
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.590
we were brought up short by the metal,

300
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:51.591
lingual of it is raining and we suddenly asked ourselves,

301
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.450
what on earth is it?
In other words,
there's a kind of a group,
there's,

302
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.010
there's,

303
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.010
there's a kind of grammatical and syntactical permissability obviously and the

304
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:04.420
expression it is raining,

305
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:10.740
but at the same time we really have no idea it can lead us in strange

306
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:16.270
directions.
This it,
you know Jupiter fluvial is God

307
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.480
sort of deep sea?
Well,
the cosmos,
the clouds,

308
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.040
some of it is plausible,
but none of us,
none of it is definite.

309
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:32.050
And we realize that it is a kind of placeholder in the sentence that is not

310
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:36.040
doing its job.
And,
and believe me,
it's not just English.

311
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:40.000
As I said before,
it's a phenomenon that you can find in any language.

312
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.760
Even in the expression it is raining,
you blur as pregnant and so on.
Right?

313
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.700
In all of those expressions,
it is not doing its job.

314
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.520
So that's another way in which if we lean on speech,

315
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.960
we have to realize that we're in the presence of what the economist again would

316
00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:01.830
call irrationality.
That,
that,
that,

317
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.840
that and that has to do with the way in which predication works in language.

318
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.370
As I said before,
uh,
an assertion,

319
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.820
a statement of truth and assertion of any kind is the utterance of a metaphor

320
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.800
because the deep structure of any assertion is that a is B,
that's,

321
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:30.810
that is an assertion by definition but a is B and and and of course when that

322
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.320
construction is grammatical that in other words it makes what the Americans call

323
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.720
a Copula when the construction has grammatical,

324
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.990
well that's fine because we understand that the relationship between a and B is

325
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:53.170
not a relationship that's insistently one of identity,

326
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.900
that a connection is being made.

327
00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.900
A connection which demand for example would call met Nimic in predication.

328
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.040
But the problem is that any sentence which declares that a is B met and

329
00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:14.261
clinically that is to say as a grammatical proposition is at the same time,

330
00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:19.411
if we simply look at the sentence for what it is a matter for and insistence

331
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:25.900
that a is B in the sense that a is a

332
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.450
a matter of for in other words,
which doesn't stand on all fours,

333
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:33.070
no metaphor does.

334
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.240
It has an element of what's called catechesis in it

335
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.770
and therefore in a certain sense as we read the sentence necessarily undermines

336
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.880
the sentences,
grammatical structure.

337
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:52.390
This is the point that demand is making and semiology and rhetoric that there is

338
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:58.361
a perpetual tension in any utterance between grammar and rhetoric.

339
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.750
There is no utterance.
That's not grammatical.
There's no utterance.

340
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:03.860
That's not rhetorical,

341
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:08.861
but unfortunately grammar and rhetoric are always rather openly or or or subtly

342
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:14.921
at odds with each other just in the way that metaphor and predication really

343
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:20.750
have to be at odds with each other.
In other words,

344
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:25.751
there isn't a sentence and which the rules of grammar and syntax are not sort of

345
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:32.630
subtly interfering with what you might call the rules of rhetoric,

346
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.400
the ways in which tropes,

347
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:39.320
in other words deploy themselves ways which can be distilled,
um,
uh,

348
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.560
in an understanding of what we call [inaudible].

349
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.680
So every sentence,
as I say,

350
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:49.790
is shadowed not just by the vagaries of sound,

351
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.240
not just by semantic drift,

352
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.950
but by the incompatibilities of grammar and rhetoric.

353
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.640
And all of that is implicit in what so sewer and his tradition call language.

354
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.730
Those are the ways,
in other words,
in which language,

355
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.460
if I can put it this way,
speaks through speech.

356
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:23.650
The ways in which anything that we say on any occasion is shadowed by another

357
00:25:26.571 --> 00:25:27.404
voice.

358
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.660
We've understood this in social terms as box Tinian,

359
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:33.650
poly glossier.

360
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:39.250
We've understood this in psychoanalytic terms as the discourse of the otherness

361
00:25:40.971 --> 00:25:42.200
of the unconscious.

362
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.980
We've understood this in purely linguistic terms as language,

363
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.200
but at we can,
I think metaphorically speaking,

364
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.270
understand it now.
Uh,

365
00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.350
as well as a kind of speech language is on it is an unintentional speech

366
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:11.140
language is just that speech which we recognize having gone through the sort of

367
00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:16.481
analysis that I've been attempting is just that speech which is not governed by

368
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:20.420
intention.
Keep in mind nobody,

369
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.100
no theorists,

370
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.160
nobody in his right mind would ever try to resist the claim.

371
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.820
That speech is intentional that we intend what we say,

372
00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.910
not that and that's the way in which Napa in Michael's are right and give us a

373
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:43.160
bracing reminder about things where our skepticism is misplaced.

374
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.290
You know,
the idea that speeches is somehow not intended.
What,

375
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:51.660
what,
what could,
what could that mean speech?
Just his intention.

376
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.650
But I've been trying to argue that there is a speech,

377
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.950
the speech of language which is unintentional,

378
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:07.100
which is just there.
It can't be factored up.
It can't be Brat.

379
00:27:07.101 --> 00:27:12.101
Well it can be bracketed but it cannot be set aside as though it were not there.

380
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.750
It will always come back.
It will always,

381
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.780
it will always confront us at some point.

382
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.640
If we take the arts of interpretation seriously enough,

383
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.340
if,
if in other words,

384
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:31.460
we really do bring some pressure to bear on the things that people say,

385
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.300
not just a pragmatic pressure,

386
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.260
which I think works just fine for most of us,

387
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.180
but a professor about a pressure that goes beyond the pragmatic and notices.

388
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:47.520
What's really in a sentence,

389
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:51.390
what's really in anybody's utterance now,

390
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.260
what this language speaks through speech partly as its origin and the way

391
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:04.431
language gets into something that you or I might say is a reminder to us that

392
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:06.450
what we say comes from someplace.

393
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.820
It has an origin and its origin is precisely language and the language and

394
00:28:11.821 --> 00:28:16.170
language keeps saying,
Oh,
here I am.
You know your origin,
right?

395
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.890
The birth of what you're doing.
In other words,

396
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:24.891
way back before you discovered that language was useful for something,

397
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:30.270
right?
Remember what we said about,
about that last time.

398
00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:35.010
You know,
you have to discover that fire is useful for cooking.

399
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:39.510
Fire is not for cooking or cave is not forward.
Dwelling.

400
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.070
A prehensile thumb is not for grasping.
You have to make,

401
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.790
you have to discover the ways in which this is the case and languages they're

402
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.231
in.

403
00:28:49.231 --> 00:28:54.231
What we say to remind us that it wasn't always the case to remind us that it's

404
00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.200
just the origin of a history of conscious expression.

405
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:10.130
During the course of which we began the never ending process of trying to master

406
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.390
language.
That's of course what it is to be a writer.

407
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:20.350
You've tried to wrestle language into submission.
All right.
That's,
that's,
that's,

408
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.200
that's the ambition of all of us.

409
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.480
Whether we're writing the great American novel or revising a term paper,

410
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:32.430
we're wrestling language into submission and we all know it's not easy.

411
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.750
I'm just trying to explain some of the reasons why it's not easy.

412
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.260
So language speaks through us as the origin of speech,

413
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.360
but it also speaks as the death of speech.
It's beaks.

414
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:47.194
In other words,

415
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.200
as the moment in which the purposeful agency of speech is finally called into

416
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:58.180
question in a certain sense,
undermine.

417
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.760
And so I think it's appropriate.

418
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.750
I think it's fair to call language again,

419
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:07.780
metaphorically the epitaph of speech,

420
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.720
the way in which in any given speech,

421
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.740
it's all the end of its own agency is inscribed Eamon as that agency is going

422
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:21.970
forward.
Now I want to,

423
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:27.210
I want to test this example and also show you a little bit more about the way

424
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:31.870
semantic,
not semantic drift,
but even more than that,

425
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.820
the perilous relationship between grammar and syntax and rhetoric,

426
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.770
syntax and rhetoric work.

427
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.670
I want to actually try out on you a couple of epitaphs.

428
00:30:42.671 --> 00:30:46.750
If language is the epitaph of speech,
why not?
Uh,

429
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:51.340
why not talk for a little bit about epitaphs.
Now,
my favorite App Epitaph,

430
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:56.500
um,
uh,
by far,
uh,
probably,
uh,
well,

431
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:00.520
you know,
we won't,
we won't speculate about where such an epitaph might be found.

432
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.800
Um,
but if you,

433
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.430
but if and when you come across it walking through a cemetery,

434
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.630
it'll probably elicit a chuckle.
The gray on the gravestone.
It says,

435
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.440
I told you I was sick.
All right.

436
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.720
Now this is a very,
this,
this is a very interesting,

437
00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.730
uh,
uh,
expression for a number of reasons,
for one thing.
And,
and,

438
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:26.050
and one should pause over.

439
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:31.051
This one can infer speakers speaking efficaciously not just one,

440
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:36.880
but many most obvious,
um,
uh,
speaker is of course,

441
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:40.010
and there's plenty of precedent for this.
And Emily Dickinson and,

442
00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:41.290
and other writers,
uh,

443
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.850
and most obvious speaker is the dead person speaking from the grave.
You know,

444
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:50.020
there I was sitting in the corner,
oh,
those years telling you I had a headache.

445
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:55.050
You never listened to me.
Uh,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and so on.
So,
so,

446
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.870
so that is the most sort of obvious identification of a speaker.

447
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.890
But of course,
the speaker could be somebody else.
And I'm not,

448
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.610
and I'm not introducing a measure of skepticism and saying this.
We just,

449
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.340
you know,
we,
when we posit an intention,

450
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:12.170
we just decide which of these speakers it is.
Uh,

451
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.540
the speaker could be an apologetic relative,
uh,
you know,

452
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:20.890
someone acknowledging that they hadn't listened,
uh,

453
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.930
and,
uh,
but with a sense of humor.
And so putting in the voice of the dead person.

454
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.030
Um,
the complaint,
uh,

455
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.950
I told you I was sick as a form of apology.
Yes,
I know you did.

456
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.930
And unfortunately,
uh,
I had to go to the grocery store,
uh,
and so,

457
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.980
you know,
uh,
[inaudible] and so that to,
uh,
can be the speaker.

458
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.600
Well,
on the other hand,

459
00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:49.601
it could be either as the dead person or as someone simply moralizing over the

460
00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:55.400
grave,
which is a frequent habit of the 18th century.
So one of my periods,

461
00:32:55.401 --> 00:33:00.020
so I'm familiar with it.
It couldn't be a philosopher.
I,
you know,
saying,

462
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:03.740
well,
you know,
I,
this is the human condition.

463
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.350
And I kept telling you,
I published 13 books and the whole,

464
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:13.130
the whole purport of which was,
ah,
I am sick,
right?

465
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.230
I'm Dostoevsky's underground,
underground,
man,
I am a sick man.

466
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.060
I'm a very sick man.
Well,
let it get worse.
You know,
I mean,
it could be,

467
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.120
it could be in this mode that a philosopher is moralizing over the grave,

468
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.530
or it could be a cultural critic.
It could be someone,
you know,

469
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.120
in a kind of an allegorical mood in scribing on the gravestone,

470
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.060
uh,
the death of culture,
you know,

471
00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:46.130
culture sort of civilization has been in a bad way for a long time.
And here.

472
00:33:46.131 --> 00:33:48.360
Finally it lies.
Uh,

473
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.010
and the way to communicate this would then be,

474
00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.870
I told you I was sick.

475
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:59.240
A civilization has ways of letting us know that all is not well with it.

476
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.040
Uh,
we didn't pay any attention,
uh,

477
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.660
and here and here is the result.
Okay.

478
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:10.780
And I would say that all those ways of reading the epitaph,
um,

479
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:15.530
are consistent with hermeneutics that they're there.
They're consistent with,
uh,

480
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.360
with the way in which we can,

481
00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:21.500
we can try to come to terms with the intention of a speaker.

482
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.820
But suppose we say that language must be [inaudible] itself,

483
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.300
uh,
in this utterance like any other,
what would that be?
You see,

484
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:37.250
that isn't just a question of sound.
It is a myth question of sematic drift.

485
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:38.084
In this case,

486
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:43.300
it's a question of are suddenly coming to understand the sentence in a way that

487
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:47.840
perhaps no individual speaker would want to give it.

488
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.650
It's an allegory precisely,

489
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.250
cleverly introduced by language about the inadequacy of speech.

490
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.630
That's just the problem with speech,
isn't it?

491
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:08.260
Again and again and again,
I tell you something and you don't listen.
All right.

492
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:12.770
No,
that's the problem with being a lecturer.
That sort of,

493
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.690
I told you,
I told you I was sick and you know,
and,
and you've,

494
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:22.460
oh,
well he's,
he's,
he's just joking.
Um,
and,

495
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.830
and,
and so it is,
uh,

496
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.860
according to the allegory introduced by language at the expense of speech with

497
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.040
speech in general,

498
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.640
it's an allegory about the limits of communication because that's after all what

499
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:44.940
the speaker and you know,

500
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:49.520
insofar as there is a speaker and scribing this expression on the grind

501
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.720
gravestone is concerned about this person sitting in the corner complaining

502
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:57.870
bitterly about nobody ever listening to her or to him

503
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:04.210
is actually an algorithm is telling us that that's the way speech is.

504
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:10.660
Speech in other words,
has its limits in a sense.

505
00:36:10.661 --> 00:36:14.140
Then when I say language is the epitaph of speech,

506
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.150
we realized that if we understand this utterance as an allegory,

507
00:36:19.151 --> 00:36:22.270
it is precisely speech that's lying here.
The end,

508
00:36:22.271 --> 00:36:24.610
as I suggested of speeches,

509
00:36:24.611 --> 00:36:29.611
powers of communication as announced or declared by language.

510
00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.260
Well,
let's try another one.

511
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:38.230
Here lies John Doe probably,
you know,
uh,

512
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:43.420
the,
or epitaph,
I mean,
supply your own name.

513
00:36:43.421 --> 00:36:48.060
But,
uh,
John Doe here.
Here lies John Doe.
Well,

514
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:52.450
now consider,
well,
it's not even pause over the speaker there.

515
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.920
Let's,
let's get immediately to the problems posed by language.

516
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
And the first place John Doe obviously does not lie precisely here.

517
00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.450
Alright?
He doesn't then.
In fact,
if you think about it,

518
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.820
it's all together possible.

519
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:17.850
The John Doe could be absolutely anywhere except precisely here because where

520
00:37:21.521 --> 00:37:26.110
are the sentences?
We know John Doe not to be all right.

521
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.590
He could be any place else,
as I said.
All right.

522
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:35.190
And so any appetite is there for a self declared cenotaph an inscription on a

523
00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:40.120
place where the body isn't all right,

524
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.370
which of course tells us a lot too about the arbitrary nature of language.

525
00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:49.630
Language does not hook onto the real world.
It doesn't hook onto the body.

526
00:37:49.631 --> 00:37:52.960
The one place where language is not is on the body.

527
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.860
The one place where language is not,
as on things,

528
00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:03.310
speeches on things,
a speech can be inscribed on a piece of rock.

529
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.590
Okay.
So here lies John Doe,
except not here any,

530
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.940
but here,
which is why,

531
00:38:12.941 --> 00:38:15.940
of course the interest of the word lies is so interesting.

532
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.900
They sorta the,
the utterance is a lie.
All right,

533
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.930
John,
but it's not John Dahl who lies that just that just read.

534
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:30.860
I mean it poor John Doe is just lying someplace,
right?
John Doe is not lying.
Hi,

535
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.520
it's language

536
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:40.260
that's making speech lie all right?
And it's,
and,

537
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:45.240
and it's not yet on a,
on any number of levels.
All right?
As,

538
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.120
as we've seen.

539
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.060
And so it's a funny thing about epitaphs,
they really do bring tour and,

540
00:38:52.061 --> 00:38:57.061
and this has been noted by certain authors writing in the tradition of what we

541
00:38:57.401 --> 00:39:01.860
loosely call deconstruction.
Um,
the appetite is,
is,

542
00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:06.861
is a particularly fruitful a locus for the study of the ways in which language

543
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.980
challenges undermines,
displaces speech.
Uh,
and,

544
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:16.390
uh,
and as I say,

545
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:20.680
these two examples show more or less,

546
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.300
more or less the way that works.

547
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.700
So speech lies,
you know,

548
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.630
everywhere except here.
Speech,
I don't mean here,
speech,

549
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:36.490
speech lies because it can never stop being language.

550
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:42.330
And therefore we can never really possibly mean exactly what we said.

551
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:50.440
We can mean what we say,
but we can't mean exactly what we say.

552
00:39:50.441 --> 00:39:55.240
I mean that that's probably the most common sensical way of putting the matter.

553
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.880
Uh,
um,

554
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.820
when Stanley Cavell poses the question and the title of one of his books,

555
00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:04.080
must we mean what we say,
you know,

556
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.710
he is actually offering us the possibility that maybe that's not the be all and

557
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:10.460
end all of speaking.
You know,

558
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.040
that the speech act situation is more complicated than that.

559
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.620
And sure,
we all have,
uh,

560
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.180
it add heart as an objective to mean what we say,

561
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.290
but at the same time and speaking were performing,

562
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.980
we're acting as the neo pragmatist would suggest.

563
00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.390
We're doing all kinds of things beside meaning,
uh,

564
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.180
and that really needs to be taken into account.
Uh,

565
00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:39.100
even an understanding what speech can do,

566
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.410
let alone let alone and understanding what's beach can't do.

567
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.940
And so,
uh,
the,
it,
it,

568
00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.940
it's plausible to say that yes,
we can mean what we say,
but,

569
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:56.380
but it's a question whether and date.
It's a very insistent question,

570
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.060
whether we can mean exactly what we say.
Now.
You ask,
you ask,

571
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:06.880
you must ask,
because after all it's been our,
it's been our constant guide.

572
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:11.710
You ask,
does language speak in Tony The tow truck?
I mean,
I,

573
00:41:11.711 --> 00:41:14.800
I know this has been on your mind and so of course we have to,

574
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.320
we have to address it.
Um,

575
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.270
I think there are a few interesting things to be said about that.
I,

576
00:41:20.271 --> 00:41:25.090
I spoke earlier in the semester about the way in which the parade of the

577
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:29.830
vertical on the vertical axis of that vertical access called I,

578
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.390
you know,
as you read the text,
there it is.
Oh yeah,

579
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.590
there it is.
Uh,
sort of out of luck car out of luck,
Indian feminism.

580
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:44.360
However you'll let the fallow go center right there.
I,
right.
But now,

581
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:49.370
you know,
I as never the first words spoken by an infant,
you know,
that,
that's,

582
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:52.820
that's another lesson of lock on.
I mean,
I as I,

583
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:57.170
as what you have to learn how to be,
maybe to put it in Judith Butler's terms,

584
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.490
uh,
and uh,

585
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:03.491
so that I in so far as it is this incredible upright pillar.

586
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:04.731
And Tonya,

587
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:09.731
the tow truck is a promise of precisely agency.

588
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.960
The promise of the kind of identity which stands up,
right?

589
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.010
Uh,

590
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:21.010
which is a successful simulacrum of what is seen in the mirror at which then

591
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:28.481
develops into what Freud called referring to the way in which infants began to

592
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:32.780
get their way in the world,
His Majesty,
the ego.
All right.
That,

593
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:36.980
so the eye has that function.
But as I say,
it's an,

594
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:40.160
it's a story about friendship and the I disappears.

595
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:45.161
And this too I think can be communicated as relevant to the infant in ways that

596
00:42:46.521 --> 00:42:47.630
is that,
that,
that,

597
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:52.160
that at the functional level of language that can't really be called speech.

598
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.180
For example,

599
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.990
the friendship exists between P and toe.

600
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.350
Knee.
Ah,
Oh ah,

601
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.850
Oh one before the baby says I,
it says,
oh,

602
00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.580
oh Oh oh and that,
oh,

603
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.040
resonates in the friendship of bumpy and Tony y r o because Tony is stock,

604
00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:24.140
right?
Antonio's natural response to being stuck would be,
oh,

605
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.280
oh,
all right.
And along comes bumpy and oh,

606
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.960
not only recognizes the problem,
but it takes care of the problem right now,

607
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.530
on the other hand,
the problem of self,

608
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.020
the problem that's caught up in this vertical,
I,
um,

609
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:46.780
comes into focus for the infant as the awareness of otherness.

610
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.350
So that which is alien,
that which is that,
that,
that,
that,

611
00:43:50.351 --> 00:43:53.690
that which is sort of irreducible to the self becomes,

612
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.330
begins to come into focus and a way of expressing this is to say

613
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.900
<v 2>e,
e,
e,
e,</v>

614
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.340
<v 0>which is perhaps in some way or another,
a mask or Simulacra</v>

615
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.670
<v 2>of Hee Hee,
Hee,
Hee.</v>

616
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.310
<v 0>And I think it's for that reason that the two antagonists of the story,</v>

617
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:17.940
the ANA assimilable others who do not help our called speedy and Nieto and other

618
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:24.880
reds,
that sense of that sense of otherness.

619
00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:27.970
So that which is it intractable that which,
that,
that,
that,

620
00:44:27.971 --> 00:44:32.971
which they cannot be sort of reduced effectively to self is I think articulated

621
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.570
in ee,
ee,
ee.
In other words,

622
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:44.110
what the infant speaks is not speech as it,
it's language.
All right?

623
00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.730
If you want to hear language and speech,
just listen to a baby.

624
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:53.610
That's why nonsense verse has such appeal to young children.

625
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:57.280
They're still hearing language.
It's like,
you know,
I mean it's,

626
00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.550
it's a way of putting,
you know,
Wordsworth's intimations though.

627
00:45:00.551 --> 00:45:03.990
Do you know their,
their,
their,
their steering still hearing that,
you know,

628
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:07.650
mighty waters rolling evermore.
They're,
you know,
they're,

629
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.360
they're hearing all I'm,
where we're all hearing speech,
you know,

630
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:17.730
they,
so,
so,
so the infant as,
as,
as I say,

631
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:22.230
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny the history of the human species is a history

632
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:24.420
of coming to terms with speech,

633
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.580
mastering speech or I should say perhaps mastering language.
Well,

634
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:31.080
so it is in the individual,

635
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:36.470
the individual who is hardwired isn't he for language Hass must somehow or

636
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:42.630
another Russell that hard wiring into what we call speech.

637
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.830
So the first thing we hear and an infant and maybe what is most predominant and

638
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:53.160
stories for toddlers and in nonsense verse is language,

639
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:59.850
which,
which,
which you don't reduce somatically.
You don't parse it somatically.

640
00:45:59.851 --> 00:46:03.510
Sure.
I've just interpreted it in into a kind of meaning,

641
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.930
but it's,
but it's a meaning which,
which,
which,

642
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.610
which comes simply from the observation of feelings,
uh,

643
00:46:11.611 --> 00:46:15.260
and noticing what children actually say on,
on,

644
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.620
on actual occasions,
which can't really be called speech,

645
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:25.400
but is rather a kind of experimentation with language dragging itself towards

646
00:46:26.401 --> 00:46:27.120
speech.

647
00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.410
But not anything that one would ever really confused with speech.

648
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.390
Partly an imitation of what is heard in the adult world.

649
00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.790
That's where you get,
uh,
oh,
uh,

650
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.780
but when the adult occasionally says,
oh,
um,

651
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.040
there's nothing like the investment in it that there is in the child for whom it

652
00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:51.840
is very often the first articulate sound.
All right.
And it is,

653
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:57.160
and it is the encounter with otherness and the Ma and the attempt to master it,

654
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.350
master otherness as in Freud story of Fort De,
um,

655
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:06.240
that this seems to be,
uh,
expressing.

656
00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.020
All right.
So,
uh,
so much for Tony.
I just liked to confuse,

657
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.590
to confuse,
I'd like to conclude,

658
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.430
I'd like to conclude with three theses.

659
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:22.490
It's v once what you have to speak very carefully or language of truth.

660
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:27.000
I had to say very carefully,
three feces,
right?

661
00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.820
Uh,
and I,
and of course I made a mistake just before I won.
I want,

662
00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:33.940
I didn't want to say confused did I?

663
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:38.950
And notice that and notice that confused was not just anything getting in the

664
00:47:38.951 --> 00:47:42.340
way of communication.
It was precisely what I did not want to say.

665
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:47.250
I mean precisely.
I mean I got to set anything else buttons,

666
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.250
but I said confused.
That is the fraud Insulet that I've been talking about.

667
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:55.900
Well anyway,
three,
three,
three theses about language.

668
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.170
First,
it never makes sense.

669
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:04.690
Language does not make sense.
It's arbitrary.

670
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:10.050
It is a system of arbitrary signs that are not natural signs.

671
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:13.780
You make sense,
not language.

672
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.520
You make sense by invoking and intention.

673
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:23.550
That is to say by having an intention and wrestling language into speech that is

674
00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.410
commandeering language for your purposes.

675
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:34.510
Language doesn't make sense.
You make sense.
Language in itself.

676
00:48:34.511 --> 00:48:35.021
Secondly,

677
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:40.021
he says nothing about reality for the dust because it is a system,

678
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:44.800
a code,
a system of arbitrary assigns you.
And I want to put it this,

679
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.650
I want to put it two different ways to show you what's going on.

680
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.280
You come to terms,

681
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:53.650
as we say with reality,

682
00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:59.420
and it's to say you find the words for reality as you grasp it.

683
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:05.020
Another way to put it is you figure it out.
In other words,

684
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:09.280
you come to understand what languages I figured it out.
But of course,

685
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:10.930
in rhetorical theory,

686
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:16.350
figure is precisely a figure of speech you bring to bear figures.

687
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.230
Just as you come to terms,

688
00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.070
you bring to bear figures on reality,

689
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:29.070
you figure it out.
And finally to,
uh,

690
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.880
adapt and expression with which you're probably familiar.
Oh,

691
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:37.890
conclude simply by saying that the road to reality is paved with your

692
00:49:39.131 --> 00:49:42.970
intentions,
be they good or bad.
Thank you very much.

693
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.890
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
