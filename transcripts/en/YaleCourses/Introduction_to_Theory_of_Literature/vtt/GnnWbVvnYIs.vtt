1
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.100
All right,
well now,

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:06.690
today is obviously a kind of watershed or transition and our syllabus,

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:11.160
you remember we began,
uh,
we began with um,
uh,

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.250
an emphasis on language where then promising to move to an emphasis on a

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.760
psychological matters.

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.590
And finally a social and cultural determinants of literature.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
So far we've immersed ourselves in notions to the effect that thought and speech

8
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.440
are constituted by language or,
uh,

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.350
to put it another way,
uh,
um,
uh,
brought,
uh,

10
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:42.800
brought into being by language,
uh,
and that,
uh,
um,

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.960
that thought it's be speech have to be understood as inseparable from their

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.610
linguistic.
Your language here being understood,
uh,

13
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.660
sometimes broadly as,
uh,

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.250
a structure or a semiotic system.

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.240
Now obviously our transition from language determined ideas about speech,

16
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.830
discourse,
literature,
uh,

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.690
to psychologically determined,
uh,
ways of thinking about,

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.680
uh,
discourse,
literature,
um,

19
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.780
has a rather smooth road to follow because the first two authors who borrow from

20
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.330
Freud and understand their project,
uh,

21
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.350
to a degree in psychoanalytic terms are nevertheless a using what is now for us

22
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.580
and extremely familiar vocabulary.

23
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.790
That is to say they really do suppose that this the medium of consciousness to

24
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.870
which we now turn the psyche,

25
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.530
the relationship between consciousness and the unconscious,

26
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.390
they really do suppose that this entity,
whatever it may be,

27
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:02.220
can be understood in terms that we take usefully from,

28
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.580
uh,
verbal,
uh,
thought,
uh,
and from linguistics.
Uh,

29
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.500
Lacalle famously said,
as you'll find next week,

30
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.680
the unconscious is structured like a language and Brooks plainly does agree.

31
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.190
You find you open Brooks and you find yourself really,
uh,
apart.
Perhaps I,

32
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.840
I don't know how well all of you,
uh,

33
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.600
are acquainted with the texts of Freud.

34
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.210
We'll say a little bit about beyond the pleasure principle,

35
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.910
which is the crucial text for our purposes,

36
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.420
but plainly apart from the influence of,

37
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.340
and the idea is borrowed from Freud,
uh,
you'll find Brooks,
uh,

38
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:45.150
writing on what for you is pretty familiar turf.
For example,

39
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.760
he begins by borrowing,
uh,

40
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.780
the Russian formalists distinction in trying to explain what fiction is between

41
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.770
plot and story.
Uh,

42
00:02:55.771 --> 00:03:00.771
I feel that I do ultimately have to cave in and to you that the Russian words

43
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:04.810
for these concepts,
plot and story are uh,

44
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.870
Sujay and fabulous respectively because Brooks keeps using these terms again and

45
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:15.320
again.
Um,
I,
I've,
I've explained by embarrassment about,
um,

46
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.170
using terms that I really have absolutely no idea then have the meaning of,

47
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.640
uh,
except that I'm told what the meaning of Ms,
uh,
in the books that I'm reading,

48
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.020
which of the same books that you're reading,
but in any case,
um,

49
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.180
since Brooks does constantly use these terms,
uh,

50
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.120
I have to overcome embarrassment and at least at times use them.
Uh,
myself.

51
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.400
There are a little or counter intuitive by the way,
if you,
um,
if,

52
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.850
if you try to find cognates for them in English because you'd think that to Jay

53
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.010
would be subject matter.
In other words,

54
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.650
something much closer to what the forum list mean in English by story.
Uh,

55
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.680
and on the other hand,

56
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:57.790
you'd think that Fabiola might well be something like plot or friction,

57
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.930
but it is not,
it's just the opposite.
Sujay is the plot,

58
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960
the way in which a story is constructed and the story is the subject matter or

59
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:10.030
material out of which,

60
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.220
or the Fabiola is the subject matter or material out of which the [inaudible] is

61
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.220
made.
All right.
And in addition to the use of this,

62
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.400
the,
this,
the relationship between plot and story,

63
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.550
we also find Brooks using terms that are now having read Jaak Epson and demand,

64
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.200
a very familiar to us,
the terms metaphor and Mytonomy.

65
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.770
Uh,

66
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.770
there's plainly a tendency in modern literary theory to reduce all the tropes of

67
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.950
rhetoric to just these two terms,
uh,
when needed,

68
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.790
they back up a little bit and invoke other terms.

69
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
But the basic distinction in rhetoric as literary theory tends to understand it

70
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.530
is the distinction between metaphor,

71
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.950
which unifies which synthesizes,

72
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.370
which brings together and metonymy,

73
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.520
which puts one thing next to another by a recognizable,

74
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.890
uh,
gesture toward contiguity,

75
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.040
but which nevertheless does not make any claim or pretension to unify,

76
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.240
to establish identity,
to insist in short that a is B.

77
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.210
Uh,
and these two terms,
as I say,

78
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:29.620
are understood reductively but usefully to be,
uh,

79
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:33.120
the essential topics of rhetoric,
uh,

80
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.600
and appropriated by modern theory in that way.
Now,

81
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.400
Brooks then,
uh,
uses these terms in ways that should be familiar to us.

82
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:44.920
As I say,
uh,
we,
uh,

83
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.950
we have now been amply exposed to them in reading Jakobson and demand.

84
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.650
So there is a language of language in Brooks's essay,

85
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.460
Freud's master plot,

86
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.700
despite the fact that the framework for his argument is psychoanalytic and that

87
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.350
he has drawn primarily on the text of Freud's,
uh,
uh,

88
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.920
beyond the pleasure principle.
So what does he take from Freud?

89
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.890
What Interests Brooks about fraud?
He is,
by the way,
uh,

90
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.230
he distinguished Freud and scholar who knows everything about Freud and is

91
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.620
interested in fact by every aspect of Freud.

92
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.690
But for the purpose of constructing the argument here and in the book too,
it's,

93
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:34.070
this essay belongs,
uh,
the book called Reading for the plot.

94
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.090
It,
for the purposes of constructing that argument.

95
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:43.091
What'd he takes in particular from Freud is the idea of structure.

96
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.510
The idea that a,
insofar as we can imagine,

97
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.470
Freud anticipating lock con La call himself certainly believed that Freud

98
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:56.471
anticipated in the idea that the unconscious is structured like a language in

99
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:01.910
terms of creating fictional plots in terms of the nature of fiction,

100
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.210
which is what interests Brooks.
Well,
what does this mean?

101
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.190
Aristotle tells us that a plot has a beginning,
a middle,

102
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.470
and an end.
Duh,
of course,

103
00:07:12.471 --> 00:07:17.471
is our response and yet at the same time we can understand a a degree of mystery

104
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.560
in evenings.
Those even so seemingly simple,

105
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.100
a pronouncement of beginning of course,
well,

106
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:26.960
it has to have a beginning a,

107
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.520
we assume that unless we're dealing with Shahabzada it has to have an end,

108
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.810
but at the same time we might well ask ourselves,
why does it have a middle?

109
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.960
What is the function of the middle with respect to a beginning and an end?

110
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.450
Why does Aristotle say,
as Brooks quotes him,

111
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.600
why does Aristotle say that applaud should have a certain magnitude,

112
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.560
why shouldn't it be shorter?
Why shouldn't it be longer?
In other words,

113
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.720
what is the relation of these parts?

114
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.870
And what in particular does the middle have to do with revealing to us the

115
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:07.130
necessary connectedness of the beginning and the end?

116
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.820
Not just any beginning or any end,
but a beginning,

117
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:15.560
which precipitates the kind of logic and an end,
which in some way,

118
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.050
whether tragically or comically,
uh,

119
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.760
satisfactorily resolved that logic.
How does all this work?

120
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.530
Brooks believes that he can,
that he can understand it,
uh,

121
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:32.420
as we'll try to explain in psychoanalytic terms.
Uh,
so this,

122
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:36.890
he gets this,
he gets from Freud and he also gets,

123
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.480
as I've already suggested,

124
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.630
the methodological idea that one can think of the machinations of a text in

125
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:49.940
terms of the distinction that Freud makes,
not in beyond the pleasure principle,

126
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.250
but in the interpretation of dreams,

127
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.880
in the passages that you read for today's assignment,
uh,

128
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.410
taken from that book,

129
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:02.160
the interpretation of dreams about the dream work.

130
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.450
It's there that Freud argues that two of the,

131
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:11.451
really the central to mechanisms of the dream work are condensation and

132
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:13.404
displacement.

133
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.680
Condensation takes the essential symbols of the dream and distills them into a

134
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:25.230
kind of overdetermined unity.

135
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.380
So that if one studies,
the dreamwork,

136
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.560
one can see the underlying wish or desire expressed in the dream manifest in a

137
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:38.880
particular,
ah,
symbolic unity,

138
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.440
that's the way in which the dream can vet condenses.
But at the same time,

139
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.090
the dream is doing something very,
very different.
And it's called displacement.

140
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.750
There they're essential symbols of the dream.

141
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.010
That is to say the way in which the dream is attempting to manifest,

142
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.930
that which it desires are not expressed in themselves,

143
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.080
but are rather displaced onto sometimes obscurely related ideas or symbols or

144
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.610
images,
excuse me,

145
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.550
or activities that the interpreter,

146
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.820
that the person trying to trying to decode the dream,
uh,

147
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.420
needs to arrive at and to understand.

148
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:26.550
So displacement is a kind of delay or a detour of understanding.

149
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.760
And condensation on the other hand is a kind of distillation of understanding

150
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.360
and,
and,
and,
and the extraordinary thing that Freud,
uh,

151
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:42.210
remarks on as he studies dreams in this book,
uh,
published 1905,

152
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:42.900
by the way,

153
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.670
the extraordinary thing about the way in which dreams work is that there seems

154
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.671
to be a kind of coexistence or a simultaneity of these effects.

155
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.890
The dreamwork simultaneously condenses and displaces Ah,

156
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.520
the that which,
uh,
it is somehow or another,
uh,

157
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.930
struggling to make manifest as it's as its object of desire.

158
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.410
Now the first person to notice that there might be a,

159
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:12.850
the,

160
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:17.070
well there are a variety of people who notice that there might be a connection

161
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.370
between condensation and displacement and metaphor and metonymy most notably

162
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.370
Jacques Lacan,
uh,
whom,
uh,

163
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.550
who Brooks quotes to this effect.
Uh,

164
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:34.640
and that the work in everyday discourse in what we say,

165
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.340
but also in our dreams and in what we tell our analyst can be understood as

166
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.610
operating through the medium of these two tropes.
Condensation.

167
00:11:47.611 --> 00:11:48.271
In other words,

168
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:53.271
his metaphorical and its nature and displacement is Matt anemic and its nature.

169
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.140
This placement as the is,
is,
is our,

170
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:02.150
our Matana me as the delay or a perpetual as we,

171
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:06.910
as,
as we gathered also from Derrida or perpetual DFL,

172
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:11.911
loss of signification matter for as they bringing together in a statement of

173
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:19.420
identity,
uh,
of the,
uh,
of,
of,
of,

174
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:24.400
of the,
of,
of the discourse that's attempting to articulate itself.

175
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.680
And again,
we see,
uh,

176
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.430
infection as Brooks argues in his essay.
Again,

177
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.180
we see that these two rhetorical tendencies,

178
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:39.010
the metaphorical and the Metronomic,
uh,
co-exist work.

179
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.000
And of course you can hear the implicit critique of demand in the background,
uh,

180
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.210
may or may not work in harmony,

181
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:49.210
may or may not conducive to an ultimate unity,

182
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.300
but nevertheless do coexist in such a way that we can understand the unraveling

183
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.620
of a fictional narrative as being like the processes we see at work in the

184
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:05.560
unraveling of dreams.

185
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.690
And so it's these two elements that Brooke,
Brooke's is interested in,

186
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.440
in Freud and that he primarily does take from Freud.

187
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:19.441
Now this means among other things that Brooks is not anything like what we may

188
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:25.110
spontaneously caricature perhaps as a traditional psychoanalytic critic.

189
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.570
Brooks is not going around looking for Oedipus complexes and Phallic symbols.

190
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.690
Brooks is as is as I hope you can see interested in very different aspects of

191
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.390
the Floridian text.
Um,

192
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.510
and he says as much at the end of his essay on page 1171 in the right hand

193
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:51.271
column where it says there can be psychoanalytic criticism of the text itself

194
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:55.780
that does not become,
this is what I'm doing.
He says,

195
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.710
that does not become,
as has usually been the case,

196
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.340
a study of the psycho genesis of the text.

197
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.500
The authors are unconscious.
The dynamics of literary response,

198
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.690
the readers unconscious,

199
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.990
the dynamics or the occult motivations of the characters postulating and

200
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:19.990
unconscious for them.
In other words,

201
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.110
Brooks is not interested in developing a theory of the author or a theory of

202
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:27.730
character.
Now,

203
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:31.950
I don't think he really means to be dismissive of Freud,

204
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.890
he and criticism.

205
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:36.100
I think he's really just telling us that he's doing something different from

206
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:36.670
that.

207
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.750
And I would remind you in passing that although we don't pause over traditional

208
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:45.130
Friday and criticism in this course,
it can indeed be extremely interesting.

209
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.120
Just for example,
uh,
Freud's disciple Ernest Jones,

210
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.710
wrote an influential study of Shakespeare's Hamlet,
uh,

211
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.290
in which he showed famously that hamlet has an edifice complex.

212
00:14:57.291 --> 00:14:58.310
Think about the play.

213
00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:02.000
You'll see that there's a good deal and what Jones is saying.
And in fact,

214
00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:06.230
famously and the history of the staging and filming of Shakespeare,

215
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.010
as you probably know,
Sir Laurence Olivier,
uh,

216
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.900
took the role of hamlet under the influence of Ernest Jones.
Uh,

217
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.640
and in,
in the Olivier production of Hamlet,
uh,

218
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.700
let's just say made it painfully clear in his relations with Gertrude that he

219
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:29.120
had an edifice complex.
Um,
and,
and,
and again,
you know,
I mean,

220
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:34.121
there were actual sort of literary texts written directly under the influence of

221
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.470
Freud.
One thinks of Dh Lawrence's sons and lovers,
for example,

222
00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:41.790
in which the central character Paul Morrell,
um,

223
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.150
is a crippled,
uh,

224
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.330
by an Oedipus complex that he can't master.

225
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.290
And the difficulties and complications of the plot or of this kind.

226
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.290
I'm moving closer to the present.
Uh,

227
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.460
an important figure in literary theory whom we'll be studying in this course.

228
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:03.610
Harold Bloom can be understood to be developing in his series of theoretical

229
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:07.220
texts,
beginning with the anxiety of influence,

230
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.340
a theory of the author that is to say a theory that is based on the relationship

231
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.870
between belated poets and they're precursors,

232
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.130
which is to say a relationship between sons and fathers.

233
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.790
So there is a certain pattern in and of course I,

234
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.220
I invoked this pattern,
uh,

235
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:33.170
in arguing that Levy Strauss version of the Oedipus Smith,
uh,

236
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.010
betrays his Oedipus complex in relation to Freud.

237
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.570
And so plainly,

238
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.660
Floridian criticism with these sorts of preoccupations is widespread,

239
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.240
continues sometimes to appear and cannot simply be discounted or ignored,

240
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.510
uh,

241
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.510
as an influence in the development of thinking about literature or of the

242
00:16:55.821 --> 00:17:00.730
possibilities of thinking about literature.
Not but the odd,

243
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.740
but the odd thing we're maybe not so odd.
The interesting thing,
uh,

244
00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:09.741
in Brooks is work is that although the text is not there to tell us something

245
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:14.360
about its author or to tell us something about its characters,

246
00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:16.700
even though character is important in fiction,

247
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:19.340
and that's what Brooks is primarily talking about,

248
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.460
although it's not there to do those things,

249
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.730
it is nevertheless like an author or a character in many ways alive.

250
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.940
That is to say the text is there to express desire to make,

251
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:35.840
to put in motion,

252
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.120
to make manifest desire or a desire.

253
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.900
Um,
and that is a rather odd thing to think about,

254
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:49.901
especially when Brooks go so far as to say that he has a particular desire in

255
00:17:50.201 --> 00:17:54.330
mind.
Uh,
the text,
in other words,
the structure of the text,

256
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:59.331
the way in which the text functions is to fulfill in some way or another,

257
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.090
a desire for reduced excitation.

258
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.220
That is to say the desire which can be associated with the pleasure principle in

259
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:12.910
sexual terms,
uh,

260
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.760
and can be associated with the idea of the death wish that fraud develops and

261
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:22.020
beyond the pleasure principle that I'll be coming back to,
um,
as,
uh,

262
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.110
as the reduce the reduction of expectation that would consist in being dead.

263
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.910
Uh,
and so in these ways,

264
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.800
and it remains to see whether or door to what extent these ways are cooperative

265
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.000
in these ways.
Brooks understands the structure,

266
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.980
the delay,

267
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:46.070
the Arabesque or postponement of the end one fines in the text to involve a kind

268
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:52.860
of coexistence of the sort that I've been talking about,
um,
between,

269
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:53.490
uh,

270
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:58.490
between relations to the possibility through desire of reducing exit

271
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.120
expectation,
being excited,
reducing exited nation.

272
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:12.230
Now obviously both dreams and stories don't just express this desire.

273
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.300
They also delay it.
I'm sure we've all had the experience of waking up.
It's,

274
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:21.090
it's an experience by the way,
which is an illusion.

275
00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:25.170
It hasn't really been the case of waking up and thinking that we've been

276
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:29.070
dreaming the same damn thing all night long.
In other words that,

277
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.000
that we have just been interminably stuck in a,

278
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:38.001
in a dream predicament which repeats itself again and again and again,

279
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.080
uh,
to the point of absolute,
total tedium.
Many of the dreams we have,

280
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.920
our neither exciting northern reverse,
but simply tedious,

281
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.280
whatever excitement they may have entailed in the long run.

282
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.750
We feel as we wake up that they go on too long.

283
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.360
Um,
perhaps fiction does have the,

284
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.210
this superiority over the dream work,
uh,
that it's art,

285
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.300
that it structure is precisely the protraction of delay to the,

286
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.950
to a desired degree,
but not unduly beyond,
uh,

287
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.040
that,
that degree.
Uh,
and so,

288
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.370
but it's not just that fiction involves the middles of fiction involve these

289
00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:27.030
processes of delay.
It's that they seem also,

290
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.710
and this is one of the ways the one,

291
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:34.780
one of the reasons Brooks does have recourse to this particular text of Freud,

292
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.430
they also have the curious tendency to revisit unpleasurable things.

293
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.900
That is to say it's not that it's amid the middles of fiction are exciting.

294
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:48.280
We love to read,
you know,
we're,
and,
and,
and,
and,

295
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:53.190
and everything we read is a page Turner.
All do.
They're good.
But the fact is,
uh,

296
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.120
our fascination with reading isn't simply a fascination that takes the form of

297
00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:00.640
having fun.
Uh,
in fact,

298
00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.750
so much of what we read in fiction is distinctly unpleasurable.

299
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.740
We wince away from it even as we turn the page.

300
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.720
One way to put it,
uh,
uh,
especially in 19th century realism,

301
00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:15.310
which particularly interest Brooks,

302
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:20.320
is all these characters are just madly making bad object choices.
You know,

303
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.130
they're falling in love with the wrong person.
You know,
they're getting there,

304
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.300
they're getting stuck in sticky situations that they cat it,

305
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.170
they cat extract themselves because they're not mature enough because they

306
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:33.550
haven't thought things through.

307
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.320
Because fate looms over the possibility of making a better choice.

308
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:38.861
However,

309
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:43.861
the case may be the experiences that constitute the middles even of the greatest

310
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:48.790
and the most exciting fiction do have a tendency a,

311
00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:51.250
if one thinks at them from a certain remove,

312
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:55.390
thinks about them from a certain remove to be run pleasurable.
Why?

313
00:21:55.391 --> 00:21:56.224
In other words,

314
00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:01.230
return to what isn't fun to what is it pleasure and what can this possibly have

315
00:22:01.481 --> 00:22:04.450
to do with the pleasure principle?
Now,

316
00:22:04.451 --> 00:22:09.451
that's precisely the question that Freud asks himself in beyond the pleasure

317
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:10.300
principle,

318
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.860
a text which begins with a consideration of trauma victims.

319
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:17.830
It's written at the end of the first world war.

320
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:23.070
And you should understand this text as not isolated in the preoccupation of

321
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.260
writers in Europe.
Uh,

322
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.920
almost contemporary with beyond the pleasure principle,

323
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.960
our novels written in England,

324
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:37.140
partly as a result of the making public of findings of psychologists,

325
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.490
uh,
about traumatic war victims as the war came to its conclusion.

326
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.220
Uh,
most of you have read a Virginia Woolf's,

327
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:50.221
Mrs Dalloway and you should recognize that her treatment of Septimus Smith and

328
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:52.660
Mrs Dalloway is,
uh,

329
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:57.430
a treatment of a traumatized war victim.
And Rebecca West,

330
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.480
a contemporary and acquaintance of hers who wrote a good many novels,

331
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:04.450
wrote one in particular called the return to the soldier,

332
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.620
the protagonist of which is also,
uh,
a traumatized war victims.

333
00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.630
So it was a theme of the period,
uh,

334
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.340
and Freud's beyond the pleasure principle contributes to this theme.

335
00:23:15.341 --> 00:23:20.341
Brooks himself likes to call it the text of beyond the or Pr Pla,

336
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.500
the text of beyond the pleasure principle as itself a master plot.
Uh,

337
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.060
in other words as having a certain fictive character.
And it would be,

338
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:31.661
I think,

339
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:36.661
extremely instructive to read it alongside the return of the soldier or Mrs

340
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.160
Dalloway for the reasons,
for the reasons I've mentioned.
Okay.
So anyway,

341
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.880
Freud begins by saying the weird thing about these drama victims who am I've had

342
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:51.881
in my office as they seem in a describing their dreams and even in their various

343
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:56.480
forms of neurotic,
repetitive behavior,
uh,

344
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.600
they seem compulsively to repeat the traumatic experience that has put them in

345
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:06.290
the very predicament that brought them to me.
In other words,

346
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:09.020
they don't shy away from it.
They don't,
uh,

347
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.180
in any strict tents repress it,
they keep compulsively going back to it.

348
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.650
Why is that?

349
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:20.651
How can that possibly be a manifestation of the only kind of drives I had ever

350
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:25.370
thought existed up until the year 19,
19.

351
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.960
Namely drives that we can associate in one way or another with pleasure,

352
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.730
with the pleasure principle.
Uh,
obviously,
uh,
you know,
with a kind of,

353
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.410
with a sort of implicit socio biological understanding that the protraction of

354
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:43.790
life is all about sexual reproduction.
Uh,
and that the,

355
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.530
the,
uh,
um,
displacement or,
or,
uh,

356
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.560
or inhibition of the direct drives associated with that take the form of the

357
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.760
desire to succeed,
uh,

358
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.380
the desire to improve oneself,
uh,

359
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:04.580
the desire to become more complex emotionally and all the rest of it.

360
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.510
All of this we can associate with,
uh,
the pleasure principle.

361
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.630
How does this compulsion to return to the traumatic event in any way correspond

362
00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:19.130
to or,
or,
uh,

363
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.050
or submit itself to explanation,
explanation in terms of the pleasure principle.

364
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:29.330
So then he turns to an example in his own home life,
uh,

365
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.190
is a little grandson,
little Hans,
uh,
standing in his crib,

366
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.600
throwing a spool,

367
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:40.010
tied to a string out of the crib saying walked away,

368
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.560
not there,
and then post reeling it back in and saying,
doc,
not,

369
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.270
there it is again,
forked Da.

370
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.160
Why on earth is little Hans doing this?
Well,
Freud Pretty,

371
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.670
pretty quickly figures out that what little Hans is doing is finding a way of

372
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:59.510
expressing his frustration about the way in which his mother leaves the room.

373
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.590
In other words,
his mother is not always there for him.

374
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.480
So what does this act,
what does this,
this,
this,
this play or accomplishing?

375
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.700
He's got her on a string,
right?
Sure.
She goes away.
We have to understand this.

376
00:26:13.701 --> 00:26:18.530
We know our mother goes away,
but guess what?
I can holler back in,
you know,

377
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.320
and there,
and there she is again.
Uh,

378
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.000
and this is the achievement of mastery.
As Freud puts it in books,

379
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:31.010
files the achievement of mastery that we can acquire through the repetition of a

380
00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:37.370
traumatic event.
So maybe that's the way to think about it,

381
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.760
but it can't just be the achievement of mastery alone because nothing can do

382
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:45.210
away with or undermine,

383
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:50.270
undermine the fact that part of the drive involved seems to be to return to the

384
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:53.010
trauma that is to say,

385
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:58.070
to keep putting before us the unhappy and traumatic nature of what's involved

386
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.470
now.
So this the,
the compulsion to repeat,

387
00:27:04.471 --> 00:27:08.850
which of course manifests itself in adults in various forms of neurotic

388
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:10.380
behavior.
By the way,

389
00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:14.070
we're all neurotic and all of us have our little compulsion's.
Uh,

390
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:17.910
but it can get serious in some cases.
And,
and,
and the composer,

391
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.020
the compulsion to repeat,
um,
takes the form,
uh,

392
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.350
Freud argues,
uh,
to the,
the,
of,

393
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.440
especially if we think of it in terms of an effort at mastery to master in

394
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:34.200
advance through rehearsal as it were,

395
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.340
the inevitability of death,
the trauma of death,

396
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.580
which awaits and which has been heralded by traumatic events in one's life,

397
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.250
uh,
near escape,
for example,

398
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.790
in a train accident or whatever the case may be.

399
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.550
And so Freud,
uh,
in developing his argument,
uh,

400
00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.620
eventually comes to think that the compulsion to repeat has something to do with

401
00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:06.261
a kind of repeating forward of an event which is in itself and meritable the

402
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:11.820
event of death,
which is a,
of course that which,

403
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.840
which ultimately looms.
Now it's in this context,

404
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:21.050
it's in this context that Freud begins to think about how it could be that the

405
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:26.580
organism,
a engage itself with thoughts of this kind.

406
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.680
What is this,
uh,

407
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.610
almost eager anticipation of death.

408
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.220
And he notices that in certain biological organisms that can be observed.

409
00:28:38.221 --> 00:28:39.450
This by the way,
is,
has,

410
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.340
has been wildly disputed by people actually engaged in biology.

411
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.120
Uh,
but it was,
but it was,
um,
but it was,
um,

412
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.750
a useful metaphor for the development of Freud's argument.

413
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.890
He noticed that there is in certain art organisms,

414
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.850
a wish to return to a simpler,

415
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:05.010
an earlier state of organic existence,
which is to say,

416
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.900
to return to that,
which isn't just what we all look forward to,

417
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:15.110
but was after all that which existed prior to our emergence into life,

418
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.370
the relationship between the beginning and the end that I've been intimating,

419
00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:22.950
in other words,
is a relation of death.

420
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:29.070
I begin inanimate and I end inanimate.

421
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:34.370
And Freud's argument is that there is somehow in us a compulsion or a desire,

422
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.330
a drive to return as well,

423
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.450
like going home again or going back to the womb to return to that inanimate

424
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:50.770
state.
The aim of all life.
He then says,
ah,

425
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.730
his death.
Well,
no,
maybe,
maybe the important thing is to,

426
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:56.380
is to allow Brooks,
uh,

427
00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:01.410
to comment on that so that you can see how he makes use of Freud's idea and move

428
00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:08.281
us a little bit closer to the application of these ideas to the structure of a

429
00:30:09.191 --> 00:30:12.580
literary plot or a of a fictional plot.
So on page 11,

430
00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:15.220
66 and the right hand margin,

431
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.593
<v 1>uh,</v>

432
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.450
<v 0>the beginning of the second paragraph,
a Brooke says,</v>

433
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.520
we need a president to follow Freud into his closer inquiry concerning the

434
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:31.390
relation between the compulsion to repeat and the instinctual.

435
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.080
The answer lies in a universal attribute of instinct and perhaps of organic life

436
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.853
in general,

437
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.100
that an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state

438
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:51.190
of things.
Building on this idea.
Page 1169,

439
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.760
the left hand column about halfway down

440
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.740
the function of the drives.
I mean,
he says this function,

441
00:31:00.741 --> 00:31:05.741
but the function of the drs is concerned with the most universal endeavor of all

442
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:09.260
living substance,

443
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.440
namely to return to the quiescence of the Inorganic World Cup.

444
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.850
Got a pleasant,
I guess,
right?
And,
uh,

445
00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:23.390
the desire to return to the quiescence of the organic world.

446
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.840
The aim in this context,
in this sense,

447
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.620
the aim of all life is death.

448
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.780
But there's more,
and this is why novels are long,

449
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.540
not too long,
not too short,

450
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.280
but of a certain length of a certain magnitude.
As Aristotle puts it,

451
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.020
there is more because the organism doesn't just want a die.

452
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.180
The organism is not suicidal.

453
00:31:50.181 --> 00:31:54.320
That's a crucial mistake that we make when we first tried to come to terms with

454
00:31:54.321 --> 00:31:56.390
what Freud means by the death wish.

455
00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.970
The organism wants to die on its own terms,

456
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:07.420
which is why it has any labyrinth mechanism of defenses.

457
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.640
The outer Cortex,
as Freud is always calling it,

458
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:15.680
attempting to withstand,
to process,
to keep an arm's length,

459
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.510
the possibility of trauma.

460
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:23.050
You blame yourself as a victim of trauma for for not having the sufficient vis

461
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:27.530
vigilance and your outer cortex to to ward it off.

462
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.750
Part of the compulsion to reteach to repeat is in a certain sense to the the

463
00:32:32.751 --> 00:32:34.160
mastery that's involved.

464
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:38.660
The hope of mastery and the compulsion to repeat is to keep up the kind of

465
00:32:38.661 --> 00:32:43.661
vigilance which you failed to have in the past and therefore fail to ward it off

466
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.900
so the organism only wishes to die on its own terms.

467
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.960
If you are reminded here by the passage of 10 Yanoff that I gave you where he

468
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:58.601
makes the distinction between literary history as evolving and literary history

469
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:03.350
is modified by as modified by outside circumstances,

470
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:05.900
I think it would be a legitimate parallel.

471
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.500
What the organism according to Freud wants to do is evolve toward its

472
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:14.930
dissolution,
not to be modified,

473
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.100
not in other words to be interfered with by everything from external trauma to

474
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:23.840
internal disease.
It doesn't want that.

475
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.330
It wants to live a rich and full life.

476
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:29.120
It wants to live a life of a certain magnitude,

477
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:34.121
but with a view to achieving the ultimate desired end,

478
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.680
which is to return to an inorganic state on its own terms.

479
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.950
And so there's this tension in the organism between evolving to its end and

480
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:51.290
being modified prematurely toward an end.
A modification,

481
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:55.040
which in terms of fiction would mean it wouldn't have a plot,
right?

482
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.010
You might have a beginning,
but you would have,
uh,

483
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.890
you would have a sudden cutting off that prevented this,

484
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.950
the arabesque of the plot from developing and arising.

485
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.780
Uh,

486
00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.780
now what Brooks argues following fraud is that to this end,

487
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.870
the creating of an atmosphere in which with dignity and integrity as it were,

488
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.470
the organism can progress toward its own end,
uh,

489
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.640
without interference as it were.
Uh,

490
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.010
what Brooks following Freud argues is that in this process,

491
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.090
the pleasure principle and the death wish cooperate,
uh,

492
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.820
page 11,
66,
uh,

493
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:44.810
bottom of the right hand column and then over to led and 67,

494
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:46.950
a relatively long passage.
Um,

495
00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.590
hence Freud is able to proffer with a certain bravado,
the formulation,

496
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.690
the aim of all life is death.

497
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.900
We are given an evolutionary image of the organism in which the tension created

498
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:04.991
by external influences has forced living substance to diverged ever more widely

499
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:12.070
from its original course of life and to make ever more complicated day tour

500
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:17.090
before reaching its aim of death.
In this view,

501
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.100
the self preservative instincts function to assure that the organism shall

502
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:27.101
follow it's own path to death to ward off anyways of returning to the inorganic,

503
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:32.210
which are not imminent to the organism itself.
In other words,

504
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.110
the organism wishes to die only in its own fashion.

505
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.240
It busts against events,
dangers,

506
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.420
which would help to achieve its goal to rapidly by a kind of short circuit.

507
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.160
And again,
uh,
on page,

508
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.690
on page 1169 lefthand column,

509
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.400
a little bit farther down from the passage we quoted before,
Brooke says,

510
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:58.740
we could say that the repetition,

511
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:03.741
compulsion and the death instinct serve the pleasure principle in a larger sense

512
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.320
though the pleasure principle keeping watch on the invasion of stimuli from

513
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:14.421
without and especially from within seeking their discharge serves the death

514
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:15.210
instinct,

515
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:20.210
making sure that the organism is permitted to return to quiescence.

516
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.400
And it's in this way that these two,
uh,

517
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.080
these two differing drives,
uh,

518
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:33.110
co-exist and in some measure cooperate in the developing and enriching of the

519
00:36:35.401 --> 00:36:40.401
good life and in the developing and enriching of the good plot

520
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.420
and obvious problem with this theory and Freud acknowledges this problem and

521
00:36:47.971 --> 00:36:52.971
beyond the pleasure principle is that it's awfully hard to keep death and sex

522
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:57.090
separate.
In other words,

523
00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:02.450
the reduction of expectation is obviously something that the pleasure principle

524
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:04.830
is all about.

525
00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.040
The purpose of sex is to reduce exercitation to anol desire.

526
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.180
The purpose of death,
Freud argues,
is to do the same thing.
Well,

527
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:18.300
how can you tell the one from the other?
There's a rich,

528
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.420
there's a rich vein of literary history,

529
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:23.820
which insists on their interchangeability.

530
00:37:23.821 --> 00:37:28.710
We all know what to die means in early modern poems.
Well,
no,

531
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.780
about the about Lebus tote and Tristan does,
and he's older,
uh,

532
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:38.790
the moments of death,
uh,
in literature,
which obviously are sexually charged,

533
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.310
uh,
there is a kind of manifest,
uh,

534
00:37:42.311 --> 00:37:46.320
and knowing confusion of the two,
uh,
in literature.

535
00:37:46.321 --> 00:37:50.400
And Freud always says that the poets preceded him and everything that he
thought,

536
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.450
uh,
which suggests that it is rather hard to keep these things separate.

537
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:56.820
For example,
by the way,
um,
you know,

538
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.570
the compulsion to repeat a nasty episodes,

539
00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:02.840
the to revisit trauma,
uh,

540
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:07.110
to repeat the unpleasurable well that could just be called masochism couldn't
it,

541
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.010
it could be called something which is a kind of pleasure,
uh,

542
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:15.510
and which therefore could be subsumed under the pleasure principle and would

543
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:20.511
obviate the need for a theory of the death drive as Freud develops it in beyond

544
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:23.220
the pleasure principle.
Now,
Freud acknowledges this,

545
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:26.700
he says that it is difficult to make the distinction.

546
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.330
He feels that that a variety of sorts of clinic,

547
00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:33.810
clinical evidence at his disposal warrant the distinction,

548
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.020
but it is not an easy one and it's one that I suppose we could continue to

549
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:44.281
entertain as a kind of skepticism about this way of understanding,

550
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.730
uh,
of,
of,
of understanding the compulsion to repeat,

551
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:49.803
uh,

552
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.600
as somehow necessarily entailing a theory of the death wish.

553
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.370
All right,
now quickly as to the plot,

554
00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:03.450
desire emerges or begins as the narrative.

555
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.200
What is the unairable?

556
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:10.201
The unairable is that immersion in our lives such that there is no sense of form

557
00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:18.370
or order or a structure.
I mean,

558
00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:20.980
anything is on narrative will.

559
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.290
If we don't have a sense of a beginning and a middle and an end to bring to bear

560
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:27.124
on it,

561
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:31.630
the narrative will and other words must enter into a structure.

562
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.910
And so the beginning,

563
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.180
which is meditated on by soft Chris Rock town in and Jose and quoted to that

564
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:45.100
effect by Brooks on the left hand column of page 1163,

565
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:50.370
the narrative will begins in this moment of entry into that pattern of desire

566
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.250
that launches a fiction.

567
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.450
We have speculated on what that desire consistent.

568
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.870
And so the narrative will becomes a plot and the plot operates through metaphor,

569
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.530
which unifies the plot,
which shows a,

570
00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.590
the remarkable coherence of all of its parts.

571
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:16.330
A narrative theory is always talking with some satisfaction about how there's no

572
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:20.410
such thing in fiction as irrelevant detail.
In other words,

573
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.450
nothing is there by accident.

574
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:27.690
That is the metaphoric pressure brought to bear on plotting by sort of in the

575
00:40:29.741 --> 00:40:33.460
course of composition.
Uh,
everything is there for a reason.

576
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.550
And the reason is arguably the nature of the underlying desire that's driving

577
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.430
the plot forward.
But on the other hand,

578
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:47.230
metonymy function functions as the principal of delay.
The detour,

579
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:51.040
the Arabesque,
the refusal of closure,

580
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:56.220
they settling upon that object choice and other unfortunate outcomes.

581
00:40:57.491 --> 00:41:01.910
The return of the unpleasurable,
all the things that happen,
uh,

582
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:06.250
in the structure of middles,
uh,
in literary plot.

583
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:10.180
The plot finally binds material together.

584
00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:14.470
Both metaphor and metonymy are arguably forms of binding.
Uh,

585
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.310
page 1166,
uh,
the right hand column,

586
00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.860
bottom of the first paragraph,

587
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.280
Brooks says to speak of binding in a literary text is thus to speak of any of

588
00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:28.530
the formalization,

589
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.900
which like binding may be painful retarding that us to recognize sameness within

590
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:40.811
difference or the very emergence of eight Sujay from the material of Fabiola.

591
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:45.710
Okay.
Now I want to turn to Tony as a,

592
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:50.630
an instance of the way in which reading for the plot can take place.
Um,

593
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.060
but I,

594
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:55.910
and I also want to mention that the choice of these materials for today's

595
00:41:55.911 --> 00:41:57.160
assignment,
uh,

596
00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:02.200
is not just a way into questions of psychoanalysis as they bear on literature

597
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:04.580
and literary theory,

598
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:09.200
but also adjust your towards something that those of you whose favorite form of

599
00:42:09.201 --> 00:42:14.030
reading his novels may wish we had a little more of.
And of course,
of this kind,

600
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.810
namely narrative theory narrow otology.
Uh,

601
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:21.970
and I commend to you the opening pages of Brooks is essay where he passes and

602
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:26.960
review some of the most important work in narrative theory work good.

603
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:31.730
I mentioned in passing when I talked about structuralism a couple of years,

604
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:36.620
a couple of weeks back,
seems like years,
doesn't it?
Uh,
and uh,
and work,

605
00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:41.621
which is for those of you who are interested in narrative and narrative theory,

606
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.850
you may well wish to revisit,

607
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:48.530
we'll unbox say Tom total rough gerage Jeanette,
uh,
are the figures,

608
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.090
uh,
to whom Brooke,

609
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.410
Brooke's is primarily a expressing indebtedness within that tradition.

610
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.530
But anyway,
Tony,
the tow truck,

611
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.890
I would suggest that,
uh,

612
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.340
in the context of beyond the pleasure principle,
we could,

613
00:43:04.341 --> 00:43:09.341
we could retitle Tony the tow truck as the bumpy road to maturity.

614
00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.750
Uh,
it,
it,
it certainly has the qualities of a picker fiction.

615
00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.560
It's on the road as it were.
Uh,

616
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.780
and it's the linearity of its plot.

617
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:23.720
The way in which the plot is like beads on a string,

618
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:26.630
which tends to be the case with picker ask fiction.

619
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:31.690
And which by the way is also a metta Nimic aspect of the fiction.
Uh,

620
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.240
the linearity of the plot.
Um,
Lens,

621
00:43:35.241 --> 00:43:39.920
the feeling of picturesque to,
to the narrative.
Um,
uh,

622
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:41.420
quickly to reread it.

623
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:44.990
I know that you all have it glued to your wrists,

624
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.320
but in case you don't,
uh,
to reread it,

625
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:53.780
I am Tony the tow truck.
I live in a little yellow garage.

626
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.160
I help cars that are stuck.
I told them to my garage.

627
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.000
I like my job.
One day.
I am stuck.

628
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.990
Who will help Tony?
The tow truck.
I cannot help you.

629
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.790
Says Neato the car.
I don't want to get dirty.
I cannot help you.

630
00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:15.680
See these are bad object choices,
right?
I cannot help you said speed either car.

631
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.250
I am too busy.
I am very sad.

632
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.330
Then a little car pulls up.
It is my friend,
bumpy,

633
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.460
bumpy,
gives me a push.
He pushes and pushes.
And I'm a,

634
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:32.610
by the way,
uh,
this,
this text I think very close to its surface,

635
00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:37.500
a kind of anal phase parable in that,
in that parable,

636
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.730
the hero is not Tony in fact,
but a character with whom you are familiar,

637
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:45.050
if you're familiar with,
with a South Park.
Um,

638
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.980
and that character is of course the one who says he pushes and pushes.

639
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:53.790
And I'm on my way.
Uh,
but,
but,
but in any case,

640
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:57.630
that is part of the narrative.
Uh,
and then thank you.
Bumpy.

641
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.990
I call back.
You're welcome.
Says Bumpy.

642
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.790
Now that's what I call a friend.
So that's,
that's the text of Tony the tow truck.

643
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.270
Now we've said that it's picker ask.
Um,

644
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.110
we can think in terms of repetition,
obviously,
uh,

645
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:18.150
as the delay that sets in between and origin and an end.

646
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.230
Uh,
and we've spoken of this as in this case.
Uh,

647
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:27.380
well it's the triadic form of Folk Tale of that Brooks actually mentions in his

648
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:29.550
essay.
Um,

649
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:34.670
but it is in its dilation of the relationship be beginning of beginning an end,

650
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.710
a way of reminding us of the,
of,
of that precisely of that relation.

651
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.480
He comes from a little yellow garage.
The question is,

652
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:49.080
and a question which is perhaps part of the unairable is,

653
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.200
is he going back there?
We know he's on his way,

654
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:57.600
but we don't know if we read it in terms of beyond the pleasure principle,

655
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:01.980
whether he's on his way back to the little yellow Varage or weather and there's

656
00:46:01.981 --> 00:46:06.110
a premonition of this and being stock,
in other words in having broken down,
uh,

657
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.300
whether he's on his way to the junk yard.
Uh,
but in either case,
uh,

658
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:15.470
the only point is that he will go to either place because little yellow garages

659
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.930
that from which he came,
uh,
that in either case,

660
00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:23.850
little yellow garage or a junk yard,
he's going to get there on his own terms,

661
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:28.870
but not as a narcissist,
not as the person who begins every sentence.

662
00:46:28.871 --> 00:46:31.050
And the first part of the story with the word I,

663
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:36.710
because you can't just be an autonomous hero on your journey.

664
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:40.500
And this is also true of the study of folklore on your journey.

665
00:46:40.501 --> 00:46:44.040
You need a helper,
you know,
that's part,
that's part of fiction.

666
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.060
You need another hero,
you need a hero to help you.

667
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.250
And having that hero and countering the other mind,
uh,

668
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:53.830
as helper,
uh,

669
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.850
is what obviates the tendency toward even in a nice guy like Tony,

670
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.500
the tendency toward narcissism,

671
00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:05.820
which is manifest in the eye at the beginning of the story.
Notice that then the,

672
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:09.480
I disappears.
Not completely,
but wherever it reappears,

673
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.710
it's embedded rather than initial.
It is no longer in other words,

674
00:47:13.711 --> 00:47:18.570
that which drives the line in the story.
And so,
and then so,

675
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:21.300
so the Arabesque of the plot,
uh,
as I say,

676
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.250
as a matter of encountering bad object choices and overcoming them,
neatness,

677
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:30.970
buisiness,
you know,
choices,
which by the way are on the surface.
Temptations.

678
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.420
We all want to be neat,
busy,
don't wait.
But somehow or another,

679
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:39.230
it's not enough because the otherness,
the mutuality of regard,
uh,

680
00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:43.480
that this story wants to enforce as life,
as life,

681
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:45.160
properly lived,
uh,

682
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.660
is not entailed in and of itself in neatness and buisiness,

683
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.280
uh,
resolution and closure then is mature object choice.
Um,

684
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.070
and um,
and yeah,
and in a certain sense,
um,
there are two,

685
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:03.480
um,
it's a push forward,
but we don't quite know,
uh,

686
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.550
toward what we have to assume though in the context of a reading of this kind.

687
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:14.160
That's a push toward a state in which the little yellow garage and the junkyard

688
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:19.950
are the unairable junkyard are manifest as one and the same thing.

689
00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.280
Now as Matana me the delays we've been talking about,

690
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.990
the paratactic structure of the way in which the story is told,

691
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.370
all of that,
uh,
and the elements of repetition,
all of that,

692
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:36.010
our forms that we recognize as met anemic.

693
00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:38.620
But there's something beyond that at the level of theme.

694
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.990
This is a story about cars.

695
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:45.010
This is a story about mechanical objects,
some of which moved,

696
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:49.180
because remember those smiling houses in the background,
some of which move.
Uh,

697
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.020
and some of which are stationary,
but they're all mechanical objects.

698
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:56.650
They're all structured.
In other words,
they're not organic.

699
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:02.040
This is a world understood from a mechanistic point of view as that which lacks

700
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:05.020
organicity and yet at the same time,

701
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.430
the whole point of the story is the magically metaphoric.

702
00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.870
It is to assert the common humanity of us all.

703
00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.970
That's what I call a friend.

704
00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:20.470
The whole point of so many children's stories,
animal stories,

705
00:49:20.471 --> 00:49:22.810
stories like this little engine that could,

706
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.750
is to humanize the world,

707
00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:31.200
to render friendly and warm and inviting to the child,

708
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.700
the entire world so that Tony is not a tow truck.

709
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Tony's a human being and he realizes humanity interacting [inaudible] the

710
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:46.150
existence of a friend,
the unity of the story.
In other words,

711
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:50.020
as opposed to it's metronomic displacements through the mechanistic,

712
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:55.230
the unity of the story is the triumphant humanization of the mechanistic and the

713
00:49:56.771 --> 00:50:00.820
fact that as we read the story,
we feel that we are after all,

714
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.570
not in mechanical company but in Human Company.

715
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:09.160
That's the effect of the story and the way it works in terms of the pleasure

716
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:14.110
principle.
Then life is best in a human universe.
And in terms of,

717
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.660
well,
in terms of beyond the pleasure principle,

718
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.510
the whole point of returning to an earlier state,

719
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.590
little yellow garage junk yard is to avert the threat.

720
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.360
That one being stock.

721
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.600
We'll return to that junk yard prematurely or along the wrong path.

722
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:31.990
Okay,

723
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:36.990
so next time we will turn to the somewhat formidable task of understanding lock

724
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.440
comb.
