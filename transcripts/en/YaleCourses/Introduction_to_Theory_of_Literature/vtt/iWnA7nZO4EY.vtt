WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.120
Alright,
uh,

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.630
let's hope we can free our minds of these matters now and turn into something a

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.770
little more substantive,
uh,
which is,
uh,
the question,

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.520
uh,
before we plunge into God of her.
Really perhaps the question,

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.670
what is hermeneutics?
Uh,
well,

6
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:25.671
it's easily enough explained what it is despite the sort of difficulty in

7
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:30.870
thorniness of the word,
uh,
uh,
it is,
uh,
the art,

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.780
uh,
or,
or,
uh,

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.810
principles of interpretation.
Um,

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.460
but hermeneutics has a history that is to say it's not something which has

11
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:42.870
always been just there.

12
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:47.700
It's not something that people have always thought about in a systematic way.

13
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:50.790
Strictly speaking,
what I've just said isn't true.
Uh,

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.300
many of you probably know that Aristotle has a treatise called day interpret.

15
00:00:55.301 --> 00:01:00.240
[inaudible].
Um,
the Middle Ages are rife with,
uh,
with,
uh,

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.270
treatises on interpretation and suppose wa I suppose what I'm really saying is

17
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.130
that the word hermeneutics wasn't available.

18
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
And the idea that there ought to be a sort of a systematic study of how we

19
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:15.960
interpret things,
um,
wasn't really,
uh,
current.
Um,

20
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760
but so,
and of course,
by the same token,
um,
uh,
uh,

21
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.960
the,
the notion of hermeneutics arises primarily,
uh,

22
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980
in religion first,
uh,
in and,

23
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.360
and specifically in the Christian tradition.

24
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.270
But that isn't to say that there hasn't been,
that,

25
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:38.271
there wasn't long before the moment at which hermeneutics became important at

26
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.460
Christianity.
Uh,

27
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
that's not to say that there wasn't a century's worth of towel.

28
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:48.870
Moody's Scholarship,
uh,
which is essentially also hermaneutic in nature.

29
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.610
That is to say,
concerned with the art and basis of interpretation.

30
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.540
But what gave rise to in,

31
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.680
in the Western world to what is called Hermeneutics was in fact,
uh,

32
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.120
the Protestant reformation.
And there's a lot of significance of that in,

33
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.170
in that I think,

34
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:12.171
and I'll try to explain why you don't really puzzle your head about questions of

35
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:15.030
interpretation,

36
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:20.031
how we interpret validity of interpretation and so on until a meaning becomes

37
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:27.651
terribly important to you and be the ascertainment of meaning becomes difficult.

38
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.030
And you say to yourself,
well,
isn't it always the case that meaning is important?

39
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.920
And that meaning is hard to construe?
Well,
not necessarily.
You know,
if,

40
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.610
uh,

41
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.610
you are a person whose sacred scripture is adjudicated by the pope and the

42
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:47.790
occasional tribunal of church elders,

43
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.180
you yourself don't really need to worry very much about what scripture means.

44
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.590
You're told what it means.
It goes without saying,
therefore what it means.

45
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.070
But in the wake of the Protestant reformation,

46
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:08.071
when the question of one's relationship with the Bible became personal and

47
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.381
everyone was aunt was understood if only through the local minister to be a and

48
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.330
gauged with coming to an understanding of what is after all a pretty difficult,

49
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.470
who on Earth knows what the parables mean and so on and the,
and,

50
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.410
and the whole of the Bible,
uh,
poses interpretive difficulties.

51
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.420
Then of course your going to have to start worrying about how to interpret it.

52
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.420
And needless to say,
since it's a sacred scripture,

53
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.560
the meaning of it is important to you.
You do want to know what it means.

54
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:40.330
It can't mean just anything.

55
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:45.331
It's crucial to you to know exactly what it means and why what it means is

56
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.560
important.
And so as Protestantism took hold,

57
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.480
by the same token,

58
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.840
the art and the arts and sciences of Hermeneutics took hold and people began to

59
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:01.030
write treatises about interpretation,

60
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.040
but it was always interpretation of the Bible.
In other words,
in this tradition,

61
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.610
religion came first after that,

62
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.660
the next thing that happens is you begin to get the rise of constitutional

63
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.360
democracies.
And as you get that,

64
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.540
you begin to be become much more interested as a citizen or as a person who has

65
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.250
suffrage or as a person in one way or another,
um,
has the,

66
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.360
uh,
has,
has,

67
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.390
has the rights of the state or nation it may get you begin to become concerned

68
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.060
about the nature of the laws you live under.

69
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.430
And that's why hermeneutics gradually moved,

70
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.250
not deserted religion,

71
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.400
but so I should say expanded to the study of the law and the arts and sciences

72
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.930
that had been developed in thinking about interpreting scripture were then

73
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.810
applied to the interpretation of something the meaning of which had become

74
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:06.811
almost as important as to say it mattered what the law was and how it was to be

75
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.110
interpreted.
And you know,
of course,

76
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.700
that this is absolutely crucial to the study of the law to this day.
You know,

77
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.500
what are the grounds for understanding the meaning of the constitution,

78
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:21.850
for example.
Uh,

79
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.680
there are widespread controversies about it and many of the courses you would

80
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:31.681
take in law school are meant to try to get to the bottom of these thorny

81
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.200
questions.
Well,
uh,
well and good.
Once again,

82
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:40.201
you see that hermeneutics enters a field when the meaning of something becomes

83
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:44.440
more important and when,
uh,

84
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.160
that meaning is recognized to be difficult to grasp.

85
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.910
Now as yet,
you know,

86
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.940
we haven't said anything about literature and the fact is there is no art of,

87
00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.770
uh,

88
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.770
no hermaneutic art devoted to literature during the early modern period and for

89
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.930
most of the 18th century,
uh,
think about,
you know,

90
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.360
the writers you've studied from the 18th century.

91
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.520
It's very interesting that they all just sort of take beaning for granted.
Uh,

92
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.910
if,
if you think about pope,
for example,

93
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.890
or even Johnson as they reflect on literature and why it's important and what

94
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:27.770
the nature of literature is,
they don't,

95
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.720
they aren't concerned about interpretation.
They're concerned about evaluation,

96
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.400
establishing the principles of,
of,
of,
of what,
uh,

97
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:42.401
of what's at stake in writing a poem or in writing literature in some other

98
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:48.740
form,
um,
uh,
and,
and,
and raise questions that are largely,

99
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.130
uh,
moral,
uh,
and,
and aesthetic.

100
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.600
They're not concerned about interpretation because to them,

101
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.690
good writing is precisely writing that's clear writing that doesn't need to be

102
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:07.400
interpreted but has as precisely as it's virtue.

103
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.350
It's transparency of meaning.
And in fact,
during this whole period,

104
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.150
um,
playwrights were writing prologues to their place,
abusing for each other,

105
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:18.320
for being obscure.

106
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.090
That is to say abusing each other for requiring interpretation.

107
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.660
I don't understand what your metaphors are all about.

108
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.600
You don't know what a metaphor is.
All you do is make one is,

109
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.210
is make one verbal mistake after another.
Nobody can understand you.

110
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.330
This is the nature of the prose and verse prefaces to a theatrical pieces in the

111
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:44.570
18th century.

112
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.890
And from that you can see that interpretation is not only not study,

113
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.130
but it's considered to be completely extraneous to what's valuable about

114
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.460
literature.
If you have to interpret it,
it isn't any good.

115
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.330
But then as the 18th century wears on,

116
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.560
you begin to get the sense in the first place.
You get a,
as,
as,

117
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:10.430
as with the emergence of romanticism,
you got to kind of as,

118
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:15.380
as as well known and I think often overstated,
uh,
you'll get a cult of genius.
Uh,

119
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.120
you get the idea,
uh,

120
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.350
that everything arises from the extraordinary,
uh,

121
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.490
mental acuity or spiritual insight of an author.

122
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.300
And that knew what needs to be understood about literature is the genius of its

123
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:36.380
production.
Well,
well and good.
But at the same time,

124
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:41.410
if that's the case and if there's this extraordinary emphasis on the importance

125
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.650
of the expression of genius,
you can see what's beginning to happen.

126
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:51.010
The literary creators starts to seem a lot more like the divine creator.

127
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.090
That is to say,
uh,
and,

128
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:57.390
and in a certain sense could be understood as a place holder for the divine

129
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.540
creator.
Remember that,
uh,
secularization,
uh,

130
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.750
in western culture is increasing during the course of the enlightenment.

131
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.360
That is to say during the course of the 18th century.

132
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.530
And there's a certain way in which romanticism and in what,

133
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.590
what's important about romanticism can be understood as what Northrop Frye has

134
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:22.440
called a secular scripture.
In other words,

135
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.660
the meaning of literature becomes more difficult because it's profoundly

136
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:29.970
subjective and no longer,
uh,

137
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.210
some and no longer engaged with shared values.
Uh,

138
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.240
and the importance of literature.

139
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.960
That is to say our sense of why it's so important to understand.

140
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:44.961
It has also grown because for many people it begins to take over partly at least

141
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.260
the role of religion.

142
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.590
And so with the rise of secular a scripture that is to say literature imagined

143
00:09:55.411 --> 00:10:00.411
as something both terribly important and also difficult to understand naturally

144
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.420
the arts and sciences of Hermeneutics,

145
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.890
hermeneutics begin to enter that field.
And in particular,

146
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.100
the great theologian of the Romantic period,

147
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:15.750
Friedrich Schleiermacher devoted his career to,
uh,

148
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.760
principles of hermeneutics that were meant to be applied as much to literature

149
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.220
as to the study of scripture,
uh,

150
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.280
and established a tradition in which it was understood that literature was a

151
00:10:29.311 --> 00:10:31.890
central focus of hermeneutics.

152
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.140
So that's then for the history of,
of Hermeneutics,
the,
uh,

153
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.700
the work of,
of,

154
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.850
of dill tire on the turn of the century of Heidegger in his being in time 1927

155
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.300
of God Umer,
who in many ways,
uh,

156
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.010
can be understood as a disciple and student of Heidegger.
Uh,

157
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.710
and the,
and a tradition which presents today,
um,

158
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.790
follows from the initial engagements of Schleiermacher during the romantic

159
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:05.670
period with literature.
All right,

160
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:10.671
so what is the basic problematic for hermeneutics in this tradition?

161
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.270
It's what we probably all have heard about.
Um,

162
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.380
and something that I will briefly try to describe what's called the hermaneutic

163
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.570
circle.
So what is the hermaneutic circle?

164
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.930
It's a relationship between a reader,

165
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.670
add a text,

166
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.920
or in the case of certain kinds of students of Hermeneutics,

167
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:35.731
but not gone.
I'm,

168
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:40.731
or I think of a relationship between a reader and an author.

169
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.710
In other words,
a relationship which is,
which is,

170
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:48.711
which is understood to aim at understanding the intention of an author,

171
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.680
the author of the forth quotation on your sheet today,

172
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.680
ed Hirsch belongs in that tradition,

173
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.890
who understands the hermaneutic circle as a relationship between a reader and an

174
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:07.231
author where the text is a kind of immediate Tory document containing the

175
00:12:07.871 --> 00:12:12.280
meaning of the author but forgot him or,
and his tradition.

176
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.270
It's a little different.

177
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.480
It can be understood as the relationship between a reader and a text.

178
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.820
And this can be put in a variety of ways.
Uh,

179
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:26.320
it's often put in terms of the relationship between the part and the whole.

180
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.670
I approached a text,
um,

181
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.980
and of course the first thing I read is a phrase or sentence.

182
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.340
There's still a lot more of the text.
And so that's,
that's a part.

183
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.150
But I immediately began to form an opinion about this heart,

184
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.680
this part with respect to an imagined or supposed hole.

185
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.110
And then,
you know,
I,

186
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:52.111
and I use the sense I have of what the whole must be like to continue to read

187
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.350
successive parts.
What is,
what success is.
This was excessive parts,
lines,
uh,

188
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.280
sentences,
whatever they may be.

189
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.520
And I keep referring those successive parts back to a sense of the whole which

190
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:11.251
changes as a result of knowing more and more and more parts.

191
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.280
And so the circularity of this interpretive engagement has to do with moving

192
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:22.561
back and forth between a certain preconception about the hole that I form from

193
00:13:24.461 --> 00:13:28.990
studying apart,
moving then to the part back to the whole,

194
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.780
back to the part,
back to the whole and so on,

195
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.240
in a circular pattern.

196
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.160
This can also be understood as the relationship between the present and the
past.

197
00:13:39.161 --> 00:13:43.530
That is to say my particular historical horizon,
uh,

198
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:48.580
and some other historicals horizon that I'm trying to come to terms with.

199
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.240
Uh,
so that I refer back and forth to,

200
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.100
to what I know about the world before I engage the tax.
Uh,

201
00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.700
what the text's seems to scene seems to be saying in relation to that,

202
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:04.800
which I know how it might change my sense of what I know.
Ah,

203
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.720
but referring back from what I know,
uh,

204
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.400
continuously to an understanding of the way in which the past text speaks.

205
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.110
And finally,
of course,

206
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:19.111
because hermeneutics isn't just something that takes place across and historical

207
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.404
golf,

208
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.210
it also can take place across a social or cultural golf,

209
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.670
maybe not even very much of a Gulf.

210
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.520
When we engage each other in conversation,

211
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.060
we are still performing our hermaneutic act.

212
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:39.150
I have to try to understand what you're saying and I have to refer it to what I

213
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:40.150
want to say.

214
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.360
And the circuit of communication between us has to stay open as a result of this

215
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:50.680
mutual and developing understanding of what we're talking about.

216
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.730
Uh,
and it's the same thing of course with conversations across cultures.

217
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.880
So understand that hermeneutics isn't necessarily about as as God him or would

218
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:04.010
put it merging historical horizons.

219
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.160
It's also about merging social and cultural and interpersonal horizons and it,

220
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.450
and it applies to all of those spheres.

221
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.870
All right?
Now the hermeneutic circle then is,
uh,

222
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.040
of this is sort of involves this reference back and forth between the entities

223
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.300
that I've been trying to describe.
And let's just quickly uh,

224
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:33.070
and here we begin to move into the tax.
Let's let us up.
Uh,

225
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.140
listen to God Homer's version of how the circularity of this thinking works on

226
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:43.280
paid seven 22 toward the bottom of the left hand column.

227
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.480
The reader got hammers where it is he the reader projects before himself a

228
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:56.000
meaning for the text as a whole,

229
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.400
as soon as some initial meaning emerges in the text.

230
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.360
In other words,

231
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600
as soon as he sees what the part is like he projects or imagine what the whole

232
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:14.230
must be that contains this part again the ladder.

233
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.260
That is to say the,

234
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:22.300
the sense of the initial meaning emerges only because he is reading the text

235
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.500
with particular expectations in regard to a certain meaning.

236
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.710
The working out of this four project,

237
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.740
that is to say the sense we have in advance of the meaning of what we are going

238
00:16:37.551 --> 00:16:42.551
to read the working out of this four project which is constantly revised in

239
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:49.541
terms of what emerges as he penetrates into the meaning is understood as what is

240
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.320
there.
In other words,
God,
that what is there,

241
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.600
which is a kind of way of talking that got them or inherits from Heidegger,
uh,

242
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.820
really has to do with what got them or means when he talks also about dissoc the

243
00:17:04.421 --> 00:17:07.040
subject matter.
In other words,

244
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.130
they effort of a reader and coming to terms with the meaning of a text is an

245
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.920
effort to master the subject matter.

246
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.210
What is there.
Uh,
and I suppose it's fair enough to say,
uh,

247
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.640
it as a kind of paraphrase what the text is really about.

248
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.850
I mean that that's what got him or means when he says what is there anyway,

249
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:35.060
you can say that in this passage on page seven 22,

250
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.240
God is describing the circularity of our reading and he's describing it in a way

251
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:45.560
that may raise certain concerns for us.

252
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.550
What do you mean a four structure or a four project?
Uh,

253
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:52.380
for having cat?

254
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.430
I view this thing as we might say objectively.

255
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.683
In other words,

256
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.190
aren't I going to be hopelessly prejudiced about what I read?

257
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.780
If I've got some sort of preliminary conception of what it's all about?

258
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:11.810
Why don't I just set aside my pro preliminary conceptions so that I can

259
00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:15.060
understand precisely what is there,

260
00:18:15.061 --> 00:18:19.080
how am I ever going to understand what is there if I approached,
if I,

261
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:23.640
if I approach it with some sort of preliminary idea,

262
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.530
which I never really get rid of.

263
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:30.030
I mean because each revision of what I think is there as a result of further

264
00:18:30.031 --> 00:18:35.030
reading is nevertheless becomes in itself yet another four project or

265
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.500
preliminary conception.
In other words,

266
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.060
this way of thinking seems to suggest to tell you the truth does suggest that

267
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:47.061
you can't get away from preliminary conceptions about things and this of course

268
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:50.820
is disturbing and it's,

269
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:55.240
and it's especially disturbing when you then get Heidegger and god him or

270
00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.350
insisting that even though there are always these preliminary conceptions which

271
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:03.810
got them or sort of boldly calls,
prejudices,

272
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:08.550
and we'll come back to that even though there are always these preliminary

273
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:09.241
conceptions,

274
00:19:09.241 --> 00:19:14.120
there nevertheless are as Heidegger puts it two ways into the circle,
right?

275
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.080
A circle in other words is not necessarily a vicious circle.
See,

276
00:19:19.081 --> 00:19:21.690
that's what you're attempted to conclude.
If you say,

277
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.860
I can never get away from preconceptions,
right?

278
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.770
It's just I'm just going back and forth meaninglessly because I'm never going to

279
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:33.180
get anyplace.
Right?
Um,
but God ever and Heidegger say,
no,
that's not true.

280
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.550
That's not true.
Circle isn't at all necessarily vicious.

281
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.260
The way into the circle can also be constructive.

282
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.770
That is to say you really can get someplace.

283
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.190
And so you're entitled to say,
well,
okay,

284
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.700
it can be constructive,
but how can that be?

285
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.450
Take a look at the second passage on your sheet from Heidegger,

286
00:19:57.451 --> 00:19:58.680
not the whole passage,

287
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:02.670
but just the first sentence of it where Heidegger says,

288
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.500
in an interpretation,

289
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:10.850
the way in which the entity we are interpreting is to be conceived,

290
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.610
can be drawn from the entity itself,

291
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.240
or the interpretation can force the entity into concepts to which it is opposed

292
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:23.940
in its manner of being.
Now,
wait a minute.
You say,

293
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.760
if I'm just dealing in preconceptions here,

294
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:30.600
how can I take anything from the entity itself?
Right?

295
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.210
That's just what seems to be a at risk.
Uh,

296
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.400
if I can never get beyond my preconceptions,
well,
let me give you an example.

297
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:41.970
I was going to do this later in the lecture,
but I feel like doing it now.
Um,

298
00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.070
in the,
in the 18th century,
uh,
a port named Mark Akin side wrote a long poem,

299
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.120
the pleasures of the imagination.
And in this poem there's the line,

300
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.110
the great creator raised his plastic arm.

301
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.400
Now let's say that we are of course we're into polymers.

302
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:04.870
We know what plastic is.
We have no,

303
00:21:04.871 --> 00:21:08.890
we have no concern or hesitation and insane what,

304
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.820
what plastic is.
And so we say,
Oh gee,

305
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.590
well I guess the create great Creator has a sort of a prosthetic limb.
Um,

306
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.740
and uh,
and he raised it all right.
So that's,
that's,

307
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.250
that's what the sentence must mean.
Um,

308
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.710
but then of course if we know something about the horizon within which ache

309
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.930
inside was riding his poem,
we are aware that in the 18th century,

310
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.850
the word plastic men send us powerful,
flexible.

311
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.910
And in that case,
of course,

312
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.940
we immediately are able to recognize what ache inside men,

313
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.560
why it makes perfect sense.
Great,
great creator raised his sinuous powerful,

314
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:56.530
flexible arm.
Um,
and we know where we stand.

315
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.610
Now notice this there.
In other words,

316
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:03.430
this is an example of good and bad prejudice,
right?

317
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.870
The good prejudice is our prior awareness.

318
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.680
That plastic meant something different in the 18th century that it means now.

319
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.180
And we bring that prejudice to bear on our interpretation of the line,

320
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.490
and that is a constructive way into the circle according to Heidegger and got

321
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:24.550
him.

322
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.840
Or the bad prejudice is when we leap to the conclusion without thinking for a

323
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:33.280
moment that there might be some other historical horizon that we know what

324
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:34.360
plastic means.

325
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.580
And the reason we can tell the difference by the way,

326
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.740
is that if we invoke the 18th century meaning of plastic,

327
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:47.920
we immediately see that the line makes perfect sense,

328
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:52.690
that it's perfectly reasonable and not even particularly notable or,
and if we,

329
00:22:52.691 --> 00:22:54.700
but if we bring our own meaning to bear,

330
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:57.790
that is to say our own sense of what the word plastic means,

331
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.790
then of course the meaning of the line must be crazy.
I mean,

332
00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:03.340
what on earth do you know why?

333
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.820
Why would he be saying this about the great creator?
Now,

334
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.360
I think I'll come back to this example next week when we're talking about an

335
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:14.140
essay called the intentional fallacy by wk website.

336
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.500
And I will revisit the possibility that there might be some value in supposing

337
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.790
that ache inside meant,
uh,
the great creator raised his prosthetic limb.

338
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.180
But I'll leave that,
but I'll leave that until next week.

339
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.650
I think for the moment it should be playing to you that this is a good example

340
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:37.210
or a good way of understanding what the difference between a useful

341
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:42.330
preconception and a useless preconception brought to bear on an interpretive act

342
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.570
might consistent all right now and giving the example.

343
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:51.590
Now I've gotten a little bit,
uh,
ahead of myself.
Uh,
but so,

344
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.840
so let me reprise a bit.

345
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.890
As you can tell from your reading of God's word and of course the title of the

346
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.250
Great Book from which this excerpt is taking his truth and method bar height may

347
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:09.251
toda with its implicit suggestion that there is a difference between truth and

348
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.420
method.
Uh,

349
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:16.750
the great objection of God and her two other people's way of doing hermeneutics

350
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.450
is that they believe that there is a methodology of interpretation and the basic

351
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:28.601
methodology God him or is attacking in the excerpt you've read is what he calls

352
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.230
historicism.

353
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.640
Now that's a tricky word for us because later in the semester we're going to be

354
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.030
reading about something called the new historicism and the new historicism

355
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:44.050
actually has nothing to do with what God or is objecting to in this form of

356
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:45.651
historicism.

357
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:50.150
So we will return to the newest stores and that contact was it for the moment,

358
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.400
what God remains by historicism.

359
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.460
Is this the belief that you can set aside preconception,

360
00:24:58.460 --> 00:24:59.270
in other words,

361
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.130
that you can completely factor out your own subjectivity,

362
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:08.660
your own view of things,
your own historically conditioned point of view.

363
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.230
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said historically condition your own point of view.

364
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.650
You can completely factor that out in order to enter into the mindset of some

365
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:25.901
other time or place that you can completely enter into the mind of another.

366
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.800
This then is the op.
This is the object of historicizing.

367
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.750
Um,
and as we'll see at the end of the lecture,
uh,

368
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.860
there's a certain nobility about it to be juxtaposed with the nobility of God

369
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:44.150
Omarion hermeneutics.
But in the meantime,

370
00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:47.420
God has objected to this because he says,

371
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.550
you simply can't do this.

372
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.420
You cannot factor out these preconceptions.

373
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.270
All you can do,
he says,

374
00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.620
is recognize that you do exist.
You do live.

375
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:03.740
You do think consciously within a certain horizon,

376
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.430
recognize that you are coming face to face with another horizon and tried to

377
00:26:10.791 --> 00:26:15.530
bridge your horizon and the other horizon.
In other words,

378
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.850
to put it simply defined,

379
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.960
common ground to find some way of merging a present with a past a here,

380
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:31.571
whether they're in such a way that results in what God him or calls Hori Hori

381
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:36.590
taunts Farish Nelson,
horizon merger,
uh,

382
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.430
and this and this act of horizon merger,
uh,

383
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.070
has as its effect,
uh,
as its result,

384
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.780
what God ever calls effective history.
And by effective history,

385
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.500
he means history,
which is useful.
That is to say history,

386
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:57.501
which really can go to work for us and is not just a matter of accumulating an

387
00:26:57.931 --> 00:27:01.970
archive or distancing ourselves from the past.
Uh,

388
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.600
I'll say again,
somewhat in advanced perhaps of the time I should say it,

389
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.610
that God them or thinks that there's something immoral about historicism.
Why?

390
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.450
Because it condescends toward the past.

391
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.630
It's supposes that the past is simply a repository of information and it never

392
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:27.171
suppose for a minute that if we actually merge ourselves with the moment of the

393
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:32.970
past,
the past may be able to tell us something we ought to know.

394
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.520
That is to say,
may be able,
uh,

395
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.670
actually to teach us something God him or believes that historicism for gets the

396
00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:46.971
possibility of being taught something by passiveness or otherness.

397
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.570
Now,
I think in order to make this,

398
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.400
this viewpoint seem plausible,

399
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.620
we probably should study it for a moment a little bit more philosophically.

400
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.510
That is to say,
uh,
you're asking yourself,
well,
sure,
you know what?

401
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.810
I can,
and I,
I pride myself on this.

402
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.960
I can factor out all forms of subjectivity.

403
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.610
I really can be objective.

404
00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:20.140
I'm perfectly capable of understanding the past in and for itself without any

405
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:22.320
contribution of my own,

406
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.530
without in short any preconceptions.

407
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.860
So let's look at a couple of facet just from your sheet,
uh,

408
00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:34.650
from Heidegger's being in time from his analytic of the hermeneutic circle.
Um,

409
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.820
and see what Heidegger has to say about this claim.

410
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.950
The first passage on your sheet,
Heidegger says,

411
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.990
when we have to do with anything,

412
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.760
the mirror scene of the things which are closest to us,

413
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.340
bears and itself,

414
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:58.490
the structure of interpretation and in so primordial a manner that just to grasp

415
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.520
something free as it were of the Az requires a certain adjustment.

416
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.890
What does Heidegger Sang?
He Sang,

417
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.430
I stand here and I,

418
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.020
and I'm just looking on just,

419
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.160
I look back there and I,
I,

420
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.730
I'm just seeing that sign that says exit.

421
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.780
I'm not interpreting it.
I don't have any preconception about it.

422
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.530
I'm just looking right?
Heidegger says,

423
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:32.550
this is a total illusion.
How do I know it's a sign?

424
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:34.830
How do I know it says exit?
How do I mean?

425
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.860
I bring a million preconceptions to bear on what I take to be a simple act of

426
00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:44.650
looking and then the girl says,
you know what?

427
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:50.020
It's not an all an interesting to imagine the possibility of just seeing

428
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.540
something without seeing it as something.

429
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.210
It would be kind of exhilarating wouldn't it,

430
00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.370
to be able just to have something before us.
Right,

431
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.750
but he says,
you know what,
that is well nigh impossible.

432
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.210
It is in fact a very,

433
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:12.211
very difficult and derivative act of the mind to try to forget that.

434
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.040
I'm looking at a sign that says exit and in fact just to be looking at what is

435
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:25.930
there without knowing.
In other words,

436
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.920
I don't not know first that that's a sign that says exit.

437
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:34.210
The very first thing I know is that it's a sign that says exit.

438
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.090
There is no prior act of consciousness.

439
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.730
It's the very first thing that I know.

440
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:45.270
It's an interesting thought experiment to try not to know that that's a sign

441
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:49.090
that says exit and as of your points out in this passage,

442
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.980
that's a thought experiment,

443
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:55.981
which if it can be done at all derives from that prior knowledge.

444
00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.620
I always know something first as something if I can just have it there before

445
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:05.014
me.

446
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.200
That is a very difficult and derivative intellectual act and it cannot be

447
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:16.270
understood as primordial or primitive.
You know,

448
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.720
I am always already in possession of an interpretation of whatever object I look

449
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:28.330
at,
which isn't at all to say that my interpretation is correct.

450
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.120
It's only to say that I can't escape the fact that the very first movement of

451
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:38.140
mine,
not the last movement,
but the first movement of mine is interpreted.

452
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.363
All right.

453
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.400
We always see something as something and that is precisely the act of

454
00:31:45.071 --> 00:31:46.030
interpretation.

455
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:51.570
We can never just have it there before us or as I say if we can,

456
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.930
if we can.
It's a very,
very difficult act.

457
00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:01.480
Continue the passage,
this grasping,
which as which is free of the,

458
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:06.510
as is a privation of the kind of seeing and you see how attracted Heidegger is

459
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:12.040
to it because he shifts his rhetoric is a privation of the kind of seeing in

460
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:14.770
which one merely understands.

461
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.970
And other words it would be an extraordinary thing not to understand.

462
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:22.870
Heidegger is saying we can't help understanding.

463
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.950
We always already understand,
which has nothing to do.

464
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:30.070
Again with whether or not we're right or wrong,

465
00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.930
we always already just necessarily do understand.

466
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:39.200
It's a kind of imprisonment understanding and I,
and when Heidegger says,

467
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.880
wouldn't it be great not to have to merely understand,
right?
He's saying,

468
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:47.540
wouldn't it be great just to have it there before us,

469
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.710
but he's also insisting that this is an incredibly difficult,

470
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:56.660
if not impossible moment of thought.
All right?
So

471
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:03.700
that's why this is,
this is perhaps the essential,
the central passage and you,

472
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.060
and I don't want to pause over it,

473
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:08.030
but you can look at passage number three on your sheet,

474
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:12.650
which says roughly again what Heidegger is saying and the first passage.

475
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.170
That's why,
uh,

476
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.210
we must work always as interpreters with preconceptions,

477
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.630
with four understandings.
Now what about this word prejudice?

478
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.770
It is a sort of a problematic word.
Uh,
God,

479
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.190
her is a bit apologetic about it and he goes into the appropriate etymologies.

480
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.090
You know,

481
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:37.090
the French praise Uj the German for or tile all mean prejudgment,

482
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.960
uh,
a prior judgment,
uh,

483
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:44.870
and they actually can be used in a court of law as a stage toward arriving at a

484
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:46.030
verdict.
Um,

485
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:51.190
they need to be accompanied by popular prejudice against prejudice as gardener

486
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.010
says,
this is the characteristic.
Uh,

487
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.040
this is the characteristic idea of the enlightenment.

488
00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.480
It's prejudice against prejudice that we can be objective,

489
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:06.710
that we can free ourselves of press.
Okay,
fine.
But,
uh,
you know,

490
00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:11.180
prejudice is bad.
You know,
we have,
we have it right to do.
I mean,

491
00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:13.850
we know prejudice is bad.
We know,
uh,

492
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:18.410
we know what prejudice has ra historically and socially.

493
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.680
So how so,
how can we try to vindicate it in this way?
It's,

494
00:34:21.681 --> 00:34:23.240
it's extremely problematic.

495
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:27.160
What got them or does in his essay is actually,
uh,

496
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.620
an active intellectual conservatism.
It has to be admitted.

497
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.030
That whole section of the essay in which he talks about classicism and you may

498
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.920
have said to yourself as you were reading it,
well gee,

499
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:38.720
isn't this sort of digressive what's he,

500
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.490
what's he so interested in classicism for the whole section of the essay which

501
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:46.580
he's talking about classicism and which he,

502
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:51.581
which he later calls tradition is meant to suggest that we really can't merge

503
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:56.891
horizons effectively unless we have a very broad and extensive common ground

504
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:04.160
with what we're reading.
And the great thing about classicism forgot them or,

505
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:09.161
or what he calls tradition is that it's something we can share the classical got

506
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:11.720
him or argues is that,

507
00:35:11.721 --> 00:35:16.430
which doesn't just speak to its own historical moment but speaks for all time,

508
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.660
speaks to all of us in different ways but does speak to us.

509
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:25.100
That is to say does proffer its claim to speak true.

510
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.820
They're classical can do that.
Okay Great.

511
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.480
We say it had gotten over that and and certainly your,

512
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.540
you're entitled to an intellectually conservative Canon.

513
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.530
Maybe other principles of hermeneutics.

514
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:41.550
We'll place much more stress on innovation or novelty or difference.

515
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.320
But you know,
you're a little,
you're,

516
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.370
you're not sure people can understand unless they share a great deal of common

517
00:35:47.371 --> 00:35:49.860
ground all well and good.
But you know what,

518
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:54.790
that's where the bad side of prejudice sneaks in.
You know,
slavery,
um,

519
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.890
was considered perfectly appropriate and natural to the,

520
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:03.980
to a great many of the most exalted figures working within the tradition that

521
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:07.920
God,
I'm are rightly calls classical classical antiquity,

522
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.720
a great many modern figures never stopped to question slavery.

523
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:17.990
Slavery was eight was an aspect of classical culture which had its defenses.

524
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.320
Well God or it doesn't talk about this obviously,

525
00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.440
but it is an aspect of that prejudice that one might share with tradition if one

526
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:34.041
worked somewhat more critical than this gesture of sharing might indicate.

527
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.430
I just say that in passing,
um,
uh,

528
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.520
calling your attention to it as a risk that's involved in our engagement with a

529
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:49.500
hermaneutic project,
uh,
of the nature of God hammers.
Uh,

530
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.363
and it's,

531
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.290
it's not to say the God and her favorite slavery or anything of the sort.
It is,

532
00:36:55.291 --> 00:36:58.440
however,
to say that prejudice,

533
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:03.530
while plainly we can understand it simply to mean preconception,

534
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:08.730
which is inescapable and understand that philosophically,
nevertheless,

535
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.190
can still be bad.
And we have to,
and,
and,
and,

536
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.290
and we have to understand,
uh,

537
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.210
the way in which it's something that if we're going to accept this point of view

538
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:23.070
we need to live with all right now.
So it is troublesome.

539
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.350
It is troublesome and it's,
it's,
it's,
it's troublesome.
Uh,

540
00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.760
also perhaps,
uh,
in a variety of other ways that I won't go into.

541
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:37.790
I think that what I'd like to do in the time remaining is to call your attention

542
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.420
to two passages.
One in God hammers text,

543
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:44.340
which I'm about to read.
And the other,

544
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:49.210
the fourth passage on your sheet by a,
uh,

545
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.910
by someone called Ed Hirsch,

546
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:55.911
whom you may actually know as the author of a dictionary of what every school

547
00:37:56.611 --> 00:37:58.380
child should know,
uh,

548
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:03.120
and as a an and as a sort of a champion of the intellectual right during the

549
00:38:03.121 --> 00:38:06.210
whole period when,
uh,
literary theory flourished.

550
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:11.190
But a person who also is seriously invested in Hermeneutics,
uh,

551
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:16.110
and,
and conducted a lifelong feud with God or,
uh,

552
00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:18.030
about the principles of hermeneutics.

553
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:20.650
And the two passages that I'm about to read,
um,

554
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.670
juxtapose the viewpoints that I've been trying to evoke,
uh,

555
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:28.110
in describing got him or his position,

556
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.590
the dignity and nobility of God gardener is that it involves being interested in

557
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.500
what it in something true that is to say and hoping that there is an intimate

558
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:46.141
relationship between meaning arriving at meaning and arriving at something that

559
00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:50.640
speaks to us as true.

560
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.920
Hirsch on the other hand,
is invoking a completely different kind of dignity.

561
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:01.960
And what I want you to realize as we juxtapose these two passages is that it is

562
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:04.900
impossible to reconcile them.
Uh,

563
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:10.050
and it poses for us a choice which as people interested in interpretation,

564
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:12.550
uh,

565
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:17.550
needs ultimately to be made and suggests perhaps differing forms of commitment.

566
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.581
Now,

567
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:23.581
the first passage is in God amorous text on page seven 35,

568
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.600
very bottom of the page.
And then I'll be going over to page seven 36

569
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.250
God ever says.
And here again,
he's attacking historicism.

570
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.880
The texts that is understood historically is forced to abandon its claim.

571
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.150
That it is uttering something true.

572
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:49.020
We think we understand when we see the past from a historical standpoint,

573
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.620
I e place ourselves in the historical situation and seek to reconstruct the

574
00:39:56.741 --> 00:40:01.090
historical horizon.
I've been attempting to summarize this position.

575
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.410
And so I trust that I trust that it's easily intelligible as,

576
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.650
as I read it to you now.
In fact,
however,

577
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.980
we have given up the claim to find in the past any truth valid and intelligible

578
00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:20.620
for ourselves.
And by the way,
this would also apply to cultural conversation.

579
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.390
You know,
I mean,
if I'm proud of knowing that in another culture,

580
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.200
if I Belch after dinner,
it's a compliment to the cook.
Right.

581
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.930
And if I'm proud of knowing that without,
you know,

582
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.300
without drawing any conclusions from it,

583
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:38.860
that's sort of the equivalent of historicism.
It's just a factoid for me.

584
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.920
In other words,
it's not,
you know,
it's not,

585
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.110
it's not an effort to come to terms with anything.
It's not,

586
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.650
it's not an an effort to engage in dialogue.

587
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.890
It's just historicizing otherness.

588
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.360
In a way that some or other satisfies my quest for information.

589
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.810
That's what's so,
so it's not just a question of the past,
as I say,

590
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:03.640
and as I've said before,
it's a question of cultural conversation,
uh,
as well.

591
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.833
Uh,

592
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:10.050
thus this acknowledgement of the otherness of the other which makes him the

593
00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:16.050
object of objective knowledge involves the fundamental suspension of his claim

594
00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:22.170
to truth.
Devastating,
I think.

595
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.180
Brilliant argument and I think ought to remind us of what's at stake when we

596
00:41:27.971 --> 00:41:32.971
invoke the notion of objectivity implicit according to gardener and the notion

597
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:39.101
of objectivity is an abandonment of the possibility of learning from the object

598
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.110
of learning from otherness.
It all,

599
00:41:46.111 --> 00:41:50.480
it becomes a question of knowing the object of knowing it in and for itself in

600
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:55.481
its own terms and not at all necessarily of learning from it,

601
00:41:55.610 --> 00:42:00.410
of being spoken to by it.
All right.
But now listen to Hirsch,
right?

602
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.560
This is,
you know,
I mean it's,
this is really,

603
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.730
this is really a hard choice to make.
What her says,

604
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.170
invoking con rightly invoking con,
he says,

605
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:17.171
con held it to be a foundation of moral action that men should be conceived as

606
00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:22.190
ends in themselves,
not as instruments of other men and other words.

607
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.390
You are an end and not a means to me,

608
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.070
unless in fact I'm exploiting you and instrumentalizing you.
Right?

609
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.190
That's cons position and that's what hers is leaping to defend.

610
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.050
You know this idea,

611
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.200
you know that it that I don't really care or that I don't really think I can

612
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:47.110
come to terms with the actual sort of with,

613
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:52.230
with the actual meaning of an entity as that entity is instrumentalizing the

614
00:42:53.721 --> 00:42:58.250
entity and other,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's approaching it for me.
This,
this,

615
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:02.330
this turns the whole idea of being open to the possibility that the other is

616
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:07.130
speaking true.
Excuse me.
It turns that on its ear and says,
oh,
no,
no,

617
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:10.610
you're just appropriating the other for yourself.
Right?

618
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.170
You're instrumentalizing the other.
You're not taking it seriously as itself.

619
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.190
That's what,
that's,
that's Hirsch's response and he continues.

620
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.100
This imperative is transferable to the words of men,

621
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.760
because speech is an extension and expression of men in the social domain.

622
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:36.850
And also because when we fail to conjoin a man's intention to his words,

623
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.770
we lose the soul of speech,

624
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.920
which is to convey meaning and to understand what is intended to be conveyed.

625
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:50.530
Notice that although the nobility of this alongside the nobility of gardener is

626
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.220
obvious and painful and really does seem to see to bring us to a crossroads,

627
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:03.320
you know where we really want to be Yogi Berra,
right?
And Go in both directions.

628
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.380
You know,
even though this is the case,
notice one thing,

629
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.740
hers is not saying anything about truth,
right?

630
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.550
He's talking about meaning.
That's good.
And he's,
and he,

631
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.580
and he's making the notion of arriving at a correct meaning as honorific as he

632
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:22.480
possibly can,
but it's insignificant,

633
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.520
but he's not talking about truth.
It's got them,

634
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:28.020
or who's talking about truth for her.

635
00:44:28.021 --> 00:44:30.650
So the important thing is the meaning for God.

636
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.720
The important thing is that the meaning be true,
right?

637
00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:39.810
And that's,
and that's where the,
that's where the distinction essentially lies.

638
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.920
God of are as willing to sacrifice because of his belief in the,

639
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:44.961
in the,

640
00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:49.961
in escape ability of preconception is willing to sacrifice historical or

641
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:52.680
cultural exactitude of meaning.

642
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.120
He's willing to acknowledge that there's always something of me in my

643
00:44:57.121 --> 00:45:00.840
interpretation,
but it's a good something because after all,

644
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:04.590
I am mindful of,
of the horizon of otherness.

645
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:07.440
I'm not just saying plastic means polymer,
right?

646
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.000
But nevertheless,
this something of me in the interpretation,

647
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:16.020
Hirsch is saying there's nothing of me and the interpretation.

648
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.980
Therefore I am able to arrive accurately and objectively at the meaning of the

649
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:24.743
other.

650
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.750
And I honor the other by arriving with such accuracy at the meeting.

651
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.700
But notice the tooth is bracketed out.
I mean,
it's not,

652
00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.040
it doesn't seem to be a question for Hershey of whether the other speaks true.

653
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.680
This is unfair to her,
by the way,
because it actually is all you do.

654
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.040
All you need to do is read him and you will recognize that it does matter to

655
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:48.810
Hirsch whether the other speaks true,

656
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:53.010
but it's not implicit in the philosophical position.
He's taking up here.

657
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.990
It's something that the philosophical position sacrifices.
Okay.

658
00:45:57.991 --> 00:46:01.800
So that's the basic distinction.
And as I say,
as far as I can see,

659
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.730
it's irreconcilable.
So you know,

660
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:08.940
it leaves us with a choice that really does have to be made and it's a choice

661
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:14.060
which looms over a course in literary theory and coming to understand the

662
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:18.210
tradition of literary theory.
So I'm,
we'll take one side,

663
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:23.450
others will take another and we'll find ourselves a siding or not siding with

664
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:24.060
them,

665
00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:29.060
at least in part for reasons that arise out of the distinction between these two

666
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:31.800
positions that I've been making today.
Okay?

667
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:34.830
So we may or may not have the lecture on Eser,

668
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.850
but on Tuesday we'll be getting into the varieties of formalism.

669
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.720
And first we'll take up the American new criticism.
All right.
Thanks.
