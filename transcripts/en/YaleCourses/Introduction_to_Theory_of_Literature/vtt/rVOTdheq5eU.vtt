1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.550
Well,
I'd like to welcome the,
uh,
prospective students.
Uh,

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.490
hi.
I won't say the word Yaley prematurely,
but I of course,
I hope you all come.

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.170
And,
uh,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.210
I wish I had a chance to provide a little context for what I'm going to say

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:19.290
today,
but,
uh,

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970
maybe we'll scramble into some sense of things as we go along.
Uh,

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.950
this,
this lecture,
uh,
concerns,
uh,
an essay,

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.970
uh,

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.970
written to immediate a widespread acclaim and controversy by two young at the

10
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:43.491
time quite an influential and untenured scholars trying to make their way in the

11
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.790
world.
Um,
they certainly succeeded with this,

12
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.850
with this essay which was published in critical inquiry then certainly the

13
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.810
leading,
uh,

14
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:58.710
Oregon for the dissemination of innovative theoretical ideas.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.450
And they were,
um,
uh,
generally speaking,
uh,

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.490
gratified by the results.

17
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:10.491
Almost immediately the editors of critical inquiry decided to publish together

18
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:13.170
with,
against theory in book form,

19
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:18.090
decided to publish a series of responses to against theory.

20
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.780
All of them thought of polite,
uh,

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420
careful a thought through responses,

22
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.440
which made it very interesting thin book,
uh,
which,
uh,
which,
which is,

23
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:32.250
is still available.
I think it's still in print.
Um,

24
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.330
and well worth having if you take an interest in the controversies that the,

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.380
that the article generated.
And of course I'm hoping,
uh,

26
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:45.120
in the time remaining to get you to take an interest in them.
Uh,
now been,

27
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:50.121
Michael's were then still are a what's called neo pragmatists,

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.120
which is to say,
um,

29
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.510
they are influenced most immediately by an important book,
uh,

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.620
written in the 1970s by the philosopher Richard Rorty called philosophy and the

31
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:07.220
mirror of nature.
Uh,
but,
but roared,

32
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.210
he riding in a tradition that goes back through the important work of John Dewey

33
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:16.170
in the 1930s and forties.
And before then,
uh,

34
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200
not only to the Great Philosophical Interventions of William James Henry James,

35
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:22.440
his brother,
uh,

36
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:27.441
but also a theory of signs by Charles Sanders purse,

37
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.730
um,
uh,
theory,
PE I our CE a theory,

38
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:35.810
which at the time,
uh,
didn't generate,
uh,

39
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.310
too much recognition or controversy.

40
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.310
It was taken up by the so called Cambridge School of literary critics headed by

41
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.400
a Richards,
he and Ck Ogden road,

42
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.070
some reflections on purses,
semiotics.

43
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.830
But today with pragmatism,
neo pragmatism,
uh,

44
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.920
a fairly important strain in academic,
theoretical and literary,

45
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.180
uh,

46
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.810
persons semiotics is inner way receiving more attention.

47
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.860
Uh,

48
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.860
in a way it's in a way also challenging the head Germany in the field of

49
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.380
literary theory of so sewers,
semiotics,

50
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.530
this sense of the sign as something different from what so Sarah said it was,

51
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.950
is going to be the underlying theme of the central.

52
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.951
The second and central part of of this lecture 1982 was probably the high

53
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.750
watermark,

54
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.730
both of the fascination and the frustration with literary theory in this

55
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.560
country.
It was a hot button topic.
Uh,

56
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.730
we've gone into this before in ways that it is not really today that are our

57
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.540
interest in literary theory as at least in part historical one might want to
say,

58
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.030
uh,
in 1982 though,

59
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.150
where you stood on these matters just made all the difference and it was in that

60
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:02.350
atmosphere that nap and Michael's is against theory,
uh,
was published.

61
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.680
Now as I say,
they were neo pragmatist.

62
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.360
And what that means basically is that one knows things,

63
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.230
which is the same thing as to say that one believes things,

64
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.820
one act in the world unhesitatingly as an agent.

65
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.980
It all sort of everything that matters in being human has to do with one's

66
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:25.450
powers of agency,

67
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.930
but that there are no actual foundations in what we can know objectively for our

68
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.410
beliefs and actions.
In other words,
it's a physician,
uh,

69
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.710
which is called [inaudible] or Antifa [inaudible] list,

70
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.750
but not a position that as such a position might imply,

71
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:47.260
uh,

72
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.260
somehow entails Neil ism or are kind of crippling radical skepticism.

73
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.910
Uh,
on the contrary,

74
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.320
it's a position that insists that we just do what we do,

75
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.010
that we are always doing thinking,
believing,

76
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.930
saying something that we are always,
uh,
exerting an influence,

77
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.950
um,
as social beings and our surroundings.
Uh,

78
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.010
and that the only thing that needn't concern us about our powers of agency is

79
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:22.360
that perhaps we don't really have a full,
adequate,

80
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.430
an objective account of how and why it is that we do and say and believe and

81
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:32.800
influence things in the way that we do.
So that the,
that,

82
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:37.801
that position is essentially the position taken up in Napa and Michael's now you

83
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.640
saw it last time already,
uh,
in the essay of Stanley fish,

84
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.740
Stanley fish who takes it,

85
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.800
that we are largely produced by the interpretive community to which we belong,

86
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.330
uh,

87
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.330
his understanding of this community as that which constitutes our values.

88
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.720
In other words,
nothing intrinsic to ourselves.
Uh,

89
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.730
nothing unique in our own modes of perception,

90
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:09.310
but rather the ways in which our educational circumstances,
uh,

91
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.620
uh,
bring us to believe and understand things.

92
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.430
This too is a neo pragmatist position.

93
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.050
Now you notice that in the third part of the not nap and Michael's essay,
uh,

94
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:25.010
they engage in a kind of polite disagreement with fish.
Uh,

95
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.080
they are under the,
there is an underlying,
very broad disagreement with him.

96
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.880
But remember in the third part of the essay they're talking about the synonym

97
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:37.820
Mitie the identity of knowledge and belief.

98
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.860
And they point to a particular passage in one of fishes arguments where he kind

99
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:47.861
of slipped in to the idea that on the one hand you have knowledge and then the

100
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:53.840
on the other hand you have in relation to that knowledge,
uh,
belief.
And they say,

101
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.050
no,
no,
no,
no.
You can't separate knowledge and belief.
Um,

102
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.910
and just on those grounds they disagree with fish and fish writes one of the

103
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:03.890
responses,
uh,
in the book.

104
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.850
This then subsequently published concerning against theory,

105
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:12.190
but it's a completely friendly controversy about,
uh,
about,
uh,

106
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.790
a transitory and superficial matter.
And as a matter of fact,

107
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.500
while I'm going to pay a lot of attention to the first two arguments there,

108
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.990
they're basically three arguments in this essay.

109
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.590
I'm going to pay very little attention to the third argument,

110
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.420
which fishes engaged about the relationship between knowledge and belief.
Um,

111
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.130
in part at least because it's an argument that does belong to philosophy.

112
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.090
Uh,
it is the cornerstone of roared.

113
00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:43.790
He's argument in philosophy in the mirror of nature and uh,

114
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.280
that perhaps not so immediately relevant,
uh,

115
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.290
to the kinds of things that we think about in doing literary theory.

116
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.200
So to turn then to,
uh,

117
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.440
what they actually do say,
uh,

118
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.460
at in relation to this movement that I'm talking about.
You notice for example,

119
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.140
that in tone their work is very similar to that a Stanley fish.

120
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.880
Uh,
it's a kind of a downright,
uh,
no nonsense.

121
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.660
Um,
let's get on with it kind of tone that after reading,
you know,

122
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.390
dairy gone and,
and,
and other writers of that kind,
uh,

123
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.900
you're perhaps not quite ready for it.
Oh yeah.
Pros can be like that too.
Um,

124
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.620
and in a way it's bracing.
I mean,
it,
it must be kind of a relief,
um,
uh,

125
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.540
to get these,

126
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:34.541
this sort of no nonsense attitude toward these issues after all the tacking and

127
00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:39.800
varying that we're likely to have experienced,
uh,
in earlier writers.

128
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.610
So the tone,
in a way,
the tone comes with the territory.

129
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:48.440
You take these views and in a way the tone seems to follow it from it because

130
00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:52.610
what they're saying is,
you know,
you just do what you do.

131
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.010
You think what you think as a literary interpreter,

132
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.610
you're bound to have some opinion about what you're looking at it.

133
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:04.470
So just get on with it,
express that opinion,
and that's your job of work.

134
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.590
The only way you can go wrong on this view and in this tone,

135
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.730
the only way you can go wrong is to grope around for some theoretical

136
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:19.110
justification for what you're doing.
It's just fine that you're doing it.

137
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.670
Don't worry about it,
get on with it,
but don't think,
uh,

138
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.820
according to the argument of nap and Michael's that you can hope to find

139
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.380
anything like,
uh,

140
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.470
an underlying or broad theoretical justification for what you're doing.

141
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.900
Obviously that rather challenging and provocative notion is something that lends

142
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:45.201
itself readily to the sort of no nonsense tone that I'm talking about.

143
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.920
Okay.
So turning then to,
to their argument,
they are,
they,

144
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.930
they argue that people become entangled with issues of theory,

145
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.380
all of which in their view should be avoided when they do too,

146
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.400
when that,
well,
three.
But as I say,

147
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:12.840
we're going to set knowledge and belief aside when they make three fundamental

148
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:16.010
mistakes.
And the first,
uh,

149
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.610
is to suppose that there's a difference between meaning.

150
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.090
In other words,
for example,
to know a meaning,

151
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.040
you have to be able to invoke an intention on the one hand or,
uh,

152
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.400
in the absence of an intention.
Uh,

153
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.430
we cannot possibly speak of a meaning.
On the other hand,

154
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.050
that's their first argument.

155
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.700
People get become embroiled in theory when they make one of those two mistakes.

156
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:46.050
And we'll come back to that in a minute.
The second argument is,

157
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:46.800
uh,

158
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.800
the insistence that there's no such thing as a difference between language and

159
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.760
speech.
In other words,

160
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.850
the so Syria and idea that we have language somehow or another virtually present

161
00:11:00.301 --> 00:11:05.301
in our heads as a lexicon at a set of rules of grammar and syntax and that that

162
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.270
language long producers speech.

163
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:12.170
What I say from sentence to sentence,
Paul,

164
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.510
that this notion is simply false because there is no difference between language

165
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:23.070
and speech.
That's their,
that's their second premise.
Now,

166
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.590
before I launch into those arguments,

167
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:29.700
let me say one more thing about their attitude toward theory.

168
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:33.450
Let me call your attention to the very first paragraph,
which,
uh,

169
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.230
in your pamphlet is on page oh 79,

170
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.260
the very first paragraph of against theory where interestingly they exempt

171
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.680
certain ways of thinking about literature,

172
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.710
certain cuase I scientific ways of thinking about literature from their charge

173
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.500
against theory.

174
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:58.501
They say the term theory is sometimes applied to literary subjects with no

175
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:02.740
direct bearing on the interpretation of individual works,

176
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.870
such as narrow totology,

177
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.670
stylistics and proximity despite their generality.

178
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:10.211
However,

179
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:15.200
these subjects seem to us essentially empirical and our arguments against the

180
00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:18.640
theory will not apply to them.
Well,
not,

181
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:22.540
this is a little surprising because I mean for one thing and this course,

182
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:26.200
which is presumably devoted to theory,
we've talked about some of these things,

183
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:31.020
especially about narrow tology stylistics,
which is,
um,

184
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.650
you know,
the,
the,

185
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.710
the science of style and how one can approach dial syntactically statistically

186
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.950
and in a variety of ways,
uh,
in which that's done.
And poetics,

187
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:50.070
which is general ideas about what constitutes a poem or a text written in some

188
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:57.250
other genre,
um,
which,
which all of which,

189
00:12:57.251 --> 00:13:01.870
for example,
must remind us very much of the Russian formalists,
uh,

190
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.240
narrow tology as we studied it.

191
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.810
It's largely derived from structuralism indeed.

192
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:10.180
Also from certain ideas of Freud.

193
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.290
And all of this sounds suspiciously like theory.

194
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.020
What point are they making about it?
Well,

195
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:22.021
simply the point that those ways of thinking about literature,

196
00:13:22.211 --> 00:13:26.440
which they exempt from their diatribe against theory,

197
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.680
are the ways that they call empirical ways of thinking about literature that are

198
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:35.830
based on observation.
And that of course would certainly,

199
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:39.130
it seems to me apply to the Russian formalists at least what the Russian

200
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:39.881
formalists think.

201
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:44.881
They're doing a ways that are empirical in the sense that they observe data,

202
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.530
they build up a kind of database and they generalize from what they have

203
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:52.240
observed.
They begin,

204
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.320
in other words with the object in question,
uh,

205
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:58.330
and then draw conclusions from it.

206
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.410
So empirical approaches to literature,

207
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.910
the simple observation of data for which one can generalize,
uh,

208
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.120
they exempt from the general charge against literary theory.

209
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.301
All right.

210
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:18.301
Turning then to the idea that intention and meaning just must be the same thing.

211
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.301
Uh,

212
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:27.301
and then subsequently the idea that language and speech just must be the same

213
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:33.370
thing
in the background.

214
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.550
I'd like you to be thinking about some of the implications of this sentence by

215
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:39.790
Stanley Cavell,

216
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:44.620
which was written in another one of the responses to this essay that was

217
00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:49.270
published in the book against theory.
I don't want to reflect on it now.

218
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.720
Um,
but,
um,
it's,
uh,
it saves to me,
um,

219
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.570
uh,

220
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.570
a strikingly vivid way of posing a challenge to the nap and Michael position,

221
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.500
uh,
which,
um,
in a variety of ways,
uh,

222
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:07.460
if only by implication will be touching on,
all right,

223
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.290
so what do nap and Michael's do in order to convince us?
And I'm,

224
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:16.480
and I'm going to be going a long way with them here,
uh,
in,

225
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.170
in almost all the way,

226
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.800
even though I'm going to be taking a sharp turning toward the end of the road,

227
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.140
which I hope saves theory.
I mean,
after all,
I mean,
I,

228
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.830
it it,
it,
it's scarcely conscionable to stand here,
uh,

229
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.860
sort of 26 times in front of you for an hour each and then finally to confess at

230
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:39.140
the end that the thing we've been talking about should be banished from our

231
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:42.470
vocabulary.
And so,
so,
so,
so needless to say,

232
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:46.460
it's incumbent on me to save our subject matter.
I will,

233
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.010
but you're going to have to wait a while because as I say,

234
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:54.220
I am going to be going a long way down the road with nap and Michael's now

235
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.750
Michael said,
well,
you know what the thing about the way in which we,
we,

236
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.460
we approach any text,
any utterance,

237
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.490
any instance of language floating before us is just to take for granted that it

238
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:12.500
has an intention as theorists and critics,

239
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:15.860
we worry away at the question of how we can no attention.

240
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.480
And all of this is,
is,
is a dangerous mistake.

241
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.350
Uh,

242
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.060
because the fact is in everyday practice,

243
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.110
any piece of language we encountered,

244
00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:33.060
we just assume to have an intention.
All right?

245
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.140
So they give us an example in which this assumption is tested and makes us

246
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:44.951
realize what's at stake in supposing that we know the meaning of something.

247
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.700
Ordinarily we just spontaneously say,
I know what that means.

248
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.590
Or if we don't know what it means,
ah,

249
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.890
it must mean something even though I don't know what it means.
That's,

250
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:59.060
I mean that,
that that's our normal approach to a piece of language.

251
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.261
But then I say,

252
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:05.261
I suppose you're working on the beach and you come across a four lines.

253
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.220
Um,
uh,
lines is already a dangerous thing to say.

254
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.400
Scratches in the sand that look an awful lot like the first stanza of

255
00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.120
Wordsworth,
a slumber did my spirit seals lumber,
did my spirits seal.

256
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.560
I had no human fears.

257
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.650
She seemed a thing that could not feel the touch of human years of earthly

258
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.940
years.
There it is on the beach just right in front of us.
And we say,
Oh,

259
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:34.670
well somebody has come along,
some Wordsworth lover.

260
00:17:34.671 --> 00:17:39.590
It's come along here and scratch these lines in the sand so that the intention

261
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.970
of the text is unquestioned.
Wordsworth wrote it.
Uh,

262
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:49.030
somebody now wants us to remind us of how of what a wonderful stands it is.

263
00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.310
And there it is.
And of course it's very difficult to know what it means,

264
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:56.940
but at least I can ascribe meaning to it because no doubt,
you know,

265
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.910
it's an intended tech.
Whoa.
But then what happens?

266
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:06.050
Huge wave comes along and leaves on the beach underneath the first stanza.

267
00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.930
The other stands up.
And,
and this,

268
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.790
and this of course is highly problematic.
Uh,
you know,
there it is.

269
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:17.370
No motion has she now no forest.

270
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.460
She neither here as nurses role round and earth star Arnold course with rocks

271
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:24.210
and stones and trees.

272
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:29.510
Now we're really puzzled maybe as APP and Michael say the sea is a kind of a

273
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:35.730
pantheistic being that likes to write poetry.
Uh,
you know,

274
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.220
so that the sea wrote it may the,

275
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:42.960
they say later on there are a little man in a submarine.
You know,
who,

276
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:47.430
uh,
who,
who,
uh,
look at their handiwork and say,
gee,
that was great.

277
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:52.030
Let's try that again.
Um,
in other words,
we can infer,
um,

278
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.450
all sorts of authors for the stanza,

279
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.440
but it's much more likely that instead of saying the sea writes poetry or

280
00:19:00.781 --> 00:19:04.230
instead of saying they're a little sort of home monkey lie and submarines

281
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:08.640
writing poetry,
instead of saying that it's much more likely that we'll say,

282
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.420
this is an amazing coincidence,
truly amazing,

283
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.120
but it's just a coincidence.
What else could it be?

284
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.510
We'll set nab and Michael's his point,

285
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.400
which was the same point that you might,
that you might make about a parrot sang,

286
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.700
my boss is a jerk.
For example,
you know,
you know,

287
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:28.890
the parrot doesn't mean that you know,

288
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.850
the parent is the parent is just making words.
Somebody else met.
It may be,

289
00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:36.750
but the parrot is,
you know,
that's just words for the parrot.
Okay.

290
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.610
Or monkeys at typewriters writing Shakespeare,
you know,
we're,

291
00:19:40.611 --> 00:19:43.800
we're told that on given eternity,

292
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.210
this is a task that could be accomplished always.

293
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.590
Supposing somebody were there to whisk away the sheets whenever they wrote a

294
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:53.550
word and finally put it back together.
You know,
all of this,
uh,

295
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.470
these things are possibilities.

296
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.520
But we suddenly realized that those texts,

297
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.140
my boss is a jerk.

298
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.700
A slumber did a spirit seal written by chance,

299
00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.480
by whatever it is.
And it's an already,

300
00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:13.140
there's a sort of an intentionality and tail than the idea of writing by

301
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:15.560
something but just left by chance.

302
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.650
We suddenly realize according to an APP and Michael's,

303
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.270
that in that case,

304
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.860
those words are only like language.

305
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.200
They are not actually language because nobody wrote them,

306
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.560
nothing wrote the no entity or being from God on Don wrote them.

307
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:41.670
They are just there by chance.
Therefore,

308
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.580
even though they look like language,

309
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.980
we suddenly realized that it would be foolish to put,

310
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.350
to suppose that they have meaning.

311
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:56.370
I mean there is a poem that exactly resembles this bunch of marks that we see in

312
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.350
front of us,
and that poem has meaning,

313
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.760
but this bunch of marks does not have meaning.
Now,

314
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.870
I think probably most of us and I,
that's why I think in a way not,

315
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:10.030
but Michael's could have chosen a better example.

316
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:15.060
I think probably most of us would resist the idea that we can't interpret the

317
00:21:16.211 --> 00:21:20.080
bunch of marks.
They're identical to language.
We should,

318
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:22.150
we feel free to interpret them after all.

319
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:24.840
Nobody knows what the poem means anyway.
I mean it's,
it's,

320
00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.270
it's been the subject of critical controversy for decades.

321
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.470
That's one of the reasons nap and Michael's Jews it.
Um,
and so,
okay,

322
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:35.110
there it is on the beach.
I'll have my stab at it.
You know,

323
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:40.030
it must mean something.
So here it goes.
Uh,
and,
and,
and so we resist that.

324
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:44.590
That's why I gave you this other example because it seems to me in a way,

325
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:49.591
the other example is more compelling than that nap and Michael's now you see

326
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:56.140
these two ladies looking up at the tree,
they upper,

327
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.170
what do you call them?
Boluses.
What,
what do you call those?

328
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.590
The branches sought off and eventually there's a kind of a scar forms.
What's,

329
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:08.200
what's what?
Pardon?
Burl.
Uh,
the upper burl

330
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.430
certainly looks an awful lot like Jesus.
And it was,

331
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.890
and these,
and,
and this went,

332
00:22:17.891 --> 00:22:21.990
and when this appeared in Milford about 15 years ago,
um,

333
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.950
not just these two ladies,
but hundreds and hundreds of people visited the site.

334
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.310
Now they of course,

335
00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:35.170
believed that that was on the tree because God put it there.

336
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.540
Therefore it had meaning.
We knew what it was.

337
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:45.530
It was a representation of the face of Jesus and,
and,

338
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.720
and,
and the feeling that one could know what it was,
interpreted it,

339
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.870
take it to be an actual representation of something was there for unquestioned

340
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.870
as we would all agree.
You accept the premise,

341
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.370
God wrote it or I should say put it there.
Uh,

342
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.490
at at him he's been known to do the same thing with toasted cheese sandwiches

343
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:11.300
and Tacos and so,
and you know,
it happens,
it happens,
right?
You,

344
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.220
you accept that premise and you're all set.

345
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.320
But suppose you say no,
no,
no,
no,
God didn't write that.

346
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.170
God didn't put that there.
It's just an accident.

347
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.200
Wouldn't you then say,
oh,
therefore it has no meaning.

348
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:34.360
It's not a representation of anything.
It just looks like something.

349
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.850
In other words,
in this case,
however you feel about a slumber,

350
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:44.110
did my spirits seal in this case you would accept nap and Michael's argument,

351
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:49.710
it would say it really does depend on the inference of an intention.

352
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.190
If I had,
if I infer no intention by ascribed no meaning,

353
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.420
if I infer an intention,
I ascribe meaning.

354
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.700
So nab and Michael's as simply making the same argument about a slumber did my

355
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:09.170
spirit's seal.
And I think it's a very strong argument.
You know,

356
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:12.230
once you realize,
or once I should say,

357
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:17.231
you accept the idea that meaning just his intention and think about it at

358
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:23.030
illogically.
When I say,
I mean that precisely means I intend.
All right.

359
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.600
It's not,
it doesn't quite work that way in all languages,

360
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.950
but it certainly works that way in English.
Uh,

361
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.130
and it's worth remembering to mean is too intense.

362
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.770
And so it makes a lot of sense to say that a meaning just is add intention and

363
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:44.771
that it's perhaps against the grain of common sense to factor them apart to say,

364
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:47.450
wow,
I could see,
ah,
you know,

365
00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:51.620
I could see this sentence and I have a certain notion what it might mean,

366
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:55.070
but I still don't know what the author intended to say,

367
00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.380
which is forbid from this standpoint a Napa and Michael's,
of course,

368
00:25:00.381 --> 00:25:02.240
you know what the author intended to say.

369
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:06.770
You've just described meaning to the sentence.
Now mind you,
you may be wrong,

370
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:13.280
but that isn't to say that you're being wrong hinges on knowing what the author

371
00:25:13.281 --> 00:25:18.020
intended in a certain sense app.
And Michael's a great,

372
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:22.550
perfectly well with the new critics.
And with Fuko or whoever it might be,
uh,

373
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.080
and say,
well,
you never know what an author intended.
Um,
that's not the point.

374
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.970
The meaning of the sentence in itself and tails intention.

375
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.570
If it weren't a sentence spoken intentionally by an agent,

376
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.620
human or otherwise,

377
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.890
it wouldn't have meaning because it wouldn't be language.
And in a certain sense,

378
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:51.010
this then can carry us to our second argument because having established in

379
00:25:55.281 --> 00:26:00.281
their own minds satisfactorily the for any text,

380
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.300
the meaning of the text,
Joe must just be its intention.

381
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.830
In other words,
to be understood as language at all.

382
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.890
To repeat myself once again to be understood as language at all and intention

383
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:17.990
needs to be inferred.

384
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.980
The argument being,
you know,

385
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:27.070
we ought to be able to recognize supposing we succeed in not inferring and

386
00:26:27.651 --> 00:26:31.910
intention that what we are looking at is actually not language.

387
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
It's just a simulacrum of language and effective copy of language.

388
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.590
Like for example,

389
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.680
the speech of a parrot or the words produced by monkeys on typewriters and so

390
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:46.254
on.

391
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:51.680
We should not from such Simulacra of words for not only intention but meaning as

392
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:55.440
well.

393
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.270
It is meaningless to speak of marks that are not signs

394
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.400
as language.
Okay,
bring us,

395
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.430
bringing us to the notion of sign for cs purse who actually discriminated among

396
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:15.230
hundreds of different kinds of sign.

397
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.960
All signs are active.

398
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.550
That is to say they have an agency,
they have a purpose,

399
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.900
they have a function purse in other words,

400
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.920
does not understand them as as the in the way that so sewer does as being

401
00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:36.570
differential of,
he understands that too.
But for him,

402
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.980
the central point about assign is it's is,

403
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:44.040
is the agency of the sign.
All right.

404
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.220
Now the implication of this is clear and it's the application that nap and

405
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.410
Michael's draw on in this argument.

406
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:58.010
Their claim is that there is no distinction to be made between language and

407
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:04.590
speech.
Now first,
not now.

408
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.290
Let's just pause over their argument.

409
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.830
And I would think the fact that as we think about that,

410
00:28:10.831 --> 00:28:14.350
especially since we've been exposed to so sewer and,
and,

411
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.380
and I and I hope have come to accept the idea that language is a virtual sin,

412
00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:21.430
chronic,
uh,

413
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:26.450
entity laid out in space and speech is an actual diachronic performance derived

414
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:31.170
from language laid out in time.
Right?

415
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:36.230
Since we have absorbed that and since we just have this sort of spontaneous,

416
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:38.520
if we're students of literary theory,

417
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.690
a belief that there is a distinction between language and speech,

418
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.870
what do we do when we come face to face with this claim of nap and Michael's

419
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.690
now,
I think that they make,

420
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.740
they make their most effective case in a footnote.

421
00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:01.010
This is the last footnote I'll be calling your attention to this semester.
Uh,

422
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.940
and it's like all footnotes,
uh,
perhaps the most telling thing in the essay,

423
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.890
uh,
and it appears on page oh eight.
Oh,
I can't,

424
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:13.800
I find it on a piece on page oh eight four.

425
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.980
Footnote number 12,

426
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.410
not going to read the whole thing and just going to read a single sentence.

427
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.340
Uh,
at the top on page 21 footnote 12,

428
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.360
which they say a dictionary is an index of frequent usages in particular speech

429
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.393
acts,

430
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:40.430
not a matrix of abstract pre intentional possibilities.

431
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.710
Think about that language we're suppose is an addition to being,

432
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.200
uh,
a set of Greg grammatical and syntactical rules.

433
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:55.290
Also a set of definitions made available for speech acts.

434
00:29:55.451 --> 00:29:58.930
That's that,
that is the assumption that of course,

435
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:02.020
and literary theory provides for us nothing.

436
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:07.021
Michael's are denying that in this footnote there saying that dictionary

437
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:11.680
definitions are just a sum total as it were,

438
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:17.070
of words in action that any definition is of a word which is already a speech

439
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.360
act.
Oed,
you go through all 18 definitions of a word.

440
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.960
There are all of them,
uh,
embedded in sentences.

441
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.630
Speech acts and can be taken out of sentences,
uh,

442
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.680
and still understood in their agency as performed any word in a dictionary and

443
00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:42.760
other words according to tea to nap.

444
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:47.080
And Michaels is a word performed and the record,

445
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.070
a fossilized as it were in the dictionary is a record,

446
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.530
not have meaning per se,

447
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:58.531
but of performance of the way and what's the word works in speech in history.

448
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.330
And so a dictionary is nothing other than a composite or some total of speech

449
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.423
acts.

450
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:14.730
And to distinguish therefore between language as something which is pre action

451
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.040
and speech,

452
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.130
which is the implementation of language as a mistake language even in the sense

453
00:31:24.431 --> 00:31:29.431
that it's always there before us is nevertheless always active.

454
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:35.460
It is a record of those actions that have taken place before our own actions as

455
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:38.853
speakers.

456
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:44.040
There's no difference between me acting through speech and language preexisting

457
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:46.390
as something which is not action.

458
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.420
It's all continuous as an ever deepening,

459
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.710
broadening and self complicating record of action or speech action.

460
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.390
Now this is a very interesting idea.
Uh,
and I think again,

461
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:09.510
it's an idea that one might well go along way a long way with,

462
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.210
I think it should be said in defensive.
So sir,
by the way,

463
00:32:13.211 --> 00:32:15.670
that in a certain way he anticipates this position.

464
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.890
Remember I told you that although for purposes of learning to understand

465
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:22.660
structuralism and its aftermath,

466
00:32:22.661 --> 00:32:27.100
we only distinguish between language and speech long and powerful.

467
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.630
But in,
so sir,
there's actually a third category I sort of intermediate category,

468
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:36.810
which he calls long gosh and long gosh is actually the sum total of all known

469
00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:40.640
speech acts.
If you could godify or or,

470
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:44.750
or quantify everything that's ever been said or written,

471
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.950
that would be long gone.
As you can see how it's different from long,

472
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.010
which needn't necessarily ever have been said at all.

473
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.950
I'll be coming back to that in a minute.
A long gosh,

474
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:57.080
in other words is empirical as nap.

475
00:32:57.081 --> 00:33:02.081
And Michael's would say it is something that had we enough information we could

476
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:06.200
actually codify into a vast database.

477
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.190
It would be the sum of all speech acts and that actually what's so circle as

478
00:33:11.191 --> 00:33:16.191
long gosh would be not unlike what Napa and Michael's mean by language.

479
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:18.550
You see,
so so,

480
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:23.890
so Sarah is aware that you can think of the some of speech act in the way that

481
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:29.270
Napa and Michael's do,
but he still holds out for this other category.
This,

482
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:33.740
this,
this notion of long,
uh,
uh,
uh,
as,
uh,

483
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:38.020
the code from which speech acts are derived,
uh,

484
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:42.820
as a thing apart.
Now,
I think as I say,
um,

485
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.870
this is a persuasive position because after all,

486
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.460
as long as we suppose that language exists for communication,

487
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120
that it is interactive as long as we accept as we have accepted from Bactine and

488
00:33:58.371 --> 00:34:01.190
others during the course of the course,
as long as we set,

489
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.980
except the idea that language is social,

490
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.980
that all of events deployments,
um,

491
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.070
our interactive,
uh,

492
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.970
derived from the speech acts of others,
uh,

493
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:18.920
appropriated for oneself as one's own set of speech acts influential on yet

494
00:34:18.921 --> 00:34:23.840
other people as a speech act,
as long as we accept this we say to ourselves.
Yeah.

495
00:34:23.841 --> 00:34:28.841
And it makes a lot of sense to think of language as inseparable from speech,

496
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:33.860
uh,
to think of language simply as the sum of all agencies.

497
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.310
Uh,
so that no meaningful distinction between that,

498
00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:42.140
some of agencies and that in the Individual Agency of a speech act,
uh,

499
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:47.330
needs to be made
notice though.
And here by the way,

500
00:34:47.331 --> 00:34:51.230
is where I'm going to make my turn and save theory.
So,
okay,

501
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.210
sharpen your pencils.
Um,

502
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:58.580
notice that I began that last riff by saying,

503
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.840
as long as we suppose language exists for communication,

504
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.000
now we do suppose language exists for communication.
I mean,

505
00:35:11.001 --> 00:35:12.650
what else could it exist for?
I mean,

506
00:35:12.651 --> 00:35:16.760
what do we do with language except to communicate?
Uh,
you know,
you could say,

507
00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:20.090
well,
we write doodles,
we make meaningless marks in the sand.

508
00:35:20.091 --> 00:35:24.440
There are all kinds of things.
Maybe we do a language,
but let's face it,
we don't,

509
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.550
right?
If I,

510
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:30.580
if I do in fact make marks in the sand amounting to Islamic did by spirits seal

511
00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:35.150
it,
it's because I love Wordsworth has,
by the way,
I do.

512
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.540
And I wish to communicate love to the rest of the world.
You know,
I mean,

513
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:43.440
it's a speech act.
Come on,
I'm not just making marks.
If I wanted to make marks,

514
00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:48.360
I'd do,
you know,
I'd do something,
you know,
but rather more mark like,
well,
so,

515
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.390
so,
so in any case,
in any case,
um,

516
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.800
we certainly inhabit a life world in which it is almost inconceivable for anyone

517
00:36:00.451 --> 00:36:05.451
to come along and tell us language is not for the purpose of communication.

518
00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.730
In other words,
napping,
Michael seemed to be completely right.

519
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:13.070
What else is it for?
I mean,
you know,
I mean that's what we use it for.

520
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.960
We have refined it,
uh,

521
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.110
to a fare thee well as an efficient,
uh,

522
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.120
flexible,
sometimes even eloquent medium,
medium of communication.

523
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.110
That's what language is for.
That's what it exists for.
And as I'm saying,

524
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.270
if we accept this idea,

525
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.530
which seems simply to carry the day because who could think anything else?

526
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.950
If we accept this idea,
then there's a very strong case for napping.

527
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.550
Michael's being right really,

528
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:46.050
there no significant or important difference between language and speech.

529
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.580
But now suppose we approached the question from a,

530
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.150
I don't say from an empirical,
you know,
because

531
00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:01.170
from a speculative anthropological point of view in other,

532
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.960
but suppose we approached it,
but with some,

533
00:37:03.961 --> 00:37:05.910
with some rather common sense remarks.

534
00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:09.360
Now we say language is for communication.

535
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:14.490
The purpose of language is for communication.
We say that.

536
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:20.210
Now does that mean especially if we think of the whole history of mankind,

537
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.320
does that mean that the purpose of fire is for cooking

538
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.570
in other words or to bring it a little bit closer to home?

539
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.690
It doesn't mean that the purpose of the prehensile thumb is for grasping

540
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:40.620
doesn't mean that the purpose of a cave,

541
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.580
a hole in the rock is for dwelling.

542
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.780
No.
In those cases,

543
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.770
adaptation is what makes fire a good thing to cook with the prehensile thumb.

544
00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:01.440
A good thing to grasp with.
And a cave,
a good thing to take shelter in.

545
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.980
But they all,
and there are various ways are just,

546
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.760
they're plainly,
all of them have other,

547
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.350
well not purposes because the purpose is is when you think about it only

548
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:15.330
something that we can impose on something,

549
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.810
but they certainly aren't out there in any sense for us to do the thing that it

550
00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:24.960
turns out we,
we've decided it's a good idea to do with it,

551
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.840
you know,
great,
you know,
fire burns us but what we can cook with it,
you know,

552
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.350
and,
and so on.
Now in the case of language,

553
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.490
in the case of language,

554
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:42.280
we have to suppose as a matter of fact,
that language as it were,

555
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:46.720
appears among us and the same way that the prehensile thumb did,

556
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.280
of course we discovered its use.

557
00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.720
But that's a funny way to put it.

558
00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:00.470
Might be more circumspect to say that we discovered it had a use for us,

559
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.680
which was to communicate.

560
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.590
And so once we were able to put this,
whatever it was,
this,
this,

561
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:16.090
this weird capacity to make differential sounds,
uh,

562
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:21.300
once we put this weird capacity to make differential sounds to work,

563
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:26.620
hence forth for us and for our purposes,

564
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.290
language was to communicate.

565
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:35.380
And of course we made an enormous success of it or a tower of Babel of it,

566
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:39.930
which whichever you prefer to think.
But in any case we have it.
Uh,

567
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
and it has developed among us as a means or medium of communication.

568
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.880
But you know,
I mean if,
uh,

569
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:53.910
in whatever by whatever mute unsee a language arose opposing this to be the

570
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:57.460
case.
And,
and you know,
I'm,
I'm not,

571
00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.880
I'm not making an argument that has anything to do with intelligent design one

572
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:05.260
way or another.
So pausing supposing that by whatever mute and see,

573
00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.100
um,

574
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.900
language appeared and that of course the next day there were an avalanche.

575
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:12.583
Alright.

576
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:17.590
It might well be the case that the space is a consisting of all of us sitting in

577
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:21.280
this room and I guess a few other people that,
that,

578
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:24.490
that this space is a might be mute.

579
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.440
It might be communicating perhaps with incredible eloquence,

580
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:34.710
perhaps even with literary genius by means of signs or who knows,

581
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.400
or for that matter it might have taken a detour and its development.

582
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:47.430
So that's that communication was not anything one could identify as specifically

583
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:52.450
human.
Uh,
Paul,
all sentient beings communicate.
Uh,

584
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:57.190
but it's possible that this particular species could have taken a turn in its

585
00:40:57.191 --> 00:40:58.480
development,
uh,

586
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.470
after which communication was much as it is among mice or,
or,
or,

587
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.730
or whatever.
Uh,
all of this is possible.

588
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:09.490
You'll see why don't we think about language,

589
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.730
a property that we have and manipulate and communicate with.

590
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.420
Uh,

591
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.420
anthropologically it comes into being in such a way that it is,

592
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.600
I would think scarcely relevant to say that its purpose is for communication.

593
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.360
It comes into being simply as an attribute,
a property,

594
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:41.140
something we happen to have something someone happens to have four,

595
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:47.150
which a use is then discovered as for fire,

596
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.990
for the prehensile thumb and for the cave.

597
00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.390
I mean the relationship between the cave and the house.

598
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.080
It seems to me as a particularly interesting way of thinking about the

599
00:41:57.081 --> 00:42:02.081
relationship between language as a set of differential.

600
00:42:03.001 --> 00:42:05.330
So and notice something about the signs of language.

601
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:07.870
And here of course we also invoke so cert,

602
00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:13.890
so sir lays every stress on the idea that language is made up of differential

603
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:20.531
and arbitrary signs and other assessor denies that there's such a thing in

604
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:24.770
language as a natural sign.
In other words,

605
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.590
the and the Russian formalists do this as well.
Both.

606
00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:32.591
So Sir and the Russian formalists warn us against believing that automotive

607
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.950
poetic devices,
peep,
peep,
peep,

608
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:42.070
devices like that are actually natural signs that they are derived.

609
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:47.230
In other words from the thing in the world that they seem through their sound to

610
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:48.794
represent.

611
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:54.220
So Sir reminds us that these are acts accidents of edible logical history,

612
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:57.560
which can also be understood in adaptive terms.

613
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.270
Automotive Pia exists in language because it's good for communication and it's

614
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:03.740
fun to communicate with,

615
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.490
but it doesn't enter language as a natural sign.

616
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:13.130
It only passes through moments in the,
in the evolution of a given word,

617
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:18.250
it only passes through woman's in which the relationship between the sound and

618
00:43:18.291 --> 00:43:20.420
the thing represented seems to be natural.

619
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:26.060
This is a matter upon which great stress is late both for,

620
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.090
so sir and for the Russian formalists you may,

621
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.730
you may have thought when you read these,

622
00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:35.450
these passages in which such dresses laid on it,
you may have thought,

623
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.850
well that's overkill.
Them cares about anema pay.

624
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:39.470
What does that have to do with it?

625
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:44.180
It anchors the entire idea about language,

626
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.160
which is precisely that.

627
00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:50.300
It is something other than speech.

628
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.820
When we speak,
we not only endeavored to communicate,

629
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.640
we endeavor to refer.
In other words,

630
00:43:58.641 --> 00:44:03.200
we take language and we try to make it as the philosophers say,

631
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.970
hook on to the natural world.
We take a set of signs,

632
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.800
a code which is not in itself natural,
which is arbitrary.

633
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.430
And through the sheer force of will we make those signs as best we can hook on

634
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:24.140
to the natural,
to the actual world.
And in doing so,

635
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.830
we reinforce the idea that language is for communication.

636
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.110
Whereas my argument is language isn't for communication.

637
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:39.140
Speech is when we speak that is entirely and exclusively and without any other

638
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:47.301
motive for communication except for one thing that the Russian formalists in

639
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:49.650
particular it took note of.

640
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.670
There are funny things going on and going on in our speech,

641
00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.080
alliteration,

642
00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:00.540
unnecessary or uneconomical forms of repetition,

643
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.990
weird things going on in a nurse in our speech,

644
00:45:03.991 --> 00:45:07.830
which don't seem to have the purpose of communication.
As a matter of fact,

645
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:12.690
they actually seem to impede communication.
You know,
if I,
you know,
when I,

646
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.480
when when I really started messing language up,
you know,

647
00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:19.320
twas Brillig and the slide the toes did gyre and Gimble in the way when I really

648
00:45:19.321 --> 00:45:21.960
started messing language up,
I'm really,

649
00:45:21.961 --> 00:45:26.961
I'm impeding communication because I'm laying stress on elements of rhythm,

650
00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:31.380
pattern,
sound recurrence,
uh,

651
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.390
which cannot be said to have any direct bearing on communication.

652
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.420
And this of course is what we've studied recurrently.

653
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:43.800
And I have to say empirically because these are all empirical facts about

654
00:45:43.801 --> 00:45:46.500
language as as the Russian formalists insisted,

655
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:51.770
you know what we have studied recurrently is the way in which language rears its

656
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.800
ugly head in speech,
the way in which in other words,

657
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.920
language won't be repressed as mere communication,

658
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:11.270
the way in which speech and tails elements that keep bubbling up to the surface

659
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.430
and asserting themselves,

660
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:19.610
which oddly enough really can't be said to conduce to communication and those

661
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:22.710
things,

662
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:27.710
those elements that bubble up to the surface are nothing other than the that

663
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:35.241
evidence of the presence of language precisely in the way that in Freud,

664
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.810
the Freudian slip,

665
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.960
the fact that I can't get through a sentence without making some kind of blunder

666
00:46:43.961 --> 00:46:48.961
some and very often an embarrassing blunder for in Freud the Freudian slip is

667
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:54.330
understood as the bubbling up into conscious.

668
00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:59.330
The conscious effort to speak of that which speech cat control of that which

669
00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.720
Freud calls the unconscious and which by the way,

670
00:47:06.721 --> 00:47:11.721
we would have no idea of the existence of if it weren't for the Freudian slip.

671
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:15.683
In other words,
we,

672
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.890
as Freud said in the first handout that I gave you at the beginning of the

673
00:47:19.891 --> 00:47:20.724
semester,

674
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:25.730
we infer the unconscious from the behavior of consciousness because given the

675
00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.750
nature of the behavior of consciousness,

676
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.840
it seems necessary to do so by precisely the same token.

677
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:42.630
We can't and I think should say we infer language as something else from the

678
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:47.440
composite or a sum total as speed of speech acts.

679
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:53.010
We infer language from the erratic behavior of speech because it seems there is

680
00:47:56.711 --> 00:48:01.690
no other way to account for the erratic behavior of speech.

681
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.820
That sense of language,

682
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.360
which I'm going to be talking a lot more about on Thursday.

683
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:12.510
That sense of language sort of bubbling up and it beat from below in speech and

684
00:48:13.661 --> 00:48:18.661
proving its existence as something other than a composite record of all speeches

685
00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.030
is what suggests to us that nap and Weigel's,
uh,

686
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.690
are not quite right in saying there's really no difference between language and

687
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:30.490
speech.
And if there's really an,

688
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:34.720
if there is a difference between language and speech as I'm claiming and if the

689
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:39.700
difference between language and speech is much as we have talked to think of it

690
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.800
by.
So Sir and his success successes down through deconstruction.

691
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.680
If there is such a difference,
then guess what?

692
00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.880
We have literary theory back in the fold alive and well.

693
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.320
And we no longer have to say that it should be jettisoned from our thinking

694
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.610
about literature.
We have a real use for literary theory,

695
00:49:00.611 --> 00:49:04.960
but that's exactly where Napa and Michael supposing supposing they were here and

696
00:49:04.961 --> 00:49:07.030
I'd convince them.
And by the way,
I know them both.

697
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:09.820
You can't convince them of anything,
but that's not unusual.

698
00:49:09.821 --> 00:49:13.630
You probably can't convince me of anything either.
Um,
uh,
suppose,

699
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.740
suppose we had them here and I had succeeded in convincing them,

700
00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:19.930
they would say,
well,
okay,

701
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.850
but isn't it a pity because you have proved better than I could.

702
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:29.470
That literary theory has no purpose.
You know,

703
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.270
why on earth should we worry about all this bubbling up of,

704
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.490
of stuff that has nothing to do with communication after all,

705
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.170
we're here to communicate,
aren't we?

706
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.940
We've begun by saying that our life world consist precisely in the deployment of

707
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:44.440
language for communication.

708
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:48.010
And here's this person saying this is stuff bubbling up.
You know what I mean?

709
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:51.580
Which,
which,
which makes communication difficult.
You know,

710
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:55.360
what use is that Knipe nap.
And Michael's might say,

711
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.170
you'll see they are pragmatists,
aren't they?
Right?
They are,

712
00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.640
they are a pragmatist or niche.
They are concerned with practicality,

713
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.850
their interests,
their,
their,

714
00:50:05.851 --> 00:50:10.851
their reason for being interested in meaning and interpretation is a practical

715
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:11.590
reading.

716
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:16.590
It reason entirely and tailed in the understanding of communication and the

717
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:22.780
furtherance of communication,
whereas theory,

718
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.460
which I have saved,

719
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:30.090
I nevertheless seem to have saved at a pretty considerable cost because I have

720
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:35.171
suggested that theory itself is completely impractical and all I've suggested

721
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:39.170
it,
we're going to get back to that next time.

722
00:50:39.171 --> 00:50:42.490
That's what the Thursday lecture is going to be going to be about.
Um,

723
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.340
but in the meantime,
you say to yourself,
okay,
fine,
we've got theory,

724
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.810
but we've also been shown that you can't really do anything with it.
Um,
and so,

725
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.120
uh,
it might just as well,
um,

726
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.780
sued us to suppose that nap and Michael's are right.
Uh,

727
00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.470
and to proceed as though theory could be jettisoned.
Um,

728
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.720
one last quick point,

729
00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:07.010
going back to the distinction between meaning and intention.

730
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.160
Notice the two pronged argument.
On the one hand,

731
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:15.310
people like Ed Hirsch who believe that you can invoke an author's intention in

732
00:51:15.441 --> 00:51:19.520
order to pin down a meaning.
On the one hand,
you have people like that.

733
00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.780
And on the other hand,

734
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:25.930
you have people doing deconstruction who say that because there is no inferable

735
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:29.210
intention,
texts themselves have no meaning.

736
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.910
That's not quite right,
because that's not what really what deconstruction says.

737
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:38.210
Deconstruction doesn't say,
texts have no meaning.

738
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.060
Deconstruction doesn't even say that.

739
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:44.870
You can't know what the meaning of a text is.
Exactly.

740
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:50.050
What deconstruction says is that you can't rope off meaning in a text.

741
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:53.210
Text have too much meaning.

742
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:55.790
Texts explode with meaning.

743
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:59.720
You can't corral the way in which texts,
uh,

744
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.760
produce meaning.
You can't corral corral at by inferring an intention.

745
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.290
You can't corral Corel.
It by taking a particular interpretive path,

746
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.440
meaning just explodes in texts.

747
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:16.940
That's not at all the same thing as to as,
as to say,
uh,

748
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.830
according to the claim of Napa and Michael's that in deconstructive thinking

749
00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:25.980
texts have no meaning of very,
very different proposition altogether.

750
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:30.890
And I think it might suggest to you that the relationship between intention and

751
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:34.250
meaning isn't really what's at stake in deconstruction.

752
00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.530
A text is intended or you can say,
well,
it may be intended,

753
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:42.740
uh,
no doubt it's intended all sorts of ways of putting it.

754
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:44.090
But is that really the point?

755
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.070
The text is the text on this view and the text just as I say,

756
00:52:49.071 --> 00:52:54.071
fairly bristles with meaning that being precise to the point you can't reign it

757
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:58.930
in.
That's not really the flip side as nap.

758
00:52:58.931 --> 00:53:01.580
And Michael's would,
would,
would want to make you think.

759
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:05.280
It's not really the flip side of the idea,
uh,

760
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:09.710
of the followers of Hirsch,
uh,
that in order to know a meaning,

761
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:14.300
you have to be able to infer an authorial intention.
There's no symmetry there.

762
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.190
Uh,
and as I say,
I'm not sure that deconstruction,
whatever its claims,

763
00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:21.200
whatever it's perfections and imperfections,

764
00:53:21.201 --> 00:53:26.201
I'm not sure that really deconstruction has the question of intention in

765
00:53:26.361 --> 00:53:29.300
relation to meaning very much at heart one way or another.

766
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:31.370
Sorry to have kept you.
We'll see you Thursday.
