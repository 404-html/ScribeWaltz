1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.120
As we get into social perspectives on literature and art,

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.660
uh,
you may ask yourself,
uh,

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.070
out of idle curiosity or perhaps even peevishly,

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.280
why Marx,
why so much marks?

5
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:22.281
Why is it marks who seems to stand behind the idea that the social criticism of

6
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:29.970
art is the best and most relevant way to approach the subject matter?

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.760
Uh,
well it's because

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.410
whatever the outcome of Marxists thought may have proven to be historically,

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.840
it's nevertheless the case,
uh,

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.870
to this day that the most devastating critique of existing ideas about things of

11
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:54.150
states of affairs that,
uh,

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.300
as it were me along without too much self consciousness remains the Marxist one

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.481
together.

14
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:05.481
Perhaps with the Freud in one and when we turned to Jameson next time we'll see

15
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:10.350
that in both cases and we'll be working a little bit with this today too.

16
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.330
When we turned to Benyamin,
uh,

17
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
we'll see that in both cases it has to do with the way in which,

18
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.580
um,

19
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580
we are brought up short by the kind of criticism which argues that somehow

20
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.170
standing behind a,

21
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.250
our conception of reality and our understanding of our place in the world.

22
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.430
There is one form or another of the unconscious.

23
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.050
Uh,
we have,
uh,
arguably,
uh,

24
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.380
in this course in literary theory,

25
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.040
first taken up notions of a linguistic,
uh,

26
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:45.900
unconscious or in any case,

27
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.020
linguistic preconditioning then taken up notions of a psychoanalytic unconscious

28
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.020
and now,
uh,

29
00:01:55.021 --> 00:02:00.021
in the very title of Jameson's book from which we'll be considering an excerpt

30
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:01.780
in the next lecture,
uh,

31
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
we have the notion of the political unconscious.

32
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.420
There are other ways of effecting a social criticism of literature and art,

33
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.290
uh,
from the right.
Uh,
there's the,

34
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.320
there's an extraordinary book by Leo Strauss on Aristophanes together with his

35
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:26.130
great readings of the traditional texts of political philosophy.
Uh,

36
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:31.131
there is of course a very strong liberal tradition of criticism,

37
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.700
particularly in the public sphere and the journalism of the public's fear.
Uh,

38
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.720
perhaps the most notable proponent of a liberal criticism of art undertaken from

39
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:48.750
a social point of view is the work collected in Lionel trilling,

40
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.220
the literal,
the liberal imagination.
So there are options,

41
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.390
but by far,

42
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:58.890
the most pervasive mode of social critique,

43
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.590
uh,

44
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.590
in literary theory and in the modern history of thinking about literature,

45
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.230
uh,

46
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.230
remains the Marxist one our concern because we are,

47
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.860
uh,
as much as we can be and working through these materials,

48
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.840
our concern is of course,

49
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:20.320
primarily with Marxist aesthetics.

50
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.020
What are the options,
uh,

51
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.320
for a Marxist critic,
um,

52
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.400
in aesthetic terms.
Uh,
and that's,
uh,

53
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.860
and that's of course what we're going to be taking up,
uh,

54
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.950
in a moment.
And also when we turn to,
uh,

55
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.520
Fredric Jameson on Thursday.
But in the meantime,

56
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.930
what about marks that,
I mean,
I think I can take it for granted.
Uh,

57
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.480
and of course of this kind,

58
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.890
most of you have some familiarity with the history of ideas,
uh,

59
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.830
and with Western culture.
I think I can take it for granted that,
that,

60
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.530
that most of you have some notion,
just as you have some notion about Freud,

61
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.720
you have some notion of what Mark's is all about.
Um,

62
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960
of particular importance for the kinds of criticism we undertake to read in this

63
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.870
moment of the course is,
uh,
of course the idea of ideology,

64
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.000
uh,
now ideology in the writings of both marks and angles and in,

65
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.810
uh,
all the,
the sort of complex history,
uh,

66
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.850
of the writings that have succeeded them.
They were founders of discursivity.

67
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.500
Uh,
and there has been great debate within the Marxist tradition.

68
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.770
Ideology is a term about which there has never been a wholehearted agreement.

69
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800
Primarily the disagreement concerning ideology in this tradition has to do with

70
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:55.400
whether or not a ideology ought properly to be,
uh,

71
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.220
to be ascribed to conscious as well as to unconscious,

72
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.090
uh,
preconceptions about the world.
In other words,

73
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.120
if I know I'm really to the core perfectly well that the moon is made of green

74
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:15.010
cheese,
uh,
I can prove it.
Uh,
I have no doubt about it.

75
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.070
It's not something that I'm unaware that I think then and which,

76
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.700
but at the same time,
if my opinion,
my belief,

77
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.950
my expression of fact,
uh,

78
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.280
to the effect that the moon is great is made of green cheese,
um,

79
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.170
can be a dean is defied as ideology.
The question is,

80
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.570
well,
is it still ideology?

81
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:42.571
If I'm quite conscious of knowing that the moon is made of green cheese and

82
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:46.930
prepared to defend my position,
uh,
just as um,

83
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.510
as a kind of belated Aristocrat,

84
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.600
I might be prepared to defend the idea that pre hierarchy and privilege is

85
00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.800
appropriate in society.
Um,

86
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.250
perfectly conscious that this is an unpopular idea,

87
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.870
but nevertheless a fully committed to it and prepared to defend it.

88
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.080
The question sometimes in Marxism is,

89
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.980
is this still ideology?
The answer by and large,

90
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:14.840
particularly in the writings of angles,

91
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:19.790
perhaps more than in the writings of marks that they answered by and large is
it,

92
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:24.791
is ideology is essentially the belief that perspective is truth.

93
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.710
That is to say the way in which things appear from the material and economically

94
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:40.421
grounded standpoint of my own consciousness is not just the way they appear to

95
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:47.450
me,
but the way they actually are.
Now,

96
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.060
this is a mode of belief,

97
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.630
which in various historical periods,
according to Marx,

98
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.720
has characterized each dominant class in turn with the rise of capitalism.

99
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.630
Uh,
it's,
uh,
the,
the,

100
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.310
the evolution of capitalism into what's called late capitalism.
Of course,
the,

101
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.370
this ideology is primarily what's called the bourgeois ideology.

102
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.180
In other words,

103
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.180
the idea that the various premises on which,

104
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.030
uh,

105
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.030
bourgeois middle class existence is based the premises that have allowed for the

106
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:30.110
rise and appropriation of power of the middleclass.
The idea,

107
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.220
for example,
of the work ethic,
uh,
the idea of family,

108
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.110
the idea of certain forms of,
of,
of,

109
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:41.170
of moral behavior,
all of this,
uh,

110
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.270
is ideological and so far as it is supposed to be valid and equally the case for

111
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:54.161
all in all circumstances at all historical times.

112
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.663
In other words,

113
00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.670
the belief that what I see the world to be is just universally the way the world

114
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.143
is.

115
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.420
That is the general characterization of ideology.

116
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.860
Now we've seen this of course,

117
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:17.861
I mean we began the chorus with the quotation from marks from Marx's Kapital on

118
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:22.970
commodity fetish fetishism.
We've seen this,
uh,
in the way in which,

119
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.810
um,

120
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.810
it is just spontaneously supposed reflexively without reflection that the labor

121
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.920
properties of something that's produced that is to say the value that can accrue

122
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:41.150
to it because of the amount of labor that's gone into it is actually something

123
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:45.920
that inheres in the product itself of Labor.

124
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.160
Uh,
this of course applies as well to art.

125
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.190
And it's something that Benyamin is fully aware of alluding to when he talks

126
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.100
about the aura.

127
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.750
If I forget that art is produced,

128
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.930
that a certain quantum of labor in other words has gone into the,

129
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.480
uh,
the emergence of the work of art.

130
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.990
And if I simply enwrapped contemplative,
uh,

131
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.100
attention address myself to the work of art as itself as though it had objective

132
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:25.851
value apart from having been produced in a mode of production,

133
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.150
then what I'm doing is commodifying the work of art from Benu means point of

134
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.560
view.
In other words,

135
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.680
to be seduced by the aura of the work of art is in a certain sense to experience

136
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:46.020
the work of art ideologically as a commodity.

137
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:47.940
Alright,
now

138
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.730
returning then to the whole question of the aesthetic objectives,

139
00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:00.600
uh,
of Marxist criticism.
There are basically four options.

140
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:01.570
In other words,
boxes,

141
00:10:01.571 --> 00:10:06.270
criticism has not consistently agreed,
uh,

142
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.340
particularly in it's sort of sophisticated,
uh,

143
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.360
versions has not consistently agreed about what the aesthetic of art or actually

144
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:21.060
to be.
In other words,
how should art reflect society?

145
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.720
How should it constitute a critique of society?

146
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.630
How should it predict and ideal,
uh,

147
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.720
emergent Utopian Society?
Uh,

148
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:36.770
all of these questions are questions of aesthetic because the way in which art

149
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:38.100
does,
uh,

150
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.690
express the social is necessarily aesthetic.

151
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.930
It's done through form,
it's done through genre,

152
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.580
it's done as a matter of style.
It's done ultimately,

153
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.440
as the Marxist would say in this or that mode of production.

154
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.590
And all of these mediations of the,

155
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.800
of what you might call the expression of society,

156
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:07.010
then are understood as the aesthetic in Marxists thought.

157
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.640
And,
and,

158
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.930
and need to be understood in terms of possible options.

159
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.700
The aesthetic of Marx and angles themselves was realist,

160
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.950
but it was a kind of realist that was really rather sophisticated.

161
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:28.490
When aspiring writers already with the idea that they ought to be writing for

162
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:32.610
the advancement of the proletariat would right angles.

163
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.480
I'm thinking of 39 La Sal [inaudible].

164
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.020
Other people would sort of send a angles,

165
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:45.021
manuscripts of their sort of socialist realist novels and angles hated them.

166
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:50.390
He just,
he just couldn't stand,
uh,
that kind of literature.
And he said,
no,

167
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.280
no,
no,
no,
no.
You don't have to.
You,
you,
you,

168
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.280
you don't have to glorify the proletariat.
You,
you,
you,
you don't have to,
you,

169
00:11:58.281 --> 00:12:01.120
you don't have to project a future in this way.

170
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.240
What you want to do is see in a way that exposes it,

171
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.810
the social dynamic as it exists.

172
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.100
What you want to do is understand the world realistically,

173
00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:18.280
but not 10 denture sleep.
That is to say,

174
00:12:18.281 --> 00:12:21.370
not from an open point of view

175
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.870
angles as literary hero was Balzac who was a royalist reactionary,

176
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.120
but who nevertheless and angles his view,
uh,

177
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.190
was so brilliant in evoking society in all of its manifold complexities,

178
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:43.570
particularly in the complexity of its class structure,

179
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.410
that this was the model,
uh,

180
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:51.580
the appropriate model for people hoping to engage in the business of realist

181
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.510
writing.
Now,

182
00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.540
this was a motive thought that prevailed largely in Marxists through its early

183
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:05.950
energetic years,
including the early energetic years of the revolution itself.

184
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.750
In 1927,
the literary philosopher,
Georg Luke Hodge,

185
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.480
l U K,
a,
C s,

186
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.690
who had been a kind of alien theorists of literature,
he'd written,
uh,

187
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.630
a very brilliant book called the theory of the novel,
uh,

188
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.690
before he turned to Marxists thought in 1927 still notice the same year in which

189
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:35.611
I can bomb is writing his theory of the formal method and the same year in which

190
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:39.130
Benyamin visit Moscow and other,

191
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:44.131
it's a period of real continued social and intellectual ferment ferment within

192
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.670
the framework of Marxist government.

193
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.290
In 1927 wrote a book called the historical novel.

194
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.360
And this book is as though it were taken from angles,
his letters.

195
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:03.510
It's partly an attack on what Luke Hodge took to be the sort of narcissistic

196
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.630
inwardness of high modernism,
particularly Joyce and Proust.

197
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.950
It's a tendentious attack,
uh,

198
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:17.500
and certainly subject to criticism on all sorts of grounds.
It's partly that,

199
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.680
but it's also just in the way that angle's championed Balzac in his letters.

200
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:28.770
It's a book that champions the novels of Sir Walter Scott Scott too was a

201
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:32.770
political reactionary,
a Tory,

202
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.340
but who's great toward of dialectical balances in his novels between Highland

203
00:14:39.701 --> 00:14:44.320
and Loland feudal and Merck until Scotland and England,

204
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.080
whose balances of,
uh,

205
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:51.130
an old social order with an emerging social order.

206
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.980
Lucot took to be perfect example of vacations,

207
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.080
of what realism of seeing class relations as they really are,

208
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.633
can do.

209
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.630
And so this is the tradition of realist aesthetics in Marxist criticism.

210
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.520
But then as really dating from 1927 precisely,

211
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:21.410
uh,
with the rise of Stalin,
uh,
things began to change,

212
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.450
at least in the Soviet sphere.

213
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.370
And the original ideas of all these people who used to write to angles,

214
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:30.110
minecart ski non novelists,

215
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:35.210
all writers of that kind began to prevail in Soviet thought.

216
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.320
There was a literary critic named not off,
uh,

217
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.820
who articulated a doctrine of Soviet,

218
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.940
of socialist realism.
Um,
even the,

219
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.010
even Marxists critics themselves in,
in those days divided the sort of,

220
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.250
the joke about the sort of novel that she's not off had in mind.
Uh,

221
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.180
you probably know the joke.
Uh,
boy meets tractor,
uh,

222
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.740
boy loses tractor,

223
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.780
boy goes to the city to find tractor fines.
Tractor,
uh,

224
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.310
continues to be in love,

225
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:12.370
takes tractor back to the countryside and lives happily ever after this

226
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.340
fundamental plot.
Uh,
obviously a variant on the marriage plot,
uh,

227
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.210
but very much engaged also in,
uh,

228
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:25.100
what bank would call the mechanical aspect of reproduction.

229
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.490
Uh,
this,

230
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.360
this sort of plot as the characteristic plot of up socialist realism,

231
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.230
uh,
began to take hold officially.
So that,
um,

232
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.430
in 1934,
a,

233
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:45.490
the Soviet Culture Minister Bukharin a convened an international Soviet writers

234
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:51.401
conference in which it was simply decreed from on high that hence forth,

235
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.510
uh,
literary practice would consist in,
uh,

236
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:01.570
the promotion of an exemplification of socialist realism.

237
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.260
Uh,
and since then,

238
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:07.970
really right up until the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 since then,

239
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.800
uh,
there really was a form of censorship,
uh,
abroad,

240
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.910
uh,
in Soviet and Soviet sphere societies,
uh,

241
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:21.680
to the effect that,
uh,
literature was subject to challenge,

242
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.770
possibly to suppress and if PR to suppression if it didn't here to a socialist

243
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.910
realist tenants.

244
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:34.570
So those are the forms of realism that I think are most often identified with

245
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:38.510
Marxist criticism and it's possibilities.

246
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:40.550
But as a matter of fact,

247
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.590
probably the most dynamic criticism since Lou couch,
uh,

248
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:49.280
of the 20th century has recognized that realism,

249
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.110
something that after all,
from a Marxist perspective,

250
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:56.370
can easily be shown to have been commandeered by the Borzois z.

251
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.620
Who else tells it like it is,

252
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.770
who else insist that reality is just one drink below par?

253
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.570
Who else insists that,
uh,

254
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.600
that he or she is a realist other than the characteristic?

255
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.950
Um,
so middleclass per person,
uh,

256
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.010
who tells you that they've been there,

257
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.490
done that and know everything that there is to know.
Uh,

258
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:21.960
the middleclass in other words,

259
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:26.830
from the standpoint of much Marxists thought since,
uh,
[inaudible],
um,

260
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.890
has,
uh,
commandeered for itself just as a common deer.

261
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.930
Everything else for itself has commandeered for itself the idea of realism,

262
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.070
which has therefore become in these views,
uh,

263
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.020
outmoded aesthetically.
Now,

264
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:48.050
Benyamin is himself acutely conscious of this problem and he insists,

265
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.580
uh,
that a realism,
uh,

266
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.600
in a variety of ways is a kind of late capitalist,

267
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.740
uh,
form of commodifying the aura.
Uh,
it is,
uh,

268
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.800
it is the last gasp of a bourgeois art and a variety of ways.

269
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:09.030
He says,
hopefully,
uh,

270
00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:14.031
and it needs to be counteracted with what he takes to be a participatory

271
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.450
aesthetic,
an aesthetic,
uh,

272
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:21.650
of the fragment and aesthetic of a intermittent attention of,

273
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:27.420
um,
participation,
which does not,
uh,
nevertheless,

274
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.830
in any way involve a sense of persisting Lee,

275
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.090
uh,
uh,
uh,
contemplating that which is real.

276
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.790
But [inaudible] emphasizes rather,
uh,

277
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.850
the idea that one is oneself in a communal spirit and gauged with the very mode

278
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:49.110
of production of the work of art.
Uh,

279
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.140
and somehow or another involved in that,

280
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.410
that's what we'll come back to when we turn to Benu means work of our essay.

281
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.820
Perhaps the most unusual aesthetic moved for a Marxist criticism.

282
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.630
Marx's critic is the one that you will find in Adorno.

283
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:12.110
Adorno was devoted to precisely what Lou Kotch had attacked in the historical

284
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:18.420
novel,
namely the high modernist aesthetic.

285
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.610
He admired Beckett in literature.
He admired Suran bear bear.

286
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.770
They Barron in music.
Uh,

287
00:20:25.771 --> 00:20:30.771
Adorno was by training a musicologist and he devoted much of his writing career,

288
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.370
uh,
to,
uh,

289
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.060
producing essays and treatises on music and the history of music.
Uh,

290
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.520
these were heroes in Adorno's Pantheon.
And of course,

291
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:46.140
the question arises,
how can,

292
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.330
how can these people who have nothing to say about society,
Ah,

293
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.960
who are totally preoccupied with form,

294
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:56.470
who seem to be indifferent to the whole course of history?

295
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.590
How can these people be the aesthetic heroes of a Marxist critic?

296
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.690
This is something you see much more clearly in the fetish character,

297
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.790
a essay,
uh,
from which I've given you the two excerpts,
which I hope you have.

298
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:17.530
And I want to pause over them because I think Adorno's essay,

299
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.430
while perhaps a little quixotic because after all,

300
00:21:21.431 --> 00:21:26.431
whoever could profit from a concept of this kind that a effort essay is

301
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.450
nevertheless rather brilliant in its distinction between the totality or

302
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:40.201
wholeness that's offered to you by artistic form and the mirror total ization or

303
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:47.881
totalitarianism that's offered to you by modern hedgematic had had demonic forms

304
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.273
of government,

305
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.280
whether truly totalitarian or insidiously totalitarian,

306
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.820
like for example,

307
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.380
the culture industry to which he devotes the essay that you've read.

308
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.610
Um,
so this is what Adorno says in these two passages.
Um,

309
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.160
he's talking about the way in which,
uh,
people,
uh,

310
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.750
the people in the culture industry,
uh,

311
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.790
who appreciate music are completely victimized by the coloratura local effect.

312
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:20.381
Uh,

313
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:25.381
what you might call this is a conductor whom Adorno hated the Toscanini effect.

314
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.210
Uh,
that flourishing of a particular moment in a concerto,

315
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.950
the writing it into the ground at the expense of the whole,

316
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.050
everything that has everything that has,
uh,

317
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.410
what Adorno elsewhere calls lip smacking you funny,
uh,

318
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.450
that sort of in a,
in other words,

319
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:51.451
I kind of cultivation of perfection of local sound as opposed to an awareness of

320
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:57.550
the total composition.
So he says in the first passage,

321
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.820
the delight in the moment and the gay facade become an excuse for absolving the

322
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:09.061
listener from the thought of the whole whose claim is comprised in proper

323
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.373
listening,

324
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.090
the listener is converted along his line of least resistance because after all,

325
00:23:16.091 --> 00:23:21.091
it's so beautiful to listen to a converted along his line of least resistance

326
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:27.060
into the acquiescent purchasing no longer do the partial moments serve as a

327
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:33.190
critique of the whole,
as they sometimes do in modernism.

328
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.180
Dissonance,

329
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:39.330
in other words is in and of itself a critique of that overarching harmony with

330
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:42.940
which we associate wholeness,
right?

331
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.960
So there's a real sense in which the parts can be understood as a critique of

332
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:52.250
the whole without challenging or breaking down the whole,
uh,

333
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.030
no longer do the partial moment serve as a critique of the whole.

334
00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:01.150
Instead they suspend the critique which the successful aesthetic totality exerts

335
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.680
against the flawed one of society.
In other words,

336
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.520
nothing can criticize the

337
00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:20.210
inauthenticity of the bad totalities of society.

338
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:26.110
Then the authenticity of a genuine achieved wholeness in a work of art.

339
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.340
The difference between these senses of the hole is precisely the zone of

340
00:24:35.031 --> 00:24:35.864
critique,

341
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:40.870
which in a drawer view might just might awaken the,

342
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.680
uh,
the victim of the culture industry,
uh,

343
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.740
from the slumbers of happy conformism and acquiescence.

344
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.960
Now,
in the second passage,

345
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:58.650
just to reinforce this great modernist composers like Barrick shirt and,

346
00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:03.620
and very burn are called individualists by other Marxist critics and other words

347
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:08.480
by people like Luca who don't like this sort of,
you know,
this,
this,

348
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:08.810
this,

349
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.810
what [inaudible] would call fetishization of form reification of form.

350
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.960
At the expense of social reference and expression.

351
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:24.670
And yet their work is nothing but a single dialogue with the powers that destroy

352
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:26.300
individuality.

353
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:31.330
Powers who's formless shadows fall gigantically on their music in music to

354
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.470
collective powers are liquidating and individuality,

355
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.320
past saving,
but against them.

356
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:44.470
Only individuals are capable of consciously representing the aid,

357
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.490
the aims of collectivity.
In other words,
uh,
the,

358
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.970
the totality,
the achieved successful,

359
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:57.170
authentic totality of the work of art models,

360
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.620
the totality of a collective state in ways that none of the false totalities of

361
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:08.570
current had Geminis can possibly do or even approximate.

362
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:09.411
In other words,

363
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:14.411
there is an implicit politics in Adorno's argument in pure form.

364
00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.350
The achievement of pure form,

365
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.160
which is after all a collection of parts is an implicit politics modeling the

366
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:31.700
achievement of a collective society.
Right?

367
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.810
So that is the argument of Adorno.
It's a fascinating one.
As I say,

368
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:40.580
it's perhaps somewhat quixotic because it's kind of hard to imagine anyone

369
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:45.240
actually,
uh,
sort of listening to Sharon bag and saying,

370
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.010
gee,
maybe I should be a communist.
You know?
I mean,
yes.

371
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:51.480
You know,
there's sort of,

372
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.750
I actually actually putting this to work in other words,
uh,
you know,

373
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.490
entails and tells a certain amount of difficulty.
Uh,
but at the same time,
I mean,

374
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.810
intellectually it seems to me to be a fascinating turn of thought and one that

375
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:07.040
certainly does give one pause a,
uh,

376
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.280
if only because I'm a Marxist criticism is so often and gauged in a critique of

377
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:19.191
what it takes to be the mainstream aesthetic of Western civilization,

378
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.480
which is a kind of Fetis fetishization of wholeness.
Think of the new criticism,

379
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.760
the unity of the poem,

380
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.800
the discreet ontological object as a unified whole.

381
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.470
Uh,
this is of course a commonplace,
uh,

382
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.490
in being attacked by Marxists criticism.

383
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.580
And it's very interesting to see in a figure like Adorno a champion of this very

384
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:47.610
wholeness who,
whose,
who sees it as a model,

385
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.390
not of a narcissistic individuality,

386
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.840
but rather of call activity.
All right.
And finally,
uh,

387
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.040
and I won't pause much over this because it's going to be the subject of

388
00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:00.090
Thursday's lecture.

389
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.360
The last option for aesthetic option for Marxism is a surprising one.

390
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900
And it actually goes back to a book by Arentz block called the principle of

391
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:16.830
hope,
uh,
in which block essentially argues,
uh,
in,

392
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:21.090
uh,
the world as we have it.
Um,
in other words,

393
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.310
the grinding down of hope,
uh,
uh,
the,
the grant,

394
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.300
the grinding down of possibility for all in late capitalism,

395
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.220
there is no longer,
uh,
any hope available,
uh,
kind of,
uh,

396
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:40.080
kind of gloomy a prognosis with which,
uh,
block,
um,

397
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.440
uh,

398
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.440
counters the idea that especially in folk art folk ways,

399
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:52.020
oral culture,
uh,
and in popular culture,
uh,
in other words,

400
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:57.021
and the expressions of logging one fines in the work of the dispossessed and the

401
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:02.910
o pressed there is a kind of utopianism,

402
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.910
a romance,
a sense,

403
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:10.610
not so much of wishing for something past,
even though it,

404
00:29:10.611 --> 00:29:13.050
it seems to take the form of nostalgia,

405
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:18.150
but rather a projection of a possibility on the future,

406
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.630
which is simply unavailable.
And the real world,
of course,

407
00:29:21.631 --> 00:29:26.040
the best example I can think of as the Big Rock Candy Mountain,
uh,
you know,

408
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.870
I mean,
this is sun.
This is,
this is a song sung by people on chain gangs.
Uh,

409
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.681
about,
you know,

410
00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:35.670
liquor running down the sides of mountains and rivulets and you know,

411
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.290
everything just as it should be.
Uh,
the Big Rock Candy Mountain in other words,

412
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:44.950
is a perfect example of,
um,
a youth of,
of,

413
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:49.510
of the principle of hope as a,
as block understands it.

414
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.040
This is something that's picked up and taken very seriously by Frederic Jameson.

415
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.580
Not so much in the excerpt from the political con,

416
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.030
from the political unconscious that you'll be reading for the lecture.

417
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:06.190
But in an earlier part of that introductory chapter,
uh,

418
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.760
in which he talks about the importance of romance,
uh,

419
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.360
replacing the bankrupt aesthetic of realism,

420
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.390
the aesthetic of realism that has been appropriated by the bourgeoisie and as

421
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:23.530
expression,
expressing in a seemingly hopeless world,

422
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:28.510
uh,
the hopes of the oppressed and the dispossessed.

423
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:33.090
Uh,
so this too,
the idea of romance,
the idea of the,
of,

424
00:30:33.091 --> 00:30:37.690
of Utopian evocation,
uh,
is,
uh,

425
00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.740
a last viable aesthetic for,
um,

426
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.770
a certain turn of Marx's thought,

427
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.630
which has been interesting and productive in the 20th century.

428
00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:55.600
All right,
so today we take up numbers two and three,

429
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.450
the participatory aesthetic of Benyamin.

430
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:03.250
And the modernist totality of Adorno,

431
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.060
uh,

432
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:09.060
and we see the way in which they conflict with each other.

433
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.550
Now in some ways,

434
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:16.720
I wish we were still reading the fetish character essay because it has more to

435
00:31:16.721 --> 00:31:20.950
do with aesthetics than the excerpt you have in your book by Adorno and

436
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:25.900
Horkheimer called the culture industry.
But the culture industry to,
uh,

437
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:31.020
is a response as was the fetish character in music which was published 1938 to

438
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.100
Banyan means work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction.

439
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.400
Adorno who was a close friend of venue means and who exchanged letters about

440
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.450
Benny means work of our essay with him,
letters by the way,

441
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:50.620
which were republished in the new left review of 1973.

442
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.420
Those of you who are interested in looking at them,

443
00:31:52.421 --> 00:31:54.460
because this is another source of,

444
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.870
of ways of seeing how Benyamin uh,

445
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.730
and Adorno we're in conflict over this matter.
Uh,
uh,

446
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.190
Datto and Benyamin,
as I say,
we're a very close friends.

447
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.590
Uh,
Benyamin,
uh,

448
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.650
was only for a relatively brief period in the 1930s,

449
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.230
a Marxist critic.
Uh,

450
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.260
he had hitherto been much more interested in a cabalistic literature in the

451
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:29.590
Hungarian tradition of philosophy.
Uh,
and even in the 1930s,

452
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.090
he was famously torn,
uh,
between two possibilities.

453
00:32:34.091 --> 00:32:39.091
He had visited Moscow in 1926 27 he had become interested in what was still,

454
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:45.630
after all,
as I've said,
a vibrant culture,
uh,
in,
uh,

455
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.390
the Soviet world.
Um,

456
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.830
and at the same time he had become very close friends with the Marxist

457
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:56.831
playwright Bertolt Brecht and I had fallen also very much under his influence.

458
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.920
But another very close friend of friend,

459
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:05.780
equally influential was the,
uh,
Jewish theologian Guercio.

460
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:10.370
I'm showing them who had emigrated to Jerusalem,
uh,

461
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.840
who was a Zionist and who wanted Benyamin to join him,

462
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:20.060
uh,
studying,
uh,
the Torah in Jerusalem,

463
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.100
uh,
and to,
uh,

464
00:33:22.101 --> 00:33:27.101
engage himself in that community as opposed to the sort of international Marxist

465
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:33.251
community toward which toward which Benyamin was perhaps more leaning,

466
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.450
especially,
uh,
owing to his friendship with brackets.
So,

467
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.100
even in the 1930s,

468
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:45.130
even in the period when Brexit wrote his work of art essay and also a shorter,

469
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.270
even more tangential essay called the author as producer,

470
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.580
a 1936,
uh,

471
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:57.610
an essay in which he actually takes up linked something he mentions in passing

472
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:02.840
in the work of art essay.
That is to say the way in which,
uh,
in Russia,

473
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.800
everybody is judged not just for being able to do a job,

474
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.510
but for being able to talk about doing a job,
uh,
for,
to be able to write it up,

475
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:14.000
to describe it,
to write a brochure about it,

476
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:18.940
to write a letter to the paper about it.
Uh,
in other words,
to participate,
uh,

477
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.100
to be engaged not just in the labor force,

478
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:27.220
but also in reflections on the labor force in a way that really does mean that

479
00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:31.550
everyone can be an author.

480
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.820
And also that every author is a producer.

481
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:36.800
That is to say engaged in writing,

482
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:41.060
which is part and parcel of the productions of labor.

483
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:45.380
Uh,
all of this was a focus of venue mean,

484
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.000
but at the same time,
even within this focus,
uh,
there,
he,

485
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:52.940
part of him is being torn in another direction.

486
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.550
No one can for a minute.

487
00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:01.390
In reading the work of art essay fail to notice that Benyamin Eve events is

488
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:04.310
tremendous nostalgia for the aura.

489
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.540
It's not an easy thing for our,
for Benyamin to say,

490
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:13.541
we have to tear down the aura and replace it with a kind of participatory

491
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.970
participatory mode,
uh,
that,
uh,

492
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.600
engages with and is involved in mechanical reproduction.
I mean,
I mean,

493
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.180
I don't know,
when I was a student,
I worked on and off,

494
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.220
I did this for years,
um,
in an art supply and picture framing store,
uh,

495
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:33.910
on the Berkeley campus.
And,
uh,

496
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.160
of course every student needed a picture,
uh,
putting his room.

497
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.790
And so we had huge stacks of Van Gogh's,

498
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:43.980
sunflowers and uh,

499
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.760
Matisse's dancers and certain other paintings.

500
00:35:47.761 --> 00:35:52.080
All of them 18 by 24,
which we call brushstroke prints.
They were,

501
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.220
they were mounted on cardboard,
ah,

502
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.950
and a huge home cookie cutter of some kind would come down on top of them.

503
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.530
Actually laminating into the print,
the appearance of brush strokes,

504
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:08.130
uh,
and these things,
if you squinted at the beginning of a semester,

505
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.410
would you,
you saw the stack going down like this.
In other words,
you,
you,

506
00:36:12.411 --> 00:36:15.300
you know,
and then before you knew it,
the stacks were gone.

507
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:19.650
And so you knew for a fact,
because you knew how many prints were in that stack,

508
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.610
that,
you know,

509
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.610
240 students rooms were festooned with van Gogh's,

510
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:32.880
sunflowers,
Matisse's dancers.
And you said to yourself,

511
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:37.520
this is the fruit of mechanical reproduction,
you know,
this,
you know,
and,

512
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.410
and you asked yourself again,
just,
you know,
just,

513
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:45.270
just what is the value of this as an authentic,
as an aesthetic.

514
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.920
Yeah.
Takes it out of the museum.
Yeah.
It means that nobody has to pay,

515
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:53.260
um,
you know,
50 bucks in order to stand,
to,

516
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.270
to wait in a long line in order to get a peep at the Mona Lisa.
Yeah.
You know,

517
00:36:57.271 --> 00:37:01.080
I mean,
it really does bring it home to the people,
but how,

518
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.490
and in what way?

519
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.700
And at the expense of what genuine knowledge of art history and even a van Gogh

520
00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:09.900
and mattise um,

521
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.700
does the fetishization because it is after all a fetishization of these little

522
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:18.750
mechanically reproduced brushstroke prints amount too.

523
00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.830
Obviously this introduces complications and their complications.

524
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:27.330
The whole point of my anecdote there complications of which Benyamin is far from

525
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:32.290
being unaware.
He knows extremely well that,
um,

526
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.580
after all the greatest threat to an aesthetic of a kind he profounds is that it

527
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:42.900
can be commandeered by capital.
Of course,

528
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:47.901
I'm getting ahead of myself because that's precisely what Ardorno says in

529
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:50.430
opposition to him.
But in the meantime,

530
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:56.060
that was the situation of Benyamin and the 1930s Adorno in the meantime had gone

531
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:00.810
to the United States.
Benyamin was living in Paris ever since 1933.

532
00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:05.550
Adorno had gone to the United States,
um,
which he hated.
I mean,

533
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.270
they,

534
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:11.270
the gloom of Adorno's view of the world is not so much the result of the,

535
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.530
of his experiences of that,

536
00:38:16.531 --> 00:38:20.170
of the week forms of democracy and the Weimar Republic,
um,

537
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:25.370
sort of ominous as those experiences were not even perhaps so much their eyes of

538
00:38:25.921 --> 00:38:30.921
nuts ism because like Benyamin he was able to flee that the gloom that he felt

539
00:38:31.501 --> 00:38:33.780
and the gloom that pervades his writing,

540
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:39.050
which after all starts in the mid 1940s is the result of his exposure to

541
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:41.800
American culture.

542
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.020
He simply could not stand us or our culture.
Uh,

543
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:49.690
he couldn't stand jazz.
Remember,
this was,

544
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.170
this was not yet the age of Bebop and I've always felt that maybe if a donor

545
00:38:54.171 --> 00:38:57.750
would hung around a little longer,
he could have,
he could have been reconciled.

546
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:02.410
It was,
no,
it was,
it was no longer the jazz of the APP.
Lee named director,

547
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.250
the conductor,
Paul White men,
you know,
it was,
it was,
you know,
it was,

548
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.650
it was jazz of,
of,
of,
of,
of,
of that was some work somewhat more serious.

549
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.450
He couldn't stand the movies.
Um,
I've just been,
I've just been,
for purposes,

550
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:19.100
I won't go into watching a film called,
uh,

551
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:24.140
Broadway melody of 1940 with Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell tap dancing and

552
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.280
Fred Astaire,
you know,
is sort of read and,
and,
and,
and his sidekick,

553
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:35.281
George Murphy are sort of grabbed out of obscurity in order to be the leading

554
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:37.870
gentlemen of Eleanor Paul.

555
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:42.530
It's a perfect sort of Samuel smiles success story replete with,
uh,

556
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.960
the necessity of occasional self sacrifice on the part of both of them.
I mean,

557
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.160
it is,
it is made for the wrath of Adorno this film,

558
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.690
but it is,
um,
it is at,

559
00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.070
and it's nevertheless in ways that Adorno could not possibly ever,
uh,

560
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.550
come to feel quite charming.
Um,
but,
but,

561
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:08.410
but Adorno wanted no part of American culture.
And he was,
uh,

562
00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:12.910
in anticipation of that whole trend of American sociology,
uh,

563
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:16.870
obsessed with,
um,
the way in which,
uh,

564
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.080
American society is dominated by conformism.

565
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.270
He takes this to be the effect,

566
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:26.170
the result of the pervasive,
um,
oh,

567
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:29.320
oppressive thumb of the culture industry,

568
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:34.410
so that our very eccentricities are very quirks and little originality.

569
00:40:35.271 --> 00:40:39.400
He's all of them are assessed carefully by the culture industry.

570
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.820
A niche is found for them.
And the next thing you know,

571
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.910
we're suborned just like everybody else.

572
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.250
There is a in four Adorno,
uh,

573
00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:53.950
no sideways escape from the Monolithic,

574
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.820
uh,

575
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.820
a ubiquitous surveillance and dominance of the culture industry.

576
00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.820
All right.
Now the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction,
um,

577
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:11.130
is influenced obviously by the promise of Russian art before 1934.

578
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:16.310
The films a very tough,
uh,
in particular,
uh,

579
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.480
and other ways in which it's possible for Benyamin to say that the spectator

580
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.870
really can be a participant.

581
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.400
It's possible for Benyamin to say that in such context.

582
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.420
It's a good thing that the pedestal in the,
the,
the,
the,

583
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.661
the,

584
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:40.661
the pedestals aura of the work of art has been successfully torn down that we no

585
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:47.150
longer stand in rapturous attention bef uh,

586
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:52.100
and in contemplative postures before works of art.
But that we,

587
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.310
uh,
reach out to them and they reached out to us.

588
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:59.990
We meet halfway and we become engaged with them.
We become part of them.

589
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.660
Now how does this work in this essay?

590
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:07.810
Primarily through the insertion of the Labor function of the apparatus in the

591
00:42:12.501 --> 00:42:13.790
represented field.

592
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:19.090
Now this is a complicated idea that Benyamin develops in various ways,

593
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:25.330
but what he means by this is that the spectator sees the object sees whatever

594
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:31.451
the field in question is from the perspective of the mode of production data is

595
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:38.351
to say that what the perspective the spectator participates by joining the

596
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:40.760
process of production.

597
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:46.490
Most obviously this means that when I watch a film,

598
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:51.880
I see the film necessarily of course from the standpoint of the camera eye,

599
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.440
my eye,
in other words joins that of the camera.

600
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:03.320
Very interesting that in Berlin and the 1930s Christopher itches issue would in

601
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:05.050
his Berlin stories,
uh,

602
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:09.650
wrote one story called I'm a camera taking place in Berlin.

603
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.380
I've often thought there's some sort of symbiosis between the notion,
uh,

604
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.220
I am a camera,
uh,

605
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.740
in Christopher Isherwood and the way in which it may be appropriate,

606
00:43:19.741 --> 00:43:24.710
it or it may simply be a happy coincidence,
uh,
and the work of Benyamin.

607
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.890
But in a certain sense for Benyamin the spectator to be a participant is the

608
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:34.550
camera is,
in other words,
the camera's eye.

609
00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.740
What is the consequence of this?
Well,

610
00:43:36.741 --> 00:43:41.741
the spectator is in a certain sense then a critic Benyamin keeps comparing the

611
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.930
eye of the camera with a test.

612
00:43:45.931 --> 00:43:50.780
He even compares it with the vocational aptitude test.
It says though,

613
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:54.740
what in the theater would count as an audition.

614
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.660
I appeared before the director.

615
00:43:56.661 --> 00:43:59.660
I recite certain lines of the script and I'm either uh,

616
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.450
told to come back another day or I'm given the part what that it,

617
00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:08.520
it's as though to substitute what counts as an audition with the perpetual

618
00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:12.380
audition of the film actor before the camera.

619
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.530
Because after all there's the camera recording what the film actor is doing.

620
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.320
But the camera,
not this camera up here by the way,

621
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:24.140
but ordinarily the camera has the opera,

622
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.790
the option of later on throwing out what is it any good?
I would that they could,

623
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.440
uh,
but,
but,
but,
but the,
but the,

624
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:36.470
but the film camera can edit the film camera as part of an editing process so

625
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:41.460
that the actor in front of the camera is perpetually being tested,

626
00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:45.240
auditioned in just the way that,
uh,

627
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:50.270
you might be tested or audition if you took a vocational aptitude test for a job

628
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:52.500
that's been you means point.

629
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:57.150
And what he means to say is that if the spectator then takes the camera's eye

630
00:44:57.151 --> 00:45:00.270
position,
the spectator,
him or herself,

631
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:05.271
then becomes a critic like a sports fan then and mean doesn't pretend for a

632
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:09.840
moment that to become a critic of this kind is to be a good critic.

633
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.970
Not at all,
not at all by any mean agrees with people that we the WHO say,
well,

634
00:45:14.971 --> 00:45:19.530
we go to the movies when we're tired.
All we want is to be entertained.
In fact,

635
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:21.270
we are distracted.

636
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:26.810
We are critics as Benyamin argues in a state of distraction.

637
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.820
The German word is sash steroid junk.

638
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.440
We are self steroid and we're perpetually,
in other words,
uh,

639
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:39.650
not quite paying attention even while at the same time we are seeing things from

640
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:44.610
the camera eye point of view to see things from the camera.

641
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:48.030
I'll come back to distraction and a minute to see things from the camera.

642
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:53.031
Eye Point of view is a position of privilege because it exposes as Benyamin

643
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:59.210
tells us again and again things about reality that we wouldn't otherwise notice.

644
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.540
The camera is capable of slow motion.

645
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.340
It's capable of angles of incidents that we couldn't otherwise see.

646
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.840
It's capable of all kinds of effects.
Let me enumerate them.

647
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:16.980
I think it's on page.
Uh,
1235

648
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:22.870
photographic reproduction,
top of the left end hall.

649
00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:26.790
I'm photographic reproduction with the aid of certain processes such as

650
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:31.791
enlargement or slow motion can capture images which escaped natural vision.

651
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.100
And on page 1245,
he gives this process a name.

652
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.960
He says the camera introduces us to unconscious optics.

653
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:48.020
Optics just as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses.

654
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.110
In other words,

655
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:53.580
the camera's eye point of view is a privileged perspective.

656
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:58.610
It does show us things as they are or perhaps if not as they are,

657
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:03.930
at least it reminds us that things as we see them with the naked eye aren't

658
00:47:03.931 --> 00:47:06.540
necessarily as they are.
I mean,

659
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.600
it's not perhaps so much of a notion of privileging what the camera sees as real

660
00:47:13.231 --> 00:47:14.910
over against what I see.

661
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:18.570
It's a question of the camera reminding us,

662
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:21.660
demystifying our ideology in short,

663
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.080
reminding us that things as we see them aren't necessarily the way things are.

664
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:33.560
The too may have,
it's biased.
Slow motion is an obvious bias.

665
00:47:33.561 --> 00:47:35.260
Speed up as an obvious bias,

666
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:40.030
but the speed at which we things see things may be a bias too.

667
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.300
That's the point of the expo.
I mean it's not that,

668
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.890
it's not that the psychoanalytic unconscious is telling the truth.

669
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.460
I mean dreams are crazy,
right?
That's the whole point of dreams.

670
00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.473
It's not that it's,

671
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:57.310
it's not that it's reality over against a mystified world scene in

672
00:47:57.311 --> 00:47:58.150
consciousness.

673
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:03.450
It's a challenge to consciousness by the world evoked in the unconscious,

674
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:07.720
not a question of what's real and what isn't real well,

675
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:12.430
it's the same with the camera's eye point of view and it's all of this which

676
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:17.490
awakens in a certain sense awakens the spectator from the complacency of

677
00:48:19.391 --> 00:48:24.391
supposing his or her own perspective to be the truth at the same time.

678
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:29.320
Admittedly the spectator is,
is distracted self steroid.

679
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.960
Well what then the point is this,

680
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:36.640
there's a kind of dialectic between distraction and shock,

681
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.010
which is crucial.

682
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:43.660
Vanderveen Benyamin thanks to a genuine,
uh,

683
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.030
re aesthetic revelation.
Uh,

684
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.410
perhaps the best analogy is with Saul on the road to Damascus.

685
00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:54.580
You know how the story goes.
Saul's trotting along on his horse and you know,

686
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:58.450
not paying a lot of attention is distracted,
daydreaming,
whatever,

687
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:01.480
and all of a sudden he falls off his horse.
All right?

688
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.760
That's a shock and it's such a shock that he's converted to Christianity and he

689
00:49:06.761 --> 00:49:10.790
stands up and he brushes himself off and his name is Paul,
right?
He's,

690
00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.950
he's a completely different person,
you know,
as a result,

691
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:18.790
and this couldn't have happened.
In other words,
if he hadn't been distracted,

692
00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.460
right?
That's been your mains point.

693
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:26.910
Distraction is the atmosphere or medium in which the shock of revelation can

694
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:32.110
take place.
And that's the advantage of distraction.

695
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:37.320
He gives a wonderful example of the way in which we do receive works of art in

696
00:49:37.461 --> 00:49:39.640
distraction.
Even if ordinary.
I mean,

697
00:49:39.641 --> 00:49:43.180
even if we're the kind of person who does pay a lot of attention when they go to

698
00:49:43.181 --> 00:49:47.260
the movies and we go,
oh,
that's not me.
We say,
nevertheless,

699
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:51.070
there is one way in which all of us receive works of art in a State of

700
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.160
distraction.
And that's in our reception of architecture.

701
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:57.670
We pass through architecture.
I mean,

702
00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.180
I work in the British arts centre every day.

703
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:04.690
I long since ceased to pay any attention to the British art center as a
building.

704
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:08.560
Uh,
I'd,
I'd,
I received the British arts centre,
in other words,

705
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:09.850
in a state of distraction.

706
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.530
But that doesn't mean that it's not part of my aesthetic experience.

707
00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:19.650
It does,
however,
show that the aesthetic and the,
and,
and,

708
00:50:19.651 --> 00:50:19.941
and,

709
00:50:19.941 --> 00:50:24.941
and the ways in which the ways in which we process the forms of the world can be

710
00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:31.160
assimilated in more than one kind of state of attention.
Uh,

711
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.120
it is,
uh,

712
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:36.800
in one's bones in a certain sense to receive architecture.

713
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.290
And yet at the same time,
uh,

714
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:44.060
unless we are sort of tourists gaping in front of the Taj Mahal with a camera,

715
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:45.530
something like that.
And,
and,
and,

716
00:50:45.531 --> 00:50:50.531
and Benyamin does take that into account unless we are in that particular mode.

717
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:56.350
We received the forms of our dwellings and a state of what you might call

718
00:50:57.021 --> 00:50:58.730
constructive distraction.

719
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.120
All of that goes in to Banyan means aesthetic of participation.

720
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.440
Now,
I am out of time,

721
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:11.090
perhaps I've said just about as much about Adorno as I need to say,

722
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:15.380
although admittedly I haven't said much about the culture industry essay.
Uh,

723
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.030
maybe I'll come back to that briefly,
uh,

724
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.880
before launching into Jameson on Thursday.
On Tuesday of next week,

725
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:27.650
we'll be talking about the new historicism and then we'll bring Tony back.
Uh,

726
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:31.250
and we'll go through all of these various perspectives that we will have been

727
00:51:31.251 --> 00:51:35.540
rehearsing,
uh,
to see what we can do with them.
When we read Toni.
