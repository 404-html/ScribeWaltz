WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.080
I'm going to be pointing to the board,
at least in theory,

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.820
I suppose I expect to be pointing to the board a little bit more today than

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.560
ordinarily.
Um,
so,
uh,
the,
the,

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.450
the usual function of my,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.730
my equivalent of PowerPoint isn't quite the same today because I'm taking an

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:24.900
interest in some of these diagrammatic matters as well.
Uh,
and as I say,

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.460
I will be,
I will be pointing to them.
All right.
So to begin,

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
I'm actually going to postpone something that you're probably already wondering

9
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.510
about,
although it will come in to this lecture on a couple of occasions.

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.230
That is to say the full relationship,
uh,

11
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:48.231
in terms of the influence of both movements between the Russian formalists,

12
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.740
uh,

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.740
and so serves notion of semiology and Santiago sticks until next week when we

14
00:00:56.221 --> 00:01:00.690
discussed Roman Yacob sins,
essay,
linguistics and poetics,

15
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:01.910
where I think,
uh,

16
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.600
the relationship between the two movements in which he himself was involved,
uh,

17
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.490
will become clearer,
uh,

18
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.390
and will come into focus more naturally than if I tried to,

19
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.100
if I tried to outline what the connection between the two movements is now.

20
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.170
So that is an aspect of our sequence of lectures,

21
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.820
uh,
beginning with the last one,
uh,
that will be postponed until next week.

22
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.163
Now,

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.760
semiotics is not in itself a literary theory,
uh,

24
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.110
as we'll learn from the occupation next week,

25
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.730
literature can be understood or what he calls sort of the study of literature.

26
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.731
Poetics can be understood as a sub field of semiotics,

27
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.390
but semiotics is not in itself a literary theory.
In other words,

28
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.070
perhaps to your frustration,

29
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.660
what you read today has nothing at all in and of itself to tell you about

30
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:58.111
literature.

31
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:02.970
This isn't the last time this will happen during the course of the syllabus.
Uh,

32
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:07.500
but then of course our job is to bring out the implications for literature of

33
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.100
texts that we read,
um,

34
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.010
that don't have any direct bearing on literary study.
The important thing about,

35
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:16.590
so sir and the,
uh,

36
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.620
the discipline of semiotics is the incredible influence that had,

37
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.350
it has had on virtually every form of subsequent literary theory.

38
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.150
And that that's what we need to keep in mind.

39
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.800
A semiotics evolves into what is called structuralism,

40
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.770
which we will be considering next week.
Uh,
and that in turn,
um,

41
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.870
as it were bequeaths it's terminology and it set of issues and frameworks for

42
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.750
thinking to,
to deconstruction,

43
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.950
to a Lacanian psychoanalysis to French Marxism to binary theories of race,

44
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.740
colonization and gender.
In other words,

45
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.800
do a great deal that we will be studying subsequently on the syllabus.

46
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.990
So while again,

47
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.260
what we read for today is not in itself literary theory.

48
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.870
It is nevertheless crucially formative for a great many of the developments in

49
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:24.010
literary theory that we'll be studying now.
Just as a,
I don't know,

50
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.870
an anecdotal or conjectural aside,
I've always found it so fascinating.

51
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.380
I can never resist talking about it.
Um,

52
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.570
the relationship between various texts in our field,

53
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:41.530
history of criticism,
literary theory,
texts that are considered foundational,

54
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.700
which curiously enough,
I'll off Fuko,

55
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.740
don't actually have an author,
Aristotle's poetics.
Uh,

56
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:55.630
we know actually not to have been one of the texts written by Aristotle,

57
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.631
but rather to be a compendium of lecture notes put together by his students.

58
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.580
Uh,
and this is one of the reasons why,
uh,

59
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:10.370
in the golden age of Arabic scholarship in the Middle Ages,
uh,

60
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.190
there was so much dispute about the poetics,
the,
the,

61
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.260
the manuscripts we find from this period of full of marginal notes where the

62
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.920
scholars are chiding each other and saying,
no,
no,
no.
It can't be that way.

63
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.080
In other words,
in a way,

64
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:28.081
it's a disputed text and it is not a written by Aristotle.

65
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:30.380
It's a foundational text.
Um,

66
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.770
Aristotle is considered the father of criticism,
um,

67
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.090
and yet he is so as what Fuko would call a founder of discursivity.

68
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.730
Well,
the odd thing is it's exactly the same,
uh,
with,

69
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:47.731
so sir who can be considered the father or patriarch of a certain kind of

70
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.650
literary theory as I've just indicated.

71
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.980
So Sarah's course in general linguistics is not something written by so sewer,

72
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.040
but is a compendium of lecture notes written by his students in a series of

73
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.930
lectures that he gave from 1960 to 1911.
Um,

74
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.840
and then gathered together in book form,
uh,
by two of,

75
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.960
by two of his disciples who were linguists.

76
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.900
Now it's odd that we have that this text,

77
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:23.740
it does have the same formative function.
Scholars who go to Geneva,

78
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.060
uh,
go for a variety of reasons when they look at the socio or archive.

79
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.630
Some of them are predisposed to dislike.
So sir,

80
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.310
and to hope that they can somehow discredit him,
uh,

81
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.380
by learning more about things that he thought that aren't actually in the text,

82
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.910
uh,
others likeso sir,

83
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
and feel that he needs to be rescued from his compositors and yet others go,

84
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.990
uh,

85
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.990
in an attitude of worship and a hope that the archive will yield to them full

86
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.870
confirmation of the integrity of the text we call the course in general

87
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:05.240
linguistics,
uh,
there.
So that in a way,
the study,

88
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.370
the study of the socio archive,

89
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:11.660
given the volatile relationship of that archive with the actual texts that we

90
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.550
have,
um,
is,
uh,

91
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.030
a kind of map that if one were to study it,

92
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.180
one could associate with the history of thinking about literary theory in the

93
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:25.940
20th century.
This is really all neither here nor there.

94
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:30.941
I just find it interesting that two people who are incontestably Scott,

95
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.680
founders of discursivity and the field that we study,
uh,

96
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.630
are in fact not strictly speaking authors.

97
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.140
So now they're confirming the,
uh,

98
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:47.060
the insight of Fuko in the essay that we began by reading.
Anyway,

99
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:51.890
enough of that,
uh,
we have to try to figure out what so sewer is up to.
And,

100
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.770
uh,
let's,
and let's move on to begin to do so.

101
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.000
Semiology,
what is semiology?

102
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.870
It's the study of existing conventional communicated systems.

103
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.910
All of these systems we can call languages and language.

104
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.800
That is to say the words that we use when we speak to each other is one of those

105
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.780
systems,
other systems,
the gestures that mine's use.

106
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.950
Semaphores railroad,
semaphores a stoplight,

107
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.260
red,
green,
yellow is a semiotic system.
In other words,

108
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.760
all of them are modes of communication with which we function,
uh,

109
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.790
the intelligibility of which allows us to negotiate the worlds around us.

110
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.430
Semiotics has expanded into ev into every imaginable aspect of thought.

111
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:47.594
There is a,

112
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.600
there is a Darwinian semiotics understanding the relationships among species and

113
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.940
semiotic terms.
Uh,
there is in other words,
uh,

114
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.320
a semiotics of virtually every imaginable thing.

115
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:05.410
Understood as a language made up of a system of signs,

116
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.850
signs we'll be getting to in a minute.
But in the meantime,

117
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.530
it's important to understand what semiology actually is.

118
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.430
That's what it is now.
Um,
oh,
I meant to ask you,

119
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.090
how many of you did not bring a,

120
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.840
the passages that I sent to you by email last night.
All right,

121
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:29.630
we have them here.
Uh,
and there'll be passed around.

122
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.650
We have about 25 copies.
So don't take one if you don't need it.

123
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.630
I'm not going to pause.

124
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:40.490
I am going to be turning to the second passage on the sheet,
um,

125
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.860
in which,
uh,
in which,
uh,

126
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.890
something about the nature of these systems I think can be made clear.

127
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.750
Language says social media is a function of the speaker.

128
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.210
Now here of course he is talking about human language.

129
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.690
Human language is not a function of the speaker.

130
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:09.020
It is a product that is passively assimilated by the individual.

131
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.400
Now what does this mean?

132
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.470
The fact that human language is not my language.

133
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:20.670
That is to say the fact that it doesn't originate in me.

134
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.130
The fact that it's not for,
in other words,

135
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:28.131
by private language is of course a certain loss because it means that when I

136
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:32.610
speak,
when I use language in speech,

137
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.230
I'm using something that is not strictly my own,
it's conventional.

138
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:41.970
That is to say it belongs in the public sphere to all of us and there's a

139
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:45.870
perhaps a certain sort of romantic loss in that.

140
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.100
Wouldn't it be nice if language in some sense were my own,

141
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.370
but the incredible game which makes language something like at the object of

142
00:09:56.701 --> 00:09:59.430
science that so Sarah is hoping to secure.

143
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.910
This is one of the things obviously that he has in common with the formalists

144
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.870
they incredible game is that if language is not private,

145
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.760
if it's not my own,
if it's not something that I can make up as I go along,

146
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.060
if in other words it is conventional belonging to all of us,

147
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:20.460
that's precisely what allows it to be communicated.

148
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:27.250
It is a system of signs and other words that we can make use of that we

149
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:34.061
recognize as signs precisely because the exist among us as something that can be

150
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:37.940
shared in common.

151
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.930
And so this then is the object of saucers attention as a linguist,

152
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.800
uh,
and as a semiotician

153
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.513
<v 1>no.</v>

154
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880
<v 0>What's implied and this idea is that language is something that we use.</v>

155
00:10:58.671 --> 00:11:00.350
I don't,
I mean the,
the,

156
00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.710
the best way to say it and the quickest way to say it is that I don't speak

157
00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:04.544
language.

158
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:12.480
Language is something that exists as an aggregate all at once,

159
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.450
arguably.
And this is something that's going to come up again as well.
And again,

160
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:23.590
as we come back to these coordinates that we'll be touching on from time to time

161
00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:28.090
today,
also,
arguably language is something virtual.

162
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:29.530
You remember that Freud said,

163
00:11:29.531 --> 00:11:34.531
we have to infer the unconscious from the erratic behavior of consciousness.

164
00:11:35.321 --> 00:11:37.120
I mean,
there's gotta be something back there.

165
00:11:37.121 --> 00:11:39.880
So we're going to call it the unconscious and we're going to try to describe it

166
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.930
very much the same with language.
Long as so Sarah calls it.
It sounds like,

167
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.640
I mean what we do is speak and when we speak,

168
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.270
of course we say correctly that we use language,

169
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.800
but we need to know what language is and we need to understand the relationship

170
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:58.270
between language and speech.

171
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.420
Now we can understand language as a kind of aggregate of everything that's in

172
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.710
the lexicon,

173
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.950
in the dictionary together with everything that would be in some sort of ideal

174
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.160
or utterly systematized a rule set of rules of grammar and syntax,

175
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:23.860
but there is no real aggregate of the aggregate of that kind.
In other words,

176
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:24.671
it exists.

177
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:29.671
It's there to be put together partly as a matter of experiment and partly as a

178
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.460
matter of conjecture by the linguists,

179
00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.390
but as as a composite thing existing in a spacial simultaneity,

180
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:42.930
Sin Chronically

181
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.480
language is something that in a very real sense as is the case with Freud,

182
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.780
we infer from speech now speech is what we do.

183
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.740
Speech is the way in which we appropriate deploy and make use of language.

184
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.260
And so Sarah calls that pothole.

185
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.710
Powell is the unfolding in time of a set of possibilities given in space.

186
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.480
That set of possibilities being sort of being what a socio recalls long

187
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.180
now language is a system of signs.

188
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.580
What does a sign?

189
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.410
So Sarah's famous diagrams make it clear enough.

190
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.310
We have above the line a concept and we have below the line a sound image and

191
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:44.290
other words I think of something and that thinking or,
or,

192
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.040
or,
or,

193
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.040
and that thinking of something corresponds to a sound image that I have ready to

194
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.020
hand for it.

195
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
And that can be understood in terms of thinking of the concept tree.

196
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.560
That's why this is in quotation marks and I speak Latin and funk.

197
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.400
And,
and,
and,
and knowing that the,
uh,

198
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:14.230
the sound image correlative to the concept tree is our board.

199
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:19.360
Right?
Or I can think of
something like that,

200
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.220
uh,
something hidden in some way resembling that.
And by the same token,

201
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:26.170
I still speak Latin.
Uh,

202
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.160
the sound image corresponding to it is our bore.

203
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.060
Now I'm going to,
I may or may not get back to this today,

204
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:38.510
but in this question,
mark is the secret of deconstruction.
All right,
just,
just,

205
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.900
just,
just do,
just to keep you poised and on tender hooks.

206
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.160
But in the meantime,

207
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:50.250
what so is doing with this relationship above and below the line is he's saying

208
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.740
that is an arbitrary relationship between the concept and the sound image.

209
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.440
The concept he calls a signified,

210
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.690
uh,
the sound image he calls a signifier,

211
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.180
assign,
in other words,

212
00:15:09.181 --> 00:15:13.350
is made up of two sides in a,

213
00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:15.180
as it were a thought moment.

214
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.110
The real a relationship between that which is signified and that which signifies

215
00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:23.420
it,
add it,
add it.

216
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:27.030
And it's to be understood that we have to think of them together.

217
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.260
They're not divisible,
their relationship is necessary.

218
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.970
But as we'll see in a minute,

219
00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.870
arbitrary and each sign is like that.

220
00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.260
And the way in which we put signs together is to take these bundles,

221
00:15:43.471 --> 00:15:48.471
these binary relationships between a concept and a sound image and adjust them

222
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.090
in an unfolding sequence.
That's how we speak.

223
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:58.800
That's how we make a sentence.
All right?

224
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.190
So
in a way,

225
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.400
the idea that a signifier us,

226
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.650
a sound that I make are bore refers to a concept.

227
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.090
And by implication,

228
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.390
by very powerful and strong and necessary application,

229
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.520
not do a thing

230
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.160
is not in itself new.

231
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.850
The idea that a word signifies an idea and not an object is already fully

232
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:33.401
developed.

233
00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:38.200
And John Locke's essay on human understanding and is more or less commonly

234
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:43.210
agreed on ever afterwards and is as I say,

235
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.213
uh,
uh,

236
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:49.230
in itself a conventional thought that so sir adopt and makes you so,

237
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.690
but what is new?
And so sir,

238
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.780
and what really is foundational and the in semiotics as a science is two things

239
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.031
that,

240
00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:05.890
so sir then goes on to say about the sign,

241
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.830
the first thing he has to say is that the signified signifier relationship,

242
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.010
as I said,
is arbitrary.

243
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.820
And the second thing he has to say as the way is that the way in which we know

244
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:28.340
one sign from another,
either studying it,

245
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.480
studying language and the aggregate whereby clusters of signs exist in

246
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.520
associational relation to each other or studying it in speech act in speech

247
00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.240
whereby signs exist next to each other and a sequence,

248
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.110
the way in which we understand what a sign is,

249
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.550
is differential.

250
00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.920
So that what's new and so soon was thinking about the relationship between

251
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:06.921
signified and signifier as the sign tied up in this relationship is both

252
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.340
arbitrary and differential.
Okay.

253
00:18:11.341 --> 00:18:14.850
This is a first walk through some essential ideas.

254
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.750
I want to go back to the distinction between language and speech and refer you

255
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:22.020
to the first passage,

256
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:26.880
which now all of you have it on your sheet because

257
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.700
like the Russian formalists.
So Sir is

258
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:39.380
chiefly concerned and outlining what he means by semiology to establish the

259
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:45.030
Samuel logical project as a science.

260
00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.470
And like the Russian formalists did in a way like the new critics talking about

261
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:50.820
their academic colleagues.

262
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.970
So sir is vexed by the messiness and lack of system in the study of linguistics.

263
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.820
And this is what he says in this first passage says,

264
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:08.090
if we study speech from several viewpoints simultaneously,

265
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.330
the object of linguistics appears to us as a confused mass of heterogeneous and

266
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:18.800
unrelated things.
This is speech of I'm,
you know,
I'm,

267
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.540
I'm a linguist and so what do I do?
I study speech,

268
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.540
I studied speeches and if I do so,

269
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.560
and if I keep thinking about it in a variety of ways,

270
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.700
all sorts of frameworks jostle for attention.

271
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.240
So Sir continues this procedure opens the door to several sciences,

272
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.480
psychology,
anthropology,

273
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.780
normative grammar philology and so on,

274
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.840
which are distinct from linguistics,

275
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.900
but which might claim speech in view of the faulty method of linguistics as one

276
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:58.530
of their objects.
As I see it,

277
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:04.030
there is only one solution to all the foregoing difficulties from the very

278
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:10.170
outset.
And this is her rotten peculiar mixed metaphor from the very outset.

279
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.380
We must put both feet on the ground of language and use language as the norm of

280
00:20:17.641 --> 00:20:20.710
all the other manifestations of speech.
What's it's,

281
00:20:20.711 --> 00:20:25.450
it's as if he's trying to hold language down,
stay there,
stay there.

282
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.480
We put both feet on the grounds of language so that we have it so that we

283
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.010
haven't so intelligible to us as a system,

284
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.700
as something that can be understood precisely differentially that can be

285
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:45.090
understood in the variety of ways,
uh,
in which,
uh,

286
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.110
language,
uh,
organizes.

287
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.450
It might be worth pausing over the variety of ways in which we can think of

288
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.280
signs in language,

289
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.380
all of which have to do with the way in which are given sign might be chosen to

290
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:03.970
go into a speech sentence.
Uh,
I don't know.
Take the word,

291
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.950
take the word ship.

292
00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:11.020
A ship is very close to related and sound to certain other words.

293
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:14.930
We won't specify them for fear of a Freudian slip,
but they,
uh,
but,

294
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.940
but that is one cluster that is one association matrix or a network that one can

295
00:21:21.881 --> 00:21:22.980
think of,
uh,

296
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:27.280
in the arrangement of that sign in language.

297
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.050
But there are also synonyms for ship,
bark,
boat,

298
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.180
Bateau,

299
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.530
a great many other synonyms,
sailboat,
whatever,
uh,

300
00:21:40.531 --> 00:21:44.350
and they to exist,
uh,
in a cluster steam ship,

301
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.900
ocean liner.
In other words,
words that don't sound at all the same,

302
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:55.540
but they're contiguous in sin,
anonymity,
they cluster in that way.

303
00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.360
And then furthermore,
ship is also the opposite of certain things and that,

304
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:05.950
so that it would also enter into a relationship with train,

305
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:10.900
car,
truck,
mule modes of transportation,
right?

306
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.090
And in all of these ways,

307
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.810
ship is clustered association,

308
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:21.811
Italy in language in ways that make it available to be chosen,

309
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.820
available to be chosen as appropriate for a certain semantic context that we try

310
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:34.030
to develop when we speak.

311
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.800
So that's the way that's that that's the way,
uh,

312
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.200
assign works in language.
I mean this is,

313
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:45.730
this is the tip of the iceberg for any given sign,
but it gives you some,
and,

314
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.880
and by the way,
uh,
and what I'm saying,
uh,

315
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.960
I oversimplified by supposing that the basic constituent of you,

316
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:56.070
unit of language is a word.
Linguist.

317
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.650
Know that that's not at all necessarily the case.
Linguists,
uh,

318
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.640
can work at different levels of abstraction with language.
I mean,

319
00:23:03.641 --> 00:23:08.200
sometimes the basic unit is the phrase,
uh,
but some other times,

320
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:13.430
but the basic unit is the phoneme that is to say the single sound unit or if one

321
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:19.330
studying languages and system of writing,
it might be the syllable.

322
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.140
Uh,

323
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.140
it could be the letter understood either graphically or audibly.

324
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:25.960
Um,

325
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.960
and the variety of ways in which one can choose a basic unit in the study of

326
00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:35.860
linguistics,
uh,
means that you need a special word for that unit,

327
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.600
which is characteristically the tag meme and other words,

328
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.060
whatever you w w what,

329
00:23:42.061 --> 00:23:47.061
whatever your thinking of as you're systematizing understanding of language as

330
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.090
the basic constituent unit.

331
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.920
The word being probably one of the less popular choices,

332
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.170
even though that's the one I've just used,

333
00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:02.240
it is the blanket term for that is the tag me.

334
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.890
Uh,
and so,
uh,
you cannot,
you can understand the associate,

335
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.600
the association will nature of signs also as tag Munich.

336
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:16.670
Then of course,
um,
since uh,
there's a certain amount of sematic payoff,

337
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.600
let's say if you're talking about a phoneme,
uh,
especially because,

338
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.240
because of the,
uh,
the,
um,
as so sir we'll say,
and his,

339
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.030
I'll get back to misleading on amount of poetic drift of language.

340
00:24:29.031 --> 00:24:33.770
Perhaps a certain sound has certain connotations,
meaning the sound may cluster,

341
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:38.510
uh,
as sort of in,
in and an associational network.
Um,

342
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.960
but depending on the unit chosen,

343
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.990
then the associational networks will differ,

344
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.490
but they will still exist as a matrix.
In other words,

345
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.910
it is always probably,
I mean,
how else,

346
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.510
how else could we have any sense of systematicity in language?

347
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.550
It is all was probably the case that when I speak,

348
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.350
I won't choose just any word.
Ee.

349
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:10.790
Cummings actually boldly experimented with this principle and,

350
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.520
and he attracted the attention of the linguists,

351
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.370
particularly a linguist named Del Himes.
Um,
he,

352
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.420
he hammock ee Cummings wrote sentences like he danced his did,

353
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.950
where did is obviously not a word you would have supposed to be in anyway

354
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.420
involved in an association.
They'll cluster in language,
you know,
I mean,

355
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:35.890
he danced,
his did.
That is in every sense,
um,

356
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.230
a misfire as the,
as,
as the,
uh,

357
00:25:39.231 --> 00:25:43.010
as one school of thinking about language would call it a,

358
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.450
and yet at the same times,

359
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.950
Cummings thumbs his nose at us and deliberately uses that word almost as though

360
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.010
he were issuing a critique,
uh,
of semiotics,

361
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.930
but at the same time,
uh,

362
00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:02.090
such that a semiotics would probably have available to it.
Uh,
it's,

363
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.890
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's ways and means of refutation.

364
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.430
I a certain amount of ingenuity is that's all,

365
00:26:09.431 --> 00:26:14.150
all that's required to notice that uh,
Duh,
uh,
uh,

366
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:18.710
reiterate the d the duff sound in danced.
Uh,

367
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.770
and that there are all sorts of combinatory pressures on his consciousness to

368
00:26:23.871 --> 00:26:28.871
choose did as opposed to some other seemingly irrelevant word.

369
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.710
But in any case,
um,
uh,
so,
so in any case,
you can still,

370
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.310
even with these egregious examples,
understood,

371
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.480
understand language even in its infinite variety.

372
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:46.260
Nevertheless,
as,
uh,
uh,
associational,
uh,

373
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.760
and as clustering,

374
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.790
it's available signs in ways that make them more readily to hand for choice,

375
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.790
then they might be,
um,
uh,
all other things being equal.
Well,

376
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.820
in any case,
so language is a system of signs.

377
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.500
The signs are both arbitrary and differential.

378
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.390
Now what does this mean?

379
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:15.890
This is actually the second thing maybe that we learn under the influence of

380
00:27:16.921 --> 00:27:21.840
what we call literary theory and the thinking that surrounds it about the nature

381
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:22.674
of perception.

382
00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

383
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.690
<v 0>If the sign is both arbitrary and differential,</v>

384
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.840
that is to say if there is no such thing as a natural sign,

385
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.200
something that is linked by nature,

386
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:43.230
by the nature of the thing and the word together with a thing.

387
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:49.350
If on one side of the of the border as so Sarah puts it,

388
00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.490
we look at a cow and say,
oh,

389
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:57.270
and if on the other side of the border we look at a cow and say birth and if we

390
00:27:57.941 --> 00:28:02.800
cross a considerable body of water and we look at a cow and say,
cow,

391
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:06.760
uh,
plainly,
the relationship between the thing

392
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:11.550
and assign,
you know,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

393
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.300
the Matrix signifier and signified just doesn't exist.

394
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.070
So signs are arbitrary and they're also differential.

395
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.880
I have to be able to distinguish between all the signs I use in any

396
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:31.020
communicative sequence and how do I do it?
By putting in Zines,

397
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:33.000
which are not other signs,

398
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.680
the sign is not linked to the natural world by any natural means.

399
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:45.560
And the sign is not linked to other signs by any natural means.

400
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.470
I don't know,

401
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.970
a unit of language which I used to commute,

402
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.480
communicate with you positively.

403
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.320
I know it negatively.

404
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:07.400
I know it only because it is not everything else in,

405
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.850
in the terms of its direct relationship with the thing that's most adjacent to

406
00:29:13.861 --> 00:29:18.780
it somehow either through similarity or dissimilarity,
it's not that other thing.

407
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:24.270
But generally speaking,
the point about a sign is that it's not any other thing.

408
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.790
This is true even of hominins.

409
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:31.791
This is true even of of of of seemingly identical signs because each has its use

410
00:29:35.071 --> 00:29:36.510
value,
uh,
and,

411
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.470
and his only intelligible as it's that which it,

412
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.220
which exists to mean in a certain context.
So,

413
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.900
uh,
it is always the case that I can only know

414
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.890
what I know.

415
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.560
If it's a question of being communicated with having something rendered

416
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:02.410
intelligible for me negatively,

417
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.470
I can't know it because it just is either that sign or that is,

418
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.950
I don't know it positively I'm about to give,

419
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.920
I'm about to give an example of this,
which I hope which,

420
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:19.270
which I hope will flesh out what I'm trying to get across in the meantime.

421
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.300
A couple of passages in.
So sir,
ah,

422
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:27.330
that may make the point now not on this version of your sheet.

423
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.710
Uh,
but on the version,

424
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.920
the not on the version of the sheet that I passed out today,

425
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.980
but on the version that I sent electronically last night,

426
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:41.130
there's a fifth passage and that passage is actually a combination of

427
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.760
formulations of,

428
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:50.440
so sir that are on two separate that are in two separate parts of your texts.

429
00:30:50.441 --> 00:30:54.160
The first one is on page eight 44.

430
00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.670
Can this possibly be correct Tyson?
I hope it can.
Um,

431
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:07.320
uh,
no,
it is not correct.
It's page eight 45

432
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.250
the lower left hand column where,

433
00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.280
so Sarah says language is a system of interdependent terms in which the value of

434
00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:24.660
each term results solely from the simultaneous presence of the others.

435
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:29.490
As in the diagram just below it.
In other words,
the value of a term,

436
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:34.520
I say something the value of the term of I honor us out.

437
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.410
The value of that sound cannot be determined except by its context.

438
00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:45.411
I can't know it except by the way in which it differs from everything that

439
00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:49.800
surrounds it.
And he goes on to say,
this is on page eight,

440
00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:52.740
47,
about halfway down the left hand column,

441
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:57.870
he goes on to say a segment of language can never,

442
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.610
and the final analysis,

443
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:04.730
the based on anything except it's non coincidence with the rest arbitrary and

444
00:32:07.471 --> 00:32:11.640
differential are to correlative qualities.

445
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:16.880
Now why don't,
and then and then again,
um,
uh,

446
00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:21.810
an another passage on page eight 46,
the right hand column,

447
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:28.070
halfway down concept are purely differential and defined not by their positive

448
00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:35.181
content but negatively by their relations with other terms of the system.

449
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:43.340
Now probably this is hard to accept.

450
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Intuitively we feel as we process the world around us that we know things for

451
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:57.500
and as what they are,
we feel,
you know,

452
00:32:57.501 --> 00:33:00.230
I look at something and I know what it is,

453
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.780
forgetting that positively.

454
00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:07.781
I only know what it is big print because of a context in which indeed it is not

455
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.030
those other things that are linked to it.

456
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.750
Now I want to take as I want to take an example.
Uh,

457
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.420
I could use any example,

458
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:22.421
but I'm going to use something which plainly does move around various semiotics

459
00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:25.670
systems.
It's,
it's a piece of language,

460
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:31.090
but it also belongs to other sorts of semiotics system as will immediately see.

461
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.750
I want to use the example of the red light.

462
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.890
Now in a stoplight,

463
00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.030
which is probably just about the simplest semiotic system that we have,

464
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:48.040
it only has three.
One is tempted to say variables,
uh,

465
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.920
plainly differing from each other.
Red,
yellow,
and green.

466
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.460
We have two ways of thinking about the red light.

467
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.240
If we think that our knowledge is positive,

468
00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:06.010
we say red in a red light means stop.

469
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.300
It is spontaneous to us to say red light means stop.

470
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:12.980
Now,

471
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.980
if all we have to go on is just this semiotic system,

472
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.390
it's going to be kind of hard to put up resistance to that sort of thinking.

473
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.470
Because by the same token was say,
yellow means pause.

474
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.480
Green means go.

475
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:34.630
These do these three lights with their respective colors.

476
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.800
Just do positively mean these things.
Everybody knows it.

477
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:40.670
Uh,

478
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:45.230
and I'm certainly not thinking when I approach an intersection that,

479
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.620
uh,
when I went in,
the red light goes on.
I'm not saying to myself,
oh,

480
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:54.470
not yellow,
not green.
You know,
it's by my mind,

481
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:59.300
my mind just doesn't work that way.
All right.
But still,
it's a red light,

482
00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.560
right?

483
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.560
And our hypothesis is that the red light has positive value in the sense that it

484
00:35:07.131 --> 00:35:08.990
means a certain thing.

485
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.770
It means we say stop.

486
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.373
Well,

487
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.960
suppose the red light appeared on or as the nose of a reindeer

488
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.840
and that case,
the red light would be a beacon,

489
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.420
which means forward.

490
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.170
Go follow me.

491
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.690
Damn the torpedoes.

492
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:41.700
We've got to get these presence to script distributed,
no time,
no time to waste,

493
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.720
you know,
and we race off,
you know,
uh,

494
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:50.290
who perhaps risking in our accident,
who knows where we race off,
uh,

495
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.400
under the compulsion of the meaning of the red light,

496
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.720
which is go all right.
Now,
by the way,

497
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:02.010
there's an anecdote,
the truth of which I've never been able to ascertain that,

498
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.840
um,
during the cultural revolution in China,
Matt,
I'm now Madame Mau,

499
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.530
uh,

500
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.530
very much disapproved of the fact that red lights meant stop because red is of

501
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:17.100
course the color of progress.
Uh,
it ought to mean go forward,

502
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.310
uh,
and you know,
and,
and,
and everything behind it.
Um,

503
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.030
but needless to say,
uh,

504
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.100
her thoughts on the subject were never implemented because if one day red light

505
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:32.190
means stop and the next day red light means go,

506
00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:37.080
there might be a few problems.
And so,
um,
and,
and,
and this by the way,

507
00:36:37.081 --> 00:36:41.660
is a way of showing the,
the,
the,
the,
the fact that,
um,

508
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.620
that everything which appears in a semiotic system is conventional,

509
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.370
right?
I mean,
it is,
it,

510
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.270
there's an emptying out of positive meaning in the very awareness that after
all,

511
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.660
the red light could mean go.
I'm about to go on and give more examples.
Uh,

512
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.030
it's conventional,

513
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.170
whatever the convention is within a system of differences,

514
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:09.480
that's what makes the sign intelligible.
All right.

515
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:13.410
Just some other examples are red light over a street door.

516
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.990
Well that doesn't mean stop.
That means go in,
come in.

517
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.050
All right.
Uh,
it's an,

518
00:37:21.051 --> 00:37:25.410
and of course it exists in a semiotic relationship to a white light over a

519
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:30.120
street door,
which means this is my house.
Um,
if you wish you can ring the bell,

520
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.010
but I just,
as soon you stayed out,

521
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:35.480
this light is probably on to keep burglars away.
Uh,

522
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.600
and so stop right and,
and,
and the,

523
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.120
and the red light is intelligible in other words,
within that,

524
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.730
within that semiotic system.

525
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.670
Now over an auditorium door.

526
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.540
And of course we've already been gazing at that light back there.
Uh,

527
00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:54.490
and it's not a good example.
I wish it didn't say exit,

528
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.650
but it does say exit because that,
that's sort of,
that kind of weakens my point.

529
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.610
Um,
but,
but over many auditorium doors,
uh,

530
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.250
or red light just hangs there.

531
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.320
And obviously it doesn't mean come in and the sense of the red light over a

532
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:14.520
street door,
it means go out.
Right?
This is the way out.

533
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.280
This is the way you get out of here.
Not,

534
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.120
this is the way you get in here.
I mean there are a lot of,
there,

535
00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:24.810
there are a lot of ways in which red light means neither stop nor go,

536
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.990
but we are sort of confining ourselves so far to the ways in which are red light

537
00:38:30.661 --> 00:38:35.661
has something to do with locomotion or the lack thereof and in new system,

538
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.750
Nah,
no system.

539
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:42.990
You can see it takes on a new meaning always with respect to whatever it is not

540
00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.720
all right now.
Uh,
well,
I mean we can continue on a light up.

541
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:53.660
Valentine means don't stop,
go.
You know,
it has this,

542
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.660
it has the same function.

543
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.840
In other words of negating,

544
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.100
it's on meaning in another semiotic system.
In this case,

545
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.590
the semiotics system of the stoplight

546
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.600
on an ambulance or a police car.

547
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:15.940
I admittedly,
many of these lights are blue these days.
But let's suppose,

548
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:17.200
let's suppose that you know,

549
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:22.320
tradition prevailing that there they are still red on an ambulance or a street

550
00:39:22.911 --> 00:39:27.640
car.
They mean get out of the way or stop.
All right.

551
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.170
And other words.
In other words,

552
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:34.171
they probably bear a distant relation to the Santiago sticks of the stoplight.

553
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.200
And that's probably why red was chosen,
uh,

554
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.030
for ambulances and police cars because they put into your head the notion of

555
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:43.864
stop.

556
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:49.140
But it's a notion that's complicated in this case by the equally imperative

557
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:53.800
notion get out of the way,
which doesn't at all necessarily entails staffing,

558
00:39:53.801 --> 00:39:58.770
but rather accelerating,
uh,
in a different direction.
Uh,
and,
and,
and,

559
00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:01.990
and all of that somewhat what complicates the picture.
But at the same time,

560
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:06.991
I think you can see that there's a connection between those semiotic systems.

561
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.111
It's,
it's,

562
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:12.190
it's a weak system in terms of color and the case of ambulance and police car,

563
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.780
it's more a question of brightness.
As I say,
red tends to be chosen,

564
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.070
but then,
you know,

565
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:22.570
if you get lab experiments showing that that particular color of gas blue is

566
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:24.130
somehow or another,
you know,

567
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.900
sort of more invasive of your consciousness than red is,
then,

568
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:33.550
you know,
you move away from the arbitrariness of the choice of red as a color.

569
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.310
Um,
and as I say it,
there's a certain instability which,

570
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:41.530
which could never apply in the semiotics of the stoplight because there it's not

571
00:40:42.101 --> 00:40:44.200
so much a question of the brightness of the color,

572
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:47.440
although that has been experimented with as you know,
um,

573
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.610
but rather the insistence that the color is just that color.

574
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:55.450
And then finally,
and here is where,
in a way,

575
00:40:55.451 --> 00:40:58.090
this is perhaps the most interesting thing because,

576
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:01.150
because it forces us to show the complexity,

577
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:05.500
to see the complexity of semiotic relationships or red light,

578
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:10.330
just to return to the Christian holiday or red light on a Christmas tree.

579
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:16.270
Now our first thought is,
Oh Haha,
that has no meaning.
Right?

580
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.650
You know,
it's not,

581
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:21.940
it's no use talking about the negative relationship between a red light and a

582
00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:24.160
green light and a yellow,
white,
blue,
whatever,

583
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.680
whatever the other colors on the Christmas tree are,

584
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.330
because they all have the same value.
They're all bright,
they're all cheerful,

585
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:33.980
they all say merry Christmas,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

586
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:37.370
So what are you supposed to do with that?
Here you've got a red light,

587
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:42.371
which doesn't seem to enter into this sense of the arbitrary and differential.

588
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:43.860
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

589
00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:48.420
<v 0>well that's because it's actually not a gross constituent unit,
right.</v>

590
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:53.870
Bright Lights as the gross constituent unit and the variety of those bright,

591
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:59.960
bright,
bright lights,
which is a matter of aesthetics.
Uh,

592
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.990
the variety of those bright lights is ironically enough neutralized by the

593
00:42:05.431 --> 00:42:09.840
common signifier governing our understanding of them,

594
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.390
which is bright lights in this case,

595
00:42:12.391 --> 00:42:15.240
particularly on a tree or festooning,

596
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:20.460
another ornament that has some sort of comparable value.
And once you get that,

597
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:25.470
once you got the value Christmas tree as opposed to red lights,

598
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.620
red lights being perhaps a part of some Christmas trees,

599
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:33.450
then you see that you're back in a semiotic system in a very obvious one because

600
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:37.980
a Christmas tree is a,
not Menorah,
a not kwanza candles,

601
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.720
a Christmas tree,
in other words,

602
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:44.870
is a sign that can only be understood intelligibly in terms of a certain

603
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.160
cultural understanding.
And we think,
of course,
ah,
you know,

604
00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:54.450
I mean we know what that is and of course probably we do,

605
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:59.580
but were misled in supposing that that's the key to the understanding of it as a

606
00:42:59.581 --> 00:43:04.581
sign because it's very possible to imagine a circumstance in which someone

607
00:43:06.121 --> 00:43:10.920
wouldn't know what it was forcing us.
Despite it's familiarity,

608
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.110
it's familiarity to ask us,

609
00:43:13.111 --> 00:43:16.740
well what is it and how do we know what it is?

610
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.990
And then we realize once again that we can only know what it is if we under,

611
00:43:21.991 --> 00:43:24.990
if we come to understand in this case,

612
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:30.170
probably it's best to say a cultural system understood as a semiosis a cultural

613
00:43:32.731 --> 00:43:35.730
system within which it appears.

614
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:39.030
And so this last version of the red light,
uh,

615
00:43:39.031 --> 00:43:43.230
introduces interesting complications,
which I don't think should confuse.

616
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:47.040
I think they should actually show us a little bit more about how we can

617
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.560
understand,
uh,

618
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:53.660
the organization of the things around us and within us as systems of signs.

619
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.360
We know that we've already learned from Heidegger and the remanent of tradition

620
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.000
that we know them as something.

621
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:04.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

622
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:08.600
<v 0>But it remains to show how we know of him.</v>

623
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:14.090
That is to say we don't know them positively.
I mean,
how do you get raises?

624
00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:18.140
The interesting fact that we spontaneously recognize something

625
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.160
and that makes us and that,

626
00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.360
but that's one of the things which could be dangerous for semiotics because it

627
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:28.760
would make us think or assume that we know them.

628
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.280
We know things positively without thinking.
In other words,

629
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.580
I know that that's an exit sign or I don't know that it's a white thing with red

630
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:41.310
marks on it.
I know that it's an exit sign,

631
00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:46.880
but I can't know that the,
so sorry.

632
00:44:46.881 --> 00:44:51.881
An argument is without knowing that it is not all the things that it's not.

633
00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.170
If it were all the things that it's not,

634
00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:01.060
or if it were identical to all the things that somehow or another it's not,

635
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:06.970
then I would be in a very different difficult situation because I wouldn't have

636
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.520
any means of knowing it in particular.

637
00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:15.690
The very fact that I need to know it in particular is what makes me need to know

638
00:45:16.391 --> 00:45:21.200
it negatively
and that is,

639
00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.030
it seems to me.
In other words,

640
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.630
we now know two things about how we perceive things from this,

641
00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.980
from the standpoint of this subject matter.
Uh,
and I,

642
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.060
and it's very useful to put them together.

643
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.120
The fact that we always know things first,

644
00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:37.960
but at the same time,

645
00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:42.961
the fact that it's misleading to think that that are knowing them first means

646
00:45:42.971 --> 00:45:46.900
that we know them positively.
We know them first,

647
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.200
but we also know them negatively in negation to other things.

648
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.740
Okay.

649
00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.740
So let me just return once again to the way in which science systems are

650
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:06.820
intelligible because you know,
I mean,
lots of,

651
00:46:06.821 --> 00:46:09.970
there are we going to be lots of moments in a course like this in which what we

652
00:46:09.971 --> 00:46:11.110
seem to be saying is it,
oh,

653
00:46:11.111 --> 00:46:15.220
we can't know anything are we don't know what we know or how do we know what we

654
00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:16.540
know and met and maybe we're,

655
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:20.940
maybe we're skirting a rhetorical questions of that kind,

656
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.060
but we're really not.

657
00:46:22.061 --> 00:46:26.080
What we're talking about today is how we do know things that,
I mean that's,

658
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:29.800
I mean if we take,
if we take semiotic seriously,

659
00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.980
it gives us a rather sophisticated means of understanding precisely how we know

660
00:46:35.591 --> 00:46:35.951
things,

661
00:46:35.951 --> 00:46:40.951
but it insists that we know things because of their conventional nature.

662
00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:47.070
That is to say because they are conventions existing within a system of

663
00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:51.820
conventions and so far as we don't recognize them,

664
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.570
things signs as existing because if we,

665
00:46:55.571 --> 00:46:57.040
if we're thinking about a thing,

666
00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:00.970
we're thinking about that thing as a sign and semiotics.

667
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:06.010
If we don't know that,
if we don't recognize it's existence in a system,

668
00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.490
if we can't think what system it belongs to,

669
00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:11.410
perhaps to put it in a better way,

670
00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.980
that's tantamount to say we're really don't know what it is.

671
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.020
And I think the more we think about it,

672
00:47:18.021 --> 00:47:22.400
the more we realized that we only know what it is if we know the system that it

673
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:27.230
belongs to,
which is to say all of the things related to it,

674
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.160
which it is not.
Right.
Okay.

675
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:34.390
So the intelligibility of sign systems is there.

676
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.450
Conventionality that's why it's impossible for anybody to come along and say,

677
00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.630
oh,
I don't like the fact that the red light is red.

678
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.480
It's symbolically the wrong move.
Let's make the red light,
uh,

679
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.450
the symbol of go.
You know,
I mean,
you know,

680
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.870
with the ecological movement,
we've very difficult to make the green light,

681
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:59.040
the symbol of stop.
But in any case,
all,
all sorts of,

682
00:47:59.041 --> 00:48:02.920
all sorts of complications would arise,
right?
But in the meantime,

683
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:07.921
you see that we can't mess with conventional systems by imposing the

684
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:14.740
individuality of our will on them and expecting anything to change.

685
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.250
A seeming a seeming exception

686
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.840
is the fact that sometimes individuals can buy it through the exertion of their

687
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:29.830
influence and prestige actually changed the way we speak about things.

688
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:31.180
This is a seeming exception.

689
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:36.181
Think about the way Jesse Jackson almost single handedly convinced us that we

690
00:48:36.581 --> 00:48:39.190
should use the expression African American,

691
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.020
even though it's a cumbersome polysyllabic expression,

692
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:48.700
which you would think somehow or another would be intuitively rejected because

693
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:51.520
it's so hard to say.
But it worked.

694
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.880
He convinced us all to say African American and you say to yourself,

695
00:48:57.070 --> 00:48:57.903
Aha,

696
00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:02.530
there's an example of somebody taking language by the scruff of the neck and

697
00:49:02.531 --> 00:49:07.531
changing it as an individual exerting the an individual will over against the

698
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:12.550
conventional nature of language.
The answer,

699
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:16.150
the said that the semi attrition's answer to this is it never could have

700
00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:19.990
happened simply as an active agency as an act of will.

701
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.330
It had to be acquiesced in.

702
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:27.750
You needed the community that makes use of linguistic conventions to acquiesce

703
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:35.200
in a change of use.
Remember,

704
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.410
language exists synchronically.

705
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.560
It only exists in a moment,

706
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.500
in a moment of simultaneous simultaneity.

707
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.490
We study language Daya Chronically.
That is to say,

708
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:53.320
we study it's history.
We study.
It's unfolding in time.

709
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:58.450
Now this unfolding is not according to the semiotician and here's another link

710
00:49:58.451 --> 00:50:02.170
with the rush and foremost is not a question is not a question of studying.

711
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:04.720
The way in which language has changed from without

712
00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.930
that is to say studying the way in which,
for example,

713
00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:13.070
an individual can rise up and insist on changing one of the signs,

714
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:18.230
but rather a see a sequence of sin,

715
00:50:18.231 --> 00:50:22.550
chronic cross sections from moment to moment,
language changes.

716
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:25.550
But if we're to understand it as language,

717
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.160
we have to honor it's simultaneity.

718
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:33.670
And in that case we understand it as a sequence of cross sections rather than

719
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:39.270
something that somehow organically changes through time.
Uh,

720
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.090
and at each cross section,

721
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:46.010
people are either willing to use a certain sign in a certain way or they're not.

722
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.620
That's the crucial thing.
If they're not willing,

723
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.840
the use of the sign doesn't work,

724
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:56.050
which confirms the idea that nothing can be changed simply by individual agency

725
00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.960
in and of its self.
All right.

726
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:04.860
I need to come back to synchrony and Diane Skrany.
I'll do so,
uh,

727
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:06.080
next time.
Uh,

728
00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:10.640
and probably in subsequent lectures because we're going to keep using these

729
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:14.420
coordinates.
We're going to keep using the things that exist in space,

730
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:16.220
virtual or not,

731
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:21.490
and the things that unfold in time in their relationship with each other as we

732
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:25.980
continue to try to understand these basic principles,

733
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.330
which shaped so much of subsequent literary theory.
Thank you.
