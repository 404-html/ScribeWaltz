1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.470
We've been passing through a variety of discourses concerning the nature of

2
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.570
identity,
the way in which identity is constructed.
Uh,

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.060
incidentally,
a with varying degrees of emphasis,

4
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.720
the way in which identity is constructed in literature.

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.820
I'm going to come back to this,
uh,
perhaps missing link literature,

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.130
uh,
in a minute.
But in the meantime,

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.420
I just wanted to point out something that I'm sure you've inferred for

8
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:34.950
yourselves,
namely,

9
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.951
that each one of these approaches to identity has a history and that the history

10
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:45.450
results in,
uh,
a recent chapter,

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.660
which is something like what you might call a deconstructive moment signifying

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.740
on theory itself such that,
uh,

13
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.990
the claim of theory as a mainstream discourse to hold certain views,

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.070
uh,

15
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
is something that in and of itself from a subversive perspective needs to be

16
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.210
deconstructed to be undermined.
Um,
again,
uh,

17
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:17.211
the idea in postcolonial studies of hybrid city as the undermining of cultural

18
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:24.081
bind binary's that is the double consciousness in which one experiences,

19
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.570
uh,
simultaneously a kind of identification with the state apparatus,

20
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.650
ah,
and a will to subvert it.
Uh,
by the way,
I thought,

21
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680
I thought I'd give you another example of how that works because edifies to me,

22
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.530
uh,
I often,
you know,
I,
I'm sitting watching,

23
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.900
I don't actually watch talk shows very often,

24
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.320
but should I be watching a talk show?
They often,

25
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.750
they often invite people onto these shows whom they call professors.

26
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.360
And I just,

27
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:02.361
and I just wanted to point out to you the degree to which the sly civility,

28
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.860
the hybrids lies civility with which people are called professors,

29
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.540
is for a professor,

30
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
one of the most discouraging sounds in the language because they know very well

31
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.380
when someone is addressed by a talk show host as professor,

32
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.260
but they mean is you are a pen.

33
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.900
You don't know how to park a bicycle straight.

34
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.870
You have no understanding of the real world.

35
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.290
I don't know why I've invited you on the show in the first place,

36
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.320
except somebody told me you were an expert.
That's,

37
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.150
that's what it means in the public sphere to be a professor.

38
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.220
Uh,
and so,
you know,
Bubba perhaps exaggerates a little bit when he went,

39
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.080
when he,
uh,
uh,
he says the discourse of hybridity,
uh,

40
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.480
has an element of terrorism about it.

41
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:55.830
Bob was writing a long ago before nine 11 and so on,

42
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.070
and perhaps uses the term a little loosely,
but have to say,
and,

43
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.960
and I have to say,
when I hear somebody addressing me,
someone not in the academy,

44
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.410
because of course people have content for me in the academy too,

45
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.120
but it's a more complicated thing.

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.190
They may not have contempt for other professors,
if you see what I mean.
Uh,

47
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.480
so that's,
that,
that's more complicated.

48
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.460
But when someone not in the academy addresses me at professor as professor,

49
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:25.570
I suppose I can't say that I feel terrorized.
Exactly.
Um,

50
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.190
but I do feel depressed.
Uh,
and that is,
and,

51
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.790
and that is,

52
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.070
and that's an important part of the double consciousness of the subaltern as

53
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.290
Baba expatiate.
It's on him.
And then in any case,
finally,

54
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
the deconstructive moment of gender theory in which gender is understood not as

55
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:51.580
something essential,
but as something performed,
something brought into existence,

56
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.260
not just by verbal discourse,
but by all the semiotics systems,
including gesture,

57
00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:00.380
dress and all the rest of it.
That,
uh,
that is,
that,
that,
that,

58
00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:05.050
that constitutes,
uh,
the way in which gender comes into being.

59
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.360
Now,
in each case,

60
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.480
you have instances of knowledge as negation.
I'm just,
I,

61
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.500
I'm just trying to pull this back into the perspective of what we recognize

62
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:21.130
perhaps more readily as literary theory.

63
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.600
By knowledge as negation.
I mean,
semiotic knowledge.

64
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.020
There's something that I've been trying to stress really,
uh,

65
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.120
as a central theme throughout this course.
I am,

66
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.280
well,
I don't know what I am,
but I'll tell you this,
I'm not that.
All right.

67
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.383
In other words,

68
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.340
the way in which I come to my aunt to understand myself as not that,

69
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.970
and I,
of course,
and the person,
uh,
Oh,

70
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:53.470
who possesses hedge mnemonic discourse.
So I see myself,

71
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:56.770
I come to understand myself.
Um,
uh,

72
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.570
for the first time in the argument of a Toni Morrison or an Edwards Pie EAD,

73
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.090
or in a certain sense of a Judith Butler,

74
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.250
I come to understand myself in a way for the first time when I reflect on what

75
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:14.350
I'm not.
That is to say when I tried to objectify,
uh,

76
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.980
to,
uh,
pigeonhole that which I'm not,

77
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.720
which is of course not what I'm really not,
but what I suppose myself not to be.

78
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.640
Uh,
and so in all of these ways,
then you,

79
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.650
and you can see that the way in which according to the sorts of thinking we've

80
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:36.790
been reviewing in recent weeks,

81
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.970
the way in which one comes to understands oneself is precisely negative in the

82
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:45.760
tradition of semiotic,
uh,

83
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:50.761
and formalists understandings of language to I am not at all necessarily what I

84
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:56.950
am.
I am precisely as I understand,

85
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.750
not that not the other,
uh,

86
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.490
and I grasp myself perhaps in ways,
uh,

87
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.520
that deepen my alleged understanding of myself as a result of this negative

88
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.490
process.
All right.

89
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:18.491
So I say all these things again to reassure you that we still are talking about

90
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.700
literary theory that the uh,

91
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:27.701
ways of thinking about things that we've encountered recently really do arise

92
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.580
out of issues given to us by deconstruction,

93
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.240
by negation and the semiotic and formalists tradition.
Uh,

94
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.870
and that we can understand what has happened.

95
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:42.710
Basically this in terms of the overall structure of the course,

96
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.890
we can understand what has happened basically not as a change in the structure

97
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.921
of thought.

98
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:53.921
We examined when we took up language as the primary determinant of

99
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:58.370
understanding,
not so much as a change in the structure of thought,

100
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.670
but as a transformation of language,

101
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.700
the determinant of social understanding into what we call a social text so that

102
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:13.121
our head now is not the repository of so sewers long.

103
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.960
That is something that,

104
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:18.950
something that just sits there in and of itself as a system,

105
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.430
but it's full of other people's language.

106
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.610
It is a space in which a society itself understood as discourse Jostle's for

107
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:33.470
attention,
uh,
and struggles,
uh,
uh,

108
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.580
to somehow or another to shape itself into intelligibility.

109
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:39.500
That's the fundamental change.

110
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.520
It's language is still preeminent in the kinds of thinking that we've been

111
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:52.430
doing.
We haven't really gotten away from language but we have altered our

112
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:56.450
understanding of language.
Language is now a social text.

113
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.880
It is now uh,
in Bach teens words,

114
00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.360
other people's language and we understand it.

115
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.950
Therefore not something and of course semiotics and deconstruction don't

116
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:11.840
understand it as our own either because language always precedes us but we

117
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.841
understand it more clearly as something that is given to us as a social

118
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:19.790
formation that intern forms us.

119
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:24.791
And in a way that does bring us to our topic today because uh,

120
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.820
this,

121
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.820
this topic almost the last topic of the course has to do with the preconditions

122
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.640
of interpretation.

123
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.780
What makes it possible for us to think something?

124
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.990
How is it that we come to think one thing as opposed to another thing?

125
00:08:44.001 --> 00:08:48.200
How is it that there are areas of agreement among us?

126
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:52.820
How is it for that matter that there are areas of disagreement among us entity

127
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:53.680
that these air,

128
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.240
that these areas characteristically seem to be so non negotiable that you know,

129
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.650
the point arises at which we just can find ourselves in agreement on things.

130
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.630
Just as the point arises when we realized that we are in some profound way in

131
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.550
agreement about other things.

132
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:16.020
How is it that all of this comes to be in order to do that?

133
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.790
Let's first go back to Tony and think about Tony.
Uh,

134
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:24.720
once again,
uh,
as being about,

135
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.170
because we've said all along that it's about whatever it is that we happened to

136
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:30.390
be talking about.
Uh,
let's,
let's,

137
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:35.280
let's think about Tony once again as being about the things we've been

138
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.670
discussing recently.
We can say for example,

139
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.690
that Tony is a Marxist Qantas station of the social determinacy of identity in

140
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.980
other forms.
It's a realist tax because as we've said before,

141
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.430
nothing happens that there is no change in the social formations that are the

142
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:00.090
givens of the story.

143
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.270
But it nevertheless does lay out the relationships among social norms,

144
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.840
uh,
in ways that show that those,
that,
that,
that,

145
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:14.430
that life goes on despite social inequality despite,

146
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.900
um,
and of course here,

147
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:19.170
I'm going to throw something at you that you've had or hadn't thought of so much

148
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.760
in terms of Tony before,
despite ethnic and gender difference.

149
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.090
Now,
what happens then in Tony,
I mean to,

150
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:31.170
to move to a slightly different way of thinking about it is we can see that it's

151
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:36.171
a global story masked as a story of hybridity in the American melting pot.

152
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.420
It should have been perfectly plain to you all along that Tony is an Italian

153
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.120
American with the,
with,
with,
with,

154
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.380
with the complex personality of the subaltern.
On the one hand,

155
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.680
he believes in the American dream.
He likes his job.
Uh,

156
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.000
he buys into the system and the other word,
but on the other hand,

157
00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:01.080
he recognizes a kind of,
but he has his own place in the world,

158
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:05.640
the little Jello garage.
It's his niche in the world.

159
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.630
Uh,
and it's something,
uh,

160
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.640
and it's something that is partly what affords him his identity Nieto.

161
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:17.170
Of course,
on the other hand is the,
uh,
is,
is,

162
00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:21.210
is the neurotic wasp in the Manor House.
Um,
you know,

163
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.380
sort of representing,

164
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.890
representing that sort of class and speedy very interestingly is what is,

165
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.200
is a member of what John Guillory calls the professional managerial class.
And,

166
00:11:31.201 --> 00:11:32.040
and,
and,

167
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:37.130
and what's interesting about speedy as that suddenly we realize that his ethnic

168
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.810
origins and his class origins and even his gender,
because he may be a woman,

169
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.250
uh,
are,
uh,

170
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.480
not perhaps as relevant as one might have imagined them to be because the

171
00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:52.770
professional managerial class is interesting as Guillory source.

172
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.470
Alvin Goldner,
uh,
points out at length is interesting,
uh,

173
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.990
precisely as the emergence of a body of people with common interests who really

174
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.320
can't be said at least to derive from,
uh,

175
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.010
or perhaps in a way even to belong to a common class.

176
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:14.011
And so a speedy is certainly in Tony the tow truck or representative of this new

177
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.570
emerging class.
Perhaps it's no accident that Nido comes first.

178
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.590
I think memory serves me and saying that neato comes first in the sort of

179
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.270
folkloric triad because Nido represents an older class,
a class,

180
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:33.271
which in a certain sense is giving way to the professional managerial class so

181
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:37.500
that it makes sense that first you'd get Nieto and then you would get speedy.

182
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.590
All right.
So then we can also think of of tone.
The tow truck,
of course,

183
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:46.270
in terms of gender,
uh,
we've said there are no women in it.
At the same time.

184
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:49.390
You do have those frowning and smiling houses with him,

185
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.040
sort of embodying the angel in the house.
But it's not just that,
I mean,

186
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:55.150
obviously Nido,

187
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:59.440
I've never drawn a picture of Neato but with his little bow tie and his prissy,

188
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:01.900
oh,
I don't want to get dirty.
I mean he's just,

189
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:05.240
he's just a bundle of gay stereotypes.
And,

190
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.000
and then obviously with,
you know,
bumpy,
he pushes and pushes,

191
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:14.890
you don't even want to go there.
And so,
and so in any case,
uh,
this is,

192
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:19.780
this is plainly a story about gender.
Um,
and so,
you know,
you,
you,
you,

193
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:24.370
you,
you can see that it's about all these things.
All right.

194
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:29.371
So then here's the question and it really does provide us with our transition to

195
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:30.880
today's materials.

196
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.910
What have I been doing all this time with Tony?

197
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:41.911
The tow truck I've been doing exactly as you can see now what fish does with

198
00:13:44.411 --> 00:13:48.190
Jacobs Rosenbaum,
11 thorn Hayes Omen.

199
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.620
I've been showing that if you bring a certain sub position to what you're

200
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:54.454
reading,

201
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.990
you're going to prefer perform a certain kind of hermaneutic act.

202
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.450
Not with any particular strain,

203
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.540
but more or less spontaneously because that's what you are conditioned to do.

204
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.220
Now,
fishes class,
I had no trouble construing they,

205
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.780
uh,
assignment for his previous class as a poem.
Uh,

206
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:17.920
and you can see of course,

207
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:22.360
that it was sort of ready to hand to be construed that way.
Uh,
fish admits that,

208
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.690
but he's a lecturing some people in Kenyon college and he pointed,

209
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.480
he just sort of runs his finger down the college,
the,

210
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.110
the list of faculty names and say,
look what I could do with these names,

211
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.690
you know,
and I,
and,
and I think,
you know,

212
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.520
does make his point because you can do it with absolutely anything we can see of

213
00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:44.500
course,
that his class actually missed a few points.
Uh,
it forgot to mention that,

214
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.970
um,
the,
uh,

215
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.720
an ancient and important meaning of the word 11 is lightning.

216
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.680
So that a flash of revelation is entailed and the,

217
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.860
uh,
in any religious understanding of the Parm,

218
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.780
and it's almost impossible to understand why his class was stumped by the word

219
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:05.870
haze because Hays,
well,
you know,

220
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:07.970
we see things through a glass darkly,

221
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:12.650
we see them in a haze and that's exactly the way in which we're likely to

222
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:16.190
respond,
uh,
to,
uh,
instances of,

223
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.450
of religious revelation as they are given in the devotional poetry of the 17th

224
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:26.950
century.
So,
in any case,
um,
what we've been doing with Tony,

225
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.340
the tow truck is of this kind.
We've taken a text with a second.

226
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.230
By the way,
you may want to know whether I think Tony is really about something,

227
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.450
you know,
as opposed to about all of those things.
Well,

228
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:46.250
I actually do and I mentioned it in passing,
but it's not an end to it.

229
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:50.630
It's only an intuition and it really doesn't arise out of any particular

230
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:53.950
predilections I have for psychoanalysis.
Uh,

231
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:58.990
it does seem to me however that a story written to that age group in which the

232
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.240
climactic line is,

233
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.270
he pushed and he pushed and I'm on my way is pretty obviously about one thing as

234
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:12.200
opposed to a lot of other things.

235
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:17.350
And that if you really pushed me about what Tony,

236
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:21.290
the tow truck is about,
I would say,
well,

237
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:26.230
I think it's an anal phase parable and that,
uh,
and,

238
00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:30.830
and that Robert crouse very possibly wrote it for that purpose.
In other words,

239
00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:34.640
this would engage the attention of the toddler who's being,

240
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.850
who's having the story read to him or her,
uh,

241
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.940
and that its meaningfulness probably is going to come across to the toddler in

242
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:48.020
that way.
Perhaps in a more and more pronounced fashion than in any other,

243
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.651
certainly,

244
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:53.120
and obviously in a more pronounced fashion than most of the ways in which we've

245
00:16:53.121 --> 00:16:57.110
been talking about the text.
And so that's what I think.

246
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.690
But what I think also as we'll see,

247
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.380
of course I've disclaimed any connection with psychoanalysis,

248
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:05.960
but nevertheless and know something about it.
Uh,

249
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.680
and so that's part of my interpretive community.
W W we'll get back to that.
Um,

250
00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.020
all right,
so in any case,
we've been treating,
uh,

251
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.180
Tony the tow truck in this way and we have been,

252
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:24.320
well,
you know,
nodding our heads and say,
yeah,
it's about that too.

253
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:26.960
And I guess so,
yeah.
Interesting.
Isn't it?

254
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.250
Under what it's going to be about on Thursday?
Uh,
and we've been and,
and,
and,

255
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.480
and we've been doing this because we belong to an interpretive community.

256
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.980
Now I want immediately to add here two caveats.

257
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.570
I would say that within the interpretive community that makes up this room,

258
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.050
a community of people who are interested in interpretation,

259
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.220
probably have all along that interpretation was a Mug's game and therefore

260
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.930
wanted to take a course of this kind to find out how just how bad it was.
Uh,

261
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.410
it all of us at least have in common,
um,

262
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.530
a concern with the potential complexity of those circumstances that surround a

263
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:09.330
interpretation.

264
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.220
So we are an interpretive interpretive community that's interested in

265
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:17.880
interpretation.
So we play the game.
However,

266
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:22.620
I would hazard that within this interpretive community there are two sub

267
00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:24.190
communities,
um,

268
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.890
which probably in a certain sense while they see the significance of the

269
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:32.150
exercise,
nevertheless want to hold out against.

270
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.980
One of them is the community,

271
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.960
which either has always has or has now come to,
to,

272
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.480
to,
to have,
uh,
a very,

273
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:46.890
very strong commitment to one or another point of view that's been passed and

274
00:18:46.891 --> 00:18:51.891
review in this course and who therefore finds it demeaning of the important

275
00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:57.300
point of view that it would be treated simply in a survey,

276
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.950
in a serial way with all sorts of other points of view that may or may not

277
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.570
supplant or jostle with it.
Now,
uh,
this is,
um,

278
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.990
th th this takes us back to the remarks.

279
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:14.991
I was making it the beginning about the way in which one can perhaps acknowledge

280
00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:17.310
the usefulness of a survey course,

281
00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:22.311
but nevertheless bridle at the very idea of a survey course when after all,

282
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:25.020
the only thing that matters is Marxists thought,

283
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.370
why do we spend any time with all of these other approaches to things?

284
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.930
And so on.
Just sort of which,

285
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.640
whichever form of thought is the only thing that matters to you.
Uh,
and so,
um,

286
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.480
this would probably lead you to say not so much.

287
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.380
Tony is only about this one thing,

288
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.780
but oh,
you know,

289
00:19:45.781 --> 00:19:50.781
this is a really facile and irrelevant exercise because the important thing is

290
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:55.791
to take this one thing seriously and the implication is that if you take a lot

291
00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:58.180
of other things in review,
uh,

292
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.660
you're not taking this one thing seriously now that's,

293
00:20:02.661 --> 00:20:07.080
so that might be one sub community within our interpretive community and another

294
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:10.320
one might be a sub community that is committed,

295
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:14.910
still committed as one's tempted to say to high culture and says,

296
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.160
I think it's a bit,

297
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:21.050
I think we should have used listed us or the rime of the ancient mariner.
Uh,

298
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.140
it was demeaning to high culture to use Tony the tow truck.

299
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.590
And furthermore,
this sub community might very well say,
um,

300
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.180
if we had used listed as or the rime of the ancient mariner,

301
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.860
a certain approach,
a certain way of reading,

302
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.890
either of those poems would have made sense self evidently meaning that all the

303
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:47.130
other approaches,
uh,
are trivial.
If you,

304
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:51.640
if your commitment is not so much to one point of view as to some idea of high

305
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:55.870
culture,
you're not going to say in advance which approach it is,

306
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.050
but you're going to suppose that somehow or another such as the value in nature

307
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:06.871
of high culture that it will be possible to arrive at a sort of consensus view

308
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.420
of what's going on in one of its products.

309
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:14.830
This is what Gillery is talking about.
Uh,
at least in part,
um,

310
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.240
in his,
uh,
review of defenses of Western civilization,

311
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:23.830
Western culture and so on.
They have a meaning.
They have a continuity,

312
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:25.900
they have a stability,
uh,

313
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.190
which is worth preserving and which ought to be the central business of the

314
00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:34.030
schools to promulgate.
All right?
So,
um,

315
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.280
those are possible sub communities within our interpretive community,

316
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:43.990
but we all do have in common the recognition that it's possible to riff on a

317
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:47.770
text in this way.
Uh,
and if somebody does it,

318
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.380
we recognize that whether we like it or not,

319
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:54.750
we ourselves could probably do it too.
So that the,

320
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.610
which has proof from Stanley Fischer's point of view and also from John Gillery

321
00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:03.240
is pointed to because we're in a school,
uh,
that we,
um,

322
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.250
have a great deal in common and that it's what we have in common that brings the

323
00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:14.500
text into visibility in the variety of ways,
uh,

324
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.240
that we've performed on it.

325
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.383
<v 1>Now,</v>

326
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.160
<v 0>with all of this said,</v>

327
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.460
let's talk a little bit more about what an interpreter interpretive community is

328
00:22:26.341 --> 00:22:29.810
a for first according to Stanley fish.
Um,
and,
and,

329
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.820
and then move to the point where we may wish to suggest one form or another of

330
00:22:35.641 --> 00:22:40.230
criticism of this idea.
Let's begin with fishes.
First sentence,

331
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.030
uh,
which is on page 10,
23,
the upper left hand column.

332
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.850
<v 1>Okay.</v>

333
00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:50.610
<v 0>This is a series of lectures.
And so he begins by saying,</v>

334
00:22:50.611 --> 00:22:55.611
last time I sketched out an argument by which meanings are the property,

335
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.190
neither of fixed and stable text,

336
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.430
nor of free and independent readers,

337
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.850
but of interpretive communities that are responsible both for the shape of a

338
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:13.701
reader's activities and for the texts those activities produce.

339
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.090
I don't know that he's written that he really carries his argument all that much

340
00:23:18.091 --> 00:23:21.580
farther forward in this lecture,
which is why,
um,

341
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.260
I think it's worthwhile to begin with the sentence because in some ways it does

342
00:23:25.261 --> 00:23:28.360
anticipate,
uh,
what he then lays out,
uh,

343
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.260
once more in this lecture.
Now,

344
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.320
an interesting thing about the career of Stanley fish as that he actually,

345
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.350
uh,

346
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:42.350
in the course of that are quite high visibility career changed his mind twice.

347
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:44.700
Uh,

348
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.700
and his changes of mind are actually recorded residually in this essay that you

349
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:54.710
read.
How do we recognize a poem when we see one,
which by the way,

350
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:58.990
as a completely disingenuous title because we don't see poems.
Uh,

351
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.490
that's,
that's,
that's the whole,
that's the whole point.
There's no poem there.

352
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.470
I mean,
if it's there,
it's because you put it there.
Uh,
and,
but,
but in any case,

353
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.430
um,
uh,
in this,
these changes of mind,

354
00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:16.490
our residually present in this text,
uh,

355
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.580
they are actually manifest in the peculiar vagary of the argument of an earlier

356
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:25.970
essay he wrote called interpreting the Variorum,

357
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.210
which is what was in the second edition of Rector.

358
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.780
And is the one that I used to teach.
Uh,

359
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.880
but I think it's still worth hearkening back to those changes of mind.

360
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.490
Um,
when I was his student at the University of California,
um,

361
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.240
he held his first opinion.
This was just before he published,

362
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:52.130
surprised by sin.
The reader in paradise lost a book for,

363
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.230
for which a seminar that I was in was a kind of Guinea pig.
Um,
and,

364
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.890
uh,

365
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:02.890
to give you an example of what he meant by saying that a stable text produces a

366
00:25:04.251 --> 00:25:07.880
reader.
In other words that,
that I do,
which is,

367
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:09.590
which was his first belief.

368
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.140
I'll give you an example that he uses from Milton about Satan spear.

369
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.860
This is a Satan standing by the fiery lake.

370
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:23.460
He's just pulled himself up to his full height.
Um,
he has a spear,
uh,

371
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.490
and Milton writes about it,
his spear to equal which the tallest pine.

372
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.340
Okay.
Spear Pine,
about the same size.

373
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.910
A human to be the master of some great amaryl.
Well,
let's see.

374
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:38.690
Mass Pine Spear.
We're about a won.

375
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:42.970
And then you realize that the sequence of sizes is completely reversed.
Um,

376
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.270
and what you thought,

377
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:48.410
what you'd already filled your consciousness with the tallest pine.

378
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.440
You know,
it's just a wand.
Compare it with the size of Satan spirits.

379
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.470
So what's he saying?

380
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.830
He's saying you think that your mind can grasp the magnitude of Satan.

381
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.150
You think you know how big Satan is,

382
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:10.280
but the language of paradise lost is going to teach you,

383
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:15.310
is going to educate you into realizing don't mess with Satan because Satan is

384
00:26:16.611 --> 00:26:20.390
much bigger than you think.
He is.
What I didn't write here,

385
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.710
and what continues the passage shows that even here,

386
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.180
Satan is absolutely at his weakest.
The passage continues.

387
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.420
He walked with to support an easy steps and others,

388
00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:37.310
he's just risen from the fiery lake.

389
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:42.311
He says week is he's ever going to be right now and yet he's already a lot more

390
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:45.510
than you can handle.
Okay?

391
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.540
So that and that is the way the syntax of paradise lost educates us into

392
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:56.571
realizing that every time we think we grasp for the point of a text,

393
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.640
we prove that we are fallen readers,

394
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.850
that we have prematurely understood what's there and that only understanding it

395
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:10.890
in the long run can prevail on,
can prevail upon us to realize,

396
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.690
uh,
the fallen condition,

397
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:17.340
which the text is obviously after all about that was fishes first opinion.

398
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.650
Not Too long after that,
uh,

399
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.090
in the course of writing a book called self consuming artifact,

400
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.040
he began to have a different opinion,

401
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:30.900
which more or less reverse the first one they decided it isn't the text that

402
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:32.520
brings the reader into being.

403
00:27:32.521 --> 00:27:36.600
That is to say brings about the self realization on my part that I'm a fall and

404
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:38.700
being in the case of paradise lost,

405
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.480
it isn't the tax that brings the reader into existence.

406
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:47.190
It's the reader that brings the text into existence.
It's the reader after all,

407
00:27:47.191 --> 00:27:50.250
who performed this act of reading.

408
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.820
And it's the reader who made visible in the text the possibility that this is

409
00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:58.110
what Milton is doing.

410
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:03.650
So he reverses his field while retaining the same structure of argument in the

411
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:08.550
same range of insight about what one can think about a text.

412
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:13.110
Well that was fine until he realized that,
you know,

413
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.120
a reader has to come from someplace,
arena isn't just an autonomous being.

414
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.800
And he said,
well as a mat and,
and,
and this is where the,

415
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:27.630
he realized that the third step in his development,

416
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.010
his second change of mind means this.

417
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.670
It's not the text that produces the reader.

418
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.090
It's not the reader that produces the text,

419
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:44.270
but it's the community that produces the reader who in turn produces the text.

420
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.700
Those three points.
In other words,
um,
our,
uh,

421
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.590
our,
our map,
the progress of his thinking on these issues.

422
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.850
It's quick.
Look at page 10,
25,
the right hand column.

423
00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.930
He says in bottom of the paragraph,

424
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.020
interpretation is not the art of construing,

425
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:12.021
but the art of constructing interpreters do not d code poems.

426
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.820
They make them.
Okay.
When he says that he's at,

427
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.860
he's only at phase two of his thinking because there's still the possibility

428
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:27.861
open to the reader of thinking that the interpreter is an autonomous being whose

429
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:32.590
thoughts,
who's interpretive powers,
whose strategies of reading,
uh,

430
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.620
emanate from something from within.
But then,
uh,
on page 10,

431
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:42.580
27,
he clarifies,
uh,
toward the bottom of the right hand column.

432
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:47.220
This does not,
however,
commit me to subjectivity.
In other words,

433
00:29:47.221 --> 00:29:51.850
it's not just a question of,
um,
whatever I think is in a text as in a text.

434
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:55.750
I'm the one who makes the text and you make the text and the other person makes

435
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:56.171
the text.

436
00:29:56.171 --> 00:30:00.010
We all make different texts because we all have different subjectivities.

437
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.760
That's not what he's saying.
This does not,
however,

438
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:08.761
commit me to subjectivity because the means by which they are made are social

439
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.100
and conventional.

440
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:18.210
I can't have an off the wall interpretation of anything if anyone else ever

441
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:26.580
hears it.
Yeah.
If I,
if I,
if I'm just,
if,

442
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.640
if,
if I'm just in my room surrounded by yellow wallpaper or something like that,

443
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.440
I suppose I can have an off the wall interpretation of something.

444
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.080
But if I try to publish it,
forget it.

445
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.790
When I try to publish,
when I try to express myself,

446
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:48.030
when I exposed myself to any aspect of the public's fear,

447
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.910
my interpretation,

448
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.930
if it's to be judged as an interpretation as all at all,

449
00:30:55.931 --> 00:31:00.340
if it's to count as an interpretation,
if it's to count as an opinion,

450
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:05.490
must already be immeshed in the interpretive community to which it's addressed,

451
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.230
it must have some sort of link with that community.

452
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:16.380
It must involve some sort of membership or relationship with that community so

453
00:31:20.021 --> 00:31:25.021
that what fish concludes as that there are neither subjects nor objects.

454
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160
In other words,
this is fishes way,
uh,

455
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:34.830
following Derrida and deconstruction of attacking them.

456
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.090
Western metaphysical tradition.

457
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.540
As long as we suppose that understanding is a matter of parsing or coming to

458
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:45.700
terms with subject object relations,

459
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:50.440
we're on the wrong track to understanding and we have to understand,

460
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.100
uh,

461
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:56.100
the way in which neither the subject nor the object can be said to have a stable

462
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.060
existence,

463
00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:03.180
to have integrity of any kind before we can come closer to grasping how it is

464
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.570
that interpretation is made and achieved.

465
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.520
We've seen this before,

466
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:15.060
all the way back at the beginning of the semester when we talked about for

467
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:17.530
having,
uh,

468
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:22.550
in Heidegger and got him or about the way in which we always see something as

469
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.350
something,
we never see it as an object.

470
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:30.940
We never see it in an of itself.
We've seen it before,

471
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:36.040
but there is a slight difference because Heidegger and got and got them or hold

472
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:41.041
out the object as a standard against one's opinions about it can be tested.

473
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:42.891
In other words,

474
00:32:42.891 --> 00:32:47.891
the hermaneutic circle is a movement back and forth between interpretation and

475
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:51.290
what's being interpreted.

476
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:56.470
So that what's being interpreted is a constant check on the process of

477
00:32:56.631 --> 00:33:00.760
interpretation.
Just as interpretation as a deepens,
uh,

478
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:05.830
is a finer and finer outlining of the nature of the object.

479
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.710
So the hermaneutic circle,

480
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.860
which resembles which anticipates the thinking of fish in that it insists on the

481
00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:19.790
way in which all interpretation begins as preconception.

482
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.480
Nevertheless does also entail that subtle difference in that the object is

483
00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:30.170
there.
It's not that fish denies the existence of objects.
Sometimes.

484
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:32.480
Sometimes his rhetoric makes it seem that way.

485
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.580
It's not that he denies the existence of logic,

486
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:39.610
he simply denies that we can know them as objects at any point.

487
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:45.380
They,
we bring them into being and in bringing them into being,

488
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.620
we construct them in whatever way it is that we construct them now.

489
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.630
Okay.
Interpretive Communities.

490
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:56.720
What do we make of this idea of interpretive community?

491
00:33:56.721 --> 00:34:00.350
I've just said we all belonged to an interpretive community.

492
00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:04.100
We sitting here all belonged to an interpretive community.
Um,

493
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.560
there may be a couple of sub communities,

494
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:08.630
but basically we're an interpretive community.

495
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:12.140
We understand each other and yet at the same time

496
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.200
it's equally the case.

497
00:34:15.201 --> 00:34:20.201
As I'm sure all of you are thinking to yourselves that no one of us has exactly

498
00:34:21.261 --> 00:34:23.840
the same set of opinions as anyone else.

499
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:28.580
We say we belonged to an interpretive community.
We can in fact,

500
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:31.430
according to a certain weak form of the argument,

501
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.380
understand the way in which yes,

502
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:37.490
we do bring things into being according to certain habits that have evolved

503
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:42.020
through our membership in such a community.
But at the same time we say,

504
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.520
guess what?
You know,

505
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:48.670
I don't quite interpret James Rosenbaum and the rest of them in the way fishes

506
00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:50.990
class did.

507
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:54.890
I still don't interpret it in a way that professor fry supplemented their

508
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:59.270
interpretation.
Um,
I interpreted a little differently and furthermore,

509
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.690
I knew all along it wasn't a poem.
Uh,
you know,
I,

510
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:07.040
you can't fool me.
Uh,
and so on.
Um,

511
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.880
so and you,
and so each of us say to ourselves,
okay,
yeah,

512
00:35:10.881 --> 00:35:14.960
we have certain things in common,
but there are also ways in which we differ.

513
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.520
What would fish say to that?
I,

514
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.970
I think what he would say is this.
And I,
and I do think,

515
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.840
and I think this needs to be acknowledged,
it weakens his position.

516
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.940
They would say,
all right,
granted in some,
in a rough sense,

517
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.990
we belong here.
Just as John Guillory says,
in a rough sense,

518
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:39.480
we're all in a
and a rough sense.

519
00:35:39.481 --> 00:35:42.000
We belonged to an interpretive community,

520
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.990
but there's another sense in which we are each of us,

521
00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.490
the sum total,

522
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.550
the composite of all the interpretive communities to which we now,

523
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.990
uh,
in some way or another,
uh,

524
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.930
have an affinity and from which in a v in all the variety of ways one can

525
00:36:00.931 --> 00:36:05.250
mention we have emerged.
Yes,
we're each different because the,

526
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:10.050
some of the interpretive communities to which we belong constituting the

527
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.650
ultimate interpretive community that indeed we are,

528
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.910
is always going to be a little different from the sum of the,

529
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.250
of the communities to which other people belong.

530
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:25.580
This reduces the idea of interpretive community to a kind of atomism whereby we

531
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:31.110
all concede.
We all say,
yes,
it's true.
I am in a certain sense,

532
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:36.060
a community.
Uh,
that's all Buckstein's said.
I am a community.

533
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.590
I am a community.

534
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:41.160
And of course what communities do when they think is interpret thinking is

535
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.390
interpretation,
but at the same time,
what's the point?

536
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.820
We then say,
I'm saying I'm a community.

537
00:36:47.821 --> 00:36:50.340
If in fact I'm a little different from everybody else,

538
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:54.670
why not retain a certain sense of subjectivity,
uh,

539
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.490
or why not at least,
uh,
retain that sense of individuality,

540
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.550
which results from the fact that none of us ultimately completely on every

541
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:09.390
particular agree with anybody else.

542
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.540
The reason being that the sum of our interpretive communities that makes up that

543
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:19.560
fundamental community to which we say we belong is always a little bit

544
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.450
different.
Okay.
Now there is another argument against,

545
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.840
uh,
this position,
the of what,

546
00:37:26.841 --> 00:37:30.300
which might be called radical constructivism.
Uh,

547
00:37:30.301 --> 00:37:35.301
we hear it very frequently from a socio biological thinkers like Edward O.

548
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:40.320
Wilson for example.
Uh,
who think that,

549
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:45.321
who pointed out that consciousness is hardwired to do and to recognize all sorts

550
00:37:46.381 --> 00:37:47.940
of things.
Uh,
we,

551
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:52.500
it has been shown in the lab that aesthetic preference,

552
00:37:52.501 --> 00:37:55.860
which of course was always held just to up to derision,

553
00:37:55.861 --> 00:37:59.850
has anything like an objective,
standard aesthetic preference.
You know,

554
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.770
there's no disputing tastes we always say,
but even aesthetic preference,

555
00:38:04.771 --> 00:38:08.310
it's been shown in the lab involves certain predilections.

556
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:12.960
We all do have in common,
we all prefer the so called golden section.

557
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:17.760
We Love Arches and this can be explained and all sorts of ways.

558
00:38:17.761 --> 00:38:21.330
The most common explanation has to do with what's called shelter theory.

559
00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:25.560
We liked shapes that somehow or another offer shelter or protection.
Uh,

560
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.320
but in any case,
uh,

561
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:32.360
the fairly conclusive evidence is that in a variety of ways we are hardwired to

562
00:38:32.911 --> 00:38:33.840
recognize things.

563
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:38.841
Darwin's last book is all about how we recognize the each other's expressions.

564
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.140
We recognize the expressions of animals that with which we have a great deal in

565
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:48.070
common and that we do this from infancy.
Uh,
in other words,

566
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:51.550
all sorts of evidence to this effect.
But you know,

567
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:56.170
I'm not sure fishes argument is vulnerable to that position because after all,

568
00:38:56.171 --> 00:38:58.090
hard wiring is communitarian.

569
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.630
The point is precisely that we all have it.

570
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.810
And then it's not something that we can call individual,

571
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.040
not something that we can call or something,

572
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.690
something autonomous to any one of us as individuals.

573
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.060
So it seems to me that although that the argument,

574
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:18.640
the argument against so called radical constructivism usually does take this

575
00:39:18.641 --> 00:39:22.840
form.
It seems to me that it actually not a very good argument.
Uh,

576
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:27.841
and that the argument objecting to the mirror weakness of the way in which

577
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:33.340
interpretive community as a concept ultimately becomes out of atomistic,

578
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:38.140
uh,
as a stronger argument because what does it matter if I'm an interpretive

579
00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:42.100
community,
if I'm still a community of one,
uh,

580
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:46.360
there in some measure,
um,
it's,

581
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.720
it's something that seems less worth talking about once,

582
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:52.300
once put it in those terms.
All right.

583
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:57.100
Very quickly then on Guillory,
uh,
whose argument,

584
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.210
um,

585
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:03.210
actually ended the very debate that he thinks is going to intensify and get

586
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:05.680
worse.
In other words,

587
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.090
he thought that the big hot button topic in the,

588
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.760
in the academic world for the next 25 years or more would be the,

589
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.850
the Canon wars,
the,
you know,
the sort of,
sort of canonical non-canonical,
uh,

590
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.190
cultural multicultural.

591
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:26.080
He thought he thought this would be the fundamental point of contention and the

592
00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:29.140
academic world.
Well,
it wasn't,
and there isn't.

593
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:31.750
It wasn't is that his argument was so brilliant.

594
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.880
Everybody came to their senses and realize that they were barking up the wrong

595
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:40.630
tree.
I mean,
literally his book,
Cultural Capital,
uh,

596
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:45.580
simply silenced,
not in the public because nothing ever silence as the public,

597
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:49.320
but simply but,
but,
but,
but simply silenced,
uh,

598
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:53.330
the debate about the culture wars in the academy.
Um,

599
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.270
and so in some ways,
um,
Guillory,
um,

600
00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.000
amusingly a undermines his own prophecy,

601
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:06.001
which by the way is on page 1477 and the upper right hand column,

602
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.400
if you care to read it now,
um,

603
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.180
Gillery his main preoccupation,

604
00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:16.390
which he takes largely from Pierre Butcher,

605
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:21.510
but also as he argues in a long constructive digression from Antonio Gramsci.

606
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:28.080
His main preoccupation is with the school as a means of establishing and

607
00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:33.920
proliferating what grom she called hegemony the school.

608
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:38.810
In other words,
on this argument doesn't typically,

609
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.130
and we'll,

610
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.240
we'll come back to the exception that gallery himself does make the school

611
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.160
doesn't typically
send out into the world.

612
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.460
Mine's armed with specific bodies of knowledge or understanding it sends out

613
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:00.320
into the world,
especially when it's a question of the humanities,

614
00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:03.890
which Guillory thinks are painting themselves into the corner,
uh,

615
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:08.300
in their obtuseness.
Uh,
especially when it's a matter of the humanities.

616
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.580
The school sends out into the world,

617
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.840
people endowed with a certain quantum of cultural capital.

618
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.020
It repeats,
in other words,
in board years term,

619
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.200
it reproduces a structure of class,

620
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.550
uh,
but really class in the sort of super sad,

621
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.470
super structural sense class superiority,
uh,

622
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.680
that regardless of the specific content that a person's supposed as himself to

623
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:39.380
have been mastering,
uh,
that is,

624
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:41.880
that simply replicates a,

625
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.550
an orientation to the ruling class,
uh,
that the school,

626
00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.120
uh,

627
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:52.120
in a western culture according to Gillery has always had what the school

628
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:53.300
reproduces,

629
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.410
is not knowledge so much as itself,

630
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.300
the attitude that it embodies its reason for being,
uh,

631
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.320
it's reason for continuation and its relation to power and stay state apparatus.

632
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:14.410
That's galleries up basic position and it's why he says that the culture wars,

633
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.500
um,
uh,

634
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:21.530
I simply play into the hands of the Monolithic ideology of the school.

635
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:30.070
What happens when you embrace multiculturalism as the only a means of

636
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.030
inculcating what Guillory calls progressive pedagogy.

637
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:39.800
What happens when you embrace multiculturalism according to Gillery is that you

638
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:43.580
d Ras innate the object of your intake,

639
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.670
of your intention from the culture to which they belong in precisely the way

640
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.660
that the great monuments of Western civilization have long since been

641
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.730
deracinated from their historical and cultural circumstances.

642
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:03.820
You reduce both western Civ and alternative cannons to the same deracinated

643
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.070
rootless,
uh,

644
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.470
sort of nature as cultural capital.

645
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:17.750
I have read this,

646
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.960
I have a certain status and negotiability in the world as having read this.

647
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:28.220
Uh,
in the case of Western Civ,
uh,

648
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:32.370
it's quotations from the poets and after dinner speeches in the case of

649
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.140
multicultural curricula,

650
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:39.290
that's the opportunity to allude in precisely the same way on largely the same

651
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.850
occasions.
And in either case,

652
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.940
it has nothing to do with learning anything about according to Gillery about the

653
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:52.670
historical and social circumstances in which any kind of cultural production,

654
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.550
uh,
are grounded.
Now the,
um,

655
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.680
the argument,
the argument,
uh,

656
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.900
depends of course on supposing that,
uh,

657
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:09.080
the way in which the way in which the great works are taught is as though they

658
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:13.020
embodied certain ideas or principles.

659
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:17.490
That is to say they're taught as messages in Gillery his view,

660
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:21.150
uh,
whatever form of message it might be.
Uh,

661
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:25.980
the western Canon as a message about the importance of being an American,

662
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:31.030
the,
uh,
mult multicultural canons as a message,
uh,

663
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:36.050
a contestatory message about the importance of being whoever happens to be

664
00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:40.350
speaking.
Uh,
but in each case,
they're merely messages.

665
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:42.630
They're not cultural artifacts.
They are,

666
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:47.631
they don't emerge from the real sort of historical and living circumstances in

667
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:53.750
which they're written.
Now,
this is,
uh,
at which,
which of course is,
is,

668
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.360
is most broadly speaking,
uh,
simply an appeal to method,

669
00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:02.390
a new way of teaching Gillery his own deepest commitment is in fact to the great

670
00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:08.040
works.
Guillory began as an early modern scholar.
He wrote a very,

671
00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:11.340
very fine first book on Spencer and Milton.
Uh,

672
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.580
his later work and literary sociology,
uh,

673
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.640
in no ways discredits or undermines the fact that earlier in his career he was

674
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:25.410
interested in a cultural canon.
Uh,
and in fact,
in fact,

675
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:29.940
probably the most interesting chapter in Po in cultural capital is maybe not

676
00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:33.270
this,
uh,
the introductory theoretical one,

677
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:38.420
but an amazing chapter in which he shows how a graze Thomas Gray's elegy in a

678
00:46:39.031 --> 00:46:40.740
country churchyard,
uh,

679
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.340
came to predominate in English curricula,

680
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:49.500
even though it was written in the vernacular in English.
He shows,
in other words,

681
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.530
how the allergy and a country churchyard,
uh,

682
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:57.090
in the way in which it's situated itself in culture at that time actually

683
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:02.180
undermined the premium placed on the classics on La Teneti,

684
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:07.110
uh,
and helped,
uh,
the emergence of a,

685
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.080
uh,
vernacular national curriculum.

686
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:14.460
It's an absolutely brilliant argument in which the LG in a country churchyard is

687
00:47:14.461 --> 00:47:18.750
itself constantly and steadily and fascinatingly invoked.

688
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.990
In other words,
Guillory himself likes the classics.
Uh,
and,
and,

689
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:27.270
and perhaps the most interesting part of this argument is the way in which,
uh,

690
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.240
the western Civ Mavens,
um,

691
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.950
are simply fooled about their own understanding of what a Canon is.

692
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:37.510
Because perpetually history changes candidates.
Uh,
the more books you get,

693
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.500
the fewer you can read and the more it gets dropped out of any curriculum,

694
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.400
including the western Civ curse curriculum today.
You know,

695
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.880
we're proud if we're proponents of great books,

696
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.900
we're proud of reading Plato and Aristotle.
Uh,
in the old days,

697
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.030
people didn't stop with Plato and Aristotle.

698
00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:58.430
They read everything there was to read in Greek and Latin culture.
Um,

699
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.950
and then they read such few books as may have been published in English.
Well,

700
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.820
a great deal has happened since then.
And perforce,
uh,

701
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.060
modern modern languages and literatures have,

702
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:14.350
have altered the cannon always to the,
to the end of thinning it out.

703
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.110
More and more gets left out.

704
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:22.230
This is an inevitability even in the so-called canonical and therefore itself

705
00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:26.920
needs to acknowledge the centrality of historical change.

706
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:31.630
Gillery his argument obviously hinges on the failure of anybody involved in

707
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:34.960
these debates to,
to distinguish between the two forms of culture.

708
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:36.670
There's culture,

709
00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.740
the guide of culture on which a person without any educated at all education at

710
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:46.390
all and the new professional managerial class can meet the kind of culture in

711
00:48:46.391 --> 00:48:50.470
which precisely literature,
it doesn't matter who needs literature,
you know,

712
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.330
I'm running Hewlett Packard,
do I need literature?
Um,
you know,
uh,
and,

713
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:59.560
and uh,
at the same time the kind of culture which,
you know,

714
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:03.590
with a capitalK as we say,
uh,
it,
which is all about,
uh,

715
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.010
the great books,
high culture,
uh,

716
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.800
the monuments of civilization and so on.

717
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.820
Guillory says the total disconnect,
uh,

718
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:15.670
in the way in which we understand the relations between these two forms of

719
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:20.671
culture is what leads to the kinds of deracination in teaching that he complains

720
00:49:22.751 --> 00:49:23.260
about.

721
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:28.260
He himself finally thinks that anything is fair game to be taught and it can be

722
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:34.180
taught progressively as long as it is taught in terms of its social and

723
00:49:34.181 --> 00:49:38.050
historical circumstances.
He points out that a great book.

724
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.000
I will quote this and then I'll leave you.

725
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.240
He points out that a great book is great in part because it can't possibly be

726
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:50.890
reduced to the silliness that the advocates of western Civ attached to it.

727
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:53.470
He says,
paid 1482 right hand column.

728
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.770
No cultural work of any interest at all is simple enough to be credibly

729
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.760
allegorizing in this way because any cultural work will objectify,

730
00:50:03.761 --> 00:50:05.620
and it's very form and content,

731
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:10.830
the same social conflict that the Canon debate allegorize is by means of a Dura,

732
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.990
a divided curriculum.
The Odyssey is full of lying,

733
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.220
trickery,
class,
betrayal,
the Iliad.

734
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.340
Perhaps the most interesting character,
as I'm sure you'll all agree,

735
00:50:24.341 --> 00:50:29.341
is their psyches who is scarcely and advocate of the values that we associate

736
