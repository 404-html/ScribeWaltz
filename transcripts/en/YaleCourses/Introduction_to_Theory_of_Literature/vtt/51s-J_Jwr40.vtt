WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.250
Well,
I'd like to start,
uh,

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.280
with a little more discussion of Derrida before we turn to demand.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.030
Uh,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.030
and I know already that I'm going to forego what for me is a kind of pleasure,

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
uh,
perhaps wouldn't be for you a which is an explication,

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.050
which,

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.050
which is an explication of the last extraordinary sentence in Derrida's essay on

8
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.150
page nine 26 and the right hand column.
I'm going to read it to you.

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.940
Um,
just so you can reflect on it.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.720
And what I'd like to do is suggest to you that if you still haven't determined

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.440
on a paper topic,
you might very well consider this one.

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.980
I you may not find it congenial.
That's a buzzing,

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.810
that you are intrigued by Derrida,
uh,
to account for this last sentence,

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.790
to show how it picks up motifs generated throughout the essay,

15
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.970
how it returns the essay to its beginning,
uh,

16
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:03.690
and to consider very carefully it's metaphors.

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.730
It reflects on its old metaphors.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.050
I think you might find intriguing passages here.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.580
There is a sort of question,

20
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.050
call it historical of which we are only glimpsing today.

21
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.150
The conception,
the formation,
the gestation,
the Labor.

22
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.340
I employ these words,

23
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:27.090
I admit with a glance toward the business of child bearing,

24
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.130
but also with a glance store.

25
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:34.131
Those who in a company from which I do not exclude myself turned their eyes away

26
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:40.551
in the face of the as yet unnameable which is proclaiming itself and which can

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.521
do so as is necessary whenever a birth is in the offing only under the species

28
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:53.151
of the non species in the formless mute infant and terrifying form of

29
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.820
monstrosity.
All right,
well there is a sentence for you,
uh,
and as I say,

30
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.130
uh,
I don't have time to explicate it,

31
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:06.900
but I commend it to you as a possible paper topic if you're still in need of one

32
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.520
right now.

33
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.520
I do want to go back to the relationship between Derrida and Levy Strauss.

34
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.980
I suggested last time that while in some ways the essay really seems to stage

35
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:24.231
itself as a critique of Levy Strauss at the same time to a remarkable degree

36
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.520
confessor unconfessed,
it stands on the shoulders of Levy Strauss.

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.630
At the same time.
However,
having made use of Levy Strauss,

38
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.750
finding a means of distancing himself from the source text.

39
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.140
Take for example,

40
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.180
paid nine 24 over onto nine 25 when he can,

41
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.170
when he quotes from Levis Strauss,
uh,

42
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.920
the as a Levy Strauss is introduction to the work of Boxville a mouse,
uh,

43
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.980
on the subject of the birth or event or emergence of language and what it grotes

44
00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:05.871
from Levis Strauss would seem on the face of it to have exactly the same kinds

45
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.970
of reservation hesitation about the emergence or birth of language that Derrida

46
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.950
himself has.

47
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.100
Levy Strauss writes whatever may have been the moment and the circumstances of

48
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:25.171
its appearance in the scale of animal life language could only have been born in

49
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.670
one fell swoop.

50
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.060
Things could not have said about signifying progressively following a

51
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.810
transformation.
The study of which is not the concern of the social sciences,

52
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.750
but rather of biology and psychology.
Uh,

53
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.751
crossing over came about from a stage where nothing had a meaning to another

54
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.710
where everything possessed it.
In other words,
Bam.

55
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.270
All of a sudden you had language,
you had a semiotic system,

56
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.470
whereas before yesterday,
a minute ago,

57
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.530
you had no language at all.
In other words,

58
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.660
there's no notion that somehow or another,

59
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.170
suddenly I looked at something and said,
oh,
that has a meaning.

60
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.670
And then you know,
somehow or another I looked at something else and said,
oh,

61
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:15.910
that has a meaning.
And in the long run,
Lo and behold,

62
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:20.911
I had language because the bringing into existence of the very thought of

63
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:26.521
meaning Levy Strauss wants to argue instantly confers meaning on everything.

64
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.810
In other words,
you don't have,

65
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.320
you don't have a gradual emergence of language.

66
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.970
You have like lava emerging from a volcano,
oh rupture.

67
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.190
You have something which suddenly appears amid other things,

68
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.190
something which is latent in those things,

69
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.250
although they don't in themselves have it until you confirm it on them.

70
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.940
Mainly that which confers meaning language.

71
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.770
All right,
so this is Levy.

72
00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:01.150
Strauss is argument and Derrida is interested in it because he recognizes it's

73
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:06.151
affinity with his own hesitation in talking about events and births and

74
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:11.140
emergence and so on.
But at the same time,
at the same time,

75
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.350
he points out by way of criticism that disappears that yesterday there was no

76
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:17.081
language,

77
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:21.520
there was just things as they are without meaning and that today there is

78
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:26.380
language that things have meaning as a result of their now being in place.

79
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:29.080
That semiotic system we call language.

80
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.500
He points out that this means that culture somehow or another must come after

81
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:38.620
nature.
There was nature.

82
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.220
Now there is culture which is very much like an event or birth in the older

83
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.710
sense.
In fact,

84
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.660
as soon as we have culture and Levy Strauss expresses this,

85
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.060
this feeling especially in a famous book called [inaudible].

86
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.090
As soon as we have culture,

87
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
we began to feel overwhelming nostalgia for nature but says Derrida,

88
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.300
what is this nostalgia other than the fact that the very thing we're nostalgic

89
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.631
for comes into existence as a result of the nostalgic and other words,

90
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.910
there is no nature unless you have culture to think it.

91
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.940
Nature is a meaningless concept.

92
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.980
Just like the lack of meaning within nature where there is no culture until

93
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.030
culture comes along and says,
oh,
not,
not so much.

94
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.230
There is nature,

95
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.880
but I'm terribly unhappy because before I came along there was nature.

96
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.690
Right?

97
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.690
And this is the nostalgia or regret of the ethnographer who says now as a result

98
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:53.651
of this terrible Eurocentrism as a result of the terrible ethnocentrism of the

99
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:58.340
European studying these things,
we no longer have a savage mind.

100
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.670
That is to say we no longer have the kind of mind which flourishes in nature in

101
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:06.860
a natural environment.

102
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.690
You can see ramifications of arguments of this sort for environmentalism as well

103
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.200
as for ethnography.
Uh,
it's a fascinating argument,

104
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.760
but the bottom line is this,
even this critique,

105
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.940
and it is a critique of Levis Strauss because you know,
he's saying,
oh,

106
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.720
Levy Strauss.
That's very interesting what you say about language,

107
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.680
but you've forgotten that this means that you yourself must think nature

108
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.820
preceded culture even though culture brings nature into being.
Okay.

109
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.180
But this very critique leveled against Levy Strauss he could have found in Levis

110
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.190
Strauss and does find it on other occasions.
Levy Strauss,
his famous book,

111
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.580
the raw and the cooked essentially stages.

112
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:54.110
This critique in and of itself.
What do you mean raw?
Well,

113
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.810
you know,

114
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.610
somebody is eating gonna feel is sitting in a field eating a carrot that's raw.

115
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.960
You say,
but wait a minute.
You know what is this notion of raw?

116
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.820
You can't have a notion of Ra until you have the notion of cooked.

117
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.920
You know,
I sit in my field,
I'm eating my carrot,
I hold it up and I say,

118
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:17.210
this is raw.
It's ridiculous.
What raw as opposed to what?

119
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.440
Right.

120
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.180
And so there can be no raw without in a certain sense,

121
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:25.640
the prior existence of cooked,

122
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:31.210
cooked brings raw into being in exactly the way culture brings nature into

123
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:37.530
being.
Now to pause over this for a moment,
I mean,
eh,
I mean,

124
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.460
and we realized that this basic move,

125
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.280
a move that when you start to think about it,

126
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.690
we've been encountering ever since we started reading in this course of readings

127
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.110
is not so much the inversion of binary's as the calling into question of how

128
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.980
they can exist apart from each other.

129
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.400
In other words,
this the,
the,
the question of,

130
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.640
of criticizing the origin of one state of things out of or after another state

131
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:14.460
of things.
The process of criticizing that is basically,

132
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.160
and I'm sorry to be so reductive about it,

133
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:21.570
but I really can't see the distortion and saying this is basically saying which

134
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.920
came first,
the chicken or the egg,
right?
It is,
it is a,

135
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
it is a declaration of Absolute Indi interdependency among the things that we

136
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:35.880
take that we understand in binary terms,

137
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
but we take somehow one to be causative of the other when we think about them.

138
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.990
This is really the basic move of deconstruction,

139
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.150
but it's a move which anyone who studies philosophy as well as literary theory

140
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.770
will encounter again and again and again,
all the way from Hegel,

141
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:00.830
right on through the thinkers post deconstructive thinkers we encounter for the

142
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.150
rest of our syllabus.
Uh,
uh,
perhaps preeminently among them,

143
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.410
the gender theorists,
Judith Butler again and again and again,

144
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:12.870
you will encounter this idea in butler.

145
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.740
It's a question of saying how on earth would you ever have the concept

146
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:21.480
heterosexual if you didn't have the concept homosexual in place?

147
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.710
Right?
They are.

148
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.770
The absolute interdependency of this concept of these concepts is again,

149
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.210
uh,
central to her argument and to her understanding of things.

150
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.960
And so,
and obviously we'll be returning to that in the long run.

151
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.490
I want to pause a little bit more than in this regard.

152
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.960
Over dairy does distinction between writing and speech writing a criteria.

153
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.303
Uh,

154
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.530
this is a distinction which is not meant sort of counterintuitively to suggest

155
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:53.610
that somehow or another

156
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.610
as opposed to what we usually think writing precedes speech.
Not at all.

157
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:02.760
He's not saying,
he's not saying that we've got it backwards.

158
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.940
He's just insisting that we cannot understand writing to be derivative.

159
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:14.270
We cannot say writing came in to being belatedly with respect to speech in order

160
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.530
to reproduce or to imitate or to transcribe.

161
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.710
Speech writing and speech are interdependent and interrelated phenomena which do

162
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.690
different things.

163
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.910
Last time we spoke about DFL Os we said that the difference between diff our

164
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:40.170
house with an e and different routes with an ae can't be voiced.

165
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.410
It's a difference or defect loss that comes into being precisely in writing and

166
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:52.191
it's only in writing that we suddenly grasp the twofold nature of different Os

167
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.290
as difference and deferral.
I'd like to pause a little bit,

168
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:01.150
and this will be my segue to demand,
right?
To pause a little bit over.

169
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:03.280
An interesting example in French,

170
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:07.360
which we don't have in English but is I think so instructive that it's worth

171
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:08.194
pausing over.

172
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.070
<v 0>You remember last time and there is a slight voicing difference here,</v>

174
00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:19.200
just as there's also a slight different voicing difference defect.
Hans,

175
00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:23.480
do you feel at all so,
but it's not a big voicing difference.
It's not.
It's,
it's,

176
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:26.930
it's not something that's easier,
easy to evoke and get across.

177
00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:30.590
Whereas in writing it's perfectly obvious.
For one thing,
the ass,

178
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:34.640
which means signification is dropped out of this word.

179
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:37.260
When you say w w when you say,
Hey,

180
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.750
the word for is the word for aunt.

181
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.170
Now these two words precisely expressed in French,

182
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:50.350
but Derrida is trying to describe as the double meaning of supplement charity is

183
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.700
and the sense of the matter for this is that a is B understood as a metaphor is

184
00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:05.620
a supplement that creek that that completes a whole,

185
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.630
it's a means of completing a hole through the declaration that a is B but is has

186
00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:16.460
another sense in which,

187
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.520
which is not a rhetorical sense that because metaphor is is you know the sort of

188
00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:24.380
the heart of,
of,
of,
of rhetoric.

189
00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.450
The rhetorical sense a is B when by the way we know perfectly well today is not

190
00:13:29.451 --> 00:13:31.920
be,
I mean how can ABB Aa is only a,

191
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.380
in fact it's even a question whether hey is a but it's certainly not be right so

192
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.410
this,
this much we know but in the,

193
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.430
in in the grammatical sense there is no sort of mystification about the metaphor

194
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.510
in the grammatical sense.

195
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.250
This word is the print is the means or principle of predication.

196
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.940
Whereby we say one thing is another thing.

197
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.000
The mayor is the female of the horse.

198
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:04.001
Notice that the relationship between the rhetorical is and their grammatical is,

199
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.610
is basically the relationship between y'all,

200
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.300
what y'all Gibson calls the poetic function and the metal lingual function.

201
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.900
Okay.
So add,
as you'll see in demand,

202
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.290
there is a an eight and had irreducible tension between the rhetorical sense of

203
00:14:20.691 --> 00:14:25.691
this word which claims metaphor [inaudible] and their grammatical sense of this

204
00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:31.100
word which makes no such claim but as simply the establishment of uh,
of the,

205
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.310
of,
of,
of the PR of predication in a sentence.

206
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.990
Now the word eh,
which is,
which is a,
are a,

207
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.050
which is almost like that reinforces the idea of the supplement not as the

208
00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:48.650
completion of something that that is,

209
00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.490
that as the completion of something needs it to be complete,

210
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.710
the fulfillment of meaning and a matter of her,

211
00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.100
but rather supplement and the sense of adding on to something that's already

212
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:05.651
complete and the APP positional sort of grammatical,

213
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:11.201
perpetual edition of meaning in the expression and or a is after all very much

214
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.950
like what y'all person calls met anemic.
That is to say the con,

215
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.860
the contiguous adding on of things,

216
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.650
making no claim to be metaphorical,

217
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.470
just like grammatical predication.

218
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.750
And so the tension or the,
the,

219
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.770
the system of differences that can be established simply by looking at these two

220
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:37.730
voice,

221
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.880
similar words I think gives us a kind of emblem or paradigm for what dairy doc

222
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:51.131
calls supplement it supplementaries city and what demand calls the irreducible

223
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.270
tension between difference between conflict,

224
00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:59.180
between rhetoric and grammar,

225
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.600
and that it will be then that is the main topic of what we have to say about

226
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:07.040
demand today.
Now,

227
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.180
last time I said a little bit about the presence of dairy and demand together

228
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:13.740
together with scholar named Jay Hillis,
Miller,
uh,

229
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.810
scholars who associated themselves with them.
Jeffrey Hartman,

230
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:22.811
Harold bloom in a kind of period of flourishing in the 70s and early eighties at

231
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.280
Yale,
uh,
called abroad,
the Yale School,
a subject,

232
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:33.281
too much admiration in the academy and much vilification both within and outside

233
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:39.210
the academy.
Uh,
but a moment of particular,
uh,

234
00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.330
and headlined notoriety,
uh,

235
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.830
in the history of academic thinking about literature,

236
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.100
a moment in which academic thinking about literature had a peculiar influence on

237
00:16:51.231 --> 00:16:51.801
topics,

238
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:56.390
much broader than literature began to infiltrate other disciplines,

239
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.600
uh,
and was,
uh,
in general,
um,

240
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.220
a high spirit and horse for that certain period of time.

241
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:10.170
Now,
shortly after the witness and then Miller,

242
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.900
eventually in the 80s,
went to Irvine Derrida.
I followed him there.
And in,

243
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.550
uh,
1983 bald Amman died.
And the,

244
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:24.080
uh,
well the,
the main,
the main force,
uh,

245
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.070
of the movement began to give way to other interests and other,

246
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.510
and other tendencies and trends both here at Yale and elsewhere.
Um,

247
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:36.050
and then,
uh,
shortly after demands death,

248
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.720
there was a revelation which is mentioned by your editor in the italicized

249
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.080
preface to semiology and rhetoric,
there was a revelation about demand,

250
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.080
which was horrible in itself,
uh,

251
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.110
made it impossible ever to read demonn in quite the same way again,
but,

252
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:52.950
which was also,

253
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.650
I have to say precisely what the enemies of deconstruction we're waiting for.
Uh,

254
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.190
and that was the fact that,
um,
in his youth,
uh,

255
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:06.390
demand still living in Belgium,
the sun,
uh,
the,
the,

256
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:11.370
the nephew of a distinguished socialist politician in Belgium,
uh,

257
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.120
wrote for a Nazi sponsored Belgian newspaper,

258
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.800
a series of articles,
uh,
antisemitic intendancy,

259
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.040
a couple of them openly,
uh,
antisemitic,
antisemitic,

260
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.450
or at least sort of racially Eurocentric and ways that,
you know,

261
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.320
argued for the exclusion of Jews from the intellectual life of Europe.
And so on.

262
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.400
Uh,

263
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.400
these papers were a pub were gathered and published as Paul demands wartime

264
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.580
journalism.
Uh,
and there was a tremendous,
fewer about them,

265
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:44.160
similar to the revelations about height,

266
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.410
which I'd never been completely repressed,

267
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:50.880
but the B seemed to w grew in magnitude as more and more was known about them,

268
00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.580
the revolutions about a,
uh,

269
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.760
Heidegger's association with the Nazi government.
Uh,
and,
and during,

270
00:18:57.761 --> 00:19:01.600
and in the late eighties,
um,
there was,
uh,
a few,

271
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.070
a furious public argumentation back and forth,
uh,

272
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:11.010
between those both,
um,
who had read demand and those who hadn't,
uh,
who,

273
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.720
uh,
were opposed to his work and those who,
uh,
scrambled,
uh,

274
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.150
in one way or another to attempt to defend it,

275
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:22.590
to preserve his legacy and also the legacy of deconstruction.

276
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.490
Uh,

277
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.350
now all of this is a matter of record and I suppose needs to be paused,

278
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.950
paused over a little bit.
One of the,
uh,

279
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:36.630
one of the texts of demand also in the book called allegories of Reading,

280
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:37.291
uh,

281
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:41.790
where you'll find also a version of the essay semiology and rhetoric that you

282
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:46.740
read for today.
One of the essays that those would actually read demand,

283
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:51.390
actually argued about in a persistent fashion is called the purloined ribbon.

284
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:56.870
And it has to do with the passage in Rousseau's confessions where Russo has

285
00:19:57.151 --> 00:20:00.060
stolen a ribbon,
uh,
uh,

286
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:05.090
in order to give it to a serving made to whom he was t he felt attraction.

287
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.100
Uh,
and then when he was asked,
uh,
who had done it,
did he know anything about,

288
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.130
uh,
uh,
who had done it?
He blurted out her name,

289
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:18.950
Mario and demand says this really wasn't an accusation.
In fact,
this,
this,

290
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.330
this,
this was just,
this was just a meaningless word,
uh,

291
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.740
blurted out that he is,

292
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.870
that there is no possibility really of confession that there is real,

293
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.500
there is no real subjectivity that can affirm or deny guilt or responsibility.

294
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.840
In other words,
a lot of things that needless to say,

295
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.930
attracted the attention of a public that wasn't perhaps so much concerned that

296
00:20:45.211 --> 00:20:46.830
he had written these articles,

297
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.460
but that he had never for the rest of his career admitted having done so.

298
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.640
And other words that he had suppressed a past.

299
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.780
Nobody really believed he still had these sympathies.
But the whole question was,

300
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.010
why didn't he fess up?
Why didn't he come clean?

301
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.610
And of course they took the prolonged written ribbon to be his sort of

302
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.660
allegorical way of suggesting that he couldn't possibly confessed because nobody

303
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:14.560
can confess.
There's no human subjectivity,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

304
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.550
So as I say,
there was a considerable controversy,

305
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.300
controversy swirling around this article.
Uh,
and um,

306
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:28.410
it has been very difficult for just as just as is the case with high degree.

307
00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:33.280
It has been very difficult,
uh,
to read demand in the same way again,

308
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.160
as a result of what we now know.
Let me just,
let me just say though,

309
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.870
um,
also that,

310
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:45.910
and I think this was largely confessed by the people engaged in the controversy,

311
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.740
although some people did go farther.

312
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:53.340
There is no cryptically and coded right ism either in demand or in

313
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.510
deconstruction.

314
00:21:55.810 --> 00:22:00.430
There are two possible ways of reacting to what deconstruction calls

315
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.690
undecidability.

316
00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:06.310
That is to say the impossibilities of are really being able to form a grounded

317
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.200
opinion about anything.
There are two possible ways of reacting to this.

318
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.330
One positive and one negative.

319
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:18.750
The negative way is to say that undecidability opens a void in the intellect and

320
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:26.881
in consciousness into which fanaticism and tyranny can rush.

321
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.720
In other words,
if there is a sort of considered,
um,

322
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.910
and skillfully argued resistance to opinion,

323
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.880
call that deconstruction.

324
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.640
Then in the absence of decently grounded,

325
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.740
decently argued opinion,

326
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.450
you get this void into which fanaticism and tyranny can rush.

327
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.630
That's the negative response to undecidability.

328
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:58.780
And it's of course something that,
uh,
that a,

329
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:00.700
a view that many of us may entertain.

330
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.690
The positive voice reaction,
however,

331
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:09.691
to undecidability is this undecidability is a perpetually vigilant scrutiny of

332
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:19.441
all opinion as such precisely in order to withstand and to resist those most

333
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.800
egregious and incorrigible opinions of all the opinions of fanaticism and

334
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:32.630
tyranny and other Ed.

335
00:23:32.631 --> 00:23:36.790
You can take two views in effect of skepticism,

336
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.480
the one that it is in its insistence on a lack of foundation for,

337
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.670
for,
for opinion,
uh,
a kind of of,

338
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.680
of passive acquiescence in whatever rises up in its face.

339
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.630
And on the other hand,
you can argue that without skepticism,

340
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.980
everybody is vulnerable to excessive commitment to opinion,

341
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:06.010
which is precisely the thing that skepticism is supposed to resist.

342
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.850
Now,
uh,

343
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.620
this isn't the first time in this course that I've paused over,
uh,

344
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:17.210
a moment at a crossroads where you can't possibly take both paths,

345
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.740
but where it is obviously very,
very different,

346
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.920
difficult to make up one's mind and it may indeed be a matter more than one can

347
00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:33.110
say or care to admit.
It may ultimately be a matter of temperament,

348
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.790
which path one chooses to take.
All right?
Now,

349
00:24:37.791 --> 00:24:41.870
in any case,
uh,
while we're on the subject of deconstruction in general,

350
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:46.820
and before we get into demand,
let me adjust a,
that there is one other way,

351
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:50.450
if I may not to criticize deconstruction.

352
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.200
It's always supposed popularly that deconstruction denies the existence of any

353
00:24:56.691 --> 00:24:59.720
reality outside a text.

354
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.670
Derrida famously notoriously said there is nothing outside of the text.

355
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.430
All right?
What he meant by that of course,

356
00:25:07.431 --> 00:25:12.431
is that there is nothing but text that is to say I the entire tissue and

357
00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:16.790
structure and nature of our lives,
including history,

358
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:18.170
which we know textually,

359
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:19.890
<v 2>okay,</v>

360
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.810
<v 0>is all there is.
Our lives are textual lives.
That's what he meant.</v>

361
00:25:24.811 --> 00:25:28.020
He didn't mean to say the text is here and the text contains everything that

362
00:25:28.021 --> 00:25:29.970
matters and nothing else exists anyway.

363
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.940
<v 2>Okay.</v>

364
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.410
<v 0>When he meant to say is that there is nothing but text in the sense that</v>

365
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:41.000
absolutely everything we ordinarily take to be just our kind of spontaneously

366
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:45.770
lived existence is in fact mediated in the ways we've already discussed at

367
00:25:45.771 --> 00:25:46.760
length in this course.

368
00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:51.761
And we'll discuss more by our knowledge and that our knowledge is textual.

369
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.770
All right?
That's,
that's what he meant.
But as I say,

370
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:59.480
it's widely misunderstood and Demonn,
uh,
in the,
um,
in,

371
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:02.450
in the fourth passage on your sheet,
um,

372
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.720
returns to the attack against this popular supposition and says

373
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.360
in genuine semiology as well as in other linguistically oriented theories,

374
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.820
the referential funk and notice the citation of Yacob sin here the referential

375
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:24.530
function of language is not being denied far from it.
In other words,

376
00:26:24.531 --> 00:26:28.640
this stuff out there,
you know,
we're,
you know,
we're with,
it's not a question of,

377
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:33.820
of the idealist who was refuted by Dr. Johnson who kicked a stone and leaked

378
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:36.320
away in terrible pain saying,
I refuted.

379
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.580
Thus nobody denies the existence of the stone.
All right?

380
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:45.360
It's not that that is not at all the the case.
You know,

381
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.450
reality is their reality is what it is and the referential function is

382
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:57.081
perpetually in play in language trying to hook on to that reality.

383
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.800
The referential function of language is not being denied far from it.

384
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.220
What is in question is its authority for natural or phenomenal cognition.

385
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:09.840
That is to say,

386
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.050
can we know what things are not that things are,

387
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:20.370
but what things are using the instrument of language.

388
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:26.690
The mine goes on to say very challengingly what we call ideology is precisely

389
00:27:27.451 --> 00:27:32.451
the confusion of linguistic with natural reality of reference with phenomenal

390
00:27:34.281 --> 00:27:36.660
realism.
In other words,

391
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.920
idealized ideology is nothing other than the belief that language my language,

392
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:46.560
what I say and what I think in language speaks true.

393
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.190
That is,
that's the position taken up.

394
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:55.490
Not at all the same thing as the saying as as saying what's out there doesn't

395
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:58.290
exist.
Nothing to do with that.

396
00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.260
All right now demands early career was influenced primary and I'm not speaking

397
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:11.010
of the very early career in which he wrote these articles,
but the early career,

398
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.540
uh,
involving the essays which were collected,
collected in his first book,

399
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.680
blindness and insight,

400
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.450
his early career as mainly influenced by French intellectual Islam in
particular,

401
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.250
John John Paul sock was being in time,
uh,
being and nothingness,
sorry.

402
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.570
And uh,

403
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.600
and the arguments of blindness and insight is largely a to be understood,

404
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.560
not so much in terms of demands later preoccupations with linguistics,

405
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:45.070
as with the negotiation of Psychiatry and existentialism,
uh,

406
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.900
into a kind of literary theory,
uh,

407
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:53.070
and the texts,
particularly the texts called criticism and crisis.

408
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:58.071
The first one that I quote on your sheet can best be read in those terms,

409
00:28:58.321 --> 00:29:02.910
but soon enough,
um,
demand did,
uh,
uh,
uh,

410
00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:08.060
accept and embrace the influence of so sir in linguistics and structuralism and

411
00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:12.780
his vocabulary,
hence,
hence forth,
took these forms.

412
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.960
The vocabulary that we have to wrestle with for today's essay is taken in part

413
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:22.830
from Yaka person's understanding of the relationship between metaphor and

414
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:27.690
metonymy.
And we will have,
we will have more to say about that.
Um,

415
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.730
but in the meantime,
uh,

416
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:34.710
it's probably on this occasion once we accept them both as having come under the

417
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:38.790
influence of the same form of linguistic thinking,
uh,

418
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.820
to say a little bit about the similarities and differences that exist between

419
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.800
Derrida and demand.
Now similarly,

420
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.860
they both take for granted that it is very difficult to think about beginnings,

421
00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.200
but at the same time one has to have some way,

422
00:29:59.201 --> 00:30:04.201
some Prodo structuralist way of understanding that before a certain moment.

423
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.340
That is to say before us a certain synchronic cross section.
Uh,

424
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.810
things were different from the way they were in some successive moment.

425
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:17.830
And so in the second passage on your sheet to which I'll return,
in the end,

426
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.950
we find demand saying literary theory can be said to come into being when that

427
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.910
is demands version of the event.

428
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.020
Literary theory can be said to come into being when,

429
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.340
and he agrees with Derrida and saying,
well,
sure,
you know,

430
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.210
God came into being,
man came into being,
consciousness came into being.

431
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.960
That's all very well,
but they're just head signifiers in metaphysics.

432
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:47.220
There's something different about language.
All right?

433
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:52.770
And what both Derrida and demand say about the difference when one thinks of

434
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:55.870
language coming into being,

435
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.380
from thinking about all those other things coming into being,

436
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:04.660
as the language does not purport to stand outside of itself.

437
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.480
They cannot stand outside of itself.

438
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:10.420
It cannot constitute itself.

439
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:15.570
It is perpetually caught up in it's own systematic nature so that it's a center.

440
00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.450
Uh,
and we have to resist,
uh,

441
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.230
excessive commitment to this idea of it being a center.

442
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.380
But it is at least not a center which somehow stands outside of itself.

443
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.100
And is a setter only in the sense that it has some remote,
hidden,

444
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.930
impersonal,
distant.

445
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.020
Because language is caught up in itself in a way that all of these other moments

446
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.410
were not.
So.

447
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.500
And then also I think that you can see the similarity there to Derrida and

448
00:31:49.781 --> 00:31:51.310
demands way insisting,

449
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.420
insisting on these binary relations,
uh,

450
00:31:55.421 --> 00:32:00.421
as interdependent and mutual comparable to the sort of thing that I've been

451
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:04.930
talking about.
In Derrida,
take eight 91 92,
for example,

452
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.850
bottom of very bottom of h 98,
91 over to eight 92,

453
00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:18.530
man says it is easy enough to see that the apparent glorification of the critic,

454
00:32:18.701 --> 00:32:23.701
philosopher and the name of truth is in fact a glorification of the poet as the

455
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:28.940
primary source of this truth.
Now,
he does not mean,
uh,

456
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.200
as Freud for example,
met men in saying,
ah,

457
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.980
the poet's came before me in the poets knew everything I knew before I knew it.

458
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.990
He does not mean that at all what he means,

459
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.480
what he says in the following clauses.

460
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:47.050
If truth is the recognition of the systematic character of a certain kind of

461
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.583
error,

462
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.630
then it would be fully dependent on the prior existence of this error.

463
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:56.510
In other words,
truth arises out of error.

464
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:59.960
Error is not a deviance from truth.
Alright?

465
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:05.300
Error is not a poetic elaboration on things which somehow,

466
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.900
uh,

467
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:10.900
as it does in Plato's view undermines the integrity of that truth identified by

468
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:12.350
philosophers.

469
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:18.070
On the contrary philosophy properly understood is what comes into being when one

470
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:24.311
has achieved full recognition of a preexisting error.

471
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.660
And that is,
uh,

472
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.970
the way in which demonn wants to think about the relationship between precisely

473
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:36.230
between literature and other forms of speech.
And in saying that,

474
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.460
I want to move immediately to the differences with Derrida.

475
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.410
Derrida,
as I said,

476
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.470
beliefs in a kind of seamless web of discourse or discursivity we are awash in

477
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:52.520
discourse.
Yes,

478
00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:57.521
we can provisionally or heuristically speak of one form of discourse as opposed

479
00:33:58.101 --> 00:34:02.300
to another literature,
law,
theology,

480
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.800
science and so on.

481
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:09.220
But it is all easily undermined and demystified as something that has real

482
00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:14.750
independent integrity.
Demand does not believe this.

483
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:17.240
Demand thinks on the contrary,

484
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.280
that there is such a thing as literariness.

485
00:34:22.281 --> 00:34:27.281
He follows [inaudible] much more consistently in this regard.

486
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.820
Then Derrida does and he says again and again,

487
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.260
he says that the,
um,
that,
that,
uh,

488
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:41.290
the important thing is to insist on the difference between literature and other

489
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:48.380
forms of discourse.
He says also,
uh,
and,

490
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:52.610
and there are all kinds of passages I could,
I could elicit in support of this.

491
00:34:52.611 --> 00:34:55.640
Let me just quickly read a few.
Page 83,

492
00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.200
page eight,
83,
uh,
about two thirds of the way down the left hand column,

493
00:35:06.201 --> 00:35:07.400
he says,
uh,

494
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.210
where he's talking about the [inaudible] sounding very much like a Russian

495
00:35:11.211 --> 00:35:13.040
formalists talking about the,

496
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:18.070
the what literature in particular has exclusively that other forms of discourse

497
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:22.370
don't have.
He says,
literature cannot merely be conceived,

498
00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.060
be received as a definite unit of referential,

499
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:29.330
meaning that can be decoded without leaving a residue.

500
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.230
The code is unusually conspicuous,
complex and attic matic.

501
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.500
It attracts an inordinate amount of attention to itself and this has to acquire

502
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:39.900
the rigor of a method.

503
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:45.170
The structural moment of concentration on the code for its own sake cannot be

504
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:49.140
avoided.
And literature necessarily breeds its own formalism.

505
00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:50.610
And the interest of time.

506
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.900
I'm going to skip over a few other passages that I was going to read to you.

507
00:35:55.020 --> 00:36:00.020
In reinforcement of this insistent on insistence on demands part that literature

508
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.970
differs from other forms of discourse.

509
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.350
The remaining question being literature differs from other forms of discourse.

510
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.380
How well is that disclosure of error that other forms of discourse supposing

511
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:21.321
themselves to refer to things remain on aware of literature knows itself to be

512
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:25.824
fictive.

513
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:31.070
Ultimately we reached the conclusion that if we're to think of literature where

514
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:35.010
to think of something that is made up,

515
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.870
not something that is based on something but something that is made up in the

516
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:40.800
first passage.

517
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.390
The statement about language by criticism that sign and meaning can never

518
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:48.870
coincide is what is precisely taken for granted.

519
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:53.400
In the kind of language we call literary literature.

520
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.590
Unlike everyday language begins on the far side of this knowledge,

521
00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.910
it is the only form of knowledge free from the fallacy of unmediated expression.

522
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:09.630
In other words,
free from the fallacy that when I say it is raining,

523
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:14.810
I mean I'm a meteorologist and I mean it is raining literature.

524
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.110
When it says it is raining,
is not looking out the window.

525
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.400
I mean you know this is,
this is after all perfectly true it.
The author of,

526
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:24.750
I have been looking out of the window,

527
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.160
but literature as we and counter it as a text is not looking out the window.

528
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:35.850
How can a techs look out of the window when literature says it is raining,

529
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.350
it's got something else as one might say.
In view,

530
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.780
all of us demand continues.

531
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.080
No this although we know it and the misleading way of a wishful assertion of the

532
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:49.134
opposite.

533
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:54.140
Yet the truth emerges in the fore knowledge we possess of the true nature of

534
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:58.500
literature when we refer to it as fiction,

535
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:03.780
and this is why in the last passage on your sheet from the interview with Stefan

536
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:08.790
orso demand is willing to venture on a categorical distinction between his own

537
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:16.200
work and that of his very close friend Jacques Derrida.
He says,

538
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.680
I have attended a tendency to put upon texts and inherent and he means literary

539
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:27.510
texts.
I have a tendency to put upon texts and inherent authority,

540
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:29.430
which is stronger,
I think,

541
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.570
than Derrida is willing to put on them in a complicated way.

542
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.840
I would hope to the statement that the text deconstructs itself,

543
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.690
in other words,
literature is the perpetual denial of its referentiality.

544
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:49.590
The text deconstructs itself is self deconstructive rather than being

545
00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:54.810
deconstructed by a philosophical intervention that which Jacques Derrida.

546
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:59.560
Dot.
Does.
That is to say Jacques Derrida bringing his,
uh,

547
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.680
his sort of delicate sledge hammer down on every conceivable form of utterance

548
00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.430
from the outside,
right.

549
00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.600
Rather than being deconstructed by a philosophical intervention from outside the

550
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.010
text.
So those,

551
00:39:15.011 --> 00:39:20.011
some remarks then on the differences and the similarities between,

552
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.850
uh,
between,
uh,
demand and Derrida.
Now,

553
00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.880
semiology in rhetoric historically comes near the end of the period that

554
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:36.940
structure sign and play inaugurate.
It's,
that is to say it is published,
uh,

555
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:41.920
in allegories of reading.
It is a text,
uh,
which we can,

556
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:45.910
which,
which we can date from the early 1980s.
Well,

557
00:39:45.911 --> 00:39:50.620
it was published originally as an article 17,
1979.
Um,

558
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:55.660
but this is also near the end of a period of flourishing that dairy does.

559
00:39:55.661 --> 00:40:00.520
Essay.
Uh,
inaugurate a and other things have begun,

560
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:04.630
uh,
to become crucial even before the death of demand.

561
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.880
And the revelations about his past,

562
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.150
there were a lot of people sort of shaking their fists and saying,

563
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:13.300
what about history?
What about reality?
You know,

564
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.030
I've already suggested that in a variety of ways.

565
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.460
This is a response that can be naive,

566
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.420
but it is still very much in the air.
Um,

567
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.730
and demand says,
uh,

568
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:29.320
in this atmosphere of response at the top of page 83,

569
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.000
the left hand column,
he says,

570
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:36.180
we speak as if with the problems of literary form resolved once and forever,

571
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:41.590
and with techniques of structural analysis refined to near perfection,

572
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.860
we could now move beyond formalism toward the questions that really interest us

573
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:48.550
and reap at last,

574
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:53.640
the fruits of the aesthetic concentration on techniques that prepared us for

575
00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.960
this decisive step.
Obviously,

576
00:40:55.961 --> 00:41:00.961
I think by this time you can realize what he's saying is if we make this move,

577
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.610
if we move beyond formalism,

578
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.650
we have forgotten the cardinal rule of the Russian formalists,
namely,

579
00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:11.800
that there is no distinction between form and content.
In other words,

580
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:16.890
that we in effect cat move beyond formalism and that it is simply a procedurally

581
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.280
mistaken notion that we can,
and that's,
uh,

582
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.690
the position of course pursued in,
in this essay,

583
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.960
the task of the asset is to deny the complimentarity,

584
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:36.390
the mutual reinforcement even and rigorous rhetorical analysis like that of

585
00:41:37.451 --> 00:41:40.550
Gerage Janette told her off backed and others,

586
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:45.580
all of whom he says have regressed from the rigor of Yacob sin to deny that in

587
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:48.890
rhetorical analysis,

588
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:54.430
rhetorical and grammatical aspects of discourse can be considered collusive or

589
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.990
continuous or cooperative with each other.
Now,

590
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:04.850
I've already suggested the problems are which that our eyes when you consider

591
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.020
this term,
even in and of itself,

592
00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:14.050
I'm actually a ripping off by the way.
An Essay,
uh,
about,

593
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.520
uh,
of Jacques Derrida was called,
uh,
called,
called,

594
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.490
called.
Oh.

595
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:28.670
Anyway,
it's that essay and,
and,
and,
and now you'll never know my source.

596
00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.850
Uh,
and in any case,
uh,

597
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.800
the dairy dot two in,
in this essay,
uh,

598
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.910
which is called,
which is called,
uh,
is at,

599
00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:45.530
is at pains to argue that you can't reduce grammar to rhetoric or rhetoric to

600
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:50.150
grammar.
Um,
and so as we think about these things,
as I suggest,

601
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:54.920
we've already introduced what Demonn,
uh,
drives home to us.
He says,
boy,

602
00:42:54.921 --> 00:42:58.010
this is complicated theory.
Uh,
I'm in over my head,

603
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:01.520
so I better just get practical and give you some examples of what I mean.

604
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.930
And so he takes up,
uh,
all,
all in the family,

605
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:14.030
Archie and Edith,
what was the name of that show all in the family?
Uh,

606
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.020
Andrew talks about the moment in which Archie becomes exasperated,
uh,

607
00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:21.500
when Edith begins to tell him that the difference,

608
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:26.590
the difference between a bowling shoes laced over and bowling shoes laced under

609
00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:32.060
this end.
Response to Archie's question,
what's the difference?

610
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.710
In other words,
Archie has asked a rhetorical question.

611
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:41.090
I don't care what the differences is.
The meaning of the rhetorical question.

612
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:46.400
Itas a reader of sublime simplicity as demand says,

613
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.720
Edith misinterprets the rhetorical question as a grammatical question.

614
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.510
What is the difference?
I'm curious to know,

615
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:58.430
and then proceeds to explain that there's lacing over on the one hand and lacing

616
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.070
under.
On the other hand,
Archie of course,

617
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.550
can't stand this because for him it's perfectly clear that a rhetorical question

618
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:13.670
as a rhetorical question demands point is a question is both rhetorical and

619
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:17.750
grammatical and the one cannot be reduced to the other.

620
00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:22.010
Both readings are available.
He complicates without changing the argument.

621
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.850
By then referring to yeats's poem among school children,

622
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.840
which culminates,
you remember,
it has a whole series of metaphors,
uh,

623
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:35.080
of attempting seeming at least to attempt the synthesis of,

624
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:38.580
of,
of,
of opposites concluding.

625
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.460
How can we tell the dancer from the dance?

626
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.800
Another question right now,

627
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:48.801
the rhetorical question completes the usual reading of the poem.

628
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.630
The answer to the rhetorical question is we can't tell the difference between

629
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:56.250
the dancer and the dance.

630
00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:01.460
They are unified in a synthetic symbolizing symbolic moment that constitutes the

631
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.580
work of art.
And so,

632
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:10.581
and all the preceding Matt metaphors lead up to this triumphant sense of unity,

633
00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:15.660
of symbolic unity as the essence of the work of art.
A unity,

634
00:45:15.661 --> 00:45:20.550
which by the way entails among other things,
the unity of author and text,
right?

635
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.640
The unity of agent and production,

636
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.690
the unit of all of those things,
which,
uh,

637
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.810
as we've seen much literary theory is interested in collapsing.

638
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.140
How can we tell the dancer from the dance?
Well,
the man says,

639
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.960
wait a minute though.
This is also a grammatical question.

640
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:41.340
And if you stop and think of it as a grammatical question,
you say to yourself,

641
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:45.780
Gee,
that's a very good question,
isn't it?
Because of course,
you know,

642
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:50.290
the easiest thing in the world is to tell the dancer from the dance,
you know,

643
00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.340
I am the dancer and this is the dance I'm doing.
And,
and,

644
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.960
and obviously they're not the same thing,
right?
I mean,

645
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:01.710
what nonsense poetry speaks,
you know what I mean?
It's particularly ridiculous.

646
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.870
You know there are,

647
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.880
there is also a grammatical sense which won't go away just because your rigorous

648
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:14.490
sort of symbolic interpretation insists that it should go away.
All right.

649
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:19.070
And then demand who happens to be a gate scholar,
his,
his,
his eight,

650
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.790
he published a dissertation on Yates and really knows his Yates starts at

651
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:28.791
deucing examples from all over the canon of Yates to the effect that to the

652
00:46:29.431 --> 00:46:30.790
effect that um,

653
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:36.260
Yates is perfectly knowing and self conscious about these grammatical

654
00:46:36.541 --> 00:46:37.350
differences.

655
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:42.350
That there is a measure of irony in the poem that saves it from this sort of

656
00:46:44.821 --> 00:46:49.821
symbolizing mystification and he makes a perfectly plausible argument to the

657
00:46:50.761 --> 00:46:54.900
effect that the question is grammatical rather than rhetorical.

658
00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.260
He's not claiming and he,
and he points this out to us,

659
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.130
he's not claiming that his explication is the true one.

660
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.170
It's not as point at all.

661
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:09.500
He's glamming only that it is available and can be adduced from what we call

662
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:16.050
evidence in the same way that the symbolic interpretation based on the

663
00:47:16.051 --> 00:47:21.051
rhetorical question is available and can be adduced from evidence and that these

664
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:24.180
two viewpoints are irreducible.

665
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.130
They cannot be reconciled as traditional.

666
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.720
So the relationship between rhetoric and grammar in studying,
uh,

667
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.780
the rhetorical and grammatical effects of literature take for granted.

668
00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.380
That's his argument.
He's,

669
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:44.400
it's a kind of infighting because he's talking to people who are actually very

670
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:46.900
close allies.
He's saying they're doing great work,

671
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:48.760
but they forget this one little thing.

672
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:53.230
You cannot reconcile rhetoric and grammar.

673
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.090
Every sentence has a predication.
And if every sentence has a predication,

674
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:03.120
it also has the structure of a metaphor and the metaphor in a sentence and the

675
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:08.680
predication in a sentence are always going to be at odds.

676
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.250
A metaphor is what we call a poetic lie.

677
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.770
Everybody knows a is not B.

678
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.860
A predication on the other hand usually goes forward in the service of

679
00:48:20.861 --> 00:48:24.740
referentiality.
It's a truth claim of some kind,
right?

680
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.770
But if rhetoric and grammatic Galtee coexist in any sentence,

681
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:34.960
the sentence is truth claim and it's lie are perpetually at odds with each

682
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:38.230
other.
And just taking the sentence as a sentence,

683
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:43.780
irrespective of any kind of inference we might make about intentions.
I mean,

684
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:48.220
we know perfectly well what Edith in tens and what Archie bunker and tens,

685
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:51.580
it's not as if we're confused about the meaning of what they're saying.

686
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:55.060
It's just that other meanings are available.

687
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:57.100
And since they're not on the same page,

688
00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:02.050
those two other meanings co-exist painfully and irreducibly at odds.

689
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.330
Right?
But there are cases,

690
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:09.540
suppose Archie bunker where RK debunker suppose Archie bunker where Jacques

691
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.260
Derrida and Jacques Derrida came along and said,
let's,
is it different halls?

692
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.250
Right.
That would be,
that would be an entirely different matter.

693
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:25.630
Wouldn't cause you would have absolutely no idea whether the question was

694
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:29.020
rhetorical or grammatical right there.
It wouldn't be there.

695
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:34.050
It wouldn't be possible to invoke an intention because the whole complication of

696
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:38.020
Derrida is precisely to the raise the question about not knowing,

697
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:43.021
not being able to voice the difference between difference in Dfl Hos and uh,

698
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:43.991
and,

699
00:49:43.991 --> 00:49:48.991
and not knowing whether Archie is right or whether Edith is right Proust.

700
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:53.380
I don't have time for it,
but I will,
but it's,

701
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:58.030
but it's a marvelous reading of,
of a,
of,
of the,
that wonderful passage,

702
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:02.680
uh,
in which,
um,
remember that he's set it up at the beginning of the essay,

703
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:05.140
whether with a kind of wonderful cunning,
that,

704
00:50:05.141 --> 00:50:10.090
a sense of structure by talking about the grandmother and Proust who's always

705
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:14.770
driving Marcel out into the garden because she can't stand the interiority of

706
00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:15.940
his reading.
Well,

707
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:21.060
then later on in the essay demand quotes this wonderful passage in which mock

708
00:50:21.221 --> 00:50:26.221
sell talks about the way in which he brought the inside what brought the outside

709
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:31.160
inside as he was perpetually conscious of everything that was going on out there

710
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:33.170
during the process of his reading.

711
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.280
So that ultimately in the charmed moment of his rating,

712
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:40.760
there was no difference between inside and outside.
In other words,
a metaphor,

713
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:42.990
a metaphor,
uh,

714
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:48.070
a rhetorical understanding of the relationship between inside and outside has

715
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:49.064
been accomplished.

716
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:54.130
But then grammatical analysis shows that the whole structure of the passage is

717
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.340
additive.
That is,
is,
is put,
is adding things on,

718
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:03.520
is complicating and reinforcing an argument without insisting on the,

719
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:06.700
on,
on identity,
on the underlying,
uh,

720
00:51:06.701 --> 00:51:11.360
identity on which metaphor depends.
And so he calls this met anemic.

721
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:14.630
By the way,
I'm going to leave also to your access to your sections,

722
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.770
the strange confusion that ensues on taking,
uh,

723
00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.840
in taking a rhetorical device Mytonomy and making it synonymous with grammar on

724
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:29.300
the access of combination.
I leave that to your sections,
but in the meantime,

725
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.230
he says,
no,
no,
no.
Then I guess this passage isn't rhetorical after all,

726
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:37.570
it must be mad an Ivig,
but wait,
it is spoken by a voice there.

727
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:42.230
This wonderful overarching voice that unifies everything.
After all,

728
00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:46.880
this is what I call says,
demand the rhetoric's ization of grammar.
Right?

729
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:50.810
But wait,
but wait,
that voice is not the author.

730
00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:55.100
That voice is a speaker.
That voices box cell,
uh,
you know,

731
00:51:55.101 --> 00:51:59.870
performing his wonderful,
uh,
sort of metaphoric magic.
Uh,

732
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:04.900
but we know that the author is painstakingly putting this together in the most

733
00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:08.930
low,
boring,
laborious,
kind of composed way,
uh,

734
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:14.000
making something up in a,
in an additive way.
That's not rhetorical.

735
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:15.170
It all,
its grammatical.

736
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:20.000
This is a supreme writer putting together long sentences.
And so,

737
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:24.170
wait a minute.
It must be after all the grammatic cessation of rhetoric,

738
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.320
the whole point of which is that the worm of interpretation keeps turning right.

739
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:35.260
It doesn't arbitrarily stop anywhere because rhetoric and grammar remain

740
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.860
irreducible.

741
00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:41.861
We have to keep thinking of them as being uncooperative with each other.

742
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:46.730

743
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.860
I'm afraid with a certain awkwardness.

744
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:53.420
I wish there were an interview Vini weekend to Freud and Peter Brooks,

745
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:56.660
but in the meantime,
we'll see you then.
