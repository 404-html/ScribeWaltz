1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.770
Last time I lectured under the illusion that all you had been assigned for,

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
I really should get in the habit of looking at the syllabus that all your,

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.440
all you had been assigned for Thursday's lecture was the,
so sir,

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.630
uh,
Lo and behold,

5
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:22.470
I did take a glance at the syllabus over the weekend and realize that you'd also

6
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.750
been assigned to Levy Strauss.
Uh,

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:29.540
so we have a little bit of ground to cover today.
I think we can do it.
Uh,

8
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.140
I think I want to reserve,
um,

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.460
something like a critique of structuralism for the beginning of Thursday's

10
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.561
lecture because it segues very nicely into what we'll have to say about Derrida.

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.150
I already promised that somehow or another,

12
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.260
the creek critique of structuralism just was deconstruction.
Uh,

13
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.500
and I hope to be able to demonstrate that on Thursday.

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.650
But I do want to get up to the point of launching a critique of structuralism on

15
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.750
two or three,
uh,
grounds.
Uh,

16
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.950
and so I hope to be able to move along fairly quickly today.

17
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.580
Uh,
now,
uh,
another thing that got left out,

18
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.310
even given the proviso that it was only about,
so sir on Thursday,
uh,

19
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:18.260
was an adequate account of the relationship between synchrony and [inaudible].

20
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.650
Uh,
and the pivotal importance of this concept for,
uh,

21
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.680
not only for semiotics but for its aftermath in structuralism and also for its

22
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.450
relation to the Russian formulas.

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.420
Because you remember that in talking about function,

24
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.000
the formalist who began,

25
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:41.001
who undertook to think about literary history and the problems of literary

26
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.790
historiography,
we're very much engaged,
um,

27
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.150
in the notion that a function in a given text could be understood in two

28
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:54.720
different ways.
There was the sin function,

29
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.430
which was the relationship between that function and all the other functions in

30
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:03.810
the text.
In other words,
viewed as an aspect of that text.

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.850
But there was also of the same function.
It's auto function,

32
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.150
which is the way in which it presents and recurs throughout the history of

33
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:17.550
literature.
Sometimes as the dominant,

34
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.460
sometimes latent or recessive,

35
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.780
but always in one form or another there now.

36
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.580
And so it's there in linguistics.

37
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The relationship between synchrony and I acronym is very much the same to

38
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:37.051
consider language in toto is to consider it at a given moment.

39
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.700
Sin Chronically.

40
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:46.701
That is to say you don't think of language as a system if at the same time

41
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.400
you're thinking of it unfolding historically.

42
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.700
Now Jakobsen you will notice introduces an element of time into this in chronic

43
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.910
analysis of a semiotic system by saying that you've got to take account both of

44
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:05.650
our Keck and innovative features,

45
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.160
but nevertheless they are simply flagged as archaic or innovative and not

46
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.891
understood as changing in time as long as they are read or analyzed in

47
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:20.410
chronically.
But at the same token,

48
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.010
a system does change through time,

49
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.690
a semiotic system language,
the history of literature,

50
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.300
the history of poetics,
whatever it might be,

51
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.950
changes through time and to analyze that changed through time.

52
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.730
You think of it dire chronically now.

53
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:44.731
So Sarah argues that the relationship among the parts of something viewed sin

54
00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:49.030
chronically a semiotic system,

55
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:54.031
let's say are not necessary and the sense they might be any number of other

56
00:03:54.551 --> 00:03:57.700
relationships,
but they are nevertheless fixed.

57
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.900
That is to say there what's there,
they can't be other than what they are.

58
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.590
Whereas through time studying a semiotic system or studying language or whatever

59
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.760
it might be,
change takes place and it's necessary.

60
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:17.560
You're looking back on it and it simply did happen and so changes determinant in

61
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.920
some stance but at the same time it's not regular.

62
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.420
This by the way is a challenge to certain ideas in traditional linguistics.

63
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.080
Like for example,
the one you probably all know the great vol shift,

64
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.720
they a structuralist view of language has to argue that the great,

65
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.020
great vol shifted,
which every vowel sound goes up a notch,
uh,

66
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
in the some mysterious period between the medieval in the early modern,

67
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.040
uh,
that this only has the appearance of regularity.
Ah,

68
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.060
but that it is actually,
uh,

69
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.920
a diachronic phenomenon that can't be understood,
uh,

70
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.020
in terms of regularity.

71
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.190
So the relationship between synchronic chronic and diachronic is of that kind.

72
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.520
Now matters are complicated a little bit on those occasions in your reading when

73
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:10.921
people are talking about the way in which a mass of material,

74
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.930
a system of language or other semiotics system,

75
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:21.400
let's say is inferred from existing data.

76
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.953
In other words,

77
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.110
the way in which I infer language long from sentences poll from us sentence

78
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.730
barrel.
Uh,
I'm actually concealing from you that in fact,

79
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:39.120
so sewer uses a third term long gosh to talk about the sum of all sentences.

80
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.610
We won't get into that.
Uh,

81
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.710
the way in which language is inferred from patrol.

82
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.800
Now language in other words is viewed as something in space that is to say,

83
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.350
or as Levy Strauss calls it,
a revertible time.

84
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:55.690
Meaning you can go backward and forward within it,

85
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:59.090
but the temporal unfolding is not the important thing about it.

86
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.220
So in space,
whereas parole speech unfolds in time.

87
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.760
So that power all because it is temporal,

88
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:11.720
because any speech any of us makes is in a certain sense.

89
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.721
Historical at the beginning of the sentence is earlier in history.

90
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:19.100
Then the end of the sentence for that reason,

91
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:23.910
there's a relationship between Dayak honey and the unfolding of Powell,

92
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.690
or of a sentence or of an utterance.
Um,

93
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.080
which is a parallel though at the same time,

94
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:35.081
admittedly confusing one doesn't really want to talk about a sentence as

95
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.790
diachronic,
but at the same time,

96
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:41.240
it does exist on that horizontal axis,

97
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.550
enrich things in a combinatory way unfold in time.

98
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.160
All right,
so,
so much then,
uh,

99
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.640
for synchrony and I acronym is something that we can't get away from.
It's,
it's,

100
00:06:53.641 --> 00:06:57.680
it's,
it's in a way the central fact of structuralism,
uh,

101
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.600
but which I don't think I did adequate justice justice too at the end of the

102
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.150
last lecture.
All right.
Now structuralism

103
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.830
there was an incredible aura about structuralism in the 1960s.

104
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.880
It crashed on the shores of the United States coming in from France.

105
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.060
Uh,
in a way that stunned,
amazed,

106
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.930
transformed people's lives.
Uh,
people,
uh,

107
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.790
like caught reading Hume woke up from their dogmatic slumbers or they,

108
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.840
or at least that they felt that that's what they were doing when encountering

109
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:35.090
structuralism.
Uh,
and I mean,

110
00:07:35.091 --> 00:07:38.600
to me it happened when I was a graduate student at Harvard and absolutely nobody

111
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:42.410
else was paying any attention to it at all at Yale and Johns Hopkins and Cornell

112
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:46.070
and some other people,
they were paying attention to it.
But at Harvard,

113
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.480
I was initiated to structuralism by a bright undergraduate who seemed to be the

114
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:51.210
only,

115
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.400
the only person in Cambridge who knew anything about structuralism in board did

116
00:07:55.401 --> 00:08:00.401
he know about structuralism and got me up to speed as quickly as as he could.

117
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.190
But it was a phenomenon,
uh,

118
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.040
that was transformative intellectually for people,
uh,

119
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.500
in the academic and beyond the academic world all over the country.

120
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.210
And of course,
it led to,

121
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.270
in all sorts of ways to most of what's been going on in theory ever since.

122
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:24.521
The amazing thing about it is that as a flourishing and undisputed French

123
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.270
contribution to literary theory,
it lasted two years,
uh,

124
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.730
because in 1966 at a famous conference,

125
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.680
Jacques Derrida who will be reading,
uh,
on Thursday blew it out of the water.

126
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.170
Um,
but at the same time,
um,
and I'll come back to that,
uh,

127
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.530
at the same time that is,
uh,

128
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.450
I mean to say that it really only lasted two years,
simply isn't fair.

129
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.580
The lasting contribution of structuralism,
uh,
as it's indebted to semiotics,

130
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.470
but on its own terms at well,

131
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.680
it something one still feels and senses,
uh,

132
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.770
throughout literary theory and the concrete contributions.
Um,

133
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.390
not all,
uh,

134
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.940
between 1964 when the first structure was texts were translated in this country

135
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:13.710
in 1966 when the conference in Baltimore,
uh,
took place.
Um,

136
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.880
but the lasting concrete contributions are also terribly important.

137
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:21.750
There's a wonderful book called Andris on Racine by rolling back.

138
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.280
Those of you interested in French neoclassical theater cannot imagine,
uh,

139
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:30.330
if you haven't read it already recently reading a more bracing book,

140
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.120
there is a,

141
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.080
an essay on a Sonnet abode layer Laisha the cats,
uh,

142
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.670
by written conjointly by Levy Strauss and Jaco Epson,
uh,

143
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.390
an extraordinary performance,

144
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:46.620
which was the model of a good deal else that was done in the academy during that

145
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:50.310
period.
The anthropologist,
Edmund Leash leak,

146
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.220
wrote a structuralist analysis of genesis in the Bible and indeed it's no

147
00:09:55.221 --> 00:10:00.221
accident that he writes about genesis as I will indicate in a minute and then

148
00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:04.730
subsequently,
um,
and,
uh,
and in addition to all of that,

149
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:08.610
probably the most lasting and rich contributions of the structuralist.

150
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.690
We're in the field,
uh,
that we know as narrow tology.

151
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.900
We'll be taking a look at that when we read.
Uh,

152
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.770
Peter Brooks is taxed and compete in conjunction with Freud a couple of weeks

153
00:10:18.771 --> 00:10:21.120
from now.
But in the meantime,
uh,

154
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.580
the key text and neurotology again by role are embarked a long,

155
00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:30.581
long essay called the structural analysis of narrative in which he approaches a

156
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.520
James Bond novel as a system system of binary pairs,
uh,

157
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.390
and uh,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,

158
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.680
and unpacks a deep structure,
uh,
and the novel,
uh,

159
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.980
as a result of this,
uh,
of this,
of this binary analysis,
uh,

160
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.490
important books by its fate on toter off,
uh,
crucial among them,
uh,

161
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.330
the grammar of the Decameron,
uh,

162
00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.420
and then a great deal of work published in a series of books called figure by

163
00:11:00.851 --> 00:11:04.050
genre.
Jeanette,
whom you will find quoted,
uh,

164
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.740
repeatedly in the work of Paul demand that you'll be reading for,
uh,
for next,

165
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.120
uh,
Tuesday.
Uh,
and all of this work,
uh,

166
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.890
and a great deal else in the theory of narrative narrow tology,
uh,

167
00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:22.891
is directly indebted to or is actually an aspect of structuralist thought.

168
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.900
Now,
I promised that I would talk a little bit about the relationship between

169
00:11:28.901 --> 00:11:33.901
formalism and Sammy Audix as it clarifies itself in the work of a writer's like

170
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:42.210
Levy Strauss and in particular Yaka person structuralism takes from,

171
00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:46.360
as you can see from Yacob sins analysis,
uh,

172
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.210
takes from formalism.
The idea of function,
uh,
Yaka,
uh,

173
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.180
is originally of course himself,
uh,
uh,

174
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.370
a member of the school of Russian formalists,
uh,

175
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.430
eventually emigrates to Prague where he is in a circle of people who are already

176
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:07.600
calling themselves structuralists moves from there to Paris and then to the

177
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:10.930
United States.
Uh,
and so y'all,
Gibson of course,

178
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.350
is the one figure who definitely,
uh,

179
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.460
hearkens back to both worlds having been a formalist,

180
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.530
having become a structuralist.
One can see the amalgam of these,

181
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:27.850
two of these two sets of ideas in his work and his work,

182
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.530
uh,
from formal.
It's from,
from formalism.

183
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:37.210
Then you get the idea of function and the relationship between sin functioning

184
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.140
auto function,

185
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:43.141
which becomes the relationship between synchrony and Diane acronym from

186
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.260
semiotics.
You get the idea of negative knowledge.

187
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.880
That is to say that in Levy Strauss is analysis of the edifice myth,
for example,

188
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.960
the notion that there is no true version,
there's no originary version.

189
00:12:55.961 --> 00:13:00.961
There's no sort of positive version of the myth of which everything else is

190
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.713
aversion.

191
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.800
You simply know what you know as it is differentiated from the other things that

192
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:13.170
you know,
this one of the essential premises of semiotics,
uh,

193
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.810
which is essential at the same time,
uh,

194
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.940
in structuralism now unlike because here's where structuralism can be understood

195
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:27.820
as an entity in itself.
Unlike formalism,

196
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:34.020
structuralism has an ambition with respect to the object to the nature of the

197
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:36.820
object,
which is quite new.

198
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:40.520
And I think that the best way to,
uh,

199
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.640
epitomize that is to turn to an aphorism of roll on back in the essay,

200
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:50.641
the structuralist activity on page eight 71 toward the bottom of the right hand

201
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:55.651
column where back says structural man takes the real decomposes it then

202
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:00.820
recomposes it.

203
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.110
This is the moment in which you can see the radical difference between what

204
00:14:05.111 --> 00:14:07.750
structuralism is doing and what formalism is doing.

205
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:12.520
Formalism takes the object and it doesn't decompose it,

206
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.340
it sees the object as it is.

207
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.780
It just breaks it down into its respective functions,

208
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:24.700
showing them dynamically in relationship with each other.

209
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:29.740
Uh,
and as a,
as a system of dominance and subordination,

210
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.371
uh,

211
00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:35.140
all of it understood as the way in which something is made,

212
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.700
the way in which it is put together.
But there's no question of,
of,

213
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.940
of anything other than the object go goals.

214
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.870
Overcoat Covanta has don Quixote,
Sterns,
Tristram Shandy.

215
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.320
These are objects and there's no question of somehow or another creating a

216
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:55.010
virtual object,
for example,
the novel,
uh,

217
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.510
out of one's remarks about individual text.

218
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.040
In a way though.
That's what,

219
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.720
as you can see again from Levi Strauss's analysis of the Oedipus myth.

220
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.410
That's what structuralism is doing.
As Beck says,

221
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.990
structural man takes the real,

222
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.490
decomposes it then recomposes it.

223
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.290
So what he means by that is you take a bunch of variants version,

224
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.670
you take a bunch of data,
not necessarily all the data,

225
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.790
but a representative amount of the data relevant to any given idea or concept.

226
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.370
And then you say,
well what are the,
and this is where he,
he,

227
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:42.371
he gets into the idea of this is where he gets into the idea of gross

228
00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:44.270
constituent units.

229
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:49.330
What are the basic constituent units of all of these items of data?

230
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.470
Oh yeah,
I see.
We can put them into a pattern.

231
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.980
What we'll work on this a little bit in a minute.
Ah,
yeah.

232
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.310
I see how this is working.
As a matter of fact,

233
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:06.370
there is a kind of virtual object that I can begin to observe as I organize the

234
00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:15.110
data that I garner from all the individual entities are versions that,
that,

235
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:17.300
that,
that,
that fall under this umbrella.

236
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.180
And that's the recomposition

237
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.320
not of any particular object,

238
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:29.470
but of a kind of virtual object which begins to emerge from ones in analysis.

239
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.430
In the case of Levy Strauss is text the meaning of the Oedipus Smith.

240
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.460
That's the virtual object that structuralist analysis arrives at.

241
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.430
By arranging,

242
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.450
analyzing and classifying the data that it can get from all the available

243
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.670
versions of the Oedipus.

244
00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.910
So structuralism decomposes but not just for the sake of seeing how something

245
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:07.340
works,
like taking apart the parts of an engine,

246
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.610
not just to see how something works,

247
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.330
but in order to lend the parts to an analysis of a,

248
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:19.940
of,

249
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.940
of a body of materials that makes it possible to re compose all those parts in a

250
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:30.410
new virtual object.
That's what's going on in,
uh,

251
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.830
what box calls the structuralist activity.
So quickly,

252
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.260
let's take a look at the levy Strauss,
a chart,
if you ought to call it that,

253
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.610
of the Oedipus myth,

254
00:17:40.611 --> 00:17:45.611
which is on page eight 64 in your text and just say a word or two about it.

255
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.650
He takes a lot of versions.
Let's not trouble ourselves with how many,

256
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:55.080
he doesn't have nearly as many versions by the way,

257
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:59.490
as he would have if he were studying,
uh,
uh,
North American Indian myth,

258
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:01.590
uh,
uh,
or a,

259
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.640
or the sorts of myths that he did study in a variety of versions as an

260
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:10.230
anthropologist.
But he has some versions.
One of them,
by the way,
Freud's version,

261
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.020
uh,
one of them Sophocles version,
uh,

262
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.100
and a variety of versions,
uh,
besides those.

263
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.840
And he says,
hmm,
you know,
as you look at these various versions,

264
00:18:21.841 --> 00:18:26.841
you can see that certain things are basically happening and they fall into

265
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:31.620
certain discreet categories.
We can put them in columns.

266
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.920
That is to say in terms of the way in which they share a common theme,

267
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:43.890
but we can also put those columns in a row so that we can in that,

268
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:48.891
so that we can analyze the way in which the columns relate to each other.

269
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.990
For example,
there's a group of events happenstances,

270
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.400
uh,
sort of naming accidents and so on,

271
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.260
that falls into a common,

272
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.850
a column called over determination of blood relations.
Uh,

273
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.060
that is to say when,
um,

274
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.510
when Antigony tries to bury her brother and goes to the wall for that in ways

275
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.980
that you might find excessive,

276
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.960
that's an overdetermined and determination of blood relations,
uh,

277
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.390
then,
and then you noticed that at the same time,

278
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.490
there's a series of actions in the myths going all the way back to edit

279
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:29.880
[inaudible] family history and then down through the history of his offspring.

280
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:33.510
And so on that there's also a series of actions which have to do with the

281
00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:37.770
undervaluation of blood relations.
You know,
people,
well,

282
00:19:37.771 --> 00:19:41.640
they don't really seem to care as much about blood relations as they should.
Uh,

283
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.270
and as a result of that,
uh,
bad things happen to,
and then there's a,

284
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.360
and then there's a column of,

285
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.420
of issues which have to do with the way in which recurrently,

286
00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:55.470
in all the versions of the myth,

287
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.830
there seems to be a strange preoccupation with that,

288
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:03.300
which is born from the earth monsters.
Uh,

289
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.530
um,
you know,

290
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:09.300
the teeth of monsters that are scattered and become the alphabet,
uh,

291
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:12.060
in the story of Cadmus and,
uh,

292
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:17.040
the variety of ways in which heroes have to confront monsters as Oedipus

293
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:21.210
confronts the state,
the Sphinx,
and all of these monsters are,

294
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.270
are understood as not being born from parents as being born from two things.

295
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.080
But instead,
as emerging from the earth,

296
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.450
they are phonic or,

297
00:20:33.451 --> 00:20:37.320
or toxin us in Levis.
Strauss is word.

298
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.790
And there seems to be a strange preoccupation with the OT,

299
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.710
with [inaudible] in this myth.
But this is,
but,

300
00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:50.080
but this is offset by the way in which,
uh,
but by the,

301
00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:51.920
by the way in which,
um,

302
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.310
that is to say with fending off all toxins as if the crucial thing where to

303
00:20:57.311 --> 00:21:02.311
incest on the binary parental relationship that produces us to be reassured in

304
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:10.861
our humanity by the idea that one of us is born from two.

305
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.240
But then on the other hand,

306
00:21:13.241 --> 00:21:16.700
there are all kinds of things in the myth which are also preoccupied with all

307
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.460
taught,
with all toxin and precisely the opposite way.
Uh,
lambda,

308
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.120
uh,

309
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.120
the word that begins so many of the names of the figures in edifices genealogy

310
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:29.020
lab,
Dacher's latest and so on.

311
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.000
Lambda looks like a limping person,
right?

312
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.740
Oedipus means swell foot one who limps.
Uh,

313
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:42.810
and what emerges in the fourth column is the idea that there are signs of

314
00:21:44.441 --> 00:21:47.110
autocross honey in our own makeup.

315
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.320
The reason we limp is that we have a foot of clay,

316
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.210
that something of the earth from which we were born sticks to us.

317
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.280
And this is a recurrent pattern,

318
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.290
a recurrent idea in the unfolding of the Oedipus myth.

319
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.290
Uh,
it's,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's a peculiar thing,

320
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:09.790
but notice that this is one of those occasions on which the myth explodes into

321
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:13.450
other cultures.
Adam means red clay.

322
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:19.020
Adam is born from the earth in the sense that red clay is taken from the earth

323
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.800
and he is created and there seems to be the same preoccupation with autocracy

324
00:22:26.541 --> 00:22:30.040
honey in the Oedipus myth as well.

325
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.840
One of the interesting links of that myth with,
uh,

326
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.740
the Christian myth of the origin of man.

327
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.410
So you got four columns,
overvaluation of blood relations,

328
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:46.330
undervaluation of blood relations,
denial of all and the presidents of all talk.

329
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.164
Funny.
All right,

330
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:52.290
I'm going to leave it at that for now because we'll come back later to see what

331
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.660
interesting thing is going on in the way in which these four columns are all

332
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:02.800
about two versus one.
That is to say whether or not,

333
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.610
uh,
we are born from two or born from one.

334
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.970
And I want to come back to that,
to,

335
00:23:08.971 --> 00:23:13.600
to that in the context of showing that in a certain way,

336
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.520
the question whether things come from to ideas,
for example,

337
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:23.521
come from to two different things or whether ideas come from one object is after

338
00:23:26.021 --> 00:23:30.580
all,
this question is itself an allegory of the structuralist activity.

339
00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.340
That's what structuralism itself is about.

340
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.640
And that's what makes it so interesting and even perhaps peculiar that Levy

341
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:43.810
Strauss is able to defer to find not just any thought in a myth,

342
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.290
but the very,
that he himself is doing about the myth.
So,

343
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.400
and that of course may have something to do with your sense that surely

344
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.910
decomposing in order to wreak and stroke recomposed creating a virtual systemic

345
00:23:58.851 --> 00:23:59.390
object,

346
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:04.390
notice that I've made this a dotted line creating a virtual systemic object,

347
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:09.260
um,
that there's a kind of a circularity in that,
you know,
you look at,
I mean,

348
00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:13.280
I hope I've explained a Levy Strauss has four columns.

349
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:17.330
Intelligibly but if you look at those four columns,
you just say to yourself,

350
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.650
how on earth did he come up with that,
you know?
And he himself says,
oh,

351
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:26.450
well maybe I could have done it some other way.
Oh,
you know,
and uh,
and was,

352
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.750
and you say to yourself,
how can this become decisive?

353
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.790
How can it become authoritative?
I,
um,
you can see what he's doing.

354
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:38.450
And by the way,
you can confirm it by thinking of things that he leaves out.

355
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.370
Jocasta hangs herself.

356
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:42.830
He doesn't mention that it's not in any of the four columns,

357
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:44.780
but obviously that has something to do.

358
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:49.490
You can take your choice either between the over determination or under

359
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:53.810
determination of blood relations.
She feels guilty because she committed incest,

360
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.770
right?

361
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:59.770
Oedipus well at his birth is hamstrung and exposed on Mount Catherine at

362
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.810
[inaudible].
Strauss doesn't mention that either,

363
00:25:02.811 --> 00:25:04.880
but obviously that's why had a piss limps.

364
00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:08.600
Oedipus is a limping person liked the letter lambda,
right?

365
00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.700
And so plainly,
that must have something to do with the persistence of all talk.

366
00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:16.400
Funny.
And finally,
if you read the Oedipus Coladas,

367
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.080
you know that at the end of it,

368
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.260
Oedipus when he dies is swallowed up by the earth.

369
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.910
Dust Thou art to dust,
thou shall return the this,
the,
the,

370
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:30.770
the equivalent of this in the Oedipus myth as that where I came from,

371
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.170
the earth is where I will go.

372
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:38.150
And he becomes a kind of a genius of the place at Coladas.

373
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.690
As a result of having been swallowed up there,

374
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.210
he becomes a kind of,
uh,
uh,

375
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.620
presiding spirit or genius of the place.

376
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.390
So all of those things,
which we ourselves thought of,
uh,
he didn't think of him.

377
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.660
He didn't put them in.
You didn't put them in.
His diagram can,
however,

378
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:00.800
be put in his diagram.
And if that's the case,

379
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.520
we have to say to ourselves,
hmm,
there might be something in this.
Maybe,

380
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.640
maybe this is a plausible and interesting way of arranging these materials.

381
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:14.660
So I really do think that ought to be said in defense of what may seem,

382
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.130
uh,
however,

383
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.970
to be a somewhat arbitrary exercise now turning [inaudible]

384
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.810
you may say with all this emphasis I've been throwing on decomposing in order to

385
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:31.400
recomposed that you don't see that going on in what Jakobsen it saying,

386
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.660
you may say to yourself,
well,
he seems to be just doing formalism.
You know,

387
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.160
he breaks,
he breaks any speech,
act into its,
into six functions.

388
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:45.150
He talks about the Inter determinacy of those six functions,

389
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.310
uh,
with a certain result that sounds just like formulas and you say,
well,

390
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.180
um,
one way to show the way in which [inaudible] has been and is doing his

391
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:58.550
structuralist is to say that after all in this essay,
uh,

392
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.620
there's a lot more of this.
I,
by the way,
what's your editor doesn't give you,

393
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.070
it's mostly about diversification,
which is,
uh,

394
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.400
the longstanding specialty of Yacob Upson's work,

395
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:12.990
Russian versification check risk location.
And so on.
Um,
and a little technical,

396
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.890
but it is all about the poetic function.

397
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:19.740
After all this essay is about the poetic function,

398
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:22.680
what the formalist would call literariness,

399
00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:28.130
but Yaka Basin has a real contribution to make to this notion of the poetic

400
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:32.760
function.
And what it is is basically this,
the product function,

401
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.770
and I'm going to quote this for the first time.

402
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.770
It's on page eight 58 in the left hand column and it's a mouthful.

403
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.710
The poetic function projects,

404
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.980
the principle of equivalents from the axis of selection to the access of

405
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:54.690
combination.
Now you understand the poetic function projects,

406
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:59.691
the principle of equivalent from the axis of selection to the access of

407
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:02.850
combination.
What is the principle of equivalents?

408
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.610
You've got that you've got a good deal of it.
The privilege,

409
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.440
the principle of equivalent can be understood as what Jaco Epson and the Aphasia

410
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.910
Essay calls metaphor.
That is to say the way in which you remember.

411
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:20.090
You remember last time I talked about how signs cluster on the verdict in the

412
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:24.900
vertical axis.
If we understand languages,
the system,

413
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:28.530
there are some signs that relate the signs in ways that they probably don't

414
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:32.250
relate to yet.
Other signs.
And then I had an incredible lapse of memory.

415
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:35.970
I couldn't remember a synonym for ship,
but I still hope that I got,

416
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.780
I still got my,
I hope that I got my point across to you.
Uh,

417
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.610
and indicated that there are varieties of ways in which any given sign cluster

418
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.960
with other signs,

419
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.320
those ways of clustering are what [inaudible] calls the principal of

420
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.240
equivalents.
What is it?
Well,

421
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:59.270
it's the way in which signs either are similar to each other or are dissimilar

422
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:02.760
to each other.
If that sounds too vague,

423
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.770
maybe it's better not to use language of difference or a similarity,

424
00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:11.250
but actually to use language of opposition.
In other words,

425
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.370
the way in which signs are virtually synonymous or the way in which signs are

426
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.930
really and truly opposed to each other.

427
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:23.460
Obviously it stretches at just as in versification,

428
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.250
you don't just have full rhyme,
you have slat rhyme.

429
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.120
These relationships stretch in,
in,
in,
in the,

430
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.650
in a v in varieties of ways of this kind.
But the principle of a kid of,

431
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.030
of equivalents is the way in which signs,
uh,
understood.

432
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.660
As phonemes Lek seems tag means however you want to understand them.

433
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.040
The way in which signs are similar or dissimilar.

434
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.710
They the,
the,

435
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:55.711
the readiness with which we combined signs of that kind is what a person

436
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:00.490
attending to the poetic function looks for.

437
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.120
If the utterance seems to involve a predominance of equivalences of various

438
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:11.104
kinds,

439
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.210
then this utterance which is unfolding on the access of combination,

440
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.400
right,

441
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.400
is the result of having projected that principle of equivalents,

442
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:23.770
call it metaphor,

443
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.800
call it a principle of similar similarity or dissimilarity too from the access

444
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.310
of selection.
That is to say that access,

445
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:38.370
perhaps a virtual one in which language is a system to the axis of combination.

446
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.860
That real access because nobody doubts to the existence of speech.

447
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.570
That real access in which language is not assistant but has become speech

448
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.280
unfolding in time.
The principle of the poetic function,
however,

449
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.480
can be understood then as the metaphorization

450
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.450
of what is otherwise met anemic.
In other words,

451
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:06.310
if I put together a sentence,

452
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.370
what I'm doing is I'm putting words next to each other,

453
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.960
and that's what my autonomy is at Ventana me is the,
is,
is,
is the,

454
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.580
a selection of signs,
if you will,
uh,

455
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:21.010
that go appropriately next to each other according to the rules of grammar and

456
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:24.730
syntax according according to the rules of logic,
right?
Uh,
at,

457
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:26.710
but also perhaps,
uh,

458
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.800
in the ways in which the rent,

459
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.990
the rhetorical devices [inaudible] autonomy can be understood.
Um,

460
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.580
if I say,
I mean,
if,

461
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.540
if I say a hot instead of house,

462
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:44.800
I'm using an example of actually taken from Yacob sins,
Aphasia Essay.

463
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.140
If I say hot instead of house,

464
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:50.650
and if I say the hut is small,
um,

465
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:55.120
there is a metro Nimic relationship implied with,
uh,

466
00:31:55.121 --> 00:31:59.080
houses,
uh,
shacks,
uh,
mansions,

467
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.690
other sorts of edifice,

468
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:06.490
but which can only really be resolved perhaps by the unfolding of the logic of

469
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.780
the sentence.
Uh,
as in,
when I say the Hud is small,
um,

470
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.900
and so common combinatory processes borrowing the rhetorical term Mytonomy as

471
00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:23.710
that which is next to each other are basically met an emic.

472
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.440
The available signs to be selected.
On the other hand,

473
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:34.441
on the access of selection are selected for certain purposes.

474
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:39.620
If they are metaphoric.
Obviously if I'm just making a sentence,

475
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.550
I'm not selecting signs because they're metaphoric on selected because I

476
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:47.900
selected because they go easily next to each other either for reasons of grammar

477
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.160
or syntax or logic.

478
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:54.400
Now let's look at [inaudible] six functions taken all together.

479
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.890
I think this is by no means difficult and I think that Jaak Gibson's analysis of

480
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:05.030
the six functions is just absolutely,
totally brilliant.
In fact,
I think,

481
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.110
I think that,

482
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:11.000
I mean I'm so profoundly convinced by what your cups and says about these six

483
00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:12.500
functions that I really think there's,

484
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.350
there isn't much else to say about an utterance.

485
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.760
I obviously in different registers,
there's lots to say.
Ah,

486
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.630
but in the spirit of the AUC of Sony and analysis,
there's,

487
00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:26.960
there's really pot,
there's no possible you can complain,

488
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.180
you can make about this except possibly want,

489
00:33:29.181 --> 00:33:33.260
which I probably won't get to until next time.
But in the meantime,

490
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.870
it's just staggeringly effective.

491
00:33:35.871 --> 00:33:40.310
And let me use the example of a word of it,
of an expression,

492
00:33:40.311 --> 00:33:45.260
which is surely as uninteresting.
I,
I've groped as,
as,
as,
as,

493
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:45.501
as,

494
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:50.501
as much as I could to find the most uninteresting possible expression to show

495
00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:55.430
the way in which any utterance whatsoever ha entails these six functions.

496
00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.340
It is raining.
Oh boy.
Excitement reigns as they say.
So in any case,

497
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.360
um,
let's say,
let's say that I am an addressor,

498
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.110
that is to say I,

499
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.120
I'm a romantic poet and I say I probably ill advisedly if I'm a poet,

500
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.240
but I'm a romantic poet and I say,
you know,

501
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:21.380
sort of waking everybody up.
When I say it,
it is raining,
Huh?
All right.

502
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:26.060
What do I mean,
what do I mean?
If I'm a romantic poet,
I what I'm,

503
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:31.290
what I mean to say is I'm singing in the rain or it's raining in my heart and

504
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:33.170
other words I'm expressing,

505
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:38.270
I'm expressing something emotional in saying it is raining.

506
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:43.630
So that sense of the expression it is rainy is what [inaudible] calls the

507
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.990
emotive function.
Now I'm being addressed.

508
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.170
The thrust of the message is toward the dressy.

509
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.670
It's being spoken by an a dresser,
but it's aimed at and address dressy.

510
00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:56.871
That address.

511
00:34:56.871 --> 00:35:01.871
He is a small child going out the door without his coat on and his mother or

512
00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:07.740
father says it is raining.
Right.

513
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.370
Which means of course as a cognitive function,
as a command,

514
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:16.830
as something which has a design on the address.

515
00:35:16.831 --> 00:35:21.831
See what it means is put your coat on but you don't necessarily say put your

516
00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:28.790
coat on.
You say it is raining and that's the cognitive function.

517
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:32.630
That's the at what y'all comes and calls the set to the addressee.

518
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:37.560
That is to say the basic dominant bearing that the message has.

519
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.650
The set is a set to the address.

520
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:45.030
See now there's a context for any utterance this much.

521
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:48.320
I suppose none of us would think to disagree with,
I'm a weatherman.

522
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:52.350
I'm a meteorologist,
right?
I don't even have to look out the window.

523
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:57.150
I look at my charts and I,
and I announced a confidently through the microphone.

524
00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.300
It is raining.
All right.
And,
uh,
everybody takes me seriously.
I mean it's,
it,

525
00:36:02.301 --> 00:36:06.930
it,
the referential function of it is raining,
is supposed to convey information.

526
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:10.530
I'm a weatherman.
I'm supposed to know what I'm talking about.
So if somebody,

527
00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.940
so if a weatherman tells me it is ranting,
I believe that it is raining.

528
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.490
I put my hand out the door and sure enough,

529
00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:20.550
it is raining and the referential function,

530
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:24.210
the dominant in the expression,
it is raining,
uh,

531
00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.020
as referential function,
uh,
has been confirmed.

532
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.030
I don't expect the Weatherman to be set to,
to,
to,

533
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:36.990
to be telling me somehow,
secretly that he's crying when he says it is raining.

534
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:42.220
Right?
I expect him,
I expect him to tell me the truth about the weather.
Right?

535
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:46.380
And that's what,
and that's what I'm listening to him for.
All right.

536
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.790
Now the set to the contact y'all comes and gives you that.

537
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:54.830
Those wonderful examples from a Dorothy Parker's representation of a date.

538
00:36:55.261 --> 00:36:59.790
Jeff,
whoa boy.
Well,
here we are.
Yeah,
here we are.
Yeah,

539
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:04.320
we sure are here.
Uh,
and so on.
Right?
Um,
in other words,

540
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.610
in a state of abject and acute nervousness,
filling the air with words,
right?

541
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.200
So that,
so that you know,
you're on a date,
right?

542
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:18.340
And you can't think of anything to say,
I really feel sorry for you.
Uh,

543
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.550
you're,
you're,
you're,
you're on a date and you can't think of anything to say.

544
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:27.880
Say,
say it is raining.
And of course your interlocutor says,
yeah,

545
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.240
it's raining.
And you say it's,
it's raining hard,
you know,

546
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:36.330
as well.
Yeah.
Maybe it'll stop soon.
And so,
you know,

547
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.920
and so the conversation continues and that's the phatic function.

548
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.900
Checking to make sure the contact is working.
Testing one,

549
00:37:45.901 --> 00:37:48.300
two,
three.
Can you hear me?

550
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.740
That's what the set to the contact is.

551
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.160
Anything that confirms that you're actually sort of in communication with

552
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:04.740
somebody and anything we can say it has that component.
I mean,

553
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:08.280
if I'm a physicist and I'm going out on a date with another physicist,

554
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:11.490
I say EMC equals MC squared.
You know,

555
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:15.930
and I'm not saying e equals MC squared.
I'm filling the air with words and,

556
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:17.430
and so once again,

557
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:22.460
it's the set to the contact and any message in the right context has that

558
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.133
function.

559
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:31.010
The set to the code is when we're not sure that we share adequately share the

560
00:38:33.961 --> 00:38:38.961
code with another person on a given occasion so that we back away from simply

561
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:46.330
saying things to make sure that what we're saying is clear and other words to

562
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:51.220
define them.
I say there's a mirror on the field.
Somebody says,
what is the mayor?

563
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:53.110
Well,
it's a female horse.
Well,

564
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:57.100
it's a female horse is the metal lingual function,

565
00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:01.270
but we're talking about it is raining.
This is where it really gets interesting.

566
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:06.660
The most interesting thing about it is raining in terms of these six functions

567
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:12.121
is metal lingual because what on earth is it all right if somebody tells me it

568
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:16.990
is raining,
I say,
what?
What are you talking about?
What is it?
I don't,

569
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:19.090
I have absolutely no idea what you're saying.

570
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.810
I've noticed that other languages have the same weird phenomenon.

571
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.310
E plus s pregnant.
What on earth does any of that mean?

572
00:39:27.311 --> 00:39:32.110
What does he you,
what does s,
what is it?
Is it God,
is it Jupiter,
Pluto,

573
00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:36.460
[inaudible] is at the cloud canopy.
Well,
sort of as the cloud canopy,
but that's,

574
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:39.790
that's sort of clearly not what's meant by it.
Right?

575
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.290
It is a kind of grammatical and syntactical anomaly,

576
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.620
which is extremely difficult even for link for linguists to analyze and to

577
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.300
explain and that so that when I try to say it is raining,

578
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.550
I can expect the metal lingual and if,

579
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:02.830
if I'm talking to a literalist of course I kind of expect the metal lingual

580
00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:07.220
function to kick in and in fact bite me in the Shin.
Uh,

581
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.580
it is,
it's,

582
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:13.590
it's no picnic with the metal lingual function in mind saying it is raining.

583
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.090
What kind of a definition of it is,
it's raining,
you know,

584
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.150
and so and so,
uh,

585
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.600
problems arise but they're interesting problems and there are a function,

586
00:40:25.601 --> 00:40:28.690
one of the six functions of the expression.
It is raining.

587
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.710
Poetic function is unfortunately not very interesting.
That's the one,

588
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.500
that's the one drawback of this example,

589
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.080
but this is still planted to say it and the air in Ning,

590
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.470
which one can hear the double [inaudible] in raining?
Uh,
they,
uh,

591
00:40:44.471 --> 00:40:48.400
the monosyllables I'm suggesting,
you know,

592
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:53.460
so to a kind of a quick declaration of something followed by a sense of duration

593
00:40:54.461 --> 00:40:59.461
that one always feels when one is aware of rain coming at it is raining.

594
00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.530
So that the,
uh,
so,

595
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.540
so that the duration or prolongation of the word has a kind of semantic value

596
00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.770
indicating to us that this is something ongoing.
Uh,
in other words,

597
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.920
a variety of a variety of ways in which the poetic function of it is raining can

598
00:41:17.201 --> 00:41:22.060
be considered for the poetic function to be dominant.
Um,

599
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.500
as I suggested when I said a romantic poet wouldn't be very smart if he or she

600
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:31.330
said it was raining for the,
for the poetic function to be dominant,
uh,

601
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:36.290
would really,
uh,
be taxing,
uh,
for anyone who wanted to make it.

602
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:36.501
So,

603
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:41.501
but it could be any function could be the dominant in a certain situation of any

604
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:50.150
given utterance.
And so,
uh,
the so,

605
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:54.320
so the,
so that then,
um,
sort of perhaps to suffice,
uh,

606
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.830
as an analysis of,
uh,
of,
uh,

607
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.030
Yaka person's understanding of the structure of an utterance.

608
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:07.270
And it has a structure in so far that is to say a metaphoric as opposed to a

609
00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:12.530
metronomic structure in so far as we observe the presence of some kind of

610
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:18.920
pressure from the access of selection,

611
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:23.930
the principle of equivalents and the access of selection bringing itself to bear

612
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.320
on the way in which the combination takes place.

613
00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:31.610
It's just incredible that,
you know,
you say it is very,

614
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:34.420
what could be more Prozac then hit his writing and all of a sudden you've

615
00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:37.730
noticed that string of eyes,
you notice all kinds of other things about it.

616
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.800
I mean,
it is,
it is the,
the,

617
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:44.801
the way in which the most basal utterance is combined is likely in one form or

618
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:48.950
another almost unavoidable.

619
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.300
I suppose I should use the strong argument and say unavoidably is likely

620
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.360
unavoidably to entail aspect of the poetic function where the poetic function is

621
00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:03.950
dominant.
You have literariness.

622
00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.640
And that of course is the old object of scientific attention of the Russian

623
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.263
formalists.

624
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:16.630
But it is a refined in a way that I think is structuralist by aqua button

625
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.750
because he insists on the binary nature

626
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:27.340
of the process of combining elements from the access of selection if they are

627
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:32.630
equivalent,
binary being same,

628
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.093
opposite,

629
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:39.140
similar dissimilar and the variety of patterns in which,

630
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.080
uh,
those relations same opposite,

631
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:46.940
similar dissimilar can be launched into use.

632
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:49.333
Now

633
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.510
I've actually reached the point at which,
uh,

634
00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:02.230
act at which possibly I could,
um,
get involved,
uh,

635
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:07.140
in some elements of critique.
Uh,
and I suppose I'll begin.

636
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:11.790
I may not finish,
but we can always carry over in,
into the next lecture.

637
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.170
So since we've been talking about your cuffs and let me call your attention to

638
00:44:16.171 --> 00:44:21.171
one problem in what seems to me otherwise to be a truly remarkable exercise of

639
00:44:23.341 --> 00:44:28.080
thought.
And that problem arises on page eight 58

640
00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.790
and he himself recognizes that it's a problem.
He acknowledges it's a problem,

641
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:39.960
but he wants to say that he's solved it and saying what he says.

642
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.060
It's about,
it's a,
it's,

643
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:47.120
it's about two thirds of the way down the page and it's about the relationship

644
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:52.521
between the poetic function and the metal lingual function between the set to

645
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.730
the message and the set to the code as he puts it.

646
00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:01.230
And this is what he said.
It may be objective.
Yeah,
and here we are objecting,

647
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:02.070
right.

648
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.070
It may be objected that metalanguage also makes a sequential use of equivalent

649
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:13.551
units when combining Sinan emic expressions into an equational sentence.

650
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:19.430
A equals a mayor is the female of the horse poetry and metalanguage,

651
00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:26.010
however,
are in Diab diametrical opposition to each other.

652
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.020
They're not the same right there in diametrical opposition to each other and

653
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:35.460
metal language.
The sequence is used to build an equation.

654
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.620
In other words,
to prove that two things are that,
that that one,

655
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.160
that that one term can be understood in terms of other terms.

656
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.790
The sequence is used to build an equip.
Whereas in poetry,

657
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:52.920
the equation is used to build a sequence.
Okay.
Now in one sense,

658
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:57.150
this is true,
obviously.
Yes,
that is,
I know what I'm speaking mental language,

659
00:45:57.151 --> 00:46:01.440
and I know when I'm speaking poetry,
maybe you know it too,

660
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.400
but what y'all Gibson has actually done is he's sort of exposed a structuralist

661
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:12.150
nerve because he has appealed to intention.

662
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.101
That is to say,

663
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:19.101
he said the metal lingual expression has one intention and the poetic expression

664
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:25.620
has another intention.
What does that mean?
It has a genesis.

665
00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:30.570
It has an origin in an intending consciousness,

666
00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:36.100
just as in traditions,
not structuralist.

667
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.730
Things have origins in prior causes and not in their structural relationship

668
00:46:44.681 --> 00:46:48.820
between two things.
In other words,

669
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.730
if structuralism is a critique of genesis,

670
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.790
as light as is the case with Edmund leashes,

671
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.280
analysis of the biblical text,
genesis as is the case,
uh,

672
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:04.350
certainly with love and Strauss is understanding of the Oedipus myth from to and

673
00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:11.440
not from one.
If structuralism is a critique of Genesis,
what happens?

674
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.030
Why don't you have to make a distinction between two entities in your system?

675
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:20.890
The poetic function and the metal lingual function in terms of their genesis.

676
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:25.990
That is to say in terms of the intention that stands behind them.
As I said,

677
00:47:25.991 --> 00:47:30.600
the example seems trivial because we're all more than to agree with [inaudible]

678
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.260
that we know the difference when we see it between the metal lingual and the

679
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:36.220
poetic functions.

680
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.580
But he's not actually saying we know the difference when we see it.

681
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.490
Maybe it would have been better if he had said it.

682
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.570
Well anybody can see what's metal lingual.
It was poetic.
Maybe you know,

683
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.140
maybe it would have been better if he had what he says instead is metal lingual

684
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:51.730
is intended to do one thing.

685
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:57.270
Poetic is intended to do another thing that that opens actually a can of worms

686
00:47:57.701 --> 00:47:59.590
about all six functions.
You know,

687
00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:04.330
I stand here in front of you and I say it is raining.
How do you know which,

688
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.160
what I'm intending,
right.

689
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.640
Whether I'm nervous and sort of sort of just being phatic whether I,

690
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.440
whether I am really unhappy or happy,
you know,
whether I think you're crazy.

691
00:48:17.441 --> 00:48:20.770
It is in fact raining outside and I don't see any coats,
uh,

692
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.220
whether I am actually,
uh,

693
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:27.850
sort of just masquerading as an English professor.
I'm really a meteorologist.

694
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.720
I mean,
how do you,
you don't,
you don't know any of these things.

695
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.700
You have to infer an intention.
All right?
And if you infer an intention,

696
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.620
uh,
in order to make,
in order to make these distinctions,
um,

697
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:45.660
how can the structuralist imperative of structure rather than Janet Genesis be

698
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:50.740
preserved intact?

699
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.860
How can we incest that we know negative things negatively and not positively if

700
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:01.360
we have to infer a direct cause,

701
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:06.450
a positive cause in order to grasp distinctions even between the six functions?

702
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:12.240
That's a rhetorical question with which I don't necessarily agree.
Uh,

703
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.820
but it is a potential objection that,

704
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:19.930
that you may wish to explore on your own.
Now,
the critique of Levy Strauss,

705
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:22.300
I've already hinted that,
um,
uh,

706
00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:27.100
but there's another aspect of it too that I will defer until next time because

707
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:31.810
you'll find that dairy does that.
The Essay of Derrida that you're reading,
uh,

708
00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.030
is largely about levies Strauss.

709
00:49:34.031 --> 00:49:39.031
So we'll make a natural segway between what we're talking about today and what

710
00:49:39.251 --> 00:49:44.170
we'll be talking about Thursday to return first to certain aspects of Strauss

711
00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:49.090
Strauss's argument.
And then,
uh,
and then get going with what dairy does say.

712
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.890
Thank you.
See that.
