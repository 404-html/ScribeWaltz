WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.330
All right.
Uh,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.490
so today we start a sequence which takes us through deconstruction.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.950
Uh,
and it's a sequence which has genuine coherence.
That is to say,

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.210
these are figures,

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.220
all of whom are attentive to each other's thought,
uh,

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.520
draw on each other,
uh,

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.650
and build from the materials that we're going to start covering,

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.840
uh,
toward,
uh,
a certain,

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.720
not end,
but toward a moment,
uh,

10
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:41.550
and which the materials seem to be undermined actually,
uh,
in deconstruction,

11
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.320
but in which they are still prominent.
And set the terms of debate,

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.430
the,
the relationship between,
uh,

13
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:55.431
the Russian formalists and the work of the linguistic linguistic Ferdinando.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.500
So sewer,
which will be taking up on Thursday is a complex one.

15
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.050
I'm going to say certain things about it.
Uh,

16
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.700
and you may find yourselves discussing this relationship in section,

17
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.970
but I think much will come clear when we actually get into what's called

18
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:14.910
structuralism.

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.070
And you read the essay by Roman Jakobson called linguistics and poetics.

20
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.280
Jaco Epson having,
uh,
uh,
spent his,

21
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:28.281
the early part of his career as a card carrying member of Oprah's eyes,

22
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.490
the Russian formalists,
uh,
and then who,
uh,

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.250
owing to various forces that I'll be talking about immigrated first to Prague,

24
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:41.660
Czech and Slovakia,
where he joined a linguistic circle,
uh,

25
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:44.370
which it,
which in a variety of ways,
uh,

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.970
proved to be the origin of what's called structuralism.
And then of course,

27
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:52.950
he moved on to Paris where he knew Claude Levy Strauss and influenced him,
uh,

28
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:55.410
and ultimately to the United States.

29
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540
But the essay linguistics and poetics,
which you'll be reading next week,

30
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.530
I think we'll give you perhaps a clearer sense of the way in which the Russian

31
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:09.150
formalists work and the work of so sewer,
the foundational work of,

32
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:14.100
so sir,
in the general course in linguistics,
um,
amalgamates,
uh,

33
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.150
in ways that,
uh,
are profoundly,
uh,

34
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.740
fruitful and influential for the subsequent course of structuralist and

35
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:26.430
deconstructionist thinking.
So today,
uh,

36
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.190
we begin thinking about the Russian formalists,

37
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:34.170
but I also do want to think them as kicking off a tradition which,

38
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.670
uh,

39
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.600
just in order to place them visa vi what you've been reading and hearing about

40
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.100
already.
Uh,

41
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.210
I one can say something like this about this tradition,

42
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.480
it differs markedly from it's opposed to hermeneutics in this one particular,

43
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.100
and it's one that is maybe initially counterintuitive,

44
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.430
but I actually I think is rather important once you began to think about it.

45
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.720
Hermeneutics is well more or less than by nature,
by nature,

46
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.780
by definition,
interested in meaning.

47
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.030
That is to say the arts of interpretation are used for the purpose of

48
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.840
discovering,
uncovering,
arriving at meaning,

49
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.980
and very frequently as is the case and got him.

50
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.440
Or this meaning is called the subject matter.
That is,

51
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.970
that is to say what in thinking about,
uh,

52
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.940
literature in terms of form and content,
let's say we'd call content.

53
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.740
So in any case,

54
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.860
hermeneutics is devoted to the discovery of meaning and it's basic and the art

55
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.990
that it's concerned with is the art of interpretation.
Well,

56
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.080
the Russian formalists differ very sharply in this regard because what they're

57
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:58.171
interested is precisely the way in which literariness as they call it,

58
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.900
the devices of literariness,
uh,

59
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.040
can be deployed so as to impede,

60
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:10.390
to interfere with,
to hinder our arrival at meaning.

61
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.690
If in other words,
hermeneutics is devoted to the possibility of,
of,
of,

62
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.960
of communication,

63
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.020
of understanding the Russian formalists are interested in that special aspect of

64
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.810
verbal communication called literariness,

65
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
which actually interferes with these very processes of communication and

66
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:35.740
understanding the roughening of the surface,
uh,

67
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.940
celebrated Busche Klowski as a form of defamiliarization.

68
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.890
The roughening of the surface is what slows us down,

69
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.250
what gets in the way of our arriving at meaning and does so for a variety of

70
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.300
reasons that the formulas are engaged to attend to.
Now,

71
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.650
you may take note of the fact that what I'm saying,
uh,

72
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:04.150
isn't completely convincing perhaps to those who have been reading the new

73
00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:09.151
critics and Wolfgang Eser and have noticed that they too are very interested in

74
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:15.661
the ways in which literariness does involve special techniques and devices that

75
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.890
slow us down.
In other words,

76
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.070
it replacing the shortest distance between two points that we experience in a

77
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:31.081
practical message literariness as the formalists call it a poetic language,

78
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.150
um,
as they also sometimes call it.

79
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.060
And as the new critics certainly call it slows us down.

80
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:41.950
It creates as a distance between two points rather than a straight line,

81
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.960
an arabesque.
In other words,

82
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.980
it makes us pause over what were reading.

83
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.010
It gets in the way of arriving to quickly at meaning if indeed one arrives at

84
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:59.570
meaning at all.
The formalists are concerned about,
however,

85
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.170
about the way in which literature is put together.
Uh,

86
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.390
those titles that I can bomb keeps talking about how Don Quixote was made,

87
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:11.420
how go goals overcoat was made,
uh,

88
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
reflect the preoccupation of the Russian formalists with how literature is put

89
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:18.620
together.
In other words,

90
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:23.621
whereas the new critics and Wolfgang Eser are interested in the roughening of

91
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.430
form.
They're interested in it for hermaneutic purposes.

92
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.500
It slows us down yet,

93
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.530
but this slowing down is a means of enriching what we finally grasp to be the

94
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.390
meaning of a text.

95
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.640
So they are still engaged in the hermeneutic enterprise in interpretation.

96
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.070
The formalists,
uh,
art,

97
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:50.060
really relatively indifferent to questions of meaning to questions of

98
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:54.650
interpretation.
They're interested in the interest of what they call science.

99
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.010
They're interested in structure,
they're interested,

100
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.960
in other words in the way a text is put together.
Uh,

101
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.380
and that is,

102
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.210
I think essentially the difference between what we've been talking about so far,

103
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.540
even though it has had a variety of outlooks,
uh,

104
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.810
and what we are talking about now temporarily as we advance through the

105
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:18.464
syllabus,

106
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.560
we're bracketing are suspending our interest in meaning and focusing instead on

107
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:29.600
how something is made.
Take for example,
Tony,
the tow truck.
Uh,

108
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.750
I mentioned,
uh,
well I can't remember what I mentioned.

109
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:36.890
It could have been in the audio.
You'll be hearing,
uh,
I mentioned that,
uh,

110
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:41.450
an interesting phenomenon in Tony,
the text of Tony,
uh,

111
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.340
is the tri partition of the t sound Tony,

112
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.380
uh,
tow truck.

113
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.370
And just after we read in the text,

114
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.530
Tony The tow truck,

115
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.830
we encounter a triadic or triple and counter with vehicles,

116
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.160
Nido speedy,
bumpy.
In other words,

117
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.250
there's a threeness which appears at a variety of levels in the text of tone of

118
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:10.880
the tow truck,

119
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.880
which exactly corresponds to the aphorism of Osi breek quoted by Eichenbaum and

120
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:23.201
your text repetition in verse is analogous to Tautology in folklore.

121
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.910
Now we have uncovered something about the form,

122
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:31.910
the structure of tone of the tow truck in saying this,

123
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.190
but we haven't discovered or uncovered a thing about the meaning of Tony the tow

124
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:37.460
truck.

125
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
Nothing follows from this really I think rather interesting observation that

126
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:46.220
there's a kind of pervasiveness of triadic city.
Uh,

127
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.250
nothing follows from this observation about the actual meaning of the text.

128
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:52.640
Now if you're clever enough,

129
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:57.190
maybe you could parlay it into a sense of the meaning of the text.
Who knows?

130
00:08:57.191 --> 00:09:00.300
Maybe we'll try on some other occasion.
But for the moment,

131
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.570
I think you can see that in making remarks of this kind about a text one has

132
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:12.201
shifted the attention from meaning to structure and it's in that context that

133
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:19.500
most of the observations we encounter in Russian formalism need to be

134
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.210
understood.
Now the stress on taxonomy,

135
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.380
in other words,
the stress on the relationship among parts,

136
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.410
the understanding of the various parts of the literary texts as device of

137
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:37.090
literary texts as devices,
uh,

138
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.220
that is to say interrelated one with the others.

139
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:46.730
This emphasis on taxonomy is one of the ways in which the formalists and says

140
00:09:47.811 --> 00:09:50.610
that what they're doing is scientific.

141
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.610
Nobody can possibly miss in reading.

142
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.620
I can bombs rhetorically rather bizarre essay.
Uh,

143
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.650
his obsession with struggle with the fight,

144
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.180
with doing battle.
I mean,
you,
you,
your gone and say to yourself,
good heavens,

145
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:12.420
it's just talk about literature,
you know,
relax,
what,

146
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.830
it can't be that important,
you know,
but there's a,
but,
but,
but for I involved,

147
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.790
there's obviously a lot at stake and I'll,

148
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:24.390
and I'll try to give you some social and historical reasons why this is the

149
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.550
case.
But in the meantime,

150
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.420
what he's struggling for is important to recognize too.

151
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:34.290
In the very first sentence of the essay,
you read the expression,

152
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.380
thus struggle for science,

153
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.810
an interesting formulation,
thus struggle for science.

154
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:43.470
Now,

155
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.000
obviously the struggle takes place against the backdrop of completely

156
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:51.390
undisciplined and an unsystematic thinking,

157
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.430
which I could bomb identifies as the typical thinking of the universities of the

158
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:58.710
academy.
Uh,
I mean it's a,

159
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.900
it's a pretty state of affairs in his view,
uh,

160
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.400
when the most rigorous thinking that's being done about literature as being done

161
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:10.290
in popular journals.
Uh,
and so that's part of the struggle undoubtedly.

162
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.660
But another part of the struggle,
uh,
is,
uh,
simply it to,

163
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.720
to reach some means to break through to some means of understanding the thing

164
00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:24.840
that you're talking about.
You want to talk about it systematically,

165
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.080
but how can you talk about anything systematically if you don't know what it is,

166
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.740
you need to pin down an object of study,

167
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.270
a first principle from which other principals can emerge.

168
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.750
And part of the process is a to say,
hey,

169
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:45.870
it's not literature we're talking about who knows what literature is.

170
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.240
Nobody's really ever known what literature is.

171
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.850
What we're talking about is literariness.

172
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.851
That is to say certain devices that we can identify that perform a certain

173
00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:02.821
function and maybe out of their identification of these devices to evolve a

174
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.460
theory,
a that's more widespread.

175
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.060
Now I use the word evolve deliberately in the backdrop,

176
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.270
in the background of that expression struggle for a science.

177
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.850
There are two key figures.

178
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.850
The first is obviously marks against the backdrop of um,

179
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.220
the first,
uh,
great socialist revolution,

180
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:32.221
which eventually resulted in the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 when the Russian

181
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:36.700
formalists movement was at its height,
uh,

182
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.710
against the backdrop of Marxists thought a pervading,

183
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.140
uh,
not just rush in life,

184
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:47.920
but beginning to pervade Russian government against this backdrop.

185
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.040
The idea of struggle as in class struggle is going to predominate and I can

186
00:12:55.511 --> 00:13:00.220
bomb,
uh,
in this culture will be using such a word,
uh,

187
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.850
advisedly,
almost familiarly.
But at the same time,

188
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.940
it's very interesting that the kind of science he's thinking about is not just

189
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:13.840
any science.
You'll see this more and more clearly as you read through the text.

190
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:17.800
And as we talk about it,
it's Darwinian science.

191
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.590
And it's very interesting that Darwin,
that Darwin,

192
00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:25.570
as much as Marx is all about struggle,
the struggle for survival,

193
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.760
the struggle for dominance.
And notice the important,
we'll come back to it,

194
00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:32.710
the importance of the word dominant,

195
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.400
the dominant and the thinking of the Russian forum list,

196
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:41.320
the struggle for dominance among species in the habitat.

197
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.500
So in literature you have something like if you think in terms of literary

198
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:51.480
evolution as you retain Yanoff does,
uh,
in the essay,
uh,

199
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.150
that the passage on your sheet,
uh,
and uh,

200
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.710
if you think in those terms,

201
00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:01.711
you think about literary history itself as a sequence of changes in which

202
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.170
devices,

203
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:10.290
aspects of literary text struggle for dominance within and over against other

204
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.160
devices.
And so it is,
uh,

205
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.090
a simultaneously in his very first sentence,

206
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.240
a Marxist and a Darwinian vocabulary that I can bomb is invoking,

207
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:29.530
and that's what partly accounts for the strenuousness of his rhetoric.
You know,

208
00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.010
I mean,
there is the backdrop of class struggle,

209
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.780
which is understood as crucial.

210
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:38.530
There is the fermentation of Darwinian thought,

211
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:43.650
which at the same time is understood as as crucial a great deal is at stake.

212
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.180
And if those,
if those disorganized unsystematic academics,

213
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:54.050
um,
aren't attuned to the importance of these struggles,

214
00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.790
right.
Class struggle,

215
00:14:55.791 --> 00:15:00.791
the struggle for science science as the science of struggle if they aren't

216
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.000
attuned to these,
uh,
currents,

217
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.950
these contemporary occurrence.

218
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.190
That's just another way of showing how irrelevant and obsolete they are now on

219
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:18.380
literary,
on literary of,
I'm sorry,
uh,
the theory of the formal method,

220
00:15:18.381 --> 00:15:23.381
I can bombs Essa that you've read for today was written in 1927.

221
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.130
In other words,

222
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:30.130
it was written directly in the aftermath of a bombshell published by the on

223
00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:36.200
Trotsky called literature in Revolution in 1926.

224
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.050
Trotsky's literature in Revolution is a brilliant book,
uh,

225
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:45.410
and attack on many things,
a defensive,
certain other things,

226
00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:50.060
but in particular and very painfully an attack on the formalists.

227
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.240
Trotsky argues that the preoccupation with form in and for itself is a kind of

228
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.040
aestheticism.
Something by the way,
which I can,

229
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:06.041
Bob denies during the course of his texts is a kind of s that a CISM turning its

230
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:10.820
back on history and turning its back precisely on class struggle.

231
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.920
Trotsky is not simple minded in his literary taste and he doesn't just sort of

232
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:19.700
spontaneously insist that everybody has to write socialist realism.

233
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.940
That doesn't by the way happen until 1934,
uh,

234
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.790
when it became a kind of,
uh,
uh,

235
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.960
pronouncement of necessity at the International Soviet writers conference on

236
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:34.490
that occasion.
But in the meantime,

237
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.610
it is a shot fired across the bow of those forms of aestheticism,

238
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:44.150
quote unquote,
which can be understood as self-involved,

239
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.800
self preoccupied and indifferent to history and class struggle.

240
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.140
It's 1927
things are changing.

241
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:57.290
It's been 10 years since the revolution.
Uh,

242
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.350
there is a kind of taking hold of society and government by increasingly

243
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.130
bureaucratized and strict forms of surveillance,

244
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.340
uh,
and uh,

245
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.790
and management of social matters,

246
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.460
whether and to what extent the Russian formalists and their allies,

247
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:29.870
the futurists among them Mayakovsky and others,
uh,
felt,

248
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.711
um,
uh,

249
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:35.711
kind of antagonism or growing threat from the government is not wholly clear to

250
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:43.530
me.
It is,
it is.
It's,
it's,
it's been disputed.
Uh,
and,

251
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.040
and one doesn't know for sure.
I mean,

252
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.280
there is still a tremendous amount of intellectual ferment and excitement in the

253
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:55.490
capitals of Russia.
This is not,
you know,

254
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.890
this is not a wasteland of thought by any means.

255
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.480
And the Russian formalists are an important part of what's going on.

256
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.560
Nevertheless,
uh,
Trotskyists book is a provocation.

257
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.570
It's a challenge.
Uh,

258
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:14.660
and I can bombs a essay that you read for today is in part to a degree that it

259
00:18:16.231 --> 00:18:20.070
can't really come out and talk about,
doesn't want to come out and talk about it.

260
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.460
A response to Trotsky's book.

261
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:29.010
Now there were,
but obviously,
you know,
he's,
he,
he doesn't say,

262
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:30.510
he doesn't want to say anything about that.

263
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:32.610
There's one way in which he does talk about it.

264
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:37.611
And that is a marvelous exchange between the ethnographic critic vessel Lawsky

265
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.200
and Schakowsky,
uh,
of the,
of 1917 which all returned to,

266
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.030
but for the most part,
uh,
but for the most part,
he stays away,

267
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.800
seems at least to stay away from the provocation and simply defends the right of

268
00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:57.801
the formulas to exist and the integrity of what they're doing and the obvious

269
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.530
enemies.
And of course this is,
I can bombs language,

270
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:05.640
so on needing wince away from using it,
the obvious enemies in this case,

271
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.680
our figures like,
uh,
[inaudible] who,
uh,

272
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.930
the academician who,
um,

273
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.810
in a way defended the premises of the symbolists,

274
00:19:15.811 --> 00:19:20.730
the other very lively group of antagonists to the formalists,

275
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.990
uh,
to the effect that,
uh,

276
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.120
poetry is all about imagery that it's all about,
uh,
uh,

277
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:30.930
that it's all about patterns of thought in the case of the symbolists thought

278
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:35.931
arising from the unconscious and being reinforced by sound by language.

279
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.680
So that language is subsidiary to imagery and thought,
uh,

280
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:43.890
kind of handmaiden of it,
uh,
the vessel.

281
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.320
In other words into which,
uh,

282
00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:50.880
the energies of symbolic thought are poured.
Um,

283
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.210
and it's this basic antagonism,

284
00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:58.150
this difference of opinion that I can bomb,
wants to focus on,
uh,

285
00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.290
and indeed does focus on,
uh,

286
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.860
but at the same time there is a feeling somehow there is a feeling and it's

287
00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:08.311
very,

288
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:12.420
it's very clear in an essay by Jaco Edison called the generation that squandered

289
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:15.330
it's poets.
Uh,
there's a feeling of a kind,

290
00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.260
something like bureaucratization is taking hold.

291
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:20.910
Something like the,

292
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.060
or an atmosphere in which our perceptions of the things around us become

293
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.320
automated.

294
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.450
Schlocky in particular is very much preoccupied with the sense of the

295
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:38.010
automization automat as ization or autonomism.

296
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.460
I much prefer the latter word of perception.

297
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.480
The way in which we no longer really see what's around us.

298
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.260
I quoted the other day while a saying that poetry should make the visible a

299
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:53.380
little hard to see.
By the same token,

300
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:58.610
she Klowski insists and his colleagues insist that the business of the

301
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.680
roughening of surface by means of various modes of literariness is two d

302
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:11.611
familiarize automated perceptions to make us suddenly see again,

303
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.610
see the nature of the language that we're using.
And indeed also to see,

304
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.690
and this is very clear by the way,
uh,

305
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.190
in the essay literature as technique and your anthology that I,

306
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.260
that I recommended that you read,

307
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:31.380
but also at the same time to see the world itself anew by means of devices of

308
00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:38.060
language that tear the film away from our eyes.
Uh,

309
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:43.170
and so the familiarization against the backdrop of a kind of gray uniformity

310
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:50.370
that Yaka person in his essay on the generation that squandered it's poets

311
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:54.220
called bit byt.
I don't know how to pronounce that.

312
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:55.570
I don't know a word of Russian.

313
00:21:55.571 --> 00:22:00.190
And so I actually try to avoid using the rather well known Russian equivalents

314
00:22:00.191 --> 00:22:04.150
for these terms because I feel like an idiot,
you know,
I mean,
I,
yes,
I,
yes,

315
00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:06.700
I see them in the tax just as anybody else does.

316
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.330
But since I don't really know what I mean,
except by means of the translation,

317
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.520
why should I use them?
But in any case,

318
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:17.230
this is a well known term used by [inaudible] in this essay,
which,

319
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:17.770
uh,

320
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.770
is like all such terms that that somehow wander into other languages,

321
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.890
uh,
is difficult to translate.
That's why they wander into other languages,

322
00:22:26.891 --> 00:22:31.891
but it means something like a kind of dulled grayness or ordinariness of life.

323
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.480
And it's against that backdrop.

324
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:42.481
It's that sense of bureaucratized existence that defamiliarization has to a

325
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:48.451
certain extent the ideological purpose of dispelling and undermining.

326
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.610
Uh,
one has to recognize,
in other words,
that this motive,
that the,
that the,

327
00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:57.680
that this motive force stands behind,
uh,

328
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:02.500
the work of the Russian formalists uh,
so that the claim,
uh,

329
00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.710
to be strictly scientific,
uh,
you know,

330
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.860
needs to be hedged a little bit as a return of the aesthetic or return of value,

331
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.120
uh,

332
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.120
understood as the insistence that life doesn't need to be all that dull.

333
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.550
That really is implicit in the Russian formalists viewpoint.

334
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.610
Literariness then what is literariness?

335
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.340
It is those aspects of a text,

336
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.140
the way in which those devices have a text that called themselves to our

337
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:37.450
attention are new.

338
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.370
That is to say the way in which they shake up perception in the fat,

339
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.160
in the fact that we're not used to seeing.
And,
and,

340
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:51.161
and in a way this call for that which is new is worldwide.

341
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:55.790
At the same time you have Ezra pound among the high modernist and the West

342
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.270
saying make it new as his slogan.
Uh,

343
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.980
you have the various uh,

344
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.960
observations of Elliot and Joyous and others that I cited last time and talking

345
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.090
about the background to the new criticism,

346
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.770
all of them insisting on the necessity of difficulty,
of novelty,

347
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:17.630
of coming to terms with the immediacy of one's particular circumstances.

348
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.760
Uh,
getting away from that,

349
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:22.880
which is familiar and ordinary and vague.

350
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:28.310
It is a eight,
eight,
eight is a transnational idea and other words,

351
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.430
which nevertheless has obviously certain specific applications depending on

352
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.850
where it is.

353
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.830
The newness that the Russian formalists are interested in is not just any

354
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:40.640
newness.

355
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.640
It has to do particularly with the palpable or roughened form of that which de

356
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:51.620
familiarizes.

357
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:56.420
Now how do we understand this form form as opposed to what?

358
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.950
This is a crucial issue for the Russian formalists which they handle very

359
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.873
boldly.

360
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:09.130
Part of their platform is that everything is form.

361
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:15.470
There is no distinction,
in other words,
between form and content.

362
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:20.930
That's the fundamental mistake as they see it,
that they're enemies,

363
00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.100
uh,
of various kinds make in their understanding,

364
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.790
in their approach to literature,
but you know,

365
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.510
their own basic distinctions are dualistic,
aren't they?

366
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:35.390
The distinction between poetic and practical language,

367
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.040
the distinction between plot and story that is thanks in between rhythm and

368
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:44.660
meter and all of these cases.
You know,
you're tempted to say,
well Gee,

369
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.980
one of those must be four and the other must be content in particular.

370
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:53.180
Obviously plot and story where we're plot as the constructiveness of the text

371
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.090
and the story is what the text is about.

372
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.990
Doesn't that sound a lot like form and content?
Well,

373
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:04.991
I actually think the Russian farmer list can be defended against the charge that

374
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.770
unbeknownst to themselves,

375
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:11.771
they fall back into forum content distinctions by a siding.

376
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.260
But by,
by insisting on this variety of dualities,
uh,

377
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.370
now I want to spend a little time,
uh,

378
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.880
suggesting developing the way in which that defense could be,

379
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.080
could be undertaken.

380
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.060
[inaudible] can practical language.

381
00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:32.290
You've already been hearing this and I a Richards and in the new critics and

382
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:37.291
they in a way do while the new critics and the in a variety of ways insists that

383
00:26:38.981 --> 00:26:41.530
form has meaning for them is content and so on.

384
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:46.620
There's still not really breaking the distinction between form and content.

385
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.800
And there's an obvious sense in which they understand poetic language to be that

386
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:57.120
in which form is predominate and predominant and practical language to be that

387
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.250
in which content is dominant.

388
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.360
But the Russian formalists see it in a slightly different way.

389
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.490
Content is a function
or,

390
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.330
or let me say,
practical language,
they purpose,

391
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:14.960
in other words of communicating facts of communicating at all,

392
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.080
which we associate with practical language is a function of poetic language.

393
00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:24.890
That is to say it coexists with poetic language.

394
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.830
It is an aspect of a text,

395
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.100
the way in which it does communicate.
In other words,

396
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:36.220
which has to an which has to be understood as existing in a dynamic functional

397
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:41.710
relationship with those aspects of the text in which literariness is dominant.

398
00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.540
It's not a question.

399
00:27:44.541 --> 00:27:49.541
In other words of of poetry or of a novel being some Har on other strictly a

400
00:27:52.281 --> 00:27:56.600
matter of poetic language in poetry or the novel.

401
00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.590
You can argue that the poetic function,

402
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.030
and this is the term Yaka person will ultimately use for it in his essay,

403
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:06.290
linguistics and politics.

404
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.220
You can argue that the poetic function is the dominant,

405
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:15.730
but that's not to say that practical language is absent or that it doesn't have

406
00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.790
its own function.
So,

407
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.460
and this by the way,
uh,
if,

408
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.780
if we begin by talking about poetic and practical language,

409
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:30.990
we're beginning where the Russian formalists began as I could,

410
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.910
as I can buy them explains in 1914,
uh,

411
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:40.010
the first publication of their journal was entirely devoted to poetic sound.

412
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.750
That is just to the way in which,
uh,

413
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.780
sound seems indeed is not just subservient to the elaboration of sense.

414
00:28:51.241 --> 00:28:52.260
One of the things by the way,

415
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:57.261
the foremost that I can bomb does in passing is remind us that we should be on

416
00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:02.310
our guard against thinking that sound is on amount of poetic.
That is,

417
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.200
that,
that,
that it reflects,
uh,
the meaning of what it's talking about.
When,

418
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.620
uh,
when I say,
um,
pigeon,

419
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.270
I don't really seem to have any particular sense of an automotive poetic word,

420
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:19.200
but if I use the Latin Ppo,
all of a sudden I say,
oh,

421
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:23.490
that's onomatopoetic.
Well,
the formalist and also,
so sir,

422
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:27.180
this is one of the most important links between the Pharma list.

423
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:32.190
And so sir are very carefully on their guard against supposing that sound,

424
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.720
that the ways in which we hear language is odd amount of poetic because that

425
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:44.470
would suggest once again in keeping with symbolist ideas that sound was

426
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:48.670
subservient to meaning the importance of the first,

427
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.380
the earliest work or the Russian formalists was the establishment of the idea

428
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:58.500
that sound goes its own way and is not subservient to anything that it is.

429
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.250
It's that it is,
uh,

430
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.420
a device independent of though interacting with other devices,

431
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.361
uh,

432
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:12.361
and that it doesn't exist for the purpose of elucidating anything.

433
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.210
In fact,
it exists amazingly,
uh,

434
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.240
in order to hinder understanding in the kinds of texts that were inclined to

435
00:30:22.331 --> 00:30:25.750
call poetic.
It's repetitive,

436
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.930
it's anti economical.
It's retardant

437
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.280
language of this source is a device.

438
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:38.320
And in relation to other devices,
it's called a function.
We call it a function.

439
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:42.730
That is to say it has a function.
It has a function within a,

440
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:47.020
at our understanding of the way in which a text has structure.

441
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.390
Every aspect of the structure of the text can be understood as having a

442
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:56.290
function.
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plane.

443
00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:01.060
Now this is an example of a text,
uh,

444
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.530
in which,
uh,

445
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.670
alliteration is plainly predominant.

446
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.160
It is a repetitive,
uh,

447
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.390
we understand it to be somehow different from the ordinary way in which a fact

448
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.310
is communicated but are,

449
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:24.100
but if we are not Russian formalists were attempted to say,
well,

450
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:27.310
you know,
it's a Nimo technic device,
uh,

451
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:30.220
introduced for the purpose,
for the purpose.

452
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:35.050
That is to say subservient to the communication of a fact.
By the way,

453
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:37.000
I've never known whether it is a fact,

454
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.150
but a lot of mountains or rainy by Pyrenees,

455
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:45.970
I suppose they're dry.
I really have no idea whether it's a fact,
but,
um,

456
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:50.050
uh,
and it's not important in my fair lady,
whether it's a fact.

457
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:55.230
What's important in my fair lady is to repeat the repetitiousness of verse.

458
00:31:58.631 --> 00:32:03.631
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain in terms of the tautology of the

459
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:10.510
plot.
Eliza Doolittle tries repeatedly to say that,

460
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:16.410
but just like Nido and speedy failing or being unwilling to push Tony out of his

461
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:19.354
problem.

462
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:25.080
So Eliza repeatedly says the Rhine and spine files mine,

463
00:32:25.661 --> 00:32:29.200
Leon,
the pipeline.
And that's not good enough.

464
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:34.380
And so the repetition in the plot reinforces the repetition of the sound in

465
00:32:36.281 --> 00:32:41.281
question and whether or not it's a fact is completely immaterial to Eliza.

466
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.460
It's completely a material to Henry Higgins and it's completely immaterial to

467
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.060
the outcome of my fair lady.
Well,

468
00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:56.150
that's important in my fair lady is the functionality of repetition in the

469
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:05.651
transformation of a principal character into a lady that is,

470
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:11.420
and,
and,
and,
and so in informal as terms,

471
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.280
that's the way we have to understand what if we weren't formalists we would

472
00:33:16.281 --> 00:33:17.870
suppose,
as I say,

473
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:22.130
to be a nema technical device for the purpose of communicating something about

474
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:26.510
the weather in Spain.
All right.
And,
uh,
and,
and,
and I think,

475
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.540
I think it's interesting to think in those terms about the relationship among

476
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.010
devices.
Now
the point is that,

477
00:33:37.011 --> 00:33:38.360
yes,
and this,

478
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.890
and this is what emerged from subsequent thought in the Russian formalists

479
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:43.910
movement.
First,

480
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.260
first wave or phase had to do strictly with sound,

481
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.330
but then they began to say,
well,
what about this notion of device?

482
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:58.331
What about the way in which maybe the best thing to do if we're going to avoid

483
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:04.390
keeping once and again and again and again falling into the trap of making one

484
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:10.271
aspect of the texts subservient to other tax tech aspects merely there for the

485
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:14.240
purpose of of,
of reinforcing content.

486
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.460
If we're going to avoid doing this,

487
00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:19.580
if we're going to see the text as a text that has a structure,

488
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:25.180
hadn't we better say that everything in it is form that everything in it is a

489
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:27.800
device.
How are we going to do that?

490
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.990
Because it would certainly seem that text refer to things.
Well,

491
00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:34.220
yes they do.

492
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.870
So why don't we call that to which they refer for example,

493
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:42.200
in the case of socialist realism or indeed realism of any kind,

494
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:46.100
why don't we call that to which they refer the society function.

495
00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.360
Why don't we say,
Oh yeah.
In a certain kind of text,

496
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.250
the dominant,

497
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:58.210
the dominant device in that text is referentiality is the way in which the real

498
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:04.970
world is hooked onto and that can be understood as a device.

499
00:35:04.971 --> 00:35:07.670
With respect to other devices,

500
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.560
it becomes at certain moments in the evolution of forms or garden into the

501
00:35:12.561 --> 00:35:14.720
Russian formalists the dominant,

502
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:20.080
you see this is the way in which you avoid the forum content distinction.

503
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.460
You say,
oh,
so called content.

504
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:27.461
What other people call content as a device like any other and it engages in the

505
00:35:27.621 --> 00:35:32.621
struggle for dominance with all the other devices that one can identify as

506
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:38.350
aspects of literature take for take the distinction between plot and story.

507
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.620
I mean there you would really think before I'm a lister on sin eyes plot.
Yes,

508
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:46.530
we all agree that's the constructiveness of the story.

509
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:50.340
That's the way the story is put together,
how the overcoat has made and so on.

510
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:54.060
But story,
that's what the plot is about.

511
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.400
And if that's what the plot is about,
how can we avoid calling it content?

512
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:00.420
Well,

513
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.420
it's very interesting in the first place notice that sometimes story can be the

514
00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:09.150
dominant in obviously formal terms.

515
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.420
I think of that story that all of you are probably right in school.

516
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.260
The things they carried by Tim O'brien.
Uh,
it's about,

517
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.630
it's a list of the contents of a,

518
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.130
of the knapsack of a soldier during the Vietnam War.

519
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:28.190
Just a list of the contents and of course all these items and then APSAC are

520
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:30.210
evocative.

521
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:35.570
And what they do is they suggest a plot by the end of the story.

522
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.790
In other words,
there is implied a plot.

523
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
It's just the opposite of the usual relationship between plot and story or a

524
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:48.240
narrowly a plot construct.
Something which is implied.

525
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:53.241
That is to say that which happens that which we can talk about in paraphrase or

526
00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:59.010
as something as,
as a subject matter outside the text.

527
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.950
But here in O'brien story,

528
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:07.100
you're given the subject matter and the subject matter itself becomes the

529
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:12.411
dominant device and it implies in your imagination a way to construct it.

530
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.040
But the way to construct it is not the dominant,

531
00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.830
the way to construct it as something that's up to you.

532
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.850
What's the dominant in the text is just the stuff,

533
00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:29.330
the stuff in his knapsack listed with as little implication as possible.

534
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.800
And so that's an instance of the way in which you can see the relationship

535
00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:39.030
between plot and story as a relationship of devices,

536
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.210
even though it's awfully tempting to say,
oh,
the stories,

537
00:37:42.211 --> 00:37:46.170
just the content and the plots the form.
But no,

538
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.240
the formulas don't want to keep that distinction.
For the reasons that I've been,

539
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.730
that I've been trying to develop.

540
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.510
Any device can be the dominant at a given moment in the development of literary

541
00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:06.360
history.
Any device can be the dominant in Hiawatha.

542
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:10.840
Longfellows Hiawatha meter is the device,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

543
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:16.770
You know how it goes in,
in well in Tennyson sound as the device.

544
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:21.090
Uh,
you know,
the sort of Burma is haunt the,

545
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.580
Oh,
I have no memory at all today.
The,
uh,
the uh,
uh,

546
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:29.760
I'm mixing it up with a line of Cates and I'm going to say something else about

547
00:38:29.761 --> 00:38:30.031
Keith.

548
00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:33.270
So I'll just tell you that seller thought the two most beautiful words in the

549
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:37.170
English language where cellar door,
uh,
and that,
um,

550
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.950
that was his preoccupation in the making of poetry so that we can say that the

551
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:46.810
dominant device in Tennyson's poetry as in much Victoria in poetry,

552
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:49.570
certainly Swinburne's,
uh,
is sound.

553
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.580
And in Keets we can say that the dominant devices imagery,
his,

554
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:59.670
his famous emphasis on synesthesia and the way in which the various senses merge

555
00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.330
in the evocation of images.
Uh,
in other words,
uh,

556
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:08.350
of course the,
um,
the academicians and the symbolist,

557
00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:09.670
we're obsessed with imagery.

558
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.560
That's not to say that a Russian formalists can't deal with imagery in a certain

559
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:16.990
poet.
The image,
the,
the,
the,

560
00:39:16.991 --> 00:39:21.991
the image patterns can certainly be recognized as the dominant device.

561
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.560
That would probably be the case.
For example,
with Keats and Gertrude Stein,

562
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.430
the dominant is repetition,
undoubtedly,
uh,
uh,

563
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.920
the,
and,
and in,
in Wordsworth or Joyce or wolf,
uh,

564
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.860
the dominant is perhaps not formal.
Think of words.
Think of the,

565
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:44.950
the feeling of that Wordsworth blank verse just kind of disappears into pros.

566
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:47.100
I don't think that's quite true.
Uh,

567
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.110
but there's a general feeling that as Matthew Arnold said,

568
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.850
Wordsworth has no style and Wordsworth or Joyce or wolf,

569
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:59.610
the dominant is the interiority of consciousness.
That is the,
the,
the,

570
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.370
the way in which the way in which,
uh,
what,
uh,

571
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:08.370
what we call a stream of consciousness or the inwardness of thought,
uh,

572
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.640
motivates.
This is another word that you encounter.
And I can,

573
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.650
Bob's essay motivates everything that everything else that goes on in the text.

574
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:18.810
In other words,

575
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:23.810
it an enormous variety of aspects of literature understood as literariness can

576
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:29.710
become the dominant.
Now,

577
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.210
as soon as we start talking about things like the dominant,
uh,

578
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:38.500
we are also aware of the evanescence of dominance.

579
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.310
What is a culinary in one generation?

580
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:46.600
And here I'm alluding to a passage quoted by I can bomb what's culinary.

581
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:48.280
And One generation,
for example,

582
00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:53.281
the devices of crime fiction in the work of Dostoyevsky become absolutely

583
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:56.740
central.
He's thinking primarily of grime and punished punishment.

584
00:40:56.741 --> 00:41:00.620
But this is true of other works of dust,
dust,
Asca as well.
Um,

585
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.290
so that the,
the,

586
00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:07.291
the devices of the dime detective novel actually then become the motivating

587
00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:12.580
dominant of the,
of a mainstream literary form,

588
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:17.670
but then they in turn run their course and are replaced by some other dominant,

589
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.610
in other words,
once you start thinking about the evanescence of dominance,

590
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.320
you're also thinking about literary history.
One of the,

591
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:31.210
the most false charge and it was a charge leveled by Trotsky among many others

592
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:35.390
against the Russian formalists is that they ignore history.
The same charge,
uh,

593
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.270
so often leveled against the new critics.

594
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.110
They don't at all ignore history almost from the beginning,

595
00:41:42.111 --> 00:41:44.390
but increasingly during the 20s,
uh,

596
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.540
they turned their attention to the problems of literary historiography and they

597
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:55.610
said some rather bracing things about it.
Uh,
on your,
uh,

598
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:59.900
in your text on page Oh 12,
uh,

599
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.920
the left hand column,
I'll keep referring to those stamped numbers,
uh,

600
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.630
left hand side of your text.
We find a,

601
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:13.631
I can bomb a evoking and exchange of opinion between the ethnographic critic

602
00:42:14.511 --> 00:42:18.350
vessel Lawsky and Victor Slawsky Schlocky.

603
00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:22.610
He said third of the way down had encountered vessel oskies formula,

604
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.710
a formula broadly based on the ethnographic principle that the purpose of new

605
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.490
form is to express new content,
new content.

606
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:36.491
In other words being those social and historical and environmental forces that

607
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.610
oblige literary techniques to change.

608
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.930
That's the ethnographic position.
It is.
That's the word used.

609
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.410
It is obviously also the materialist or social position.

610
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.500
History produces literature and not just literary history but social history

611
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.080
produces literature.

612
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:04.060
Philosophy disagreed and and he decided to advance a completely different point

613
00:43:04.941 --> 00:43:05.774
of view.

614
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:11.170
The work of art arises from a background of other works and through association

615
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:12.620
with them.

616
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.620
The form of a work of art is defined by its relation to other works of art

617
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:21.830
deforms existing prior to it.
Not only parody.

618
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.980
Parody by the way is uh,
a very,

619
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:29.750
very broad term in Russian formulas.
Thought in a way simply meaning change.

620
00:43:29.751 --> 00:43:34.751
That is to say the way in which one text inevitably riffs on another text in

621
00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.020
elaborating its own devices and emphases.
Ah,

622
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.780
and in search of a new kind of dominance,
uh,

623
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.300
not only parody,

624
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:49.390
but also any kind of work of art is created parallel to an opposed to some kind

625
00:43:50.241 --> 00:43:55.220
of form.
The purpose of new form is not to express new content,

626
00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.920
but to change and old form,

627
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.890
which has lost its aesthetic quality.

628
00:44:00.891 --> 00:44:05.891
That is to say lost its power to de Familia eyes lost its power to take the film

629
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:10.550
away from our eyes.
Now this,
um,
it really,

630
00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:13.400
I mean as you think about it,
it's 80 herself.
You know,

631
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.060
that's all very bracing and daring,
but vessel oss,
caves,
right?
We,
we,

632
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:22.910
we know literature is produced by historical forces.
What does it mean?
You know,

633
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:27.140
a new form comes about only to replace an old form,

634
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:31.070
which has ceased to be aesthetically viable.
How does that happen?
You know,

635
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.280
the old phone,
it's,
it's,
you know,
you've got to appeal the social forces.

636
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:36.810
If you're going to talk about change.

637
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:41.760
That really does seem to me to be the spontaneous conclusion we want to draw.

638
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:47.220
That's why I gave you the extraordinary passage on your sheet,

639
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:48.360
uh,

640
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.360
for the end of 10 neon offs on literary evolution written also 1927 written also

641
00:44:56.161 --> 00:45:01.161
and other words in response to Trotsky's literature and revolution.

642
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.790
This is what 10 Yanno says in formalist historiography.

643
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:11.390
The prime significance of major social factors is not at all discarded and other

644
00:45:11.431 --> 00:45:14.400
ones where we're,
where we're not just playing a game here.

645
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:19.460
We to understand the relevance of what we call the society function.

646
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.000
Rather,

647
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
it must be elucidated in its full extent through the problem of the evolution of

648
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:27.960
literature.

649
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.960
This is in contrast to the establishment of the direct influence of major social

650
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:38.961
factors and this is the amazing part of this audience which I think is remarked

651
00:45:39.021 --> 00:45:42.510
truly remarkable,
which the major social effect,

652
00:45:42.511 --> 00:45:44.190
the influence of major social impact,

653
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:49.050
which replaces the study of evolution of literature with the study of the

654
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:51.750
modification of literary works.

655
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.810
That is to say there deformation,

656
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.590
you see the distinction in natural selection,

657
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.520
certain things happen.
There is mutation.

658
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.420
New genes emerge as dominant,

659
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.480
no longer recessive or Leighton and organisms change.

660
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.600
That's evolution.

661
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.150
But organisms change against a backdrop,
you know,

662
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.660
organisms changing like crazy in comes the prehensile thumb.

663
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:25.920
And then next thing you know,

664
00:46:25.921 --> 00:46:30.921
you've got a colossal earthquake and the possessor of the prehensile thumb

665
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.850
disappears from the earth,

666
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.280
which is to say very possibly the human spaces will never develop.

667
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.680
That's the modification

668
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:44.413
<v 3>of a form.</v>

669
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:51.080
<v 0>And it strikes me that that's a remarkable distinction you will get in any</v>

670
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:53.730
period spontaneously.

671
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.680
The sorts of impulses that bring about a socialist realism.

672
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.400
But if you have a UK is from above telling you that if you're going to write,

673
00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:09.330
it has to be socialist realism.
That's a modification.

674
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.240
That is the modification of what,

675
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:17.390
of what would and does evolve in and of itself within an understanding of

676
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.630
literary historiography.
The distinction,

677
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:26.070
it seems to me compelling.
They all,

678
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:31.071
my objection to be made to it perhaps indeed is that much of the time it's just

679
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:34.580
more trouble than it's worth to enforce it.
I mean,
it is,
it,

680
00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.280
it would drive us into such baroque circumlocutions,
uh,

681
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:42.220
and avoidances of the obvious to say,
oh,

682
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:45.000
social factors have nothing to do with this,
uh,

683
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:49.630
that we might as well just sort of not give the distinction up because I think

684
00:47:49.631 --> 00:47:52.660
it's very important always to have it in the back of our minds.

685
00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.650
It's important in Darwinian terms to have it in the back of our minds.

686
00:47:56.651 --> 00:48:00.130
And that's what,
that's what a [inaudible] is insisting on.

687
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.400
That's why he calls his essay on literary evolution,

688
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.560
not literary revolution,
but literary evolution.
Uh,

689
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:12.190
and I think it's terribly important to keep the distinction in the back of our

690
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:16.660
minds,
even if we find it in practical terms well nigh impossible,

691
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:19.180
possibly even in many contexts,

692
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.230
a waste of time to be perpetually and forcing it.
Uh,

693
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:28.260
it is nevertheless a distinction that does exist once you think about it that

694
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:31.300
deserves to exist and deserves to be remembered.

695
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.400
When we think about the variety of ways in which literary history can be

696
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:41.320
written.
Now I'm going to stop their time's up.
Uh,
there's a little more to say,

697
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:42.380
I think,
uh,

698
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.400
and certainly the possible ways in which Russian formalism is subject to

699
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:52.930
critique a knit need quickly to be passed and review.
Uh,

700
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:55.690
we'll do all this next time before we get into,
so,
sir.
