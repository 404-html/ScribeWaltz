WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.940
So anyway,
uh,
to get launched on today's topic.
Uh,

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:06.280
well,

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.280
obviously we confront one of the more formidable figures on our syllabus.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.280
A person who,
uh,
who recently passed away,
uh,

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.310
and who in his last years and into the present has had a kind of second life as

6
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:27.270
a person who in his later work,
uh,

7
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.340
then that all repudiate his earlier thoughts or indeed his earlier style,

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.800
but nevertheless did,
uh,

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.920
begin to apply is central central aspects of his thinking to ethical and

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.050
political issues.
And so he,
uh,
and a number of other writers,

11
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:50.150
like for example,
the Italian philosopher,
Georgie or Gambon,
uh,

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.900
are the figures who we identify with what's called the s called the ethical

13
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:59.450
turn.
In thinking about texts,
literature and other matters,
uh,

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.700
that is very much of the current moment.
And so,

15
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.850
so dairy does reputation and the tendency of people interested in theory to read

16
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:15.321
him is alive and well today about the materials that we're a reading in this,

17
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.080
uh,
in this,
uh,
sequence of lectures for the sequence of lectures,

18
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.990
uh,
date back much earlier.
Uh,

19
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.310
the essay that you read in its entirety for today,

20
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.610
structured sign and play in the language of the human sciences was delivered on

21
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:40.161
the occasion of a conference about the sciences of man,

22
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.520
uh,
at Johns Hopkins University in 1966.

23
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.710
It was an event,
uh,

24
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.890
that was really meant to be a kind of coronation of Claude Levy Strauss whose

25
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.100
work had burst upon the scene only a few years earlier.

26
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.800
A Levy Strauss was there.
He gave a talk.

27
00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:03.801
He was in the audience and dairy does essay was widely taken,

28
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.251
uh,

29
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:10.251
far from being a coronation of a Levy Strauss as a kind of de thronging of Levy

30
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.540
Strauss.
And I have to tell you that why they stylists who is still alive,

31
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.200
a very old man,
um,
uh,
uh,

32
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.410
expresses great bitterness in his old age about what he takes to be the

33
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:26.580
displacement of the importance of his own work,
uh,
by what happened,
uh,

34
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.500
subsequently.
Uh,
and what happened subsequently,
um,
can I think,

35
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.860
be traced to dairy does lecture one of the complications,

36
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:39.450
one of the million complications of thinking about this lecture and about dairy

37
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:44.370
does work in general.
And for that matter about deconstruction is indeed,

38
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.210
uh,

39
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.210
whether or not it really to what extent it really is a significant departure

40
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.950
from the work of structuralism.

41
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
There is a self consciousness in the thinking about structure that we find in

42
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:03.321
many places in Levy Strauss that Derrida freely acknowledges in his essay,

43
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.010
uh,
again and again and again.

44
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:11.011
He quotes Levis Strauss in confirmation of his own arguments only then in a way

45
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:17.440
to turn on him by pointing out that there's something even in what he's saying

46
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.150
there that he hasn't quite thought through.
So it is not anything like,

47
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.750
even as one reads it,
um,
in retrospect,
uh,

48
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.990
a wholesale repudiation or even a really a very devastating critique of Levy

49
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.390
Strauss.
He,

50
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.390
Derrida I think freely acknowledges in this essay the degree to which he is

51
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.780
standing on Levy Strauss's shoulders.
But in any case,

52
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.320
this extraordinary event did,
however,

53
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.600
in the imaginations of people thinking about theory and the West did,

54
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:53.690
however,
uh,

55
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.890
tend to bring about a sense of almost overnight revolution from the

56
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:04.480
preoccupation we had in the mid sixties were structuralism to the subsequent

57
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.560
preoccupation we had,
uh,

58
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.320
throughout the 70s and into the early eighties with deconstruction.
Uh,

59
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.330
and,
uh,
uh,
so,
and Derrida was of course,
a central figure in this.

60
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:20.740
He was here at Yale as a visitor in the spring for many years.
Uh,

61
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:23.380
he influenced a great many,
uh,

62
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.790
people whose work is still current,
uh,

63
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.780
throughout the United States and elsewhere.
Uh,
he,
after that,

64
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.440
[inaudible] had a comparable arrangement with the University of California at

65
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.400
Irvine and his influence there continued,
uh,

66
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.240
a key figure,
um,
whom,
uh,

67
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.650
many of us remember,
uh,
from the,
uh,
period.

68
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.120
His period at Yale,
uh,
as a galvanizing presence.
Uh,

69
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.560
it was the,
the idea that there was a,
what was called by one critic,

70
00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.400
a hermeneutical mafia at Yale,
uh,
uh,

71
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.690
arose largely from the presence of Derrida together with,

72
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.430
with our own Paul Man,
uh,
and more loosely connected with them.

73
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.190
Uh,
Jeffrey Hartman and Harold Bloom,

74
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.040
and also a scholar named Jay Hillis Miller,

75
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.800
who's departure for the University of California.

76
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.890
Irvine a resulted also in dairy,

77
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.891
does decision to go there and be with Miller rather than to continue to stay

78
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:30.130
here.
Uh,
but that was,
that was the Yale School,

79
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:32.290
the so called the El School.
Um,

80
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.360
and it generated a extraordinary influenced to some extent,

81
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.520
but well beyond its influence and atmosphere of hostility,
which,

82
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.330
uh,
had in many ways to do,
I think with what might,

83
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.920
what might still be called the crisis in the humanities as it is widely

84
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.070
understood,
uh,
by,
uh,

85
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.120
state legislators,
by boards of trustees,

86
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.810
um,
as somehow or another something needing to be overcome,

87
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.670
backed away from forgotten in the development of the humanities,

88
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.680
uh,
in academia.
Um,
and the reasons for this,
uh,

89
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.960
we can only imply,
uh,

90
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:18.630
I think probably in the context of a course of this nature,
uh,

91
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.480
but are nevertheless a fascinating and will recur,
uh,

92
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.430
as we think not just about a deconstruction itself,
but,
uh,
about,

93
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:32.450
about the sorts of thinking that it has influenced.

94
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.780
Now you've now read some dairy dot.

95
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:40.160
You've read all of one essay and you've read part of another defect holes and

96
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:44.330
you found it very difficult.
And indeed,
in addition to finding it very difficult,

97
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:47.630
you've probably said,
why does he have to write like that?
In other words,
yeah,

98
00:06:47.631 --> 00:06:49.460
okay.
He's difficult,
but he's,

99
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.630
isn't he making it more difficult than it needs to be?
You say to yourself,

100
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.040
I've never seen pros like this.
You say,
I mean,
this is ridiculous.

101
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:02.880
Why doesn't he just say one thing at a time?
You might also want to say,
uh,

102
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.930
well,
of course it's all deliberate on his part.

103
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.230
And the idea is that deconstruction is as a thought process,

104
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:17.651
precisely a kind of evasive dance whereby one doesn't settle for distinct

105
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:25.001
positions for any sort of idea that can be understood as governed.

106
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:29.750
And this is what structure sign in play is all above that can be understood as

107
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.390
governed by a blanket term.

108
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.470
What Derrida often calls a transcendental signified,

109
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:40.760
we'll have much more to say about this,
but dairy does prose style.

110
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.910
It's kind of crab like sideways movement around an argument is meant,

111
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.270
uh,

112
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.270
as rigorously as it can to avoid a seeming to derive itself from some definite

113
00:07:55.191 --> 00:08:00.191
concept because of course deconstruction is precisely the deconstruction of the

114
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:06.341
grounds whereby we suppose are thinking can be derived from one or another.

115
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.470
Definite concept.

116
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.160
Also this to be kept in mind.

117
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:16.610
And this is of course one of the key distinctions between Derrida and demonn.

118
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.420
We'll have more to say about distinctions between them.
On Tuesday,

119
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.830
I'll also to be captain mind Derrida is not a literary theorist though he

120
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:29.520
sometimes does talk about texts that we call literary very often does.
Uh,

121
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.100
nevertheless,
dairy,

122
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.400
dairy does position and the logic of that position suggest that we can't really

123
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:39.650
reliably discriminate among genres.
In other words,

124
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:44.651
we can't use genre either as a blanket term and therefore he is one of these,

125
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:46.760
one of the people,

126
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:51.080
one of the most influential people in persuading us that there's no such thing

127
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.350
as literature,
legal text,
a theological text,

128
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.290
philosophical text,
scientific taxed.

129
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.250
There is discourse and that,
uh,
to think about,

130
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.310
to think about the field of texts is to think about something which is full of

131
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:12.030
difference.
Who,
needless to say it's the central word and Derrida,

132
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.130
but which is nevertheless not classifiable or categorizable.

133
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.750
And so for that reason,
um,

134
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.920
we can't really say Derrida is specifically a literary theorist.

135
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.060
Now,
I've been talking so far about difficulty and confusion,

136
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.620
but uh,
in view of the fact that we,
you know,

137
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:37.480
we're all in a state of tension about this.
I'm in,

138
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.480
I'm in a state of tension about it too.

139
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.750
Let me remind us that we've already been doing deconstruction and that much of

140
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:50.631
what's problematic in reading dairied I really has already been explained.

141
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.650
I mean,
let's begin with a kind of warmup sheet,
um,
which,

142
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.500
which we can use,
which,
which we can anchor.

143
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.740
And these little drawings I've made now,
no,
I don't think it,

144
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.860
I mean obviously you look at these drawings and you say,
Aha,

145
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.640
that's the vertical axis,
right?
Um,
and of course,

146
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.290
once we get to feminism,

147
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.090
feminism will have certain ideas of its own about the vertical axis.
Uh,

148
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.960
and we will be,
and we will be getting into that when the time comes.

149
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.700
But in the meantime,
you know,

150
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:25.701
the Eiffel Tower is a wonderful way of showing the degree to which the vertical

151
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.380
axis is virtual.

152
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.410
That is to say that if you ever saw a dotted line standing upright,

153
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:37.050
it's the Eiffel Tower.
There's nothing in it.
It's empty,
it's transparent,

154
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.800
you know,
and there's a wonderful Annika and yet somehow or another,

155
00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:44.030
if you're at the top of it,
in the,
in,
in,
in,
in,

156
00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:46.770
in the viewing station at the top of the Eiffel Tower,

157
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.160
suddenly all of Paris is organized at your feet.

158
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.310
That is to say it's a wonderful access of combination that you're looking at.

159
00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:00.090
It is just there with its landmarks,
not,
you know,

160
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.720
instead of having the same kind of status,
is that what you're standing on?

161
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.810
But rather just in a kind of row as the key signs as it were of the skyline of

162
00:11:09.931 --> 00:11:14.200
Paris.
So you get milk Notradame,
arc de Triomphe and so on,
you know,

163
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.810
all sort of lined up in a row.
And there it is,
uh,

164
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.640
Geeta Bopa saw,
uh,
in a famous anecdote,
uh,

165
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.130
who complained rather bitterly about this and he says,
uh,

166
00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.750
according to roll embarked in an essay called the Eiffel Tower.

167
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.930
Moba saw often ate at the restaurant in the tower up here someplace,

168
00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.720
oven ate at the restaurant in the tower,

169
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.600
even though he didn't particularly like the food,

170
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.010
it's the only place he said where I don't have to see it.

171
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.030
In other words,
if as so Sarah says,
once again,

172
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.570
we put both feet squarely on the ground of the Eiffel Tower.

173
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.030
All right?
If we do that,

174
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.360
we're liberated from the idea that somehow or another it's a governing presence.

175
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.470
If we're actually there,

176
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:10.980
we no longer have to worry about the way it organizes everything around it into

177
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.910
a kind of rigorous on folding pattern.
You know,

178
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.550
after all,
you know,
there's a very real sense in which the iPhone,

179
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.180
we infer the Eiffel Tower from its surroundings.
It's built in the 19th century.

180
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:29.110
It's by no means causative of the skyline of Paris.

181
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.090
It's something that comes in belatedly,
just as long comes in,

182
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.480
belatedly with,
with relation to speech.
You know,

183
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.790
the Eiffel Tower is a,

184
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.770
is a virtuality that organizes things as one might say,

185
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:49.120
arbitrarily,
sort of as a reflection on these same ideas.

186
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:52.180
You get the famous poem of Wallace Stevens,

187
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:55.420
I'm sure you'll recognize this as Stevens,
is jar.
Uh,

188
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.790
but I will quickly quote to you the poem.

189
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.200
I placed a jar in Tennessee and round,

190
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:03.790
it was upon a hill.

191
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.830
It made the Slovenly wilderness surround that hill.

192
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.380
The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around.
No longer wild.

193
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.400
As Derrida would say,
the center limits free play,

194
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:24.070
right?
The wilderness rolls up to it and sprawled around.

195
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.540
No longer wild.

196
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.870
The jar was round upon the ground and tall and have a port in air.

197
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.930
It took dominion everywhere.

198
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.780
The Jar was gray and bear.

199
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.950
It did not give of bird or Bush like nothing else in Tennessee.

200
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.010
In other words,

201
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.010
it is arbitrarily placed in the middle of the free play of the natural world,

202
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.820
a free play which is full of which is full of of reproductive exuberance,

203
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.410
full of a kind of joyous excess,
which is part of what dairy does.

204
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:07.411
Talking about when he talks about what's left over the surplusage of the sign,

205
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:10.450
the supplementaries [inaudible] of the sign.

206
00:14:10.451 --> 00:14:13.310
There's an orgasmic element in the in,

207
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:17.950
in what Derrida has in mind so that when he speaks of the seminal adventure of

208
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:21.160
the traits toward the end of,
toward the end of your essay,

209
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:26.080
you want to put some pressure on that word salmon oil.
Well,
in any case,

210
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.230
the jar is just arbitrarily in the middle of that organizing everything without

211
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:36.250
participating in the nature of anything.
It is,

212
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.240
in other words,

213
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.130
a center which is outside the structure of center,

214
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.180
which is not a center.
And we'll come back to that in a minute.
Now,

215
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.020
the Twin Towers,
uh,
and I first started using this example,

216
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.430
decades 2001,

217
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.230
the twin towers have a kind of poignancy in path those today,
uh,

218
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.040
that they would not have had.
Um,
and,
but,

219
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:04.320
but what they suggest is,
uh,
in a,

220
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.360
in a way today,
which,
which,
which overwhelms us with grief.

221
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.630
What they suggest is the ephemerality of the vertical axis.

222
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:18.290
The twin towers had the same function in New York that the Eiffel Tower had in

223
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:23.150
Paris.
Uh,
it was a wonderful place from which to see the city,

224
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.390
a wonderful place from which to feel that everything was organized at its feet.

225
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.560
Uh,
it really there,
there's a,

226
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:33.440
there's a very fine essay about the twin towers again,

227
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:38.360
long before 2001 by Michelle decept toe,
which makes this argument,

228
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.950
uh,
in sustained form.
I recommend it to you,
but in any case,

229
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:44.950
it's another example,
uh,

230
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:50.080
that we can take from our experience of the uneasy sense.

231
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:55.241
We may have that to infer a spatial moment from which the irreducibly temporal

232
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:04.841
nature of experience is derived to infer a moment from the fact of this

233
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:12.311
experience as a necessary cause of it is always problematic and always

234
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.680
necessarily must,
as Derrida would say,

235
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.890
put this sense of a spacial full presence of everything there at once in

236
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:30.290
systematic order as Derrida,
I would say,
must put that under eraser.

237
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.650
In other words,
in a certain sense,
you can't do without it.

238
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.710
Dairy Derrida never really claims that you can do without it.

239
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.110
If you want to get a sense of structure,

240
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.170
you've got to have some sort of inference of this nature.

241
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.430
But at the same time it,

242
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.520
he had had better be in quotes because it is always tenuous if femoral dubious

243
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:57.370
even in even as to its existence and necessarily needs to be understood in that

244
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:04.040
way.
All right,
now other ways in which we've already,
uh,

245
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.390
already been involved in the subject matter,
uh,

246
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.560
for that you,
that you've been reading today.
Uh,
take a look at page nine,

247
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:15.090
21,
uh,

248
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:20.110
a couple of passages in which is straw in which Derrida is quoting a Levy

249
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.350
Strauss on the nature of myth.

250
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.040
And here's where a having quoted you,

251
00:17:28.041 --> 00:17:30.650
these two passages from Levy Strauss.

252
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.740
Here's where I'll return just for a moment to Levy Strauss's analysis of the

253
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:41.051
Oedipus myth and show you how it is that Derrida is both benefiting from what

254
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:45.290
Levy Strauss has said and ultimately able to criticize.

255
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:50.350
Levy Strauss is position bottom of the left hand column nine 21,

256
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.050
an opposition to epistemic discourse.

257
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.250
That is to say the kind of discourse which has,
uh,

258
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.380
some principle or transcendental signified or blanket term as its basis.

259
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:07.410
In other words,
something,
uh,

260
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.710
which in a given moment makes it possible for all knowledge to flow from it in

261
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:18.630
opposition to epistemic discourse,
structural discourse on myths,

262
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:25.190
mythological discourse must itself be Mytho morphic.

263
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:30.530
It must have the form of that of which it speaks and love.

264
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.920
And Derrida then says,

265
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:36.921
this is what Levy Strauss himself says in the following passage taken from one

266
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:42.090
of Levis Strauss,
his most famous books,
the Ra.
And the cook and the cooked.

267
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.830
I just want to quote the end of it.

268
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.860
The middle of the right hand column still on page nine,

269
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:51.861
21 levy Strauss says in wanting to imitate the spontaneous movement of mythical

270
00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:58.440
thought,
my enterprise itself too brief and too long,

271
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.640
has yet to yield to its demands,
has,

272
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.310
has had to yield it to its demands and respect.
It's rhythm.

273
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:10.670
Thus is this book on myths itself and in its own way a myth.

274
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.181
In other words,

275
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:16.680
here's a moment where I live is drives is admitting something about his own
work,

276
00:19:16.681 --> 00:19:21.681
which he is not admitting in his analysis of the Oedipus myth in the essay from

277
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:27.540
structural anthropology that you read.
Uh,
last time.

278
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.650
What love is jobs is saying here is that his approach to myth is itself only

279
00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.100
aversion of the myth.

280
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:43.310
That is to say it participates in the mythic way of thinking about things.

281
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.700
It uses what in the,
uh,

282
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.910
structural anthropology essay he calls MyThemeShop or gross constituent units of

283
00:19:53.701 --> 00:19:54.920
thought.
Uh,

284
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.990
it deploys and manipulates those gross constituent units of thought in the ways

285
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:01.440
that we saw.

286
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.600
But notice what Levy Strauss is saying in that essay as opposed to in the past.

287
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:08.970
It's Derrida has just quoted,
he says,

288
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.100
this form of the meth is scientific.

289
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.560
One of the versions that I have made use of to arrive at this scientific

290
00:20:19.561 --> 00:20:22.080
conclusion is,
for example,

291
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:26.670
Freud's version of the Oedipus meth and other,

292
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:28.500
it's Freud,
Sophocles.

293
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.680
All the other versions I have at my disposal have equal merit as versions,

294
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.820
but none of them is a,

295
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.270
is a transcendental signified none of them as a blanket term.

296
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.390
None of them is the causal explanation or meaning of the myth.

297
00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.240
The meaning of the myth is discoverable only in my science.

298
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.890
Now,
of course,

299
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.950
Freud himself thought he was a scientist and his reading of the myth was also

300
00:20:56.051 --> 00:20:57.610
supposed to be scientific.

301
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.470
What was Freud's reading of the myth about two or one?

302
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.670
It was,
in other words,
about the problem of incest,

303
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.380
the problem of the over determination of blood relations and the under

304
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:13.390
determination of blood relations.

305
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.370
It was a thorough examination of that problematic,
uh,

306
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.750
leading to the conclusion that that's what the myth was about.

307
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.770
In other words,
Levy Strauss,

308
00:21:24.771 --> 00:21:29.320
his conclusions are already anticipated in Freud.
And furthermore,

309
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.850
what is Levy Strauss doing?
He's denying the influence of Freud,

310
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.510
right?
It's my myth,
not his myth,
right?

311
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.740
Which of course is precisely what happens in the prime will hoard.

312
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.280
It is a perfect instance of the Oedipus complex.

313
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.720
Levy Strauss is repudiating the father,
uh,

314
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:53.790
and in repudiating the father showing himself to fall into the very mythic

315
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:57.760
pattern that Freud had been the first to analyze.
Okay.

316
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.910
So when you say there what you're doing is scientific in a context of this sort,

317
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.860
you are making yourself vulnerable.

318
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:11.010
And the moments in this essay in which Derrida is criticizing Levy Strauss are

319
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:16.021
those moments in which Levy Strauss has unguardedly said something on the order

320
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:22.060
of my work is scientific.
So,
but,

321
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:26.170
but there are lots of occasions and he always quotes Levy Strauss to this effect

322
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:31.210
when Levy Strauss is not saying that when Levy Strauss is conceding that his

323
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:31.661
work,

324
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:36.661
that is to say his viewpoint disappears unstably into the thing viewed.

325
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.850
All right.

326
00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.320
Now also take a look at it because we've been doing this to take a look at page

327
00:22:44.321 --> 00:22:49.321
nine 17 the lefthand column where Derrida is talking not about Levy Strauss but

328
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:52.631
about,

329
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:57.631
so sir and here he's talking about the nature of the sign and he's concerned,

330
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.830
very much concerned about this relationship between the concept and the sound

331
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:07.540
image,

332
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.540
which is to say the signified and the signifier that is the basis of the science

333
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.310
of so sir,

334
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.590
that is to say the relationship between the pair in the that's involved in the

335
00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:25.591
pairing of signified and signifier is the basis the cornerstone of the science

336
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.080
of so sir.
So here's what a little more than halfway down the left hand column.

337
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:35.830
Page nine 17 Derrida has to say about that.
He says,

338
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.980
the signification sign has always been comprehended and determined in its sense

339
00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.390
as sign of signifier,

340
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.000
referring to a signified signifier.

341
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.640
Different from its signify.

342
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:57.740
If one erases the radical difference between signifier and signified.

343
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.440
It is the word signifier itself,

344
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.240
which ought to be abandoned as a metaphysical concept,
a metaphysical concept,

345
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:10.070
which is to say that a transcendental signified,
in other words,

346
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:11.360
the idea that a,

347
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.340
that the concept in some sense generates the sa the signifier,

348
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.730
right?
Which is which,
which is the basis of,

349
00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.550
so Sutter's thinking about this,
but,

350
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.640
and here's where I come back to that example that I already gave you,

351
00:24:26.641 --> 00:24:29.960
but with a question mark next to it when I was talking about,
so sure.

352
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.620
Suppose I think of the relationship between quotes signified and quotes,

353
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:40.370
signifier as the relationship between two terms.

354
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.440
Because after all,
you know,

355
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:47.441
one way of signifying the concept tree is to write the word tree and put

356
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:52.490
quotation marks about it.
So if I take away the quotation marks,

357
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.030
all I have is the word with no indication that it's a concept.

358
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.420
Notice that this is now a relationship,

359
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.780
which Jakobsen would call metal lingual.

360
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.510
It what?
What's,

361
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.540
what it suggested is tree is another word for our boar and other,

362
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.080
it's a relationship not between a signified and signifier,

363
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.440
but between a signifier and a signifier.

364
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:23.710
So that the binarism of the relationship is broken down and we begin to

365
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.841
understand the combinatory structure of speech or writing as one signifier

366
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.980
leading to another,
uh,

367
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.980
s I think a signifier dairy dot says,

368
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:39.260
let's banish the word signifier.
But he and I will say,

369
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:40.720
let's banish the word signified.

370
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:45.730
I think a signifier added triggers by association as so sir would say it

371
00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:53.861
triggers by association a subsequent successive signifier which triggers another

372
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.840
which triggers another.

373
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.890
And that's what gives us in the language of deconstruction what we call the

374
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:03.650
chain,
the signifying chain,

375
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.220
not an organizational pattern,

376
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:12.370
but an ever self replicating and self extending pattern.

377
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:20.260
Irreducibly linear and forward progressing through a sequence of temporal

378
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.240
associations.

379
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.490
One of the things that happens when you demystify the relationship between a

380
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:36.491
concept and a signifier or a sound image is that you're also dignify,

381
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:42.160
demystify the relationship between a set of associations with exists somehow

382
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:47.070
and,
and the way in which association actually takes place,

383
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:51.300
which is necessarily in time.
In other words,
you know,

384
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.020
if say if one signifier leads to another,
you know,
like history,

385
00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:59.520
one damn thing after another speech is one damn signifier after another.
If one,

386
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.740
if one thing leads to another,

387
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.340
then that is actually the nature of the,
of,
of the associations that,

388
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:12.190
so Sarah has been talking about it in the first place,
but it doesn't exist in,

389
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.560
in a systemic space.
It exists in an unfolding time.

390
00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.850
All right,
and this,
so,
so this then,
uh,
is,
are,

391
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:26.060
these are some of the implications of no longer being satisfied with the way in

392
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:31.371
which assign can be understood as a concept to which we attach belatedly a

393
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.260
signification,
a signifier.

394
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.750
What we have is we find is,

395
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.660
is a situation in which we find ourselves caught up in a stream of

396
00:27:46.661 --> 00:27:50.320
signification,
all of which is in a certain sense there.

397
00:27:50.321 --> 00:27:55.321
Before we came along and moved as down a stream by the way in which one

398
00:27:58.461 --> 00:28:03.461
signifier succeeds another in ways that later on as we take up concepts like

399
00:28:04.511 --> 00:28:08.470
supplement charity and defend Ross,
uh,
we can think of,
uh,

400
00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.010
a little bit more in a little bit,
a little bit more precisely.

401
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.010
Okay,
so now,
finally,

402
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:22.011
then there's one other way in which dairy does essay from the very outset

403
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:30.510
confirms what we've been saying about the crisis of structuralism being the need

404
00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:37.531
to deny ordinary understandings of genesis or cause in structuralism.

405
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.690
If something emerges,

406
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.740
it emerges from between two things.

407
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:52.770
That is to say it's not this and it's not this or that emerges as that which is

408
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.670
not this,
not this.
It doesn't,

409
00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.570
in other words,

410
00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:03.571
derive from an antecedent single cause as an effect.

411
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.470
It emerges on the other hand as difference within,

412
00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.950
within a field.
Now,

413
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.580
that's what Derrida is talking about with extraordinary,
uh,

414
00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.100
intensity of complication.
In the first paragraph of your essay,

415
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:27.550
page nine 15 left column,
first paragraph,

416
00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:30.580
first word,

417
00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:35.590
first words uttered at the famous conference at Johns Hopkins in 1966.

418
00:29:35.591 --> 00:29:36.011
He says,

419
00:29:36.011 --> 00:29:41.011
perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that

420
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:45.970
could be called an event,

421
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.310
a then mom something which comes which emerges something which is there now and

422
00:29:53.771 --> 00:29:55.210
wasn't there before.

423
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.650
That's the most problematic issue for structuralism when instructure lives and

424
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.940
thinks about how yesterday things were different from the way they are today.

425
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.420
It has to say yes today there was a certain sin,

426
00:30:07.421 --> 00:30:12.421
chronic cross that cross section of data and today there's a slightly difference

427
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:18.661
in chronic cross section of data but structuralism is unable and furthermore,

428
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:24.210
much more importantly unwilling to say anything about how yesterday's data

429
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:29.620
turned into today's data and other,
it's to say anything about change.

430
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.300
It sees successive cross sections and it calls that history I'm anticipating

431
00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:38.650
here and we'll come back to this in other contexts,

432
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.300
but it doesn't say one thing led to another.

433
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.610
It says one thing after another.
In my facetious reference,

434
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.990
uh,
to history as I've already given it to you.
Now,

435
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.230
this is what Derrida is deliberately struggling with in this first paragraph and

436
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:00.850
event,
quote unquote,

437
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.470
if this loaded word did not entail a meaning,

438
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:09.730
which it is precisely the function of structural or structuralist thought to

439
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:11.650
reduce or to suspect,

440
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.070
but let me use the term event,

441
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.620
quote unquote anyway,

442
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.280
employing it with caution and as if in quotation marks in this sense,

443
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.880
this event will have the exterior form of a rupture.

444
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.240
That is to say any emergence among things,
right?

445
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.740
A rupture pool,
you know the volcano,

446
00:31:35.741 --> 00:31:40.090
the volcano parts,
and there you have lava right?

447
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.110
And event,

448
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.920
a rupture and a redoubling,

449
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.790
a redoubling in the sense something has happened as Bob Dylan would say,

450
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.030
something has happened,
but it's not something new.

451
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.360
It is in fact a replication of what was unbeknownst to you because Mr. Jones,

452
00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:04.620
you don't know very much,
uh,
of what was unbeknownst to you.

453
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.380
They're always,
as Derrida says,

454
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:12.470
already something that emerges but is at the same time,

455
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.063
<v 2>okay,</v>

456
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.960
<v 0>press at the same time presses on us.</v>

457
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.920
It's status as having already been there,

458
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.820
always already been there.
All right.

459
00:32:25.821 --> 00:32:28.160
So in all of these sorts of ways,
the critique,

460
00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:33.220
this understanding structuralism as a problematic critique of genesis because

461
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.430
it's still very hard,
uh,
to grasp,

462
00:32:37.431 --> 00:32:41.270
to accept the notion of not having been caused.

463
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:45.020
Why can't we say things were caused just for example,

464
00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:51.020
the notion of the sign as a arbitrary relationship between,

465
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.170
uh,
a substratum of thought,

466
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:59.350
which is then somehow or another hooked on to a derivative series or,

467
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.270
or,
or,
or,
or a system of signifiers.
Uh,
the notion of,

468
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.140
uh,

469
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:11.140
getting outside of myth and being scientific and the notion that we can ascribe

470
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.000
reality to the vertical axis.

471
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:22.400
All of these ways of questioning the integrity,

472
00:33:22.401 --> 00:33:27.401
the security within its skin of structuralism we have actually already

473
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:30.043
undertaken.

474
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:35.060
So I only want to suggest to you with this long preamble that much of the work

475
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.670
that lies before us is actually,
uh,
in the past and,
uh,

476
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:44.710
we have already accomplished now structure sign in play is a critique of

477
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:51.890
structured reality.
It's not just a critique of structuralism,
it's a street.

478
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:52.281
It's a,

479
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:57.281
it's a critique of the idea of anything that has a center,

480
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.790
which is at the same time and enabling causal principle and other words.

481
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:08.420
I look at a structure
and I say it has a center.

482
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:12.230
What do I mean by a center?
I mean a blanket term,
a guiding concept,

483
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.180
a transcendental signified,

484
00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:19.181
something that explains the nature of the structure and something also as dairy

485
00:34:20.311 --> 00:34:24.200
da says,
which allows for free play within the sub structure.

486
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.970
But at the same time,
you know,

487
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:29.390
the structure has this kind of boundary nature.

488
00:34:29.391 --> 00:34:32.600
I mean it may be amoeboid but it still has boundaries,
right?

489
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:37.750
And so at the same time limits the free play within the structure and that's

490
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:43.370
like the new critics saying that a text has structure.

491
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:47.120
It has something that actually in the phenomenological tradition is called an

492
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:49.970
intentional structure.
You know what Kant calls it?

493
00:34:49.971 --> 00:34:54.971
Purposiveness that is to say the way in which the thing is organized according

494
00:34:55.911 --> 00:34:58.730
to some sort of guiding pattern,

495
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.610
but to speak of an intentional structure as a center is not at all the same

496
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:09.611
thing as to speak of an intending person or author or being or idea that brought

497
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:18.020
it into existence because that's extraneous,

498
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.900
that something prior.
That's genesis,
that's a cause.

499
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:26.630
The intending author in other words is outside.

500
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.830
Whereas we can argue that the intentional structure is inside.

501
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:34.540
But that's a problem.
I mean,
how do you get from uh,

502
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:39.720
an intending author to an intentional structure and back a center is both a

503
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:41.700
center and not a center.

504
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.880
As Derrida Madden maddeningly tells us it is both that which organizes a

505
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:53.190
structure and that which isn't really qualified to organize anything because

506
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:54.450
it's not in the structure.

507
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:59.510
It's outside the structure and something that imposes itself from without like a

508
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:02.550
cookie cutter on the structure.
All right.

509
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.210
And so this then is the,
is the,

510
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.360
is an introductory moment,
uh,
in dairy.

511
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:12.660
Does thinking about centers page on page nine,

512
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:16.020
16 in the lower left hand column,

513
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.320
he talks about the history of metaphysics as a history of successive appeals to

514
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.250
a center.
That is to say to a,

515
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:31.360
to some idea from which everything Daraja some genesis or other that can be

516
00:36:33.481 --> 00:36:38.190
understood as responsible for everything that there is.

517
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.160
And the list is very cunningly put together.

518
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.620
This is bottom of the left hand column.
It's not necessarily chronological,
uh,

519
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.670
but at the same time it gives you a sense of successive metaphysical

520
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:53.820
philosophers thinking about first causes,

521
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:59.270
origins about that which determines about whatever it is that determines

522
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:03.990
everything else.
And I'll just take up the,
uh,
the uh,
list,
uh,

523
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:07.260
toward the end.
Transcendentality conscience,

524
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:12.150
consciousness or conscience,
God,
man and so forth.

525
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:17.430
Notice how,
notice that all though the list isn't strictly chronological man.

526
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:21.420
Nevertheless,
nevertheless does succeed.
God.
In other words,

527
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:26.310
he's thinking about the development of Western culture in the Middle Ages and to

528
00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:30.930
some extent in the early modern period.
We live in a theocentric world.

529
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:35.490
Man is a,
understands himself insofar as he understands himself,

530
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:37.320
has man at all,
man,

531
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:40.950
understands himself as a product of divine creativity,

532
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.180
as something derived from God as one entity among all other entities,

533
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.280
uh,
uh,

534
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.420
who participate in and benefit from the divine presence.

535
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:55.080
But then of course the rise of enlightenment is also the rise of

536
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:59.190
anthropocentrism.
And by the time enlightenment is in full cry,

537
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.490
you get everybody from Blake to Mark's to Nisha saying,

538
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:05.970
not that God invented man,
but that man invented God.

539
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.570
Man has become the transcendental signified.

540
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:14.780
Everything derives now in this historical moment from human consciousness and

541
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:20.601
all concepts of whatever kind can be understood in that light.

542
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:25.500
But then of course he says,
having said,
man,
he says,

543
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.600
and so forth.
And I heard something,
something comes after man.

544
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.990
Man is in other words and historical moment,

545
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:37.390
there are lots of people who have pointed out to us that,
um,

546
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:41.330
before a certain period there was no such thing as man and in,
in,

547
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.120
in a variety of quite real senses.

548
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.180
After a certain moment in the history of culture,

549
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.480
there's also no such thing as man.
Uh,

550
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.640
and the argument Derrida is making about his,

551
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.730
about the emergence of his event is that a transcendental signified has actually

552
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.290
substituted itself for man.
In other words,

553
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:07.650
the world is no longer anthropocentric its linguistic.

554
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.210
Obviously the event that Derrida is talking about the emergence,

555
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:15.640
the rupture and event,

556
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:20.641
which makes a difference is the emergence of language.

557
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:25.600
On page nine 17,
the lefthand column,
Oh,
I'm sorry,

558
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:29.800
not uh,
take,
I take it back.
Uh,
what I really want to,

559
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:34.950
what I really want to talk about here is something that is on page nine 16,

560
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.170
the right hand column,
the moment of emergence,
the event.

561
00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:45.760
In other words about halfway down was that in which language invaded the

562
00:39:45.761 --> 00:39:48.160
universal problematic.
In other words,

563
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:53.190
that moment in which language displaced the previous transcendental signified,

564
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:54.550
which was man,

565
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:59.230
that in which in the absence of a center or origin,

566
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.910
everything became discourse provided.
We can agree on this word.

567
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:09.210
That is to say when everything became a system where the central signified the

568
00:40:09.851 --> 00:40:14.851
original or transcendental signified is never absolutely present outside a

569
00:40:15.291 --> 00:40:16.480
system of differences.

570
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.460
He's making a claim for language while racing it.

571
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.600
In other words,
he's,

572
00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:27.070
he's painfully aware that language is just the new God,

573
00:40:27.071 --> 00:40:28.400
the new man.
That and,

574
00:40:28.401 --> 00:40:32.380
and many critiques of deconstruction take the form of saying,
ah,

575
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.610
that that deconstruction simply instrumentalize is language,

576
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:37.780
gives it agency,

577
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:42.490
gives it consciousness as though it were God or man and then pretends that it

578
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:45.730
isn't.
This is a,
this is a common response to deconstruction.

579
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.300
Derrida is aware of it in advance.
He says,
look,

580
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:53.290
I know we're running this risk and saying everything is language or if you will,

581
00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:55.120
here everything is discourse.

582
00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.240
But at the same time we are saying something different because hitherto,

583
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.090
we had this problem of this.
In other words,

584
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:08.770
we had the problem of something being part of a structure that is to say God is

585
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.080
imminent in all things.
You know,

586
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.220
human consciousness pervades everything that it encounters.
In other words,

587
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.280
something which is part of a structured but which is at the same time outside of

588
00:41:20.471 --> 00:41:23.380
it,
God creates the world.

589
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.130
And then sort of as Milton says himself,

590
00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.120
uncircled stride withdraws,
right?
God is not there.

591
00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:34.800
God is the jerk.
Cachet is the hidden God.
Ah,

592
00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.200
who's absent from the world,
uh,

593
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.950
is in effect the structure of the world.

594
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.710
Same thing can be said of men.
You know,

595
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:47.740
man brings the sense of what the world is into being and then stands aside and

596
00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:51.620
somehow sort of takes it in,
uh,
through,
uh,

597
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:56.621
an aesthetic register or in some other remote way language doesn't do that.

598
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.730
Language is perpetually immersed in itself.
There it does.

599
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:05.840
Claiming that language is different in the sense that it makes no sense to talk

600
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:09.380
about it as standing outside of what's going on.

601
00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.560
And this is an essential part of the critique of structuralism language is not

602
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:19.160
other than speech.
It is perpetually manifest in speech,

603
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:20.803
<v 3>right.</v>

604
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.390
<v 0>That it's,
it's,
it's simply a distinction that can't be maintained,</v>

605
00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:27.150
which is why he calls it an event.
In other words,

606
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.080
something of significance has happened Mr. Jones.

607
00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.220
And that is language,
right.
All right.
So,

608
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.793
<v 3>okay.</v>

609
00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:46.200
<v 0>I suppose in the time remaining and last,
there isn't a lot of it.
Uh,</v>

610
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:51.150
we'd better ask what language is.
We've,
we've,
we've,
we've talked about it.

611
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:52.920
Uh,
we've had a great deal to do.

612
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:57.090
Of course we still have the flight Astonia what it is soon.
We'll know.

613
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.460
First of all,
first of all,

614
00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:03.840
I'd better say we'd better say as is already clear from what we've been quoting,

615
00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:08.460
language is not quite so Syrian at is to say it isn't,

616
00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:13.490
it is not a system of signs understood as stable relationships between a concept

617
00:43:15.691 --> 00:43:20.540
world and a world of signifying.
It is not.
In other words,
uh,

618
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.750
it is,
it is,
it is not,
um,

619
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:27.890
a world in which language can be understood as somehow or another a means of

620
00:43:29.881 --> 00:43:34.440
expressing thought.
Deconstruction calls into question,

621
00:43:34.441 --> 00:43:39.441
the distinction between language and thought in calling into question,

622
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:44.780
the distinction between signifier and signified.
So it's not quite so serious,

623
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.380
even though as Derrida says,
uh,

624
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.390
it can't do without a area and vocabulary.

625
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.090
Another problem is,
uh,

626
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.300
and also also related to the critique of,

627
00:43:57.301 --> 00:44:02.130
so serve as that this idea that what's inward,

628
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:07.310
what is essential is something that can be voiced and should be voiced.

629
00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.120
So that if I think a sign is a way of talking about the expression of a thought,

630
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:22.140
notice that I call if I'm so sir,
that expression,
a sound image.

631
00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:23.513
In other words,

632
00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:28.110
language according to Derrida in the social area and tradition seems to

633
00:44:28.111 --> 00:44:28.860
privilege,

634
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.860
sound over script over over what is graphic,

635
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.280
why in other words should and,
and he claims that this is a,

636
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:43.230
a hib hidden bias and the whole history of metaphysics.
Why,
in other words,

637
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:46.590
should we think of language as speech,
as voice?

638
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.790
Why do we think of voice in the sense of the divine logos?

639
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.540
The word right in the beginning was the word.

640
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:59.690
Why do we think of voice as a kind of fully present simultaneity that is

641
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.800
absolutely present precisely in consciousness or wherever it is that we

642
00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:12.360
understand language to derive from what's so special about voice?

643
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.300
Why do they say all these terrible things about writing?

644
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.690
Writing is no different from Voight's.

645
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:23.930
Voice two is articulated combinatorially in time.

646
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:29.510
Voice too can be understood as inscribed on the ear that it's at.

647
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.500
This is,
this is a metaphor,

648
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:36.501
but Derrida frequently ISS as a kind of writing on the ear and the distinction

649
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.260
which Derrida takes to be metaphysical,

650
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:44.190
that so Sarah wants to make between something primary,

651
00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:49.191
something immediate and under riveted voice and something merely a repetitious,

652
00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:55.260
merely reproductive,
merely a handmaiden to voice,

653
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.940
namely writing needs to be called into,
into question.

654
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.940
Now,
this is the point at which we need to say something about,
uh,

655
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:11.060
about a number of key terms that Derrida uses to sustain this sort of criticism

656
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:17.520
of traditional ideas of language.
The first,

657
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.750
the first has to do with this notion of supplementary.

658
00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:28.170
A supplement he points out is something that either complete something that

659
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:33.360
isn't complete or adds to something that already is complete.
I take vitamin C.

660
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:37.500
Well,
I've,
I also drink a lot of orange juice.
So I,
you know,

661
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:41.340
I've got fun of vitamin C,
so if I take a vitamin C pill,

662
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.460
I am supplementing something that's already complete.

663
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:49.380
But if I don't drink any orange juice,
then of course if I take a vitamin C pill,

664
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.200
it's,
I'm supplementing something that's not complete.

665
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:56.970
But we always call it a supplement and there and we and we can't and it's very

666
00:46:56.971 --> 00:47:01.350
difficult even to keep in mind that conceptual difference between these two

667
00:47:01.351 --> 00:47:03.300
sorts of supplements.
Now a,

668
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.860
a sign traditionally understood is self sufficient,

669
00:47:07.861 --> 00:47:08.970
self contained.

670
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.040
So Sarah has made it a scientific object by saying that it's both arbitrary and

671
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.440
differential,
but assign,

672
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.620
understood under the critique of deconstruction is something that is perpetually

673
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:26.820
proliferating,
signification,
something that doesn't stand still,

674
00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:30.130
something that can't be understood as self sufficient,

675
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.140
independent in its,

676
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.440
in its nature as being both arbitrary and differential.

677
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.120
It is a bleeding or spilling into successive signs,

678
00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:40.720
uh,

679
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.340
in such a way that it perpetually leaves what buried our calls traces.

680
00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:49.750
That is to say as we examine the unfolding of a speech act,

681
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:54.490
we see the way in which successive signs are contaminated.

682
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:56.380
That's not meant to be a bad word,

683
00:47:56.950 --> 00:48:01.900
but influenced one might say in the sense of open the window and influenza,

684
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.850
uh,
influenced by those,
uh,

685
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.390
by those signs that preceded.

686
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:12.990
And so supplement Harrity is a way of understanding the simultaneously living

687
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.030
linear and ever proliferating,

688
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.860
ever self complicated nature of verbal expression.

689
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.600
Now defend loss,
uh,

690
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.850
is a way of talking about,

691
00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:32.110
among other things of talking about the difference between voice and writing.

692
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:35.440
There is a difference between voice and writing.

693
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.700
Even though they have so much in common voice and rate or writing by the way are

694
00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:43.840
not a stable binary.
There are no stable binary's and Derrida.
Uh,

695
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:49.020
the difference between voice and writing is that writing can give us all kinds

696
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.650
of indication of difference.

697
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:58.651
That voice can't give us that part of the interest of misspelling the fellows as

698
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:04.090
Derrida insists on doing is that we can't,

699
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.710
as in terms of voice as sound tell the difference between different loss and

700
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.630
[inaudible].
Actually one can slightly,
but it's not a difficult,
uh,

701
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:18.310
different,
uh,
difference worth lingering over different loss.

702
00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.670
In other words,
with it,

703
00:49:20.671 --> 00:49:25.671
substitution of the A and remember the riff in the essay de Faire,

704
00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:30.040
hos on a,
as a pyramid,
as Alpha,
as origin,

705
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.480
as killing the king because the king remember is the transcendental signified

706
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:38.570
God.
Man.
And so forth.
All the riff on the riff on,

707
00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:43.770
on the AE in diva Ross as all of those things is something that we can only pick

708
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:50.350
up if we understand language as writing.
Because in speech,

709
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.560
these modes of difference don't register.

710
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:59.510
The other aunts is simply the so Syrian linguistic system,

711
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:04.990
a system of differences understood as spatial.

712
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.620
That is to say,
understood as available to us,
um,
uh,

713
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:14.020
in as,
as a kind of Smorgasbord,
uh,
as we stand in front of it,

714
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.880
defect Ross introduces the idea of deferral and reminds us that difference.

715
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.790
That is to say our understanding of difference,

716
00:50:24.791 --> 00:50:26.960
our means of negotiating differences,

717
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.960
not something that's actually done in space.
It's done in time.

718
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.200
When I perceive a difference,
I perceive it temporarily.

719
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.700
I do not understand the,
the,

720
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:41.990
the relation among signs as a simultaneity.
I want to,

721
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:46.430
if I want to pin it down scientifically,
but in actual,
in the actual,

722
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.920
as Joyce would say,
stream of consciousness.

723
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:51.710
I understand difference temporarily.

724
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.830
I Diefer difference.

725
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.470
I unfold,

726
00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:03.060
I successively negotiate difference.

727
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.230
And in doing that,
I need the concept of difference.

728
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:14.110
All right.
Time to go.
I the,
uh,
there are a number of,

729
00:51:14.111 --> 00:51:18.260
there are a couple of things that I want to say about the key moves,
uh,

730
00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.760
of Derrida.
Um,
I will,
I will mention those next time.

731
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:28.030
I'll also look over my notes and see what I might say further about these

732
00:51:28.371 --> 00:51:30.110
troublesome terms,
uh,

733
00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:35.090
and their relation to dairy does understanding of language.
Uh,
so that Tuesday,

734
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:36.920
uh,
our introduction,

735
00:51:36.921 --> 00:51:41.570
we'll still have to do with Derrida and then we'll move into thinking about

736
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.060
demand.
